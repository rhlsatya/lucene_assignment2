FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 








Securities Credit Transactions; List of Marginable OTC Stocks; List of Foreign Margin Stocks 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; determination of applicability of regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The List of Marginable OTC Stocks (OTC List) is composed of stocks traded over-the-counter (OTC) in the United States
that have been determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to be subject to the margin requirements
under certain Federal Reserve regulations. The List of Foreign Margin Stocks (Foreign List) is composed of foreign
equity securities that have met the Board's eligibility criteria under Regulation T. The OTC List and the Foreign
List are published four times a year by the Board. This document sets forth additions to and deletions from the previous
OTC List and an addition to the Foreign List.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Listed below are additions to and deletions from the OTC List. This supersedes the last OTC List which was effective
May 9, 1994. Additions and deletions to the OTC List were last published on May 5, 1994 (59 FR 23124). A copy of the complete
OTC List is available from the Federal Reserve Banks. 


The OTC List includes those stocks that meet the criteria in Regulations G, T and U (12 CFR Parts 207, 220 and 221, respectively).
This determination also affects the applicability of Regulation X (12 CFR Part 224). These stocks have the degree
of national investor interest, the depth and breadth of market, and the availability of information respecting the
stock and its issuer to warrant regulation in the same fashion as exchange-traded securities. The OTC List also includes
any OTC stock designated for trading in the national market system (NMS security) under a rule approved by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additional OTC stocks may be designated as NMS securities in the interim between the
Board's quarterly publications. They will become automatically marginable upon the effective date of their NMS
designation. The names of these stocks are available at the SEC and at the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. and will be incorporated into the Board's next quarterly publication of the OTC List. 

Also listed below is an addition to the Board's Foreign List, which was last published on May 5, 1994 (59 FR 23124), and
became effective May 9, 1994. There are no deletions from the Foreign List. The Foreign List includes those foreign
securities that meet the criteria in section 220.17 of Regulation T and are eligible for margin treatment at broker-dealers
on the same basis as domestic margin securities. A copy of the complete Foreign List is available from the Federal Reserve
Banks. 


Public Comment and Deferred Effective Date 


The requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to notice and public participation were not followed in connection with
the issuance of this amendment due to the objective character of the criteria for inclusion and continued inclusion
on the Lists specified in 12 CFR 207.6 (a) and (b), 220.17 (a), (b), (c) and (d), and 221.7 (a) and (b). No additional useful
information would be gained by public participation. The full requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to deferred
effective date have not been followed in connection with the issuance of this amendment because the Board finds that
it is in the public interest to facilitate investment and credit decisions based in whole or in part upon the composition
of these Lists as soon as possible. The Board has responded to a request by the public and allowed approximately a two-week
delay before the Lists are effective.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747-400 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
all Boeing Model 747-400 series airplanes, that requires various inspections and functional 
tests of the thrust reverser control and indication system, and correction of any 
discrepancy found. This amendment is prompted by an investigation to determine the 
controllability of Model 747 series airplanes following an in-flight thrust reverser 
deployment, which has revealed that, in the event of thrust reverser deployment during 
high-speed climb or during cruise, these airplanes could experience control problems. The 
actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure the integrity of the fail safe features of 
the thrust reverser system by preventing possible failure modes in the thrust reverser 
control system that can result in inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to all Boeing Model 747-400 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal 
Register 

on March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10336). That action proposed to require various 
inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication system, and 
correction of any discrepancy found. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 

One commenter supports the proposed rule. 

The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its 
members, requests that the proposed repetitive inspections and tests be withdrawn since 
those actions will be added to the revised Maintenance Planning Document. The ATA 
acknowledges that the proposed repetitive actions may not be incorporated uniformly into 
every operator's maintenance program unless an AD is issued. Therefore, the ATA asks 
that another provision be added to the proposal as follows: Within 3 months after the 
effective date of the AD, revise the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program to 
include a functional test of the thrust reverser control and indication system at an initial 
15-month interval. Inspections for damage to the bullnose seal would be conducted at an 
initial 1,500 flight hour interval. The AD would no longer be applicable for operators that 
have acceptably revised the maintenance program. Operators complying with this 
paragraph could use an alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by 
section 91.417 or 121.380 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 91.417 or 
121.380). The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector 
(PMI) for operators electing this alternative. 
The ATA believes that its suggestion should be adopted because the proposed 
repetitive actions will likely continue for as long as Model 747-400 series airplanes are 
operated. The ATA acknowledges that, while numerous AD's that require repetitive 
inspections continue for the life of the aircraft, it has either been shown that a satisfactory 
terminating action has not been developed or that service experience has shown that 
control of the inspections cannot be administered safely through an operator's maintenance 
program. The ATA states that its proposal is intended to minimize the impact of the AD 
process on an operator's maintenance program and cites other AD's that contain 
provisions similar to its proposal. 
The FAA recognizes the ATA's concerns regarding the requirement for repetitive 
inspections and tests of the thrust reverser control and indication systems. However, the 
FAA finds that this requirement is necessary in order to provide an adequate level of safety 
by addressing the specified unsafe condition. Further, the FAA determined the required 
repetitive intervals based on the service history of similar components and on an analysis 
of the system design to predict the reliability of the system during the service life of the 
aircraft. Lengthening these intervals would only be appropriate when a sufficient sample 
of systems is allowed to operate through an entire system overhaul cycle; adjustments 
made prior to that time may not account for the effects of age and wear. 
The FAA finds that addressing inspections and tests of the thrust reverser control 
and indication systems in a document that is not FAA-approved, such as a Maintenance 
Planning Document, will not ensure an acceptable level of safety with regard to the thrust 
reverser system. The ATA's suggested provision for accomplishment of the inspections 
and tests would permit each operator to determine whether and how often these actions 
should be conducted. In light of the severity of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA 
has determined that allowing this degree of operator discretion is not appropriate at this 
time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to ensure that operators accomplish the repetitive 
actions in a common manner and at common intervals. 
One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time for the initial 
inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication systems be 
extended from 6 to 12 months. This commenter offers no justification for the request. A 
second commenter indicates a false impression that a 12-month compliance time was 
proposed for these inspections and functional tests, and requests that the compliance time 
be expressed in terms of maintenance checks (specifically, ``C'' checks) or 15 months to 
coincide with regularly scheduled maintenance. (The FAA notes that no 12-month 
compliance time is specified for any requirement contained in the proposal.) Another 
commenter requests that the compliance times be specified in terms of maintenance check 
intervals (``A'' checks, ``C'' checks, etc.). The commenter provides no justification for this 
request.

The FAA concurs partially. Since only two comments were received in response 
to the proposed 6-month compliance time, the FAA assumes that most operators are able 
to accommodate that proposed compliance time. In light of safety considerations, the 
FAA finds that a short initial compliance time for the inspections and functional tests is 
warranted. However, upon reconsideration, the FAA considers that extending the 
proposed compliance time by 3 additional months will not adversely affect safety, and will 
allow the required actions to be performed at a base during regularly scheduled 
maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available, 
if necessary. Paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), and (c) of the final rule have been revised to 
specify a compliance time of 9 months for the initial inspections and functional tests of the 
thrust reverser control and indication systems. 
The FAA does not agree that the compliance times specified in the final rule should 
be expressed in terms of maintenance check intervals. Since maintenance schedules vary 
from operator to operator, there would be no assurance that the actions will be 
accomplished during those maximum intervals. The FAA has determined that the 
compliance times, as specified in the final rule, represent the maximum intervals of time 
allowable for the affected airplanes to continue to operate prior to accomplishing the 
required actions without compromising safety. 
Several commenters request that the proposed compliance time for repetitive 
inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication systems 
[specified in paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), and (c) of the proposal] be extended from the 
proposed 15-month intervals to accommodate current or future scheduled ``C'' check 
maintenance intervals. Two commenters propose extension of the compliance time to 18-month intervals. One commenter
indicates that Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
747-78A2115, Revision 1, dated March 10, 1994, recommends inspection intervals of 15 
months or 5,000 flight hours. 
The FAA concurs partially. As discussed previously, the FAA does not agree that 
these compliance times should be expressed in terms of maintenance check intervals. 
However, the FAA does concur with the commenters' requests to extend the proposed 
compliance time to 18 months. Extending the compliance time by 3 additional months will 
not adversely affect safety, and will allow the inspections and tests to be performed at a 
base during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained 
maintenance personnel will be available, if necessary. Paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), and (c) of 
the final rule have been revised to specify a compliance time of 18 months for repetitive 
inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication systems. 
Several commenters request that paragraph (d) of the proposed rule be revised to 
allow dispatch with a thrust reverser inoperative in accordance with the FAA-approved 
Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) if any discrepancy is found during the required 
inspections and tests. Several commenters point out that allowing dispatch with a thrust 
reverser inoperative will provide operators time to obtain parts and perform any necessary 
corrective action. One commenter explains that, without this change, the dispatch 
capability of the airplane would be downgraded for problems such as proximity sensor 
adjustments or auto restow chafing, which are not related to the integrity of the stow lock 
feature. One commenter requests 14-day dispatch relief. 
The FAA concurs partially. The FAA agrees that an option for dispatch relief may 
be allowed in accordance with an operator's FAA-approved Minimum Equipment List 
(MEL). However, the FAA does not concur with the commenter's request for 14-day 
dispatch relief, since the MMEL specifies 10-day dispatch relief. The FAA has revised 
paragraph (d) of the final rule to provide an alternative for an airplane to be operated in 
accordance with existing provisions and limitations specified in the MEL, provided that no 
more than one thrust reverser on the airplane is inoperative. 

Three commenters request that the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service for repetitive inspections
of the bullnose seal and tests of the lock mechanism and 
of the position switch module and cone brake be extended to coincide with operators' 
scheduled maintenance intervals and to reduce the economic impact of the proposed 
actions. One commenter suggests a repetitive interval of 1,300 hours time-in-service. The 
second commenter proposes that the interval be extended to 1,500 hours time-in-service. 
The third commenter recommends that these actions be required every 15 months or 
during ``C'' checks. 
The FAA does not concur. The FAA based the repetitive inspection interval on 
data obtained from a reliability analysis submitted by Boeing prior to the issuance of the 
proposed rule. The FAA based the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service on 
that analysis and on the fact that affected operators conduct ``A'' checks at intervals of 
approximately 450 hours time-in-service. The FAA's intent was that the proposed 
inspections and tests be conducted during every other regularly scheduled ``A'' check, 
when the airplanes would be located at a base where special equipment and trained 
personnel would be readily available, if necessary. Further, the FAA has received no 
supporting technical analysis to supplement or refute the manufacturer's original reliability 
analysis. The FAA has determined that the compliance time, as proposed, represents the 
maximum interval of time allowable for the affected airplanes to accomplish the required 
repetitive actions without compromising safety.

One commenter requests that a statement be added to the proposed rule to indicate that the AD is considered to be interim
action. The FAA acknowledges that this AD is interim action, as specified in the preamble to the proposed rule. The
manufacturer has advised that it currently is developing a modification that will positively address the unsafe
condition addressed by this AD, and that the modification should be available within approximately 24 months. Once
this modification is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking. 
One commenter requests that the proposal be revised to require that operators report results from all inspections
and tests, rather than only initial inspections and tests, and that these results be used to justify adjustments of
inspection intervals or cancellation of inspections. The commenter offers no justification for this request. The
FAA does not 
concur. The FAA is interested in the initial inspection results for the purpose of determining the present state of
thrust reverser systems throughout the fleet. Since the actions required by this AD are considered to be interim action
and terminating action is imminent, the FAA finds that gathering information for the purpose of adjusting inspection
intervals and cancelling inspections is not needed and would pose an unnecessary burden on operators. 
One commenter requests that the FAA review the probability calculations made by Boeing in determining that an unsafe
condition exists. The commenter states that if the probability of inadvertent thrust reverser deployment is lower
than 1 in 10

9

 flight hours, an AD would not be required. The commenter points out two factors that would reduce controllability:
deployment of an outboard thrust reverser, and deployment of that reverser during climb. Neither of these factors
was accounted for in the probability study that Boeing presented to the operators. In addition, for Model 747-400
series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6-80C2 engines, deployment of a single thrust reverser
sleeve half is possible, and deployment of a single sleeve half was assumed to have the same effect on airplane controllability
as full (both halves) deployment of a thrust reverser. 
The FAA does not concur. The analysis presented by Boeing to the FAA states clearly that the effect of deployment of
an inboard thrust reverser, or the effect of deployment of a single outboard thrust reverser sleeve, had not yet been
quantified. At that time, Boeing and the FAA recognized the need for further study. However, in light of the experience
gained during investigation of the accident discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, Boeing had identified
design deficiencies that needed to be addressed as soon as practicable to ensure the safety of the Model 747 fleet.
The FAA did not determine that an AD was warranted solely on the basis that a particular probability threshold of 1 in
10

9

 flight hours had been exceeded. Rather, the FAA based its determination on the fact that design deficiencies exist
that could lead to an unsafe condition (reduction in or loss of controllability of the airplane), which can be compensated
for by periodic inspections and tests until a design change becomes available. 
Since the issuance of the proposal, Boeing has issued Revision 1 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletins 747-78A2112,
dated March 7, 1994; 747-78A2113, dated March 10, 1994; and 747-78A2115, dated March 4, 1994. (The original
issues of these service bulletins were cited in the proposal as the appropriate sources of service information.)
These alert service bulletin revisions reclassify the service bulletin type from standard to alert, recommend certain
revised compliance times to coincide with operators' maintenance schedules, and revise certain test procedures.
The FAA has reviewed and approved these alert service bulletins and has revised the final rule to reflect these latest
revisions as additional sources of service information. In addition, the FAA has revised the final rule to specify
the appropriate paragraphs of the Accomplishment Instructions of these alert service bulletins for performing
the actions required by this AD. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified for these airplanes, at which time the FAA
may consider further rulemaking. 
There are approximately 286 Model 747-400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 39 Model 747-400 series airplanes powered by Pratt & Whitney PW4000 series engines of
U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 48 work hours per airplane to accomplish
the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD on U.S. operators of Model 747-400 series airplanes powered by Pratt & Whitney PW4000 series engines
is estimated to be $102,960, or $2,640 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.

Currently, there are no Model 747-400 series airplanes powered by General Electric CF6-80C2 series engines
on the U.S. Register. However, should one of these airplanes be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future,
it will require approximately 60 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per
work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD is estimated to be $3,300 per airplane. 
Additionally, there are no Model 747-400 series airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211-524G/H series
engines on the U.S. Register at this time. However, should one of these airplanes be imported and placed on the U.S.
Register in the future, it will require approximately 30 hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor
charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD is estimated to be $1,650 per airplane.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series
airplanes, that currently requires inspecting to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints, and repair, if
necessary; reporting any findings of discrepancies; replacing certain countersunk fasteners with protruding
head fasteners; and verifying that the airplanes do not have certain countersunk fasteners. This amendment requires
inspection of an expanded area, deletion of the reporting requirement, and expansion of the applicability to include
additional airplanes. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracking of the fuselage skin in certain areas and
findings of additional countersunk fasteners. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent reduced structural
integrity of the fuselage.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 90-01-07,
amendment 39-6440 (55 FR 255, January 4, 1990), which is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 3, 1994 (59 FR 5139). The action proposed to require inspection of an expanded area, deletion of the reporting
requirement, and expansion of the applicability. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
Two commenters request that proposed paragraph (e) be revised to reduce the area of inspection to coincide with the
area specified in the service bulletin (Boeing Service Bulletin 747-53A2312, Revision 2, dated October 8,
1992) referenced in the proposal as the appropriate source of service information. The FAA does not concur. An FAA
investigation has revealed that countersunk fasteners may be installed in areas other than those specified in the
referenced service bulletin. Therefore, the FAA has determined that a one-time inspection along the entire lap joint
of the skin panel must be accomplished to positively confirm the exact location of these countersunk fasteners. 
One commenter requests an extension to the proposed compliance time of 11,000 total landings to conduct the high frequency
eddy current (HFEC) inspection required by paragraph (g) of the proposal. The commenter states that the compliance
time should coincide with the time recommended in the service bulletin (Boeing Service Bulletin 747-53A2312,
Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992) referenced in the proposal as the appropriate source of service information. The
compliance time in the service bulletin specifies that, for airplanes on which only the minimum number of countersunk
fasteners have been installed, the HFEC inspection should commence at 20,000 total flight cycles. The commenter
notes that for airplanes on which only the minimum number of countersunk fasteners have been installed, the potential
for widespread multi-site damage is significantly lessened than for airplanes on which more than the minimum number
of countersunk fasteners have been installed. 
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to extend the compliance time. In developing an appropriate compliance
time for this action, the FAA considered the safety implications of any cracking in this area. The FAA acknowledges
that cracking in the upper row of countersunk fasteners in the lap splice in the area adjacent to the wing-to-body fairing
intersection may not result in catastrophic consequences; however, the FAA finds that any cracking in this area has
the potential for developing into an unsafe condition. This AD is issued to address that unsafe condition, which may
result in reduced structural integrity of the fuselage of the airplane as a result of cracking in these areas. Further,
since cracking has been found in this area on in-service airplanes that had accumulated less than 20,000 total flight
cycles, the FAA has determined that 11,000 total landings represent the maximum interval of time allowable wherein
the inspection can reasonably be accomplished and an acceptable level of safety can be maintained. 
One commenter requests clarification of the proposed compliance time for reinspection of previously modified lap
joints. The commenter requests that the HFEC inspections required by proposed paragraph (k) commence from the time
the lap joint was modified in accordance with AD 90-01-07, rather than from the time the lap joint is modified
in accordance with proposed paragraph (j). The FAA finds that clarification is warranted. Paragraph (k) of the final
rule has been revised to state that HFEC inspections are to be performed prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total landings
following modifications (of locations where countersunk fasteners were found) accomplished in accordance with
Boeing Service Bulletin 747-53A2312, dated June 12, 1989, Revision 1, dated March 29, 1990, or Revision 2, dated
October 8, 1992, which includes modifications accomplished in accordance with AD 90-01-07 or in accordance
with paragraph (j) of this AD. 
Two commenters question the necessity for the inspections following modification of the lap joints required by proposed
paragraph (k). One of these commenters does not see adequate justification for requiring these inspections since
AD 90-01-07 terminated the inspections after accomplishment of the modification. The other commenter
states that, since other lap joints are not required to be inspected following modification, this lap joint should
not be inspected following modification. From these comments, the FAA infers that these commenters are requesting
that the requirement to inspect following modification be deleted. The FAA does not concur. An FAA evaluation of currently
available inspection techniques reveals that current technology may not be able to adequately detect cracking beneath
protruding head fasteners. Further, in-service experience has demonstrated that cracking has gone undetected
beneath these protruding head fasteners. Therefore, the FAA's intent in requiring these inspections following
the modification are to detect any cracking that may develop after accomplishment of the modification and to repair
any cracking prior to it adversely affecting the structural integrity of the fuselage of the airplane. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.

There are approximately 723 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 183 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD.
The inspections that were previously required by AD 90-01-07, and retained in this AD, take approximately
14 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of these inspection requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,910, or $770 per airplane,
per inspection cycle.
The additional new inspections that are required by this AD will take approximately 82 work hours per airplane to accomplish,
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspection requirements
of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $825,330, or $4,510 per airplane, per inspection cycle.
The modification required by this AD will take approximately 124 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average
labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the modification requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,248,060, or $6,820 per airplane.
Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspection and modification requirements of this AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $2,214,300, or $11,407 per airplane.
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
The FAA recognizes that the modification will require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However, the 20,000-landings
compliance time specified in paragraph (j) of this AD should allow ample time for the modification of all countersunk
fasteners locations to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance
activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22 Helicopters 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Robinson Helicopter Company Model
R22 helicopters. This action requires an initial inspection and repetitive checks and visual inspections for corrosion
and cracks on certain main rotor blades. This amendment is prompted by reports of chordwise cracks found in the main
rotor blades. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent abnormal in-flight vibrations, failure of
the main rotor blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive that is applicable to Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22
helicopters equipped with main rotor blades, part number (P/N) A016-2, with serial numbers (S/N) up to and including
7569 (all suffixes), that have over 500 hours time-in-service (TIS) or more than 1 year TIS. The manufacturer reports
finding two main rotor blades with cracks caused by corrosion on the main rotor blade skins. The cracks started at the
trailing edge on both the upper and lower surfaces and extended several inches in the chordwise direction. The FAA
has determined that corrosion or cracks in the main rotor blade skins create an unsafe condition. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in abnormal in-flight vibrations, failure of the main rotor blade, and subsequent
loss of control of the helicopter. 



The FAA has reviewed Robinson Helicopter Company Service Bulletin (SB) #72, dated March 29, 1993, that describes
procedures for a visual pilot check for corrosion or cracks in the skin of the main rotor blade, after the onset of any
unusual vibrations, or within 25 hours TIS; and, thereafter at intervals of 4 months TIS. After reviewing the available
data, the FAA has determined that repetitive visual inspections should be performed by a mechanic at intervals of
100 hours TIS, and the repetitive visual owner/operator (pilot) checks should be performed at intervals of 25 hours
TIS. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Robinson Helicopter Company
Model R22 helicopters of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent abnormal in-flight vibrations, failure
of the main rotor blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. This AD requires an initial visual inspection
by a certificated mechanic, (1) for main rotor blades that have less than 500 hours TIS and have been installed for less
than 1 year, upon or prior to the accumulation of 525 hours TIS or upon or prior to the main rotor blades having been installed
for 1 year, whichever is earlier, or (2) for main rotor blades with 500 or more hours TIS or that have been installed for
1 year or more within the next 25 hours TIS. The inspection threshold is 1 year and 500 hours TIS. Thereafter, inspections
for corrosion and cracks are required at intervals of not more than 100 hours TIS, or before further flight after the
onset of abnormal vibrations. This AD also requires repetitive checks for corrosion and cracks in the main rotor blade
at intervals not to exceed 25 hours TIS. These checks may be performed by an owner/operator holding at least a private
pilot certificate but must be documented in the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with
sections 43.11 and 91.417(a)(2)(v) of the Federal Aviation Regulations. These checks do not require the use of tools,
precision measuring equipment, training, pilot logbook endorsements, or the use of technical data not contained
in the AD. These 25 hours TIS checks are additional measures to ensure that a crack that is visible without the aid of
a magnifying glass has not developed during the time between maintenance inspections. However, this AD does not require
visual checks at intervals of 4 months as specified by the SB, dated March 29, 1993. Due to the criticality of the main
rotor blades and the short compliance times, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in
aircraft. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93-SW-16-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Establishment of the Billings Logan International Airport Class C Airspace Area, MT, and Revocation of the Billings
Class D Airspace Area, MT

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes a Class C airspace area and revokes the Class D airspace area at the Billings Logan International
Airport, Billings, MT. The Billings Logan International Airport is a public-use facility at which a Terminal Radar
Service Area (TRSA) is currently in effect. The establishment of this Class C airspace area will require pilots to
establish two-way radio communications with the air traffic control (ATC) facility providing air traffic services
prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within the Class C airspace area.
Implementation of the Billings Logan International Airport Class C 
airspace area will promote the efficient control of air traffic and reduce the risk of midair collision in the terminal
area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
History 



On April 22, 1982, the National Airspace Review (NAR) plan was published in the 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 17448). The plan encompassed a review of airspace use and procedural aspects of the ATC system. Among the main
objectives of the NAR was the improvement of the ATC system by increasing efficiency and reducing complexity. In its
review of terminal airspace, NAR Task Group 1-2 concluded that TRSA's should be replaced. Four types of airspace
configurations were considered as replacement candidates, and Model B, the Airport Radar Service Area (ARSA) configuration,
was recommended by a consensus of the task group. 

The FAA published NAR Recommendation 1-2.2.1, ``Replace Terminal Radar Service Areas with Model B Airspace
and Service'' in Notice 83-9 (48 FR 34286; July 28, 1983) proposing the establishment of ARSA's at the Robert
Mueller Municipal Airport, Austin, TX, and the Port of Columbus International Airport, Columbus, OH. ARSA's were
designated at these airports on a temporary basis by Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 45 (48 FR 50038; October
28, 1983) to provide an operational confirmation of the ARSA concept for potential application on a national basis.


Following a confirmation period of more than a year, the FAA adopted the NAR recommendation and, on February 27, 1985,
issued a final rule (50 FR 9252; March 6, 1985) defining ARSA airspace and establishing air traffic rules for operation
within such an area. 

Concurrently, by separate rulemaking action, ARSA's were permanently established at the Austin, TX, Columbus,
OH, and the Baltimore/Washington International Airports (50 FR 9250; March 6, 1985). The FAA stated that future notices
would propose ARSA's for other airports at which TRSA procedures were in effect. 

A number of problems with the TRSA program were identified by the NAR Task Group. The task group stated that because
of the different levels of service offered in terminal areas, users are not always sure of what restrictions or privileges
exist or how to cope with them. According to the NAR Task Group, there is a shared feeling among users that TRSA's are
often poorly defined, are generally dissimilar in dimensions, and encompass more area than is necessary or desirable.
There are other users who believe that the voluntary nature of the TRSA does not adequately address the problems associated
with nonparticipating aircraft operating in relative proximity to the airport and associated approach and departure
courses. The consensus among the user organizations is that within a given standard airspace designation, a terminal
radar facility should provide all pilots the same level of service and in the same manner, to the extent feasible. 

Additionally, the NAR Task Group recommended that the FAA develop quantitative criteria for establishing ARSA's
at locations other than those which were included in the TRSA replacement program. The task group recommended that
these criteria include, among other things, traffic mix, flow and density, airport configuration, geographical
features, collision risk assessment, and ATC capabilities to provide service to users. These criteria have been
developed and are being published via the FAA directives system (Order 7400.2D). 

Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport
radar service area'' and replaced it with the designation ``Class C airspace area.'' This change in terminology is
reflected in this rule. 

The FAA has established Class C airspace areas at 121 locations under a paced implementation plan to replace TRSA's
with Class C airspace areas. 

This rule establishes a Class C airspace area at a location which was identified as a candidate for an ARSA (a Class C
airspace area) in the preamble to Amendment No. 71-10 (50 FR 9252). 

The Billings Logan International Airport is a public-use airport with an operating control tower served by a Level
II TRACON, at which a TRSA is in effect. A TRSA consists of the airspace surrounding a designated airport where ATC provides
radar vectoring, sequencing, and separation for all aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) and
for participating aircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR). TRSA airspace and operating rules are not
established by regulation, and participation by pilots operating in the TRSA under VFR is voluntary, although pilots
are urged to participate. This level of service is known as Stage III and is provided at all locations identified as
TRSA's. 


The Billings Logan International Airport is a major terminal hub that primarily serves the States of Montana, Wyoming,
and the Dakotas. Airport operations at Billings Logan International Airport consist primarily of large air carriers
(turbine-powered), air freighters, corporate jets, air taxis (multi-engine turboprop and piston-engine aircraft),
and general aviation (GA) itinerant and training (multi-engine and single-engine) aircraft. An extensive lifeguard
(helicopter and fixed-wing) operation is based at Billings Logan International Airport. The availability of instrument
approach aids at Billings Logan International Airport attracts military (United States Air Force units) and civil
(Rocky Mountain College aviation curriculum) entities alike. 

The terminal air traffic environment is basically unencumbered by terrain and special use airspace restrictions.
Aircraft operating under VFR that transit the Billings terminal area normally do so on random, flight-specific routes.
There are no major ``established'' VFR routes to be considered.

On June 21, 1988, the FAA published a final rule, ``Transponder with Automatic Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement
(Mode C)'' (Amendment No. 91-203; 53 FR 23356), which, among other amendments, revised Section 91.24 of the
Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 91). In pertinent part, that rule added Section 91.24(b)(5)(ii), effective
December 30, 1990, which required aircraft operating in the airspace from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL within a 10-mile
radius of any airport listed in newly designated Appendix D of part 91 to be equipped with an operable transponder with
Mode C except when operating in the airspace below 1,200 feet above ground level outside of the airport traffic area.
Logan International Airport, Billings, MT, and Hector International Airport, Fargo, ND, were the only airports
listed. Aircraft which were not originally certificated with an engine-driven electrical system or which had not
subsequently been certified with such a system installed, balloons, and gliders were excluded from this requirement.
The preamble to this rule indicated that an airport would be considered as a candidate for this Mode C requirement if
its annual enplaned passenger count exceeded 200,000. The preamble further stated that several airports exceeded
the 200,000 annual enplaned passenger requirement, which had not been designated as, or planned for, a Class C airspace
area (formerly ARSA) (including Billings, MT). The FAA examined the operations at this location and determined that
the Mode C requirement should be established at Billings, MT, because this airport had experienced a significantly
high number of passenger enplanements, and typically generated over 50,000 instrument operations per year. 

On December 17, 1993, the FAA proposed to designate a Class C airspace area at the Billings Logan International Airport,
MT (58 FR 65950). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting comments
on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. 



The Rule 



These amendments to parts 71 and 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR parts 71 and 91) establish a Class C airspace
area at the Billings Logan International Airport and revoke the Class D airspace area at Billings, MT. This action
will remove Billings Logan International Airport as the only remaining airport under Appendix D, Section 2 of part
91, ``airports at which the requirements of section 91.215(b)(5)(ii) apply.'' This action will not remove Appendix
D, Section 2 of part 91. Billings Logan International Airport is a public airport with an operating control tower served
by a Level II TRACON, at which a TRSA is in effect. The establishment of this Class C airspace area will require pilots
to establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering
the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within the Class C airspace area. Implementation
of the Class C airspace area will promote the efficient control of air traffic and reduce the risk of midair collision
in the terminal area. The Class D airspace area is being revoked because Class C airspace is more restrictive (i.e.,
carries higher operational requirements) than Class D airspace. Therefore, the FAA is revoking the Billings, MT,
Class D airspace area. 

This action supports a goal of airspace reclassification_to simplify the airspace by eliminating overlapping airspace
designations. The coordinates in this document are based on North American Datum 83. Except for editorial changes
and the revocation of the Class D airspace area in Billings, MT, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice.
Class C and Class D airspace designations are published in paragraphs 4000 and 5000, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A
dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298;
July 6, 1993). The Class C airspace area listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order and the
Class D airspace area listed in this document will be removed subsequently from the Order. 



Regulatory Evaluation Summary 



Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that the final rule will generate benefits that justify its costs and is not ``a significant regulatory
action'' as defined in the Executive Order and the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures.
The final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not constitute
a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below. 



Costs 



The FAA has determined that the establishment of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area at Logan International Airport
will impose a one-time FAA administrative cost of $550 (1993 dollars). For the aviation community (aircraft operators
and fixed-based operators), the final rule will impose only negligible costs. The potential costs of the Class C airspace
area are discussed below. 

For the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area, the FAA does not expect to incur any additional costs for ATC staffing,
training, or facility equipment. The FAA is confident that it can accommodate any additional traffic that will participate
in radar services at the Class C airspace area through more efficient use of personnel at current authorized staffing
levels. The FAA has trained its controller force in Class C airspace procedures during regularly scheduled briefing
sessions routinely held at Billings. Thus, no additional training costs or equipment requirements are anticipated.


Establishment of Class C airspace throughout the country has made it necessary to revise sectional charts by removing
existing airspace depictions and incorporating the new Class C airspace boundaries. The FAA currently revises these
sectional charts every 6 months to reflect changes to the airspace environment. 

Changes required to depict Class C airspace are made routinely during these charting cycles. The periodic changes
to these charts are considered as routine operating expenses of the FAA. Thus, the FAA does not expect to incur any additional
charting costs as a result of the establishment of the Billings Class C airspace area. 

The FAA holds an informal public meeting at each proposed Class C airspace location. These meetings provide pilots
with the best opportunity to learn about Class C airspace operating procedures. The routine expenses associated
with these public meetings are incurred regardless of whether Class C airspace is ultimately established. Before
the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area becomes effective, the FAA will distribute a ``Letter To Airmen'' to all pilots
residing within 50 miles of the Class C airspace site that will explain the operation and airspace configuration of
the Class C airspace. The ``Letter to Airmen'' cost will be approximately $550. This one-time negligible cost will
be incurred upon the establishment of the Class C airspace area. 

The FAA anticipates that some pilots who currently transit the terminal area without establishing radio communications
or participating in Stage III services may choose to circumnavigate the Billings Class C airspace area. However,
the FAA contends that these operators can circumnavigate the Class C airspace area without significantly deviating
from their regular flight paths. They could remain clear of the Class C airspace area by flying above the ceiling (7,700
feet mean sea level (MSL)), under the outer floor (4,900 feet MSL), or just beyond the lateral boundaries. The FAA estimates
that this final rule will have a negligible, if any, cost impact on nonparticipating GA aircraft operations because
of the small deviations from current flight paths imposed on these operators.

The FAA assumes that nearly all aircraft operating in the vicinity of the Billings Class C airspace area already have
Mode C transponders and two-way radio communications capability. All aircraft (except those without an electrical
system, balloons, and gliders) flying in the vicinity of the Billings Logan International Airport have been required
(under 14 CFR Section 91.215(b)(5)(ii)) to have a Mode C transponder since December 30, 1990. Aircraft with Mode C
transponders are usually equipped with two-way radio communications capability because radios are considered
a more basic piece of avionics equipment. Since the cost of the Mode C requirement has already been addressed (Phase
II of the Mode C Rule), it is not considered separately here in order to avoid double counting. This final rule will terminate
the exemption from the Mode C requirement for gliders, balloons, and aircraft certified without engine-driven electrical
systems. The overall economic impact will be very slight because there are not many of these aircraft, and ATC will
have discretion to authorize deviations from the Mode C requirement for these aircraft on an individual basis. 

The establishment of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area is not expected to have any adverse impacts on the operations
of the two small satellite airports (Laurel Municipal and Airpark Oscars) located in the vicinity of Billings Logan
International Airport. Pilots using these airports who do not have the required equipment can circumnavigate the
Class C airspace area. 



Benefits 



The benefits of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area will be enhanced aviation safety (lowered risk of midair collisions)
and improved operational efficiency (higher air traffic controller productivity with existing resources). These
potential benefits are difficult to quantify in monetary terms. Thus, such benefits have been analyzed in qualitative
terms and are discussed below. 

The NAR Task Group found that airspace users, especially GA users, encountered significant problems with terminal
radar services. Different levels of radar service offered within terminal areas caused confusion about existing
restrictions and privileges. 

The standardization and simplification of operating procedures provided by Class C airspace is expected to alleviate
many of these problems. All these benefits of the Class C airspace program, however, cannot be specifically attributed
to individual airports. Rather, the benefits will result from overall improvements in terminal area ATC procedures
realized as Class C airspace is implemented throughout the country. Establishment of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace
area will contribute to these overall improvements. 

The Billings, MT, Class C airspace area will lower the risk of midair collisions due to the increase of controlled airspace
around Billings. Due to the proactive nature of the Class C airspace, the potential safety benefits are difficult
to quantify in monetary terms. Traffic trends indicate an increased probability of a midair collision at Billings.
The FAA is, therefore, establishing a Class C airspace area to prevent the development of a potential safety problem.
These traffic trends consist of an increased volume of passenger enplanements and an increased complexity of aircraft
operations. Complexity refers to air traffic conditions resulting from a mix of controlled and uncontrolled aircraft
(pilots that are not in contact with ATC) that vary widely in speed and maneuverability. Enplanements at Billings,
MT, for 1992 were 285,378 and are projected to be 397,000 by the year 2000. The number of aircraft operations at Billings
is projected to increase from 112,000 in 1992 to 156,000 by the year 2000. The current volume of passenger enplanements
and aircraft operations have made Billings, MT, eligible to become a Class C airspace area. 

The FAA has conservatively estimated that the Class C airspace program will reduce the risk of midair collision by
50 percent at TRSA locations. This estimate is based on studies of near midair collision (NMAC) trends and radar tracking
data from the original Columbus, OH, Class C airspace location and a review of the National Transportation Safety
Board's (NTSB) midair collision accident records from January 1978 to October 1984. This 50 percent reduction translates
into one midair collision prevented nationally every one to two years. The FAA currently values the prevention of
a human fatality at $2.6 million and the prevention of a serious injury at $640,000. The quantifiable benefits of preventing
a midair collision (based on the aforementioned reports) can range from less than $172,000 (1993 dollars), a minor
non-fatal accident between two GA aircraft in which both aircraft need to be replaced, to $409 million (1993 dollars),
the weighted average of a midair collision between an air carrier and a GA aircraft in which there are no survivors.
The benefits of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area and other designated airspace actions that require Mode C transponders
cannot be separated from the benefits of the Mode C Rule and the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)
Rule. These airspace actions will share potential benefits totaling $4.4 billion (discounted 7 percent, 15 years,
1993 dollars). 



International Trade Impact Assessment 



This final rule will only affect U.S. terminal airspace operating procedures at and in the vicinity of Billings, MT.
This final rule will not impose a competitive trade disadvantage on foreign firms in the sale of either foreign aviation
products or services in the United States. In addition, domestic firms would not incur a competitive trade disadvantage
in either the sale of United States aviation products or services in foreign countries. 



Regulatory Flexibility Determination 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by Federal regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if
a final rule will have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order 2100.14A
outlines the FAA's procedures and criteria for implementing the RFA. Small entities are independently owned and
operated small businesses and small not for profit organizations. A substantial number of small entities is defined
as a number that is 11 or more and which is more than one-third of the small entities subject to the final rule. 

For the purpose of this evaluation, the small entities that will be potentially affected by this final rule are defined
as fixed-base operators, airport operators, flight schools, agricultural operators, and other small aviation
businesses operating in the vicinity of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area. Sport aviation interests that may
be affected include ballooning, parachuting, and gliding. Mandatory participation in the Class C airspace and special
conditions around Billings could potentially impose certain costs (i.e., avionics equipment) on aircraft operators.
The FAA will develop special procedures to accommodate these activities through local agreements between ATC and
the affected organizations. For these reasons, the FAA does not expect any adverse impacts to occur as a result of the
establishment of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940725-0-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940725-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The FAA has determined that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required under the terms of the RFA. 



Federalism Implications 



The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national Government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule would not have
sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



Conclusion 



The FAA has determined that this final rule to establish the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area will impose a negligible
cost of $550 on the agency. When this cost estimate of $550 is added to the total cost of the Class C airspace program,
the Class B airspace program, the Mode C Rule, and the TCAS Rule, the combined cost will still be less than their total
potential safety benefits. This final rule will also generate benefits in the form of enhanced operational efficiency.
The establishment of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area will only impose negligible costs on the aviation community.
Thus, this final rule will be cost beneficial.

 Final and temporary regulations. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final Income Tax Regulations relating to the computation and characterization of income
or earnings and profits under the dollar approximate separate transactions method of accounting (DASTM). These
regulations are issued under section 985 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code), which was added to the Code by
the Tax Reform Act of 1986. These regulations provide guidance for taxpayers with a qualified business unit (QBU)
operating in a hyperinflationary environment, i.e., a QBU that must use the dollar as its functional currency and
determine income or earnings and profits under DASTM because its functional currency otherwise would be a hyperinflationary
currency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Paperwork Reduction Act



The collection of information contained in these final regulation has been reviewed and approved by the Office of
Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under
control number 1545-1051. The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 45 minutes to 13/4 hours,
depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 11/4 hours.

Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent
to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office
of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Washington, DC 20503.



Background



On July 17, 1991, proposed amendments to  1.985-3 were published in the 

Federal Register

 at 56 FR 32525. In addition, conforming changes were proposed to   1.904-4, 1.954-2T, 1.985-0,
1.985-1, and 1.985-2. A public hearing was held on September 13, 1991. A number of comments, which are discussed
below, were received on issues raised by the proposed regulations. After consideration of these comments, the regulations
are adopted as a Treasury decision with the modifications described below.



Explanation of Provisions



Under  1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(A), a QBU that would otherwise have a hyperinflationary currency as its functional
currency must use the dollar as its functional currency and must compute income or earnings and profits using DASTM
for taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994. Any change in a QBU's method of accounting which results from the
QBU's adoption of DASTM under these final regulations shall be deemed to have been made with the consent of the Commissioner.

Some commentators objected to the requirement that use of the dollar and DASTM be made mandatory for a QBU operating
in a hyperinflationary environment. The suggestion that use of the dollar and DASTM should continue to be elective
was not adopted because the use of a hyperinflationary functional currency and the profit and loss method of accounting
(P&L method) does not clearly reflect income.

Under the P&L method, income or loss is computed in the hyperinflationary currency and translated into dollars
at the appropriate exchange rate for the accounting period. The P&L method distorts income and loss of a QBU with
substantial depreciable assets. As the hyperinflationary currency depreciates with respect to the dollar, sales
revenues (as measured in the hyperinflationary currency) increase; but depreciation and amortization deductions,
which are based on hyperinflationary currency cost bases, remain constant. This results in an overstatement of income.
Another distortion occurs with respect to income and expense derived from hyperinflationary financial assets and
liabilities. For example, a QBU that borrows in hyperinflationary currency will incur and deduct a very high level
of nominal interest expense, reflecting the lender's expectation that payment of interest and repayment of principal
will be in devalued currency. However, under the P&L method, the offsetting exchange gain (relative to the dollar)
on a QBU's hyperinflationary currency liabilities is deferred, causing the income of net borrowers to be understated.

In light of these distortions, use of a hyperinflationary functional currency and the P&L method by QBUs operating
in a hyperinflationary environment is not appropriate. The regulations, therefore, generally require that QBUs
operating in a hyperinflationary environment use the dollar and DASTM for future taxable years. Under  1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(B)(

2

), however, a taxpayer is not required to use DASTM to compute the income or loss or earnings and profits of a foreign
corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation. This exception is provided because minority shareholders
of a foreign corporation may be unable to obtain the information required to apply DASTM. However, where the necessary
information can be obtained,  1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(B)(

2

) provides that DASTM may be elected by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation under the procedural rules of  1.985-2(c)(3).

Section 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(B)(

1

) clarifies the rule for determining the functional currency of a QBU branch of a foreign corporation when the foreign
corporation has a non-dollar functional currency that is not hyperinflationary. If the QBU branch otherwise would
have a hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency, the branch's functional currency is the functional
currency of the foreign corporation.

The definition of hyperinflationary currency, now found in  1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D), has been revised
to clarify that the cumulative inflation rate during the thirty-six month base period is based on compounded inflation
rates for the base period, and not on the sum of annual inflation rates. This change conforms the definition of hyperinflationary
currency more closely to that applicable under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Section 1.985-3(a) provides that, for all purposes of subtitle A, DASTM must be used to compute gross income,
income or loss, or earnings and profits (or deficits in earnings and profits). This provision is intended to clarify
that DASTM gain or loss is part of gross income for purposes of the 

de minimis

 and full inclusion rules of section 954(b)(3) (A) and (B), and that DASTM gain or loss must be taken into account in applying
the related party interest rules of section 954(b)(5), among other computations.

Section 1.985-3(a) further provides that, for open taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, but before
the effective date of these regulations, the taxpayer has the option to elect DASTM for any open taxable year (and all
subsequent taxable years). Taxpayers previously using the P&L method that wish to elect DASTM for prior open
years may do so by amending their tax returns for the applicable years and complying with the applicable election procedures
of  1.985-2, including the conformity requirements of  1.985-2(d)(3), if applicable. Taxpayers
that have elected DASTM and applied the rules under prior  1.985-3 may elect to apply the rules under this
revised  1.985-3 by amending their tax returns for the applicable years. In either case, the Commissioner
is deemed to consent.

If a taxpayer elects for prior years to change the functional currency of a QBU operating in a hyperinflationary environment
to the dollar, it must make the adjustments described in  1.985-5 (or  1.985-5T, if applicable)
if the year of change begins after 1987, or the adjustments described in  1.985-6 (or  1.985-6T,
if applicable) if the year of change begins in 1987. The adjustments described in  1.985-5 (or  1.985-5T,
if applicable) must be included in income in the taxable year prior to the year of change unless that prior taxable year
is closed. In that case, the adjustments must be included in income in the year of change.

Certain countries with hyperinflation require taxpayers to make adjustments to the balance sheet under a system
of monetary correction with respect to fixed assets and capital, with corresponding adjustments to the profit and
loss statement. Under U.S. GAAP, these adjustments are reversed. Section 1.985-3(b)(2) and  1.985-3(d)(2)(ii)
have been clarified to require reversal of monetary correction adjustments required by local accounting principles.

Taxpayers suggested that they should be permitted to translate certain financial assets and liabilities at the period-end
exchange rate, rather than at the average exchange rate for the last translation period in order to conform the rules
under  1.985-3 to GAAP. To make it clear that the period-end exchange rate may be used,  1.985-3(c)(6)
has been amended to indicate that a spot exchange rate on the last day of the taxable period is a reasonable method, provided
that it is consistently and used and conforms to the taxpayer's method of financial accounting.

Taxpayers requested guidance with respect to transactions described in section 988(c)(1) (B) and (C) denominated
in a currency other than a QBU's hyperinflationary currency or the dollar (third currency transaction). In order
to parallel the financial accounting rules for the administrative ease of taxpayers and the Service,  1.985-3(c)(9)
provides that taxpayers may use any reasonable method of accounting for third currency transactions so long as such
method is consistent with their method of financial accounting.

Several commentators requested that the regulations provide a simpler method of allocating and apportioning DASTM
gain or loss for small taxpayers. This suggestion has been adopted. Section 1.985-3(e)(2) provides that a taxpayer
with a QBU having an adjusted basis in assets of $10 million or less (taking into account assets of related QBUs resident
in the same country) may elect to allocate DASTM gain or loss ratably to all items of the QBU's gross income (determined
prior to adjustment for DASTM gain or loss). Thus, for purposes of the foreign tax credit, DASTM gain or loss is allocated
on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income in each separate category described in section 904(d). Similarly,
for purposes of section 952, DASTM gain or loss is allocated to subpart F income in a separate category based on the ratio
of gross subpart F income in the separate category to total gross income in that category. Commentators also requested
a simpler method for taxpayers with one or two section 904(d) separate categories (or a 

de minimis

 amount in a second category). This suggestion was not adopted because the allocation rules in  1.985-3(e)(3)
more accurately reflect the income of large taxpayers.

The prior final regulations under  1.985-3 provided for the allocation of DASTM gains and losses to section
904(d) separate categories based on foreign source gross income in each category. There was no attempt to identify
DASTM gain or loss with specific assets or liabilities. However, in the proposed regulations under  1.985-3,
DASTM gain or loss was identified with specific assets and was directly allocated to specific section 904(d) separate
categories based on the income those assets would generate. With respect to liabilities, the proposed regulations
provided that DASTM gain or loss should be allocated to the section 904(d) separate categories in the same manner as
the allocation and apportionment of interest expense. The proposed regulations applied this method of allocation
to all liabilities.

Some comments suggested that DASTM gain or loss on certain non-interest-bearing liabilities, particularly short-term
non-interest-bearing trade payables, should be directly allocated to the same section 904(d) separate category
as the income produced by the purchased good or service to which the payable relates. The suggested rationale for this
approach is that in a hyperinflationary environment the purchase price for deferred payment of goods or services
reflects a premium for inflation expected to occur prior to payment. This overstated purchase price is reflected
in cost of goods sold, distorting the taxpayer's income in the pertinent section 904(d) separate category. Therefore,
in order to compensate for this distortion, commentators recommended adjusting cost of goods sold by the DASTM gain
on the trade payable.

In response to this suggestion,  1.985-3(e) now provides different rules for allocating and apportioning
DASTM gain or loss with respect to interest-bearing liabilities (under  1.985-3(e)(3)(vii)) and non-interest-bearing
liabilities (under  1.985-3(e)(3)(viii)). Section 1.985-3(e)(3)(vii)(A) now provides that
the amount of DASTM gain on interest-bearing liabilities reduces interest expense generated by such liabilities;
any DASTM gain in excess of interest expense is sourced or otherwise classified in the same manner that interest expense
is allocated and apportioned. Any DASTM loss on interest-bearing liabilities is allocated and apportioned in the
same manner that interest expense is allocated and apportioned under  1.861-9T (without regard to the
exceptions to fungibility in  1.861-10T).

Section 1.985-3(e)(3)(vii)(B) provides rules with respect to the allocation of DASTM gain or loss on debt that
gives rise to related person interest expense under section 954(b)(5). Section 954(b)(5) requires that related
person interest expense must first be allocated to foreign personal holding company income that is passive income
to the extent thereof and therefore to the section 904(d)(1)(A) separate category for passive income for purposes
of the foreign tax credit limitation. To prevent distortion, any DASTM gain or loss arising from such related person
debt must also be allocated for purposes of sections 904 and 952 in the same manner that the related person interest
expense of that debt is required to be allocated under the rules of section 954(b)(5).

One commentator suggested that, in applying the modified gross income method under  1.861-9T(j) to allocate
and apportion the interest expense of a controlled foreign corporation, the gross income in each section 904(d) separate
category should first be adjusted by the amount of DASTM gain or loss allocated to assets under  1.985-3(e)(3)(v).
Section 1.985-3(e)(3)(vii)(C) of the final regulations adopts this suggestion and requires that, before
applying the modified gross income method under  1.861-9T(j), an adjustment to gross income must be made
for DASTM gain or loss attributed to assets under  1.985-3(e)(3)(v) and DASTM gain or loss on short-term,
non-interest-bearing trade payables under  1.985-3(e)(3)(viii)(A).

In accordance with comments described above,  1.985-3(e)(3)(viii)(A) provides that DASTM gain or loss
on short-term, non-interest-bearing trade payables is allocated to the same category or type of gross income as the
cost or expense to which the trade payable relates. For this purpose, a short-term, non-interest-bearing trade payable
is a non-interest-bearing liability with a term of 183 days or less that is incurred to purchase property or services
to be used by the obligor in an active trade or business. Under  1.985-3(e)(3)(viii)(B), a similar rule
has been provided for excise tax payables.

Under  1.985-3(e)(3)(viii)(C)(

1

), DASTM gain or loss on other non-interest-bearing liabilities is allocated under  1.985-3(e)(3)(ix)
(i.e., on a gross income basis). However, under  1.985-3(e)(3)(viii)(C)(

2

), the taxpayer may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the district director, or the district director may determine,
that application of the gross income allocation method would result in a substantial distortion of income. In that
case, DASTM gain or loss on such liabilities may be attributed to the same section 904(d) separate category or subpart
F category as the transaction to which the liability relates.

The temporary regulations under  1.954-2T have been amended in this Treasury Decision and will be finalized
as part of a separate regulation.

An accompanying proposed regulation provides rules that would require a taxpayer to change from DASTM to the P&L
method when the currency which otherwise would be its functional currency ceases to be hyperinflationary.



Effective Date



These regulations are effective for taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994. However, a taxpayer may elect
to apply  1.985-3 to any open taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986 (whether or not DASTM has been
previously elected for some or all of those years). In order to make this election, the taxpayer must apply  1.985-3
to that year and all subsequent years. In addition, each person that is related (within the meaning of  1.985-3(e)(2)(vi))
to the taxpayer on the last day of any taxable year for which the election is effective and that would have been eligible
to elect DASTM must also apply  1.985-3 to that year and all subsequent years.

It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.



Drafting Information



The principal authors of these regulations are Jacob Feldman and Teresa B. Hughes of the Office of Associate Chief
Counsel (International) within the Office of Chief Counsel, IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury
Department participated in their development.

(b) 

Dollar functional currency

_(1) 

In general.

 The dollar shall be the functional currency of a taxpayer or QBU described in paragraph (b)(1) (i) through (v) of this
section regardless of the currency used in keeping its books and records (as defined in  1.989(a)-1(d)).
The dollar shall be the functional currency of_

(i) A taxpayer that is not a QBU (e.g., an individual); 

(ii) A QBU that conducts its activities primarily in dollars. A QBU conducts its activities primarily in dollars if
the currency of the economic environment in which the QBU conducts its activities is primarily the dollar. The facts
and circumstances test set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
shall apply in making this determination; 

(iii) Except as otherwise provided by ruling or administrative pronouncement, a QBU that has the United States, or
any possession or territory of the United States where the dollar is the standard currency, as its residence (as defined
in section 988(a)(3)(B)); 

(iv) A QBU that does not keep books and records in the currency of any economic environment in which a significant part
of its activities is conducted. Whether a QBU keeps such books and records is determined in accordance with paragraph
(c)(3) of this section; or 

(v) A QBU that produces income or loss that is, or is treated as, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business within the United States. 

(2) 

QBUs operating in a hyperinflationary environment

_(i) 

Taxable years beginning on or before August 24, 1994.

 For taxable years beginning on or before August 24, 1994, see  1.985-2 with respect to a QBU that elects
to use, or is otherwise required to use, the dollar as its functional 
currency.
 
(ii) 

Taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994.

_(A) 

In general.

 For taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this
section, any QBU that 
otherwise would be required to use a hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency must use the dollar as
its functional currency and compute income or loss or earnings and profits under the rules of  1.985-3.


(B) 

Exceptions

_(

1

) 

Certain QBU branches.

 The functional 
currency of a QBU that otherwise would be required to use a hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency
and that is a branch of a foreign corporation having a non-dollar functional currency that is not hyperinflationary
shall be the functional currency of the foreign corporation. Such QBU's income or loss or earnings and profits shall
be determined under  1.985-3 by substituting the functional currency of the foreign corporation 
for the dollar. 

(

2

) 

Corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation.

 A foreign corporation (or its QBU branch) operating in a hyperinflationary environment is not required to use the
dollar as its functional currency pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section if that foreign corporation
is not a controlled foreign corporation as defined in section 957 or 953(c)(1)(B). However, a noncontrolled section
902 corporation, as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E), may elect to use the dollar (or, if appropriate, the currency
specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(

1

) of this section) as its (or its QBU branch's) functional currency under the procedures set forth in  1.985-2(c)(3).


(C) 

Change in functional currency.

 If a QBU is required to change its functional currency to the dollar under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section,
or chooses or is required to change its functional currency to the dollar for any open taxable year (and all subsequent
taxable years) under  1.985-3(a)(2)(ii), the change is considered to be made with the consent of the Commissioner
for purposes of  1.985-4. A QBU changing functional currency must make the adjustments described in  1.985-5
if the year of change (as defined in  1.481-1(a)(1)) begins after 1987, or the adjustments described in
 1.985-6 if the year of change begins in 1987. The adjustments described in  1.985-5 must be
included in income in the taxable year prior to the year of 
change unless that prior taxable year is closed. In that case, the adjustments must be included in income in the year
of change. No adjustments under section 481 are required solely because of a change in functional currency described
in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C).

(D) 

Hyperinflationary currency.

 For purposes of sections 985 through 989, the term hyperinflationary currency means the currency of a country in which
there is cumulative inflation during the base period of at least 100 percent as determined by reference to the consumer
price index of the country listed in the monthly issues of the ``International Financial Statistics'' or 
a successor publication of the International Monetary Fund. If a country's currency is not listed in the monthly issues
of ``International Financial Statistics,'' a QBU may use any other reasonable method consistently applied for determining
the country's consumer price index. Base period means, with respect to any taxable year, the thirty-six calendar
months immediately 
preceding the first day of the current calendar year. For this purpose, the cumulative inflation rate for the base
period is based on compounded inflation rates. Thus, if for 1991, 1992, and 1993, a country's annual inflation rates
are 29 percent, 25 percent, and 30 percent, respectively, the cumulative inflation rate for the three-year base period
is 110 percent [((1.29  x  1.25  x  1.3)^1.0  x  1.10)x100=110%] and the currency of the country for
the QBU's 1994 year is considered hyperinflationary. 

(c) * * * 

(6) 

Effect of changed circumstances.

 Regardless of any change in circumstances, a QBU may change its functional currency determined under this paragraph
(c) only if the QBU complies with  1.985-4 or the Commissioner's consent is considered to have been granted
under  1.985-2(d)(4) or  1.985-3(a)(2)(ii). 

(d) * * *
 
(1) * * * 

(ii) * * * For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), if a QBU of a foreign corporation has the dollar as its
functional currency under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the QBU's activities shall be considered dollar activities
of the corporation. 



* * * * * 





Par. 6.

 Section 1.985-2 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b)(2) to read as follows: 



 1.985-2 

Election to use the United States dollar as the functional currency of a QBU. 



(a) 

Background and scope

_(1) 

In general.

 This section permits an eligible QBU to elect to use the dollar as its functional currency for taxable years beginning
on or before August 24, 1994. An election to use a dollar functional currency is not permitted for a QBU other than an
eligible QBU. Paragraph (b) of this section defines an eligible QBU. Paragraph (c) of this section describes the time
and manner for making the dollar election and paragraph (d) of this section describes the effect of making the election.
For the definition of a QBU, see section 989(a). See  1.985-1(b)(2)(ii) for rules 
requiring a QBU to use the dollar as its functional currency in taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994.

(2) 

Exception.

 Pursuant to  1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(B)(

2

), the rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply with respect to the procedure required to be followed by
a noncontrolled section 902 corporation as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E) to elect the dollar as its (or its QBU branch's)

functional currency and the application of  1.985-3. 

(b) * * * 

(2) 

Hyperinflationary currency.

 See  1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D) for the definition of hyperinflationary currency. 



* * * * * 





Par. 7.

 Section 1.985-3 is revised to read as follows: 



 1.985-3 

United States dollar approximate separate transactions 
method. 



(a) 

Scope and effective date

_(1) 

Scope.

 This section describes the United States dollar (dollar) approximate separate transactions method of accounting
(DASTM). For all purposes of subtitle A, this method of accounting must be used to compute the gross income, taxable
income or loss, or earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) of a QBU (as defined in section 989(a))
that has the dollar as its functional currency pursuant 
to  1.985-1(b)(2).

(2) 

Effective date

_(i) 

In general.

 This section is 
effective for taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994.

(ii) 

DASTM prior-year election.

 A taxpayer may elect to apply this section to any open taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986 (whether or not
DASTM has been previously elected for some or all of those years). In order to make this election, the taxpayer must
apply  1.985-3 to that year and all subsequent years. In addition, each person that is related (within
the meaning of  1.985-3(e)(2)(vi)) to the taxpayer on the last day of any taxable year for which the election
is effective and that would have been eligible to elect DASTM must also apply these rules to that year and all subsequent
years. A taxpayer that has not previously elected to apply DASTM to its prior taxable years may make the DASTM election
for the pertinent years by filing amended returns and complying with the applicable election procedures of  1.985-2.
Form 8819 shall be attached to the return for the first year for which the election is to be effective. A taxpayer that
has elected DASTM for prior taxable years and applied the rules under  1.985-3 (as contained in the 
April 1, 1994 edition of 26 CFR part 1 (1.908 to 1.1000)) may amend its returns to apply the rules of this  1.985-3.
In either case, the DASTM election for prior taxable years shall be deemed to be made with the consent of the Commissioner.


(b) 

Statement of method.

 Under DASTM, income or loss or earnings and profits (or a deficit in earnings and profits) of a QBU for its taxable year
shall be determined in dollars by_

(1) Preparing an income or loss statement from the QBU's books and records (within the meaning of  1.989(a)-1(d))
as recorded in the QBU's hyperinflationary currency (as defined in  1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D)); 

(2) Making the adjustments necessary to conform such 
statement to United States generally accepted accounting 
principles and tax accounting principles (including reversing 
monetary correction adjustments required by local accounting 
principles); 

(3) Translating the amounts of hyperinflationary currency as shown on such adjusted statement into dollars in accordance
with paragraph (c) of this section; and 

(4) Adjusting the resulting dollar income or loss or earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) and,
where necessary, particular items of gross income, deductible expense or other amounts, in accordance with paragraph
(e) of this section to reflect the amount of DASTM gain or loss as 
determined under paragraph (d) of this section. 

(c) 

Translation into United States dollars

_(1) 

In general.

 
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), the amounts shown on the income or loss statement, as adjusted
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, shall be translated into dollars at the exchange rate (as defined in paragraph
(c)(6) of this section) for the translation period (as defined in paragraph 
(c)(7) of this section) to which they relate. However, if the QBU previously changed its functional currency to the
dollar, and the rules of  1.985-5 (or, if applicable,  1.985-5T, as contained in the April
1, 1993 edition of 26 CFR part 1 (1.908 to 1.1000)) applied in translating its balance sheet amounts into dollars, then
the spot exchange rate applied under those rules shall be 
used to translate any amount that would otherwise be translated at a rate determined by reference to a translation
period prior to the change in functional currency. For example, depreciation with respect to an asset acquired while
the QBU had a nondollar functional currency shall be translated into dollars at the spot rate on the last day of the taxable
year before the year of change to a dollar functional currency, rather than at the rate for the period in which the asset
was acquired. 

(2) 

Cost of goods sold.

 The dollar value of cost of goods sold shall equal the sum of the dollar values of beginning inventory and purchases
less the dollar value of closing inventory as these amounts are determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(3) 

Beginning inventory, purchases, and closing inventory

_(i) 

Beginning inventory.

 Amounts representing beginning inventory shall be translated so as to obtain the same amount of dollars which represented
such items in the closing inventory balance for the preceding taxable year. 

(ii) 

Purchases.

 Amounts representing items purchased or otherwise first included in inventory during the taxable year shall be translated
at the exchange rate for the translation period in which the cost of such items was incurred.

(iii) 

Closing inventory

_(A) 

In general.

 Amounts representing items included in the closing inventory balance shall be translated at the exchange rate for
the translation period in which the cost of such items was incurred. However, if amounts representing items included
in the closing inventory balance are either valued at market or written down to market 
value, they shall be translated at the exchange rate existing on the last day of the taxable year. For purposes of determining
lower of cost or market, items of inventory included in the closing inventory balance shall be translated into dollars
at the exchange rate for the translation period in which the cost of such items was incurred and compared with market
as determined in the QBU's hyperinflationary currency translated into dollars at 
the exchange rate existing on the last day of the taxable year. 

(B) 

Determination of translation period.

 The method used to determine the translation period of amounts representing items of closing inventory for purposes
of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section may be based upon reasonable approximations and averages, including
rates of turnover, provided that the method is used consistently from year to year. 

(4) 

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization.

 Amounts representing allowances for depreciation, depletion, or amortization shall be translated at the exchange
rate for the translation period in which the cost of the underlying asset was incurred, except as provided in paragraph
(c)(1) of this section. 

(5) 

Prepaid expenses or income.

 Amounts representing expense or income paid or received in a prior taxable year shall be translated at the exchange
rate for the translation period during which they were paid or received. 

(6) 

Exchange rate.

 The exchange rate for a translation period may be determined under any reasonable method, provided that the method
is consistently applied to all translation periods and conforms to the taxpayer's method of financial accounting.
Reasonable methods include the average of beginning and ending exchange rates for the translation period and the
spot 
rate on the last day of the translation period. Once chosen, a method for determining an exchange rate can be changed
only with the consent of the district director. 

(7) 

Translation period

_(i) 

In general.

 Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(B) and (c)(7)(ii) of this section, a translation period shall be each
month within a QBU's taxable year. 

(ii) 

Exception.

 A taxpayer may divide its taxable year into translation periods of equal length (with not more than one short period
annually) that are less than one month. Once such a translation period is established, it may not be changed without
the consent of the district director. 

(8) 

Dollar transactions

_(i) 

In general.

 Except as provided in paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section, no DASTM gain or loss is realized with respect to dollar
transactions since the dollar is the functional currency of the QBU. Thus, the amount of any payment or receipt of dollars
shall be reflected in the income or loss statement by the amount of such dollars. Also, 
the income or loss attributable to any transaction in which the amount that a QBU is entitled to receive (or is required
to pay) by reason of such transaction is denominated in terms of the dollar, or is determined by reference to the value
of the dollar, must be computed transaction by transaction. For example, if a foreign corporation lends 20 LC when
20 LC=$20 and is entitled to receive the LC equivalent of $20 at maturity plus a market 
rate of interest in dollars (or its LC equivalent), the loan is a dollar transaction. Similarly, this paragraph applies
to any transaction that is determined to be a dollar transaction under section 988. 

(ii) 

Non-dollar functional currency.

 If pursuant to  1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(B)(

1

), a QBU is required to use a functional currency other than the dollar, then that currency shall be substituted for
the dollar in applying paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. 

(9) 

Third currency transactions

_A taxpayer may use any reasonable method of accounting for transactions described in section 988(c)(1) (B) and (C)
that are denominated in, or determined by reference to, a currency other than the QBU's hyperinflationary currency
or the dollar (third currency transactions) so long as such method is consistent with its method of financial accounting.


(10) 

Examples.

 The provisions of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples: 






Example 1.

 S is an accrual basis QBU that is required to use the dollar as its functional currency for its first taxable year beginning
in 1994. S's hyperinflationary currency is the ``h.'' During 1994, S accrues 100 dollars attributable to dollar-denominated
sales. Because this is a dollar transaction under paragraph (c)(8) of this section, S's income or loss for 1994 shall
reflect the 100 dollars (not the hyperinflationary value of such dollars when accrued).

Example 2. 

(i) S is an accrual basis QBU that is required to use the dollar as its functional currency for its first taxable year
beginning in 1994. S's hyperinflationary currency is the ``h.'' During 1994, S's sales amounted to 240,000,000h,
its currently deductible expenses were 26,000,000h, and its total inventory purchases amounted to 100,000,000h.
During January and February of 1994, S purchased depreciable assets for 80,000,000h and was allowed depreciation
of 4,000,000h. At the end of 1994, S's closing inventory was 23,000,000h. No election to use a translation period other
than the month is made, S had no transactions described in paragraph (c)(8) or (c)(9) of this section, and S's closing
inventory was computed on the first-in, first-out inventory method. S's adjusted income or loss statement for 1994
is translated into dollars as follows:








(ii) Since S uses the first-in, first-out inventory method, the closing inventory is assumed to consist of purchases
made during the most recent translation period as follows: 







(d) 

Computation of DASTM gain or loss_

(1) 

Rule. 

DASTM gain or loss of a QBU equals_

(i) The net worth of the QBU (as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) at the end of the taxable year minus
the net worth of the QBU at the end of the preceding taxable year; plus 
(ii) The dollar amount of the items described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and minus the dollar amount of the
items described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section; minus 
(iii) The amount of dollar income or earnings and profits (or plus the amount of any dollar loss or deficit in earnings
and profits) as determined for the taxable year pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. 

(2) 

Net worth. 

Net worth of a QBU at the end of any taxable year equals the aggregate dollar amount representing assets on the QBU's
balance sheet at the end of the taxable year less the aggregate dollar amount representing liabilities on the balance
sheet. Notwithstanding any other provision in this paragraph (d)(2), the district director may adjust the amount
of any asset or liability if a purpose for acquiring (or disposing of) the asset or incurring (or discharging) the liability
is to manipulate the composition of the balance sheet for any period during the taxable year in order to avoid tax. The
taxpayer shall determine net worth by_

(i) Preparing a balance sheet as of the end of the taxable year from the QBU's books and records (within the meaning of
 1.989(a)-1(d)) as recorded in the QBU's hyperinflationary currency; 
(ii) Making adjustments necessary to conform such balance sheet to United States generally accepted accounting
principles and tax accounting principles (including reversing monetary correction adjustments required by local
accounting principles); and

(iii) Translating the asset and liability amounts 
shown on the balance sheet into United States dollars 
in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section. 
(3) 

Positive adjustments.

 The items described in 
this paragraph (d)(3) are dividend distributions for 
the taxable year and any items that decrease net worth 
for the taxable year but that generally do not affect 
income or loss or earnings and profits (or a deficit in 
earnings and profits). Such items include a transfer 
to the home office of a QBU branch and a return of 
capital. Except as otherwise provided by ruling or 
administrative pronouncement, the amount of a transfer 
to the home office of a QBU branch, a dividend, or a 
distribution that is a return of capital shall be 
translated into dollars at the exchange rate on the 
date the amount is paid. 
(4) 

Negative adjustments.

 The items described in 
this paragraph (d)(4) are items that increase net worth 
for the taxable year but that generally do not affect 
income or loss or earnings and profits (or a deficit in 
earnings and profits). Such items include a capital 
contribution or a transfer from a home office to a QBU 
branch. Except as otherwise provided by ruling or 
administrative pronouncement, if the contribution or 
transfer is not in dollars, the amount of a capital 
contribution or transfer shall be translated into 
dollars at the exchange rate on the date made. 
(5) 

Translation of balance sheet.

 Asset and 
liability amounts shown on the balance sheet in 
hyperinflationary currency (adjusted pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section) shall be 
translated into dollars as provided in this paragraph 
(d)(5). However, if the QBU previously changed its 
functional currency to the dollar and the rules of 
 1.985-5 (or, if applicable,  1.985-5T, as contained in 
the April 1, 1993 edition of 26 CFR part 1 (1.908 to 
1.1000)) applied in translating its balance sheet 
amounts into dollars, then the spot exchange rate 
applied under those rules shall be used to translate 
any amount that would otherwise be translated at a rate 
determined by reference to a translation period prior 
to the change in functional currency. For example, the 
basis of real property acquired while the QBU had a 
nondollar functional currency shall be translated into 
dollars at the spot rate on the last day of the taxable 
year before the year of change to a dollar functional 
currency, rather than at the rate for the period in 
which the cost was incurred. 
(i) 

Closing inventory.

 Amounts representing 
items of inventory included in the closing inventory 
balance shall be translated in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. 
(ii) 

Bad debt reserves.

 Amounts representing bad 
debt reserves shall be translated at the exchange rate 
for the last translation period for the taxable year. 
(iii) 

Prepaid income or expense.

 Amounts 
representing expenses or income paid or received in a 
prior taxable year shall be translated in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(5) of this section. 
(iv) 

Hyperinflationary currency.

 Amounts of the 
hyperinflationary currency and hyperinflationary demand 
deposit balances shall be translated at the exchange 
rate for the last translation period of the taxable 
year. 
(v) 

Certain assets

_(A) 

In general.

 Amounts 
representing plant, real property, equipment, goodwill, 
and patents and other intangibles shall be translated 
at the exchange rate for the translation period in 
which the cost of the asset was incurred. 
(B) 

Adjustment to certain assets.

 Amounts 
representing depreciation, depletion, and amortization 
reserves shall be translated in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section. 
(vi) 

Hyperinflationary debt obligations.

 Except 
as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(vii) of this section, 
amounts representing a hyperinflationary debt 
obligation (including accounts receivable and payable) 
shall be translated at the exchange rate for the last 
translation period for the taxable year. 
(vii) 

Accrued foreign income taxes.

 Amounts 
representing an accrued but unpaid foreign income tax 
shall be translated at the exchange rate on the last 
day of the last translation period of the taxable year 
of accrual. 
(viii) 

Certain hyperinflationary financial 
instruments.

 Amounts representing any item described 
in section 988(c)(1)(B)(iii) (relating to forward 
contracts, futures contracts, options, or similar 
financial instruments) denominated in or determined by 
reference to the hyperinflationary currency shall be 
translated at the exchange rate for the last 
translation period for the taxable year. 
(ix) 

Other assets and liabilities.

 Amounts 
representing assets and liabilities, other than those 
described in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (viii) of 
this section, shall be translated at the exchange rate 
for the translation period in which the cost of the 
asset or the amount of the liability was incurred. 
(6) 

Dollar transactions.

 Notwithstanding any 
other provisions of this paragraph (d), where the 
amount representing an item shown on the balance sheet 
reflects a dollar transaction (described in paragraph 
(c)(8) of this section), the transaction shall be taken 
into account in accordance with that paragraph. 
(7) 

Third currency transactions.

 A taxpayer may 
use any reasonable method of accounting for 
transactions described in section 988(c)(1)(B) and (C) 
that are denominated in, or determined by reference to, 
a currency other than the QBU's hyperinflationary 
currency or the dollar (third currency transactions), 
so long as such method is consistent with its method of 
financial accounting. 
(8) 

Character.

 The amount of DASTM gain or loss 
determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall 
be ordinary income or loss. 
(9) 

Example.

 The provisions of this paragraph (d) 
are illustrated by the following example:

 



Example.

 (i) S, an accrual method calendar year 
foreign corporation, uses DASTM. S's hyperinflationary 
currency is the ``h.'' S's net worth at December 31, 
1993 was $3,246,495. For 1994, S's operating profit is 
81,340,000h, or $2,038,200. S made a 5,000,000h 
distribution in April and again in December of 1994. 
S's translation period is the month. None of S's 
assets or liabilities reflect a dollar or third 
currency transaction described in paragraph (c)(8) or 
(c)(9) of this section, respectively. The exchange 
rate for each month in 1994 is as follows:

(iv) Thus, total profit = $2,038,200 + $1,862,768 = $3,900,968 


(e) 

Effect of DASTM gain or loss on gross income, taxable 
income, or earnings and profits

_(1) 

In general. 

For all 
purposes of subtitle A, the amount of DASTM gain or loss of a QBU 
determined under paragraph (d) of this section is taken into 
account by the QBU for purposes of determining the amount of its 
gross income, taxable income or loss, earnings and profits (or 
deficit in earnings and profits), and, where necessary, 
particular items of income, expense or other amounts. DASTM gain 
or loss is allocated under one of two methods. Certain small 
QBUs may elect the small QBU DASTM allocation described in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section. All other QBUs must use the 9-step procedure described in paragraph (e)(3) of this
section. 
(2) 

Small QBU DASTM allocation

_(i) 

Election threshold. 

A 
taxpayer may elect to use the small QBU DASTM allocation 
described in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section with respect to 
a QBU that has an adjusted basis in assets (translated as 
provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section) of $10 million or 
less at the end of any taxable year. In calculating the $10 
million threshold, a QBU shall be treated as owning all of the 
assets of each related QBU (as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of 
this section) having its residence (as defined in section 
988(a)(3)(B)) in the QBU's country of residence (related same- 
country QBU). For this purpose, appropriate adjustment shall be 
made to eliminate the double counting of assets created in 
transactions between related QBUs resident in the same country. 
For example, assume QBU-1, resident in country X, sells inventory 
to related QBU-2, also resident in country X, in exchange for an 
account receivable. For purposes of determining the assets of 
QBU-1 under this paragraph (e)(2)(i), the taxpayer shall take 
into account either the inventory shown on the books of QBU-2 or 
QBU-1's receivable from QBU-2 (but not both). 
(ii) 

Consent to election. 

The election of the small QBU 
DASTM allocation or subsequent application of the rules of 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section due to an increase in the 
adjusted basis of the QBU's assets shall be deemed to have been 
made with the consent of the Commissioner. Once the election 
under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section is made, it shall 
apply for all years in which the adjusted basis of the assets of 
the QBU (and any related same-country QBU) is $10 million or 
less, unless revoked with the Commissioner's consent. If the 
adjusted basis of the assets of the QBU (and any related same- 
country QBU) exceeds $10 million at the end of any taxable year, 
the rules of paragraph (e)(3) of this section shall apply to that 
QBU (and any related same-country QBU) for such year and each 
subsequent year unless such QBU again qualifies, and applies for 
and obtains the Commissioner's consent, to use the small QBU 
DASTM allocation. However, if a QBU acquires assets with a 
principal purpose of avoiding the application of paragraph 
(e)(2)(iv) of this section, the Commissioner may disregard the 
acquisition of such assets.

(iii)

 Manner of making election

_(A) 

QBUs that are branches 
of United States persons. 

For the first year in which this 
election is effective, in the case of a QBU branch of a United 
States person, a statement shall be attached to the United States 
person's timely filed Federal income tax return (taking 
extensions into account). The statement shall identify the QBU 
(or QBUs) for which the election is being made by describing its 
business and its country of residence, state the adjusted basis 
of the assets of the QBU (and any related same-country QBUs) to 
which the election applies, and include a statement that the 
election is being made pursuant to  1.985-3(e)(2). 
(B) 

Other QBUs. 

In the case of a QBU other than one 
described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, an 
election must be made in the manner prescribed in  1.964-1. The 
statement filed with the Internal Revenue Service as required 
under  1.964-1 must include the information required under 
paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. 
(iv) 

Effect of election. 

If a taxpayer elects under this 
paragraph (e)(2) to use the small QBU DASTM allocation, DASTM 
gain or loss, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section, 
of a small QBU shall be allocated ratably to all items of the 
QBU's gross income (determined prior to adjustment for DASTM gain 
or loss). Therefore, for purposes of the foreign tax credit, 
DASTM gain or loss shall be allocated on the basis of the 
relative amounts of gross income in each separate category as 
defined in  1.904-5(a)(1). In the case of a controlled foreign 
corporation (within the meaning of section 957 or 953(c)(1)(B)), 
for purposes of section 952, DASTM gain or loss shall be 
allocated to subpart F income in a separate category in the same 
ratio that the gross subpart F income in that category for the 
taxable year bears to its total gross income in that category for 
the taxable year. 
(v) 

Conformity. 

If a person (or a QBU of such person) 
makes an election under this paragraph (e)(2) to use the small 
QBU DASTM allocation, then each QBU of any related person (as 
defined in paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section) that satisfies 
the threshold requirement of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section 
(after application of the aggregation rule of paragraph (e)(2)(i) 
of this section) shall be deemed to have made the election. 
(vi) 

Related person. 

The term related person means any 
person with a relationship to the QBU (or to the United States or 
foreign person of which the electing QBU is a part) that is 
defined in section 267(b) or section 707(b). 
(3) 

DASTM 9-step procedure

_(i) 

Step 1_prepare balance 
sheets. 

The taxpayer shall prepare an opening and a closing 
balance sheet for the QBU for each balance sheet period during 
the taxable year. The balance sheet period is the most frequent 
period for which balance sheet data are reasonably available (but 
in no event less frequently than quarterly). The balance sheet 
period may not be changed without the consent of the district 
director. The balance sheets must be prepared under the 
principles of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 
(ii) 

Step 2_identify certain assets and liabilities. 

The 
taxpayer shall identify each item on the balance sheet that is 
described in section 988(c)(1)(B) or (C) and that would have been 
translated under paragraph (d)(5) of this section into dollars at 
the exchange rate for the last translation period for the taxable 
year (or the exchange rate on the last day of the last 
translation period of the taxable year in the case of an accrued 
foreign income tax liability). 
(iii) 

Step 3_characterize the assets. 

The taxpayer shall 
characterize and group the assets identified in paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii) of this section (Step 2) according to the source and 
the type of income that they generate, have generated, or may 
reasonably be expected to generate by applying the principles of 
 1.861-9T(g)(3) or its successor regulation (relating to 
characterization of assets for purposes of interest expense 
allocation). If a purpose for a taxpayer's business practices is 
to manipulate asset characterization or groupings, the district 
director may allocate or apportion DASTM gain or loss 
attributable to the assets. Thus, if a taxpayer that previously 
did not separately state interest on accounts receivable begins 
to impose an interest charge and a purpose for the change was to 
manipulate tax characterizations or groupings, then the district 
director may require that none of the DASTM gain or loss 
attributable to those receivables be allocated or apportioned to 
interest income.

(iv) 

Step 4_determine DASTM gain or loss attributable to 
certain assets_

(A) 

General rule. 

The taxpayer shall determine 
the dollar amount of DASTM gain or loss attributable to assets in 
each group identified in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section 
(Step 3) as follows: 


[(bb+eb)
2] x [er^br]




where

 


bb = the hyperinflationary currency adjusted basis of 
the assets in the group at the beginning of the balance 
sheet period. 

eb = the hyperinflationary currency adjusted basis of 
the assets in the group at the end of the balance sheet 
period. 

er = one dollar divided by the number of 
hyperinflationary currency units that equal one dollar at 
the end of the balance sheet period. 
br = one dollar divided by the number of hyperinflationary 
currency units that equal one dollar at the beginning 
of the balance sheet period. 


(B) 

Weighting to prevent distortion. 

If averaging the 
adjusted basis of assets in a group at the beginning and end of a 
balance sheet period results in an allocation of DASTM gain or 
loss that does not clearly reflect income, as might be the case 
in the event of a purchase or disposition of an asset that is not 
in the normal course of business, the taxpayer must use a 
weighting method that reflects the time the assets are held by 
the QBU during the translation period. 
(C) 

Example. 

The provisions of this paragraph 
(e)(3)(iv) are illustrated by the following example:

 



Example. 

S is a foreign corporation that operates in the 
hyperinflationary currency ``h'' and computes its income or loss or 
earnings and profits under DASTM. S's adjusted basis in a group 
of assets described in section 988(c)(1)(B) or (C) that generate 
general limitation foreign source income (as characterized under 
paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section) at the beginning of the 
balance sheet period is 750,000h. S's basis in such assets at 
the end of the balance sheet period is 1,250,000h. The exchange 
rate at the beginning of the balance sheet period is $1 = 200h. 
The exchange rate at the end of the balance sheet period is $1 = 
500h. The DASTM loss attributable to the assets described above 
is $3,000, determined as follows:

 

[(750,000h+1,250,000h)
2] x  [($1
500h)^($1
200h)]=($3000) 


(v) 

Step 5_adjust dollar gross income by DASTM gain or 
loss from assets. 

The taxpayer shall adjust the dollar amount of 
the QBU's gross income (computed under paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(3) of this section) generated by each group of assets 
characterized in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section (Step 3) 
by the amount of DASTM gain or loss attributable to those assets 
computed under paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section (Step 4). 
Thus, if a group of assets, such as accounts receivable, 
generates both a category of income described in section 
904(d)(1)(I) (relating to general limitation income) that is not 
foreign base company income as defined in section 954 and a DASTM 
loss under paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section (Step 4), the 
amount of the DASTM loss would reduce the amount of the QBU's 
gross income in that category. Similarly, if a group of assets, 
such as short-term bank deposits, generates both foreign personal 
holding company income that is passive income (described in 
sections 954(c)(1)(A) and 904(d)(1)(A)) and a DASTM loss under 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section (Step 4), the amount of the 
DASTM loss would reduce the amount of the QBU's foreign personal 
holding company income and passive income. See section 904(f) 
and the regulations thereunder in the case where that section 
would apply and DASTM loss attributable to a group of assets 
exceeds the income generated by such assets. 
(vi) 

Step 6_determine DASTM gain or loss attributable to 
liabilities

_(A) 

General rule. 

The taxpayer shall determine the 
dollar amount of DASTM gain or loss attributable to liabilities 
identified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section (Step 2), and 
described in paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(B) of this section as follows:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940725-0-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940725-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

[(bl+el)
2] x [br^er]

 

where

 

bl = the hyperinflationary currency amount of liabilities at 
the beginning of the balance sheet period. 

el = the hyperinflationary currency amount of liabilities at 
the end of the balance sheet translation period. 
br = one dollar divided by the number of hyperinflationary 
currency units that equal one dollar at the beginning 
of the balance sheet period. 
er = one dollar divided by the number of hyperinflationary 
currency units that equal one dollar at the end of the 
balance sheet period. 


(B) 

Separate calculation. 

The calculation shall be made 
separately for interest-bearing liabilities described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(vii) of this section (Step 7) and for each of 
the classes of non-interest-bearing liabilities described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(viii) of this section (Step 8). 
(C) 

Weighting to prevent distortion. 

Where a distortion 
would result from averaging the amount of liabilities at the 
beginning and end of a balance sheet period, as might be the case 
where a taxpayer incurs or retires a substantial liability, the 
taxpayer must use a different method that more clearly reflects 
the average amount of liabilities weighted to reflect the time 
the liability was outstanding during the balance sheet period. 
(vii)

 Step 7_adjust dollar income and expense by DASTM gain 
or loss from interest-bearing liabilities

_(A) 

In general. 

The 
taxpayer shall apply the amount of DASTM gain on interest-bearing 
liabilities computed under paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section 
(Step 6) to reduce interest expense generated by such liabilities 
(

e.g., 

prior to the application of  1.861-9T or its successor 
regulation). To the extent DASTM gain on such liabilities 
exceeds interest expense, it shall be sourced or otherwise 
classified in the same manner that interest expense is allocated 
and apportioned under  1.861-9T or its successor regulation. The 
amount of DASTM loss on interest-bearing liabilities computed 
under paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section (Step 6) shall be 
allocated and apportioned in the same manner that interest 
expense is allocated and apportioned under  1.861-9T or its 
successor regulation (without regard to the exceptions to 
fungibility in  1.861-10T or its successor regulation). For 
purposes of this section, an interest-bearing liability is a 
liability that requires payment of periodic interest (whether 
fixed or variable), has original issue discount, or would have 
interest imputed under subtitle A. 
(B) 

Allocation of DASTM gain or loss from interest-bearing 
liabilities that generate related person interest expense. 

DASTM 
gain or loss from interest-bearing liabilities that generate 
related person interest expense (as provided in section 
954(b)(5)) shall be allocated for purposes of subtitle A 
(including sections 904 and 952) in the same manner that the 
related person interest expense of that debt is required to be 
allocated under the rules of section 954(b)(5) and  1.904-5(c)(2). 
(C) 

Modified gross income method. 

In applying the modified 
gross income method described in  1.861-9T(j) or its successor 
regulation, gross income shall be adjusted for any DASTM gain or 
loss from assets as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this 
section (Step 5) and any DASTM gain or loss with respect to 
short-term, non-interest-bearing trade payables as provided in 
paragraph (e)(3)(viii)(A) of this section.

Short-term, non-interest-bearing trade payables. 

The taxpayer shall 
allocate DASTM gain or loss on short-term non-interest-bearing 
trade payables for purposes of subtitle A (including sections 904 
and 952) to the same category or type of gross income as the cost 
or expense to which the trade payable relates. For this purpose, 
a short-term, non-interest-bearing trade payable is a non-interest-bearing liability with a term of 183 days or
less that 
is incurred to purchase property or services to be used by the 
obligor in an active trade or business.

Provision of Early Intervention Services to Eligible Infants and Toddlers With Disabilities and Their Families,
and Special Education and Related Services to Children With Disabilities Within the Section 6 School Arrangements



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Office of the Secretary, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

Guidance is required for the Department of Defense (DoD) Section 6 School Arrangements and the Military Services
pursuant to Section 6 of the Impact Aid Law of 1950, as amended (20 U.S.C. 241), as amended by Pub. L. 102-119, ``Individuals
with Disabilities Act (IDEA) Amendments of 1991.'' By statute, DoD must provide all substantive rights, protections
and procedural safeguards, including due process procedures of IDEA, in the DoD Section 6 School Arrangements. This
final rule provides guidance outlining the procedures for the provision of early intervention services for eligible
children with disabilities ages birth to 2 (inclusive) and a free appropriate education and related services, for
children with disabilities ages 3 to 21 (inclusive) enrolled in the DoD Section 6 School Arrangements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On October 6, 1993, 58 FR 51996, the Office of the Secretary of Defense published an interim final rule (32 CFR part 80)
that implemented the IDEA, as amended, in the Section 6 Schools and for eligible infants and toddlers. Today's final
action, except for administrative amendments for clarity, does not differ from the interim final rule. This final
rule reflects the change of the title of the Department of Defense organization formerly known as the Directorate
for Industrial Security Clearance Review (DISCR). This organization is now named the Defense Office of Hearings
and Appeals (DOHA).



Comments



Two comments were received from the public on the interim final rule.

1. 

Comment: 

State reason for release of records and set a time limit-usually six months from the date of signature that the release
is signed.



Reply: 

The reason for release of records will be apparent in each case. Therefore, this recommendation has not been accepted.
The final rule requires that the student activity for which the parental consent is being sought be specified. This
necessarily involves stating the reason for parental consent. Because the final rule further provides that parental
consent may be revoked at any time, a fixed time of expiration for that consent is unnecessary.

2. 

Comment: 

Why can't standardized test be used as part of the evaluation?



Reply: 

The final rule does not preclude the use of standardized tests. Under  80.3(n), ``basic tests'' do not qualify
as acceptable evaluative instruments. Standardized tests, however, are not included in the category of ``basic
tests.''



Rulemaking Analyses



Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review''



It has been determined that 32 CFR part 80 is not a significant regulation action. This final rule does not:

(1) Have an annual effect of the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal
governments or communities;

(2) Cause a serious inconsistency or other wise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in this Executive Order.



Public Law 96-354, ``Regulatory Flexibility Act''



It has been determined that this final rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because
it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary financial effect
of the final rule will be a reduction in administrative costs and other burdens resulting from the simplification
and clarification of policies.



Public Law 96-511, ``Paperwork Reduction Act''



It has been determined that 32 CFR part 80 does not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).

This final rule is issued to provide guidance, required by statute, with respect to (1) the implementation of the IDEA,
as amended, in the DoD Section 6 Schools and (2) the provision of early intervention services to infants and toddlers
who, but for their age, would be entitled to enroll in such Section 6 Schools. Section 6 School Arrangements are conducted
by DoD pursuant to section 6 of Pub. L. 81-874, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 241, and Section 505(c) of Pub. L. 97-31,
20 U.S.C. 241 note.



List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 80



Education of individuals with disabilities, Individuals with disabilities, Infants and children.




Accordingly, title 32, chapter I, subchapter C, is amended to revise part 80 to read as follows:

 80.2

Applicability and scope.


This part:
(a) Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and the Joint Staff, the Unified and Specified Commands, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense,
the Defense Agencies, and the DoD Field Agencies (hereafter referred to collectively as ``the DoD Components'').

Puerto Rico, Wake Island, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands.


 80.3

Definitions.


(a) 

Assistive technology device

. Any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially or off the shelf, modified, or customized,
that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.
(b) 

Assistive technology service

. Any service that directly assists an individual with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive
technology device. This term includes:
(1) Evaluating the needs of an individual with a disability, including a functional evaluation of the individual
in the individual's customary environment.
(2) Purchasing, leasing, or otherwise providing for the acquisition of assistive technology devices by individuals
with disabilities.
(3) Selecting designing, fitting, customizing, adapting, applying, maintaining, repairing, or replacing of assistive
technology devices.
(4) Coordinating and using other therapies, interventions, or services with assistive technology devices, such
as those associated with existing educational and rehabilitative plans and programs.

(5) Training or technical assistance for an individual with disabilities, or, where appropriate, the family of an
individual with disabilities.
(6) Training or technical assistance for professionals (including individuals providing educational rehabilitative
services), employers, or other individuals who provide services to, employ, or are otherwise substantially involved
in the major life functions of an individual with a disability.
(c) 

Attention deficit disorder (ADD). 

As used to define students, encompasses attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and attention deficit disorder
without hyperactivity. The essential features of this disorder are developmentally inappropriate degrees of inattention,
impulsiveness, and hyperactivity.
(1) A diagnosis of ADD may be made only after the child is evaluated by appropriate medical personnel, and evaluation
procedures set forth in this part (appendix B to this part) are followed.
(2) A diagnosis of ADD, in and of itself, does not mean that a child requires special education; it is possible that a
child diagnosed with ADD, as the only finding, can have his or her educational needs met within the regular education
setting.
(3) For a child with ADD to be eligible for special education, the Case Study Committee, with assistance from the medical
personnel conducting the evaluation, must then make a determination that the ADD is a chronic or acute health problem
that results in limited alertness, which adversely affects educational performance. Children with ADD who are eligible
for special education and medically related services will qualify for services under ``Other Health Impaired''
as described in Criterion A, paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
(d) 

Autism. 

A developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and non-verbal communication and social interaction
generally evident before age 3 that adversely affects educational performance. Characteristics of autism include
irregularities and impairments in communication, engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements,
resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The
term does not include children with characteristics of the disability of serious emotional disturbance.
(e) 

Case Study Committee (CSC). 

A school-based committee that determines a child's eligibility for special education, develops and reviews a child's
individualized education program (IEP), and determines appropriate placement in the least restrictive environment.
A CSC is uniquely composed for each child. Participants on a CSC must include:
(1) The designated representative of the Section 6 School Arrangement, who is qualified to supervise the provision
of special education. Such representative may not be the child's special education teacher.
(2) One, or more, of the child's regular education teachers, if appropriate.
(3) A special education teacher.
(4) One, or both, of the child's parents.
(5) The child, if appropriate.
(6) A member of the evaluation team or another person knowledgeable about the evaluation procedures used with the
child.
(7) Other individuals, at the discretion of the parent or the Section 6 School Arrangement, who may have pertinent
information.
(f) 

Child-find. 

The ongoing process used by the Military Services and a Section 6 School Arrangement to seek and identify children
(from birth to 21 years of age) who show indications that they might be in need of early intervention services or special
education and related services. Child-find activities include the dissemination of information to the public and
identification, screening, and referral procedures.
(g) 

Children with disabilities ages 5-21 (inclusive). 

Those children ages 5-21 years (inclusive), evaluated in accordance with this part, who are in need of special
education as determined by a CSC and who have not been graduated from a high school or who have not completed the requirements
for a General Education Diploma. The terms ``child'' and ``student'' may also be used to refer to this population.
The student must be determined eligible under one of the following four categories:
(1) 

Criterion A. 

The educational performance of the student is adversely affected, as determined by the CSC, by a physical impairment;
visual impairment including blindness; hearing impairment including deafness; orthopedic impairment; or other
health impairment, including ADD, when the condition is a chronic or acute health problem that results in limited
alertness; autism; and traumatic brain injury requiring environmental and/or academic modifications.

(2) 

Criterion B.

 A student who manifests a psychoemotional condition that is the primary cause of educational difficulties; a student
who exhibits maladaptive behavior to a marked degree and over a long period of time that interferes with skill attainment,
classroom functioning or performance, social-emotional condition, and who as a result requires special education.
The term does not usually include a student whose difficulties are primarily the result of:

(i) Intellectual deficit;
(ii) Sensory or physical impairment;
(iii) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;
(iv) Antisocial behavior;
(v) Parent-child or family problems;
(vi) Disruptive behavior disorders;
(vii) Adjustment disorders;
(viii) Interpersonal or life circumstance problems; or 
(ix) Other problems that are not the result of a severe emotional disorder.

(3) 

Criterion C.

 The educational performance of the student is adversely affected, as determined by the CSC, by a speech and/or language
impairment.

(4) 

Criterion D.

 The measured academic achievement of the student in math, reading, or language is determined by the CSC to be adversely
affected by underlying disabilities (including mental retardation and specific learning disability) including
either an intellectual deficit or an information processing deficit.

(5) 

Criterion E.

 A child, 0-5 inclusive, whose functioning level as determined by the CSC, is developmentally delayed and would
qualify for special education and related services as determined by this regulation.

(h) 

Consent.

 This term means that:

(1) The parent of an infant, toddler, child, or preschool child with a disability has been fully informed, in his or
her native language, or in another mode of communication, of all information relevant to the activity for which permission
is sought.

(2) The parent understands and agrees in writing to the implementation of the activity for which his or her permission
is sought. The writing must describe that activity, list the child's records that will be released and to whom, and
acknowledge that the parent understands consent is voluntary and may be prospectively revoked at any time.

(3) The parent of an infant, toddler, preschool child or child must consent to the release of records. The request for
permission must describe that activity, list each individual's records that will be released and to whom, and acknowledge
that the parent understands that consent is voluntary and may be prospectively revoked at any time.

(4) The written consent of a parent of an infant or toddler with a disability is necessary for implementation of early
intervention services described in the individualized family service plan (IFSP). If such parent does not provide
consent with respect to a particular early intervention service, then the early intervention services for which
consent is obtained shall be provided.

(i) 

Deaf.

 A hearing loss or deficit so severe that the child is impaired in processing linguistic information through hearing,
with or without amplification, to the extent that his or her educational performance is adversely affected.

(j) 

Deaf-blind.

 Concomitant hearing and visual impairments, the combination of which causes such severe communication and other
developmental and educational problems that they cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely for
children with deafness or children with blindness.

D. Placement Procedures and Least Restrictive Environment



1. The placement of a preschool child or child in any special education program by the Section 6 School Arrangement
shall be made only under an IEP and after a determination has been made that such student has a disability and needs special
education and/or related services.

2. The Section 6 School Arrangement CSC shall identify the special education and related services to be provided under
the IEP.

3. A placement decision may not be implemented without the consent of a parent of the preschool child or child, except
as otherwise provided in accordance with this part.

4. The placement decision must be designed to educate a preschool child or child with a disability in the least restrictive
environment so that such student is educated to the maximum extent appropriate with students who do not have disabilities.
Special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of preschool children or children with disabilities from
the regular educational environment shall occur only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that the
preschool child or child with disabilities cannot be educated satisfactorily in the regular classes with the use
of supplementary aids and services, including related services.

5. Each educational placement for a preschool child or child with a disability shall be:

a. Determined at least annually by the appropriate CSC.

b. Based on the preschool child or child's IEP.

c. Located as close as possible to the residence of the parent who is sponsoring the preschool child or child for attendance
in a Section 6 School Arrangement.

with a disability, unless the IEP requires some other arrangement.

e. Predicated on the consideration of all factors affecting the preschool child's or child's well-being, including
the effects of separation from parent(s).

f. To the maximum extent appropriate, designed so that the preschool child or child participates in school activities,
including meals and recess periods, with students who do not have a disability.



E. Children With Disabilities Placed in Non-Section 6 School Arrangements



1. Before a Section 6 School Arrangement CSC, with the concurrence of the Section 6 School Arrangement Superintendent
concerned, places a preschool child or child with a disability in a non-Section 6 School or facility, the Section 6
School CSC shall conduct a meeting in accordance with this part to initiate the development of an IEP for such student.

2. Preschool children and children with disabilities eligible to receive instruction in Section 6 School Arrangements
who are referred to another school or facility by the Section 6 School CSC have all the rights of students with disabilities
who are attending the Section 6 School Arrangement.

a. If a Section 6 School Arrangement CSC places a preschool child or child with a disability in a non-Section 6 School
Arrangement or facility as a means of providing special education and related services, the program of that facility,
including nonmedical care, room, and board, as set forth in the student's IEP, must be at no cost to the student or the
student's parents.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940725-0-00065 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940725-0-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. A Section 6 School Arrangement CSC may place a preschool child or child with a disability in a non-Section 6 School
Arrangement or facility only if required by an IEP. An IEP for a student placed in a non-Section 6 School is not valid
until signed by the Section 6 School Arrangement Superintendent, or designee, who must have participated in the IEP
meeting. The IEP shall include determinations that:
(1) The Section 6 School Arrangement does not currently have, and cannot reasonably create, an educational program
appropriate to meet the needs of the student with a disability.
(2) The non-Section 6 School Arrangement or facility and its educational program conform to this part.
3. A Section 6 School Arrangement is not responsible for the cost of a non-Section 6 School Arrangement placement when
placement is made unilaterally, without the approval of the cognizant CSC and the Superintendent, unless it is directed
by a hearing officer under appendix C of this part or a court of competent jurisdiction.


F. Procedural Safeguards


1. Parents shall be given written notice before the Section 6 School Arrangement CSC proposes to initiate or change,
or refuses to initiate or change, either the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a preschool
child or child receiving, or entitled to receive, special education and related services from a Section 6 School Arrangement,
or the provision of a free appropriate public education by the Section 6 School Arrangement to the child. The notice
shall fully inform a parent of the procedural rights conferred by this part and shall be given in the parent's native
language, unless it clearly is not feasible to do so.
2. The consent of a parent of a preschool child or child with a disability or suspected of having a disability shall be
obtained before any:
a. Initiation of formal evaluation procedures;
b. Initial special educational placement; or
c. Change in educational placement.
3. If a parent refuses consent to any formal evaluation or initial placement in a special education program, the Section
6 School Arrangement Superintendent may initiate an impartial due process hearing, as provided in appendix C of this
part to show why an evaluation or placement in a special education program should occur without such consent. If the
hearing officer sustains the Section 6 School Arrangement CSC position in the impartial due process hearing, the
appropriate CSC may evaluate or provide special education and related services to the preschool child or child without
the consent of a parent, subject to the parent's due process rights.
4. A parent is entitled to an independent evaluation of his or her preschool child or child at the Section 6 School Arrangement's
expense, if the parent disagrees with the findings of an evaluation of the student conducted by the school and the parent
successfully challenges the evaluation in an impartial due process hearing.
a. If an independent evaluation is provided at the expense of a Section 6 School Arrangement, it must meet the following
criteria:
(1) Conform to the requirements of this part.
(2) Be conducted, when possible, within the area where the preschool child or child resides.
(3) Meet applicable DoD standards governing persons qualified to conduct an evaluation.

<PARENT> FR940725-0-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. If the final decision rendered in an impartial due process hearing sustains the evaluation of the Section 6 School
Arrangement CSC, the parent has the right to an independent evaluation, but not at the expense of the Department of
Defense or any DoD Component.

5. The parents of a preschool child or child with a disability shall be afforded an opportunity to inspect and review
all relevant educational records concerning the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of such
student, and the provision of a free appropriate public education to him or her.

6. Upon complaint presented in a written petition, the parent of a preschool child or child with a disability or the
Section 6 School System shall have the opportunity for an impartial due process hearing provided by the Department
of Defense as prescribed by appendix C of this part.

7. During the pendency of any impartial due process hearing or judicial proceeding on the identification, evaluation,
or educational placement of a preschool child or child with a disability receiving an education from a Section 6 School
Arrangement or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such a student, unless the Section 6 School
Arrangement and a parent of the student agree otherwise, the student shall remain in his or her present educational
placement, subject to the disciplinary procedures prescribed in this part.

8. If a preschool child or child with a disability, without a current IEP, who is entitled to receive educational instruction
from a Section 6 School Arrangement is applying for initial admission to a Section 6 School Arrangement, that student
shall enter that Arrangement on the same basis as a student without a disability.

9. The parent of a preschool child or child with a disability or a Section 6 School Arrangement employee may file a written
communication with the Section 6 School Arrangement Superintendent about possible general violations of this part
or Pub. L. 101-476, as amended. Such communications will not be treated as complaints under appendix C of this
part.



G. Disciplinary Procedures



1. All regular disciplinary rules and procedures applicable to students receiving educational instruction in the
Section 6 School Arrangements shall apply to preschool children and children with disabilities who violate school
rules and regulations or disrupt regular classroom activities, subject to the provisions of this section.

2. The appropriate CSC shall determine whether the conduct of a preschool child or child with a disability is the result
of that disability before the long-term suspension (10 consecutive or cumulative days during the school year) or
the expulsion of that student.

3. If the CSC determines that the conduct of such a preschool child or child with a disability results in whole or part
from his or her disability, that student may not be subject to any regular disciplinary rules and procedures; and

a. The student's parent shall be notified in accordance with this part of the right to have an IEP meeting before any
change in the student's special education placement. (A termination of the student's education for more than 10 days,
either cumulative or consecutive, constitutes a change of placement.)

b. The Section 6 School Arrangement CSC or another authorized school official shall ensure that an IEP meeting is held
to determine the appropriate educational placement for the student in consideration of his or her conduct before
the tenth cumulative day of the student's suspension or an expulsion.

4. A preschool child or child with a disability shall neither be suspended for more than 10 days nor expelled, and his
or her educational placement shall not otherwise be changed for disciplinary reasons, unless in accordance with
this section, except that:

a. This section shall be applicable only to preschool children and children determined to have a disability under
this part.

b. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the emergency suspension of any preschool child or child with a disability
who endangers or reasonable appears to endanger the health, welfare, or safety of himself or herself, or any other
student, teacher, or school personnel, provided that:

(1) The appropriate Section 6 School Arrangement CSC shall immediately meet to determine whether the preschool child's
or child's conduct results from his or her disability and what change in special education placement is appropriate
for that student.

(2) The child's parent(s) shall be notified immediately of the student's suspension and of the time, purpose, and
location of the CSC meeting and their right to attend the meeting.

(3) A component is included in the IEP that addresses the behavioral needs of the student.

Appendix C to Part 80_Hearing Procedures


A. Purpose


This appendix establishes adjudicative requirements whereby the parents of infants, toddlers, preschool children,
and children who are covered by this part and, as the case may be, the cognizant Military Department or Section 6 School
System are afforded impartial due process hearings and administrative appeals on the early intervention services
or identification, evaluation, and educational placement of, and the free appropriate public education provided
to, such children by the Department of Defense, in accordance with Pub. L. 101-476, as amended, 20 U.S.C. sec.
1401 et seq.; Pub. L. 81-874, sec. 6, as amended, 20 U.S.C. sec. 241; Pub. L. 97-35, sec. 505(c), 20 U.S.C.
sec. 241 note; and Pub. L. 102-119, sec. 23, 20 U.S.C. sec. 241(a).


B. Administration


1. The Directorate for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) shall have administrative responsibility
for the proceedings authorized by this appendix.
2. This appendix shall be administered to ensure that the findings, judgments, and determinations made are prompt,
fair, and impartial.
3. Impartial hearing officers, who shall be DOHA Administrative Judges, shall be appointed by the Director, DOHA,
and shall be attorneys who are independent of the Section 6 School System or the Military Department concerned in proceedings
conducted under this appendix. A parent shall have the right to be represented in such proceedings, at no cost to the
government, by counsel and by persons with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of individuals
with disabilities. DOHA Department Counsel normally shall appear and represent the Section 6 School System in proceedings
conducted under this appendix, when such proceedings involve a preschool child or child. When an infant or toddler
is involved, the Military Department responsible under this part for delivering early intervention services shall
either provide its own counsel or request counsel from DOHA.


C. Mediation


1. Mediation can be initiated by either a parent or, as appropriate, the Military Department concerned or the Section
6 School System to resolve informally a disagreement on the early intervention services for an infant or toddler or
the identification, evaluation, educational placement of, or the free appropriate public education provided to,
a preschool child or child. The cognizant Military Department, rather than the Section 6 School System, shall participate
in mediation involving early intervention services. Mediation shall consist of, but not be limited to, an informal
discussion of the differences between the parties in an effort to resolve those differences. The parents and the appropriate
school or Military Department officials may attend mediation sessions.
2. Mediation must be conducted, attempted, or refused in writing by a parent of the infant, toddler, preschool child
or child whose early intervention or special education services (including related services) are at issue before
a request for, or initiation of, a hearing authorized by this appendix. Any request by the Section 6 School System or
Military Department for a hearing under this appendix shall state how this requirement has been satisfied. No stigma
may be attached to the refusal of a parent to mediate or to an unsuccessful attempt to mediate.

Special Local Regulation; Venetian Festival Yacht Parade, Round Lake, Charlevoix, MI



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A special local regulation is being adopted for the marine event, Venetian Festival Yacht Parade. This event will
be held on Round Lake, Charlevoix, MI on July 23, 1994. The Venetian Festival Yacht Parade will have an estimated 25
power and sailboats, parading in a closed course on Round Lake which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This
regulation is needed to provide for the safety of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during the event.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth
Coast Guard District until June 3, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in advance
of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.



Drafting Information




The drafters of this regulation are Scott J. Smith, Lieutenant Junior Grade, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Officer, Aids
to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch and Karen E. Lloyd, Lieutenant, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Attorney,
Ninth Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Discussion of Regulation



The Venetian Festival Yacht Parade will be held on Round Lake, Charlevoix, MI, on July 23, 1994. This regulation restricts
general navigation on Round Lake and the upper and lower portions of the Pine River. This event will have an estimated
25 power and sailboats, parading in a closed course on Round Lake which could pose hazards to navigation in the area.
This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection of life, limb, and property during this event. Any vessel desiring
to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast
Guard Station Charlevoix, MI).

This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1225 and 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165.



Federalism



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c
of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.



Economic Assessment and Certification



This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.



Collection of Information



This regulation will impose no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq.

Exclusions From Income (Tribal Trust Land Income)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning income exclusions.
The purpose of the rule is to implement recent legislation excluding from countable income under federal programs
up to $2,000 per year of income received by an American Indian beneficiary from trust or restricted lands.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

VA administers several income-based benefit programs under which a claimant's countable income determines the
rate of VA benefits payable. 38 CFR 3.271 states that payments of any kind from any source shall be counted as income
for purposes of the Improved Pension program unless specifically excluded under  3.272. 38 CFR 3.261(a)(1)
states that total income from business, investment, and rents is countable income for purposes of the Parents' Dependency
and Indemnity Compensation program and prior pension programs.



In Precedent Opinion 76-90 dated July 18, 1990, the VA General Counsel held that although Indian trust lands
were an excludable resource for purposes of net worth determinations, rental income from these lands received by
beneficiaries of VA's income-based benefit programs is considered income for VA purposes.

Section 13736 of Public Law 103-66 amended 25 U.S.C. 1408 to provide that up to $2,000 per year of income received
from trust or restricted lands shall be excluded from the income of individual Indians when determining eligibility
for assistance from any Federal program.

25 CFR 151.2(d) defines ``trust land'' as land the title to which is held in trust by the United States for an individual
Indian or a tribe. 25 CFR 151.2(e) defines ``restricted land'' as land the title to which is held by an individual Indian
or a tribe and which can only be alienated or encumbered by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.

We are amending 38 CFR 3.261, 3.262, and 3.272 to show that up to $2,000 per year of income from trust or restricted lands
is excludable from the countable income of an individual Indian. The purpose of this rule is to amend the regulations
to be consistent with the provisions of Section 13736 of Public Law 103-66.

A notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary because this amendment simply corresponds to the provisions of section
13736 of Public Law 103-66. Since a notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and will not be published, this
amendment is not a ``rule'' as defined in and made subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601(2).
In any case, this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities as they are defined in the RFA, 5 U.S.C. sections 601-612. This amendment will not directly affect any
small entity.

The catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.104 and 64.105.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; West Virginia: Limited Approval and Disapproval
of PM-10 Implementation Plan for the Follansbee Area



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is taking simultaneous limited approval and limited disapproval action on a State Implementation Plan (SIP)
revision submitted by the State of West Virginia. West Virginia submitted the plan revisions in order to achieve the
national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or
equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM-10) and to fulfill other Clean Air Act (Act) requirements for the Follansbee,
West Virginia area. The limited approval makes bilateral consent orders between the West Virginia Office of Air Quality
and six companies federally enforceable and fulfills some of the requirements of the Act applicable to the Follansbee
area. The limited disapproval disapproves West Virginia's submittal for the purpose of fulfilling its requirements
under sections 172 and 189 of the Act to demonstrate that the SIP will provide for the attainment of the NAAQS. These
actions are being taken under section 110 of the Act in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt
regulations necessary to further air quality improvement by strengthening the SIP.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The air quality planning requirements for PM-10 nonattainment areas, such as the Follansbee area, are set out
in subparts 1 and 4 of Title I of the Act. Among other requirements, the Act requires that SIPs provide for reasonably
available control measures (RACM) including reasonably available control technology (RACT), emissions inventories,
and demonstrations (including air quality modeling) that the SIP will provide for attainment of the NAAQS by the statutory
attainment date.



On January 7, 1994 (59 FR 988), EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that proposed limited approval
and limited disapproval West Virginia's November 15, 1991 PM-10 SIP submittal for the Follansbee, West Virginia
PM-10 nonattainment area. The submittal is not fully approvable because it does not demonstrate attainment
of NAAQS, and, therefore, does not satisfy the requirements of section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act. Specifically,
the modeling is unapprovable as a demonstration of attainment because of deficiencies in estimating emissions from
coke oven batteries and other sources, the lack of an approvable analysis of intermediate terrain, and the nonguideline
use of the Gaussian Plume Multiple Source Air Quality Algorithm (RAM) dispersion model in a meteorologically rural
area.

While the submittal does not meet specific provisions of Part D, it does contain some provisions (enforceable consent
orders) which advance the NAAQS-related air quality protection goals of the Act. Therefore, EPA is approving the
submittal for the limited purpose of approving the consent agreements and making them part of the SIP. EPA has evaluated
the consent agreements for consistency with the Act and EPA regulations and has found that they provide State and federally
enforceable provisions to decrease PM-10 emissions in the nonattainment area.

While approving the consent orders for incorporation by reference into the SIP, EPA is taking no action at this time
on the contingency measures contained therein with respect to the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. The
General Preamble to Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments established a November 15, 1993 deadline for state submittal
of contingency plans (57 FR 13498).

In addition to the limited approval and limited disapproval, EPA proposed to determine that PM-10 precursors,
such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds, do not contribute significantly to PM-10
concentrations in the Follansbee area. (See section 189(e).) EPA based this proposal an air quality data presented
by West Virginia in its submittal.

The rationale for today's action is presented in more detail in the NPR and in the Technical Support Document (TSD)
which is available at the addresses indicated above.



Summary of Public Comments



EPA received two letters of comment; comments were submitted by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection
and by the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation (WPS).

1. In correspondence dated February 4, 1994, West Virginia described its ``planned action'' to correct the deficiencies
in its submittal. West Virginia stated its intent to correct PM-10 emission rates, perform an analysis of intermediate
terrain, and replace RAM with an approvable technique for modeling certain area sources under rural meteorological
conditions. Additionally, West Virginia also related its intent to alter the characterizations of certain buoyant
volume sources.

EPA Response 

West Virginia did not comment on EPA's proposed action or its underlying rationale, so no response is necessary. EPA
intends to provide technical guidance to West Virginia to assist in the submittal of a fully approvable SIP revision.

2. EPA received comments from WPS dated February 4, 1994. WPS commented on and disputed deficiencies identified by
EPA in the NPR. WPS also provided its own air quality analysis. WPS's comments are summarized and responses are provided
below. 


a. Coke Oven Emissions 




WPS Comment. 

WPS agrees that the coke oven emissions estimations are in error and provided revised estimates attributed to the
West Virginia Office of Air Quality. 


EPA Response. 

As described above, EPA intends to provide technical guidance to West Virginia to assist in the submittal of a fully
approvable SIP revision. 


b. Intermediate Terrain

1

 






WPS Comment. 

WPS comments that at the time of the West Virginia SIP submittal, there was no single, EPA-approved model applicable
to intermediate terrain; that its consultant had developed a post-processor to combine the results of simple and
complex terrain models; and that EPA had approved the use of this post-processor in two permit applications in West
Virginia in 1988. WPS continues to comment that its submittals to West Virginia and Ohio were consistent with EPA's
intermediate terrain policy, including, in 1991, an analysis employing a model that integrates simple and complex
terrain models. Finally, WPS comments that the deficiency relating to intermediate terrain is not identified in
EPA's August 3, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking for the Ohio PM-10 SIP (58 FR 41218). 


EPA Response.

 West Virginia's attainment demonstration did not address intermediate terrain as required by the Guideline on Air
Quality Models as revised in 1986 (EPA-450/2-78-027R)

2

 and clarified in 1989.

3

 WPS's comments do not dispute this fact. The consultant's post-processor and integrated model were two of several
approaches available at the time to implement EPA's intermediate terrain policy. (See, for example, EPA's widely
available post-processor, POSTIT). The development of these techniques by WPS or its consultant does not alter the
fact that no such analysis was included in the West Virginia SIP submittal. Therefore, this comment does not affect
today's action or its underlying rationale. 





As matter of clarification, EPA's August 3, 1993 notice for Ohio affected the regulation of PM-10 emissions
state-wide.

4

 Today's action applies only to the West Virginia SIP. Because of the broader scope of that notice, some issues that
were presented in the NPR for the Follansbee, West Virginia nonattainment area were relegated to the technical support
document

5

 in EPA's rulemaking on the Ohio SIP. The NPR for the Ohio SIP clearly referred interested readers to the TSD for further
information regarding EPA's underlying rationale for that notice, generally, and the deficiencies in Ohio's attainment
demonstration, specifically. That TSD clearly articulated EPA's concern over Ohio's lack of an intermediate terrain
analysis and other deficiencies in Ohio's November 4, 1991 and January 8, 1992 SIP submittals. 





c. The Use of RAM 




WPS Comment. 

WPS commented that the use of RAM was discussed with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) before the West
Virginia SIP was submitted. WPS also comments that this deficiency was not articulated in EPA's NPR for the Ohio PM-10
SIP referenced above (58 FR 41218).

EPA Response. 

Conversations between WPS and OEPA do not exempt or ameliorate the deficiencies in West Virginia submittal or invalidate
today's action or its underlying rationale. As noted above, EPA's notice regarding the Ohio SIP addressed this deficiency
through its technical support document. 




d. WPS's Air Quality Analysis 






WPS Comment. 

WPS supplied an alternative air quality analysis that concluded, ``Controls resulting in the PM-10 emissions
in Attachment 2 are shown to meet the NAAQS for PM-10 when naturally occurring buoyancy of several process fugitives
is included in the dispersion modeling.'' Attachment 2 lists the PM-10 emissions rates for model input. 




EPA Response. 

Setting aside the problem that this analysis was not submitted by the State of West Virginia and, therefore, does not
satisfy the requirement of section 189(a)(2), this analysis is not approvable as an attainment demonstration for
at least two reasons. 


First, the emissions estimations used as model input are flawed. While an attempt was made to correct the unapprovable
aspects of emissions from coke ovens, estimates of emissions from WPS's basic oxygen furnaces (BOF) in Mingo Junction,
Ohio remain profoundly underestimated. Deficiencies in BOF emissions estimation were outlined in the TSD and described
in more detail in EPA's notice and TSD regarding the Ohio SIP. 


Second, the buoyancy of emissions from certain large volume sources (coke oven battery fugitives, the BOF, and blast
furnace cast houses) was only incorporated in the estimation of impacts at receptors (locations) where a more conventional
methodology failed to show attainment. This approach is unapprovable because incorporation of buoyancy effects,
by design, will disturb the spatial distribution of estimated PM-10 impacts. Therefore, it is necessary to
model using a more extensive array of receptors than was employed in the WPS analysis. 

For these reasons, WPS's air quality analysis does not effect today's action or its underlying rationale. 




Final Action 




EPA is approving West Virginia's submittal for the limited purpose of incorporating the enforceable provisions
into the SIP and disapproving the submittal for the purpose of fulfilling the attainment demonstration requirements
of Part D of Title I of the Act. EPA is also formally finding that PM-10 precursors do not contribute significantly
to PM-10 concentrations exceeding the NAAQS in the Follansbee area (see section 189(e)).

6

 






This limited disapproval constitutes a disapproval under section 179(a)(2) of the Act (see generally 57 FR 13566-67).
As provided under section 179(a) of the Act, the State of West Virginia has up to 18 months after a final SIP disapproval
to correct the deficiencies that are the subject of the disapproval before EPA is required to impose either the highway
funding sanction or the requirement to provide two-to-one new source review offsets. If the State has not corrected
its deficiency within 6 months thereafter, EPA must impose the second sanction. Any sanction EPA imposes must remain
in place until EPA determines that the State has come into compliance. Note also that any final disapproval would trigger
the requirement for EPA to impose a federal implementation plan within 24 months as provided under section 110(c)(1)
of the Act.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The U.S. EPA has submitted a request
for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such
time as it rules on U.S. EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 



Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by September 23, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of the Follansbee, West Virginia PM-10 final rule does not affect the finality of this rule
for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed,
and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings
to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

 Implementation Plan and Oxygenated Gasoline Program for Colorado 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this action, EPA is finalizing two separate proposed actions: EPA is finalizing the limited approval of the control
measures which were contained in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Colorado
to achieve attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic
diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM

10

). EPA is approving these control measures for the limited purpose of strengthening the federally approved SIP for
Colorado. (At this time, EPA is not approving the control measures limiting the emissions from Purina Mills and Electron
Corporation. EPA will act on these measures at a later date.) The SIP revisions were submitted by Colorado to satisfy
certain federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP for Denver. Approval of these measures makes them federally enforceable. The EPA will take separate action, as
appropriate, on the revisions as a whole at a later date. EPA is also approving revisions to Regulation No. 13 (oxygenated
gasoline program) submitted on August 6, 1990, and November 27, 1992, implementing and amending oxygenated gasoline
programs in the Fort Collins-Loveland, Colorado Springs, and Boulder-Denver Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA)
as required by Section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act). This
action is being taken under Section 110 of the Clean Air Act. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



The Denver, Colorado area was designated nonattainment for PM

10

 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990.

1

 See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991); 40 CFR 81.306 (specifying PM

10

 nonattainment designation for the Denver metropolitan area). The air quality planning requirements for moderate
PM

10

 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act

2

. 






The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and
SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)).
Because EPA is describing it's interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble
for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this final action and the supporting rationale.


Those States containing initial moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas (

i.e.,

 those areas designated nonattainment for PM10 under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among
other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 

(1) Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM), (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993;

<DOCNO> FR940725-0-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940725-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;


(3) Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 

(4) Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM

10

 also apply to major stationary sources of PM

10

 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. 
Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified
major stationary sources of PM

10

 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 that
become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to
achieve RFP or to attain the PM

10

 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543-13544. 

On December 20, 1993 (at 58 FR 66326), EPA announced its intention to take two separate actions with two independent
public comment periods on the SIP revisions submitted by the State of Colorado to satisfy the moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP requirements due November 15, 1991 for the Denver PM

10

 nonattainment area. One proposed action was to grant conditional approval of the SIP revisions due to the State's
need to fulfill a final commitment to revise permit limitations at two stationary sources (Purina Mills, and Electron
Corporation) prior to December 1, 1993. EPA will take action on the conditional approval at a later date. The second
proposed action was to limitedly approve the control measures, excluding the permit limits for Purina Mills and Electron
Corporation, contained in the SIP revisions for the limited purpose of strengthening the federally enforceable
SIP for Colorado. In the proposed rulemaking actions and related Technical Support Document (TSD), EPA described
in detail its interpretations of the Act and its rationale for proposing to approve the control measures for their
limited purpose in strengthening the federally approved implementation plan for Denver, taking into consideration
the specific factual issues presented. 

EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal related to the limited approval (please reference 58
FR 66326). EPA received no comments during the public comment period regarding the proposed limited approval. This
final action on the limited approval of the control measures in the Denver moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP revisions is unchanged from the December 20, 1993, proposed approval action. 

The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred
to the December 20, 1993, proposed rule for a more in-depth discussion of the action now being finalized. 



II. Response to Comments 



EPA did not receive any public comments regarding its December 20, 1993, proposed limited approval of the Denver moderate
nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP control measures. (58 FR 66326-66334). 



III. This Action 



Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
The Governor of Colorado submitted the Denver PM

10

 SIP revision in a letter dated June 7, 1993. That submittal and subsequent submittals made on September 3, 1993, and
October 20, 1993, fulfilled commitments made on June 7, 1993, were intended to satisfy those moderate PM

10

 SIP requirements due for Denver on November 15, 1991. As described in EPA's proposed action on this SIP (58 FR 66326-66334,
December 20, 1993), the Denver June 7, 1993, moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 plan and subsequent submittals include control measures. EPA may grant a ``limited'' approval of SIP requirements
under section 110(k)(3) of the Act in light of the general authority delegated to EPA under section 301(a) of the Act
which allows EPA to take actions necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act. EPA is granting a final limited approval
of the referenced PM

10

 control measures for Denver because they strengthen the SIP by advancing the PM

10

 air quality protection goal of the Act. Federal approval of the control measures makes them federally-enforceable.
However, this limited approval is not approving those measures as satisfying the RACM requirement or any other specific
requirement of the Act, nor does it constitute full approval of the SIP pursuant to section 110(k)(3). Please refer
to EPA's notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 66326) and the TSD for that action for a more detailed discussion on control
measures contained in the Denver plan.

In this notice of final rulemaking action, EPA is announcing its approval of the control measures, excluding the permit
limits for Purina Mills and Electron Corporation, contained in the June 7, 1993 Denver PM

10

 SIP and subsequent submittals noted above for their limited purpose in strengthening the SIP. 
Four sources/source categories were identified as contributing to the PM

10

 nonattainment problem in Denver and, therefore, were targeted for control in the SIP revisions. Control measures
were developed for the following area sources: residential wood combustion, street sanding and sweeping of paved
streets, and mobile sources. In addition, controls reducing emissions from stationary sources were also developed.

EPA views the following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for PM

10

 emissions reductions in the Denver PM

10

 nonattainment area: (1) Colorado Regulation No. 4 which regulates residential wood burning; (2) Colorado Regulation
No. 16 which sets sanding and sweeping requirements; (3) the federal tailpipe standards, which provide an ongoing
benefit due to fleet turnover and Colorado Regulations 12 and 13 which were developed independently from the PM

10

 SIP but are included because of their particulate emission reduction benefit; and (4) Colorado Regulation No. 1,
which provides stationary source emission control regulations for particulates, smokes, carbon monoxide and sulfur
oxides. 
A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions and their associated control measures (including
available control technology) can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed approval of the Denver moderate
PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP (58 FR 66326). EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that the control measures
on which EPA is taking final action on today serve to strengthen the existing SIP by advancing the PM

10

 air quality protection goal of the Act. 
As noted, EPA is finalizing the control measures contained in Colorado's June 7, 1993 SIP submittal and subsequent
SIP submittals for the Denver PM

10

 nonattainment area, excluding the permit limits for Purina Mills and Electron Corporation which will be acted on
at a later date. This action is explained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 66326-66334) and associated
TSD. 


IV. Final Action_Limited Approval 


This document announces EPA's final action on the limited approval rulemaking proposed at 58 FR 66326. As noted elsewhere
in this action, EPA received no adverse public comments on the proposed action to approve the control measures for
their limited purpose in strengthening the existing SIP. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified
this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 


Regulation No. 13 


<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1513-1515), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking for the State of Colorado.

The notice proposed approval of an oxygenated gasoline program. 


The formal SIP revisions were submitted by the State of Colorado 
on August 6, 1990 and November 27, 1992. (The November 27, 1992 revision supersedes the August 6, 1990 submission.
EPA mentions the August 6, 1990 submittal as historical information. EPA is taking action on only the November 27,
1992 revision.) The revisions included amended versions of Colorado's Regulation 13. These regulatory changes
were adopted by the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission. A more detailed analysis of the state submittal was prepared
as part of the proposed action and is contained in a TSD dated September 25, 1993, which is available from the Region
VIII office listed in the Addresses section of this document. Other specific requirements of the oxygenated gasoline
program and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the proposed rulemaking and will not be restated
here. No public comments were received on the proposal.

I. Final Action_Regulation No. 13 


EPA is approving Colorado's Regulation No. 13; Oxygenated Gasoline Program as adopted September 17, 1992 by the Colorado
Air Quality Control Commission as part of the Air Quality Implementation Plan for State of Colorado. This Regulation
was submitted on November 27, 1992. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting 
or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request 
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP 
shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, 
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant 
statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by September 23, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review
nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2)). 


Executive Order (EO) 12866 


This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules
on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. General Background 


This final rule with comment period contains final regulations for the provision of Medicaid home and community-based
services under waivers granted under section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act (the Act), and for the provision of
respiratory care services as an optional benefit under the Medicaid program. 
Home and community-based services are those medical assistance services provided under a State waiver that are not
otherwise available under a State's Medicaid plan. These services: (1) must be furnished in accordance with an individually
written plan of care that is subject to approval by the State Medicaid agency; and (2) may be furnished only to persons
who, but for the provision of such services, would otherwise require the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing
facility (NF) (formerly referred to as a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or intermediate care facility (ICF)), or
intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (ICF/MR). (Under section 4211(a)(3) of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100-203, the distinction between SNFs and ICFs under the Medicaid
program ended, effective October 1, 1990. Both of these facilities are now categorized as NFs, as defined in section
1919(a) of the Act, effective October 1, 1990. We generally use the acronym ``NF'' throughout this rule unless we are
quoting directly from a statute or providing an historical reference. Medicaid recognizes two types of long-term
care facilities_NFs and ICFs/MR.) 
Respiratory care services as medical assistance may be provided as an option under the Medicaid program, as authorized
and described in sections 1902(e)(9) and 1905(a)(20) of the Act. 
On June 1, 1988, we published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 19950) proposing to revise the Medicaid regulations governing the provision of home and community-based services
under waivers and respiratory care services. This rule proposed to codify in regulations section 9502 of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), Public Law 99-272, enacted on April 7, 1986, and sections
9408, 9411, and 9435(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86), Public Law 99-509, enacted
on October 21, 1986. 
Four additional public laws have been passed that contain provisions that impact on the proposed rule. These laws
were enacted either immediately preceding or subsequent to the publication of the proposed rule. The public laws
are: 
 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100-203, enacted on December 22,
1987 (sections 4102 (b) and (c), 4118, and 4211); 
 The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100-360, enacted on July 1, 1988 (sections
411(k)(10)(A) and 411(k)(10)(H)); 
 The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TMRA), Public Law 100-647, enacted on November
10, 1988 (section 8437); and 
 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101-508, enacted on November 5,
1990 (sections 4741 and 4742). 
In this final rule with comment period, we are incorporating provisions of these public laws that relate to many of
the regulatory provisions in the June 1, 1988, proposed rule. We are inviting public comments on the revisions that
we have made to this proposed rule in response to these legislative changes. 
We have also revised the proposed regulations in response to public comments. We received, on a timely basis, 16 letters
from individuals, associations, State agencies, and providers of services (primarily home health agencies). While
most commenters supported the provisions in the proposed rule, the majority also expressed interest in expanding
the waiver program. Some commenters correctly noted that the proposed rule did not include statutory changes made
by OBRA '87, MCCA, and TMRA. 
Because we have made a substantial number of revisions to the proposed rule in response to legislative changes, we
have organized our discussion in this preamble by specific subject areas. We are using this organization to group
all of the additions and revisions to each subject in one place. We are presenting the legislative basis for the proposed
rule and any subsequent legislative provisions that changed or added to the provisions of the proposed rule. We are
following the legislative foundation with a discussion of the proposed regulations for that area, any public comments
we received, and our responses to the public comments. We conclude each topic with a description of the applicable
provisions contained in this final rule.

II. Home and Community-Based Services Waivers 


Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act authorizes the Secretary to waive certain Medicaid statutory requirements
to enable a State to cover a broad array of home and community-based services. Coverage of these services enables elderly,
disabled, and chronically ill persons, who would otherwise be institutionalized, to live in the community. Section
1915(c) specifies the services that may be covered, the conditions for granting waivers, and the provisions governing
the scope of services under waivers. Section 1915(c) was added to title XIX of the Act by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1981 (OBRA '81), Public Law 97-35, to encourage the provision of services to Medicaid recipients in noninstitutional
settings. Prior to the enactment of OBRA '81, the Medicaid program provided limited coverage for long-term care services
in noninstitutional settings. 
A State may request approval by HCFA of waivers under section 1915(c) to provide home and community-based services
that are not otherwise available to certain recipients under the State's Medicaid plan. These services must be furnished
in accordance with an individual written plan of care subject to approval by the State's Medicaid agency and may be
furnished only if the individual would otherwise require the level of care provided in a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR and
if the costs are reimbursable under the State's plan. (The original statute specified SNF or ICF. OBRA '87 struck out
SNF or ICF and substituted NF or ICF/MR.) 
Existing regulations governing home and community based services under waivers under section 1915(c) appear in
various sections of 42 CFR parts 435, 440, and 441. This final rule with comment period contains regulations which
amend each of these three parts. 


A. Expanded Habilitation Services 


1. Background 


Prior to the enactment of COBRA, a waiver granted under section 1915(c) of the Act allowed a State to receive Federal
financial participation (FFP) for the following services as home and community-based services: case management
services, homemaker/home health aide services, personal care services, adult day health services, habilitation
services, respite care, and ``other'' services as requested by the State and approved by the Secretary. Section 9502(a)
of COBRA revised section 1915(c) of the Act to explicitly include certain prevocational, supported employment,
and educational services as habilitation services under home and community-based services. 
Habilitation services are authorized by section 1915(b)(4) of the Act and defined in section 1915(c)(5)(A) of the
Act, as amended by section 9502 of COBRA, as services designed to assist individuals in acquiring, retaining, and
improving the self-help, socialization, and adaptive skills necessary to reside successfully in home and community-based
settings. Section 9502(a) of COBRA also added new sections 1915(c)(5) (B) and (C) to the Act that allow a State to request
HCFA's approval to include certain additional services previously excluded from coverage in its definition of ``habilitation
services'' for individuals who receive waiver services after discharge from a NF or ICF/MR. Sections 1915(c)(5)
(B) and (C) provide that habilitation services include prevocational, educational, and supported employment services,
but do not include_
 Special education and related services, as defined in section 602 (16) and (17) of the 1975 Amendments to the
Education of the Handicapped Act (Public Law 94-142, now located at 20 U.S.C. 1401 (16) and (17)), that are otherwise
available to the individual through a local educational agency; and

 Vocational rehabilitation services that are otherwise available to the individual through a program funded
under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 730). 
Section 9502(j)(1) of COBRA provides that section 9502(a) is effective for services furnished on or after April 7,
1986. Section 4118(j) of OBRA '87 amended section 9502(j)(1) of COBRA to provide that eligibility of previously institutionalized
individuals for the expanded habilitation services under a section 1915(c) waiver is determined without regard
to whether the individuals were receiving institutional services before their eligibility under the waiver. Section
1915(c)(5) as added by section 9502(a) of COBRA refers to habilitation services, ``* * * with respect
to individuals who receive such services after discharge from a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for
the mentally retarded * * *''. In our proposed rule, we interpreted ``after discharge'' as meaning
that an individual is discharged directly into a home and community-based services waiver. (Individuals who have
never been institutionalized, however, are not eligible for the expanded habilitation services.) This provision
was effective as if it were included in the enactment of section 9502(j)(1) of COBRA. As indicated in the Report of the
Committee on the Budget to accompany H.R. 3545 (OBRA '87) (H. Rept. No. 391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 537 (1987)), the
Congress included this amendment to section 9502(j) because it believed HCFA had misread COBRA in the proposed rule
by stating that expanded habilitation services would be provided only to recipients discharged directly from a NF
or ICF/MR into a home and community-based services waiver program. 
In the proposed rule, we included in regulations the provisions of section 9502(a) by_
 Revising  440.180 to provide for the expanded definition of habilitation services under paragraphs
(b)(6) and (c); 
 Adding   440.180(c)(2) and (3) to provide for the inclusion of prevocational, educational, and
supported employment services under a home and community-based waiver and for the exclusion of certain services;
and adding  441.302(i) and  441.303(h) to require documentation to support State health and welfare
assurances for the provision of these expanded services. 
 Revising  441.310(a)(3) to provide for limits on FFP for prevocational, educational, and supported
employment services. 
We received the following comments on this proposal: 


Comment:

 Five commenters raised issues concerning the expanded definition of habilitation to include educational, prevocational,
and supported employment services. Some commenters suggested that HCFA was imposing an age minimum of 22 for the expanded
habilitation services. Others stated that our definition of prevocational services was too strict and should be
more consistent with section 4442.3(B)(3)(a) of the State Medicaid Manual, which distinguishes prevocational
services from noncovered vocational services. (This definition was added in HCFA Transmittal No. 37, issued in September
1988.) 


Response:

 We are not imposing a minimum age for the expanded habilitation services. Our discussion of this subject in the preamble
of the proposed rule pertained only to the fact that most educational and prevocational services for individuals
under 22 years of age ordinarily would be provided under State and Federal programs other than Medicaid. We agree with
the commenters concerning the need for more consistency between the regulations defining prevocational services
and the related HCFA instructions, and have revised  440.180(c)(2)(i) of the proposed regulations to make
the policy consistent. 


2. Provisions of the Final Rule 


We are adopting the proposed regulations as final rules, with the following changes: 
 We have revised  440.180(c)(1) to provide that a State may provide expanded habilitation services under
a new or amended waiver to recipients who have been discharged from a Medicaid-certified NF or ICF/MR, regardless
of when the discharge occurred. We have made a conforming change to  441.302(i)(2). 
 We have revised  440.180(c)(2)(i) to incorporate a provision to distinguish covered prevocational
services from noncovered vocational services. 
 We have revised  441.310(a)(3)(iii) to clarify that FFP is not available for prevocational, educational,
or supported employment services, or any combination of these services, as part of habilitation services provided
to recipients who were never institutionalized in Medicaid-certified NFs or ICFs/MR. 


B. Services to Patients with Chronic Mental Illness 


1. Background 


Section 9411(d) of OBRA '86 amended section 1915(c)(4)(B) of the Act by adding day treatment or other partial hospitalization
services, psychosocial rehabilitation services, and clinic services (whether or not furnished in a facility) for
individuals with chronic mental illness to the list of services specifically enumerated as home and community-based
services. Therefore, effective October 21, 1986 (the date OBRA '86 was enacted), States may request that any of the
above services be provided under a waiver or renewal of a waiver for persons diagnosed as chronically mentally ill.

In the proposed rule, we_

 Revised  440.180 to add a new paragraph (b)(8) to provide for the inclusion of day treatment or other partial
hospitalization services, psychosocial rehabilitation services, and clinic services for individuals with chronic
mental illness as home and community-based waiver services; 

 Added new   441.302(i) and 441.303(i) to specify requirements for written State health and welfare
assurances for the provision of these services and for supporting documentation of these assurances; 

 Added a new  441.310(a)(4) to specify limits on FFP for the provision of these services. 

We received the following public comment on these proposed regulations: 



Comment:

 One commenter noted that States may provide the specified services to the mentally retarded as well as to the chronically
mentally ill. 



Response:

 Section 1915(c)(4)(B) of the Act authorizes the provision of day treatment or other partial hospitalization services,
psychosocial rehabilitation services, and clinic services (whether or not furnished in a facility) for individuals
with chronic mental illness. Neither the statute nor the conference committee report mentions individuals diagnosed
as mentally retarded. However, States may request the authority to provide these services to the mentally retarded
under the broader waiver authority of section 1915(c)(4)(B) of the Act as ``other'' services. The ``other'' services
category has been in existence since the home and community-based services waiver program was established, and HCFA
has approved a variety of services under this category that States establish as cost-effective and necessary to avoid
institutionalization. 



2. Provisions of the Final Rule 



We are adopting the proposed provisions, with minor editorial changes, as final rules. We have also redesignated
 441.302(i) as  441.302(j) to accommodate other revisions. 



C. Scope of Respite Care 



1. Background 



Under section 1915(c)(4)(B) of the Act, a State may provide respite care under its home and community-based waiver
services program. Respite care may be provided in institutional and noninstitutional settings. However, under
existing regulations at  441.310, FFP is not available for the cost of room and board, except when provided as
part of respite care in a State-approved facility that is not a private residence. Because respite care generally
should be a short-term service, we have required States to fully document the need for more than 30 days of care. 

In the proposed  440.180(b)(7), in accordance with section 1915(c)(4) of the Act, we imposed a 30-day limitation
on the duration of institutional respite care services provided during a waiver year to any individual under a waiver
program. We indicated in the proposed rule that we were not placing a limit on noninstitutional respite care but that
we would closely review all waiver applications that requested noninstitutional respite care in excess of 30 days
per waiver year. 




(

Note

: We have traditionally used the term ``waiver year'' for any 12-month period for which a waiver applies. While we recognize
that the statute uses the term ``fiscal year'', we have not had a problem with our use of ``waiver year'' for ``fiscal
year''. Since the term ``waiver year'' is generally understood and accepted by those involved in the waiver process,
we are continuing to use it in the Medicaid regulations. 
We believe that a switch from the term ``waiver year'' to ``fiscal year'' would cause unnecessary confusion.) 



Subsequent to the publication of the proposed rule, section 4742(d)(l) of OBRA '90 amended section 1915(c)(4) of
the Act to eliminate restrictions on the number of hours or days of respite care that a State may provide in any period
under a waiver as long as the State continues to show cost-neutrality in its waiver program. (``Cost-neutrality''
means that the average per capita expenditures for individuals under waivers does not exceed what the average per
capita expenditures for these individuals would have been if the waiver had not been granted.) Section 4742(d)(2)
of OBRA '90 specifies that the changes under section 4742(d)(1) apply as if included under OBRA '81, the original legislation
for the waiver program, enacted August 13, 1981. 

We received the following public comments on this proposal: 



Comment:

 Six commenters expressed concerns about the proposed 30-day limit on institutional respite care. Two commenters
indicated that room and board should be included under noninstitutional respite care. Three commenters indicated
that the 30-day limit is too strict; two recommended a 60-day limit and one a 90-day limit. One of the commenters who
recommended a 60-day limit also recommended a 2-week limit on consecutive weeks of institutional respite care.

Response:

 Section 1915(c)(4) of the Act prohibits the Secretary from placing durational limits on respite care as long as the
waiver retains cost-neutrality as required under section 1915(c)(2)(D). The issues raised by the commenters regarding
our formerly proposed limits on institutional respite care are now moot. 

Section 1915(c)(1) of the Act specifically excludes room and board as a covered waiver service. However, an exception
with regard to respite care was included under regulations based on the text of section 1915(c)(4)(B) of the Act, the
legislative history of OBRA '81 that amended the Act to include the home and community-based waiver program, and the
fundamental nature of respite care services. In discussing the services that could be included under section 1915(c)
waiver programs, the Congress explained in H. Rept. No. 208, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 966 (1981) that respite care services
were provided on a short-term basis to individuals unable to care for themselves and designed to fill-in for the absence
of care or the ``need for relief for those persons normally providing such care.'' The Congress indicated that such
services can be offered in ``the home of an individual or an approved facility such as a hospital, nursing home, foster
home, or community-residential facility.'' 

Because of the Congress' discussion of certain institutional facilities as locations for the provision of respite
care, and the fact that room and board costs are a core aspect of the costs of respite care services offered in these facilities,
we believe that the Congress intended to allow for payment of room and board costs as part of the costs of respite care
services. Based in part on the cited language from the Conference Report, we have decided to limit institutional respite
care to States which limit the facilities authorized to provide such care to (1) Medicaid-certified hospitals and
nursing homes, and 
(2) foster homes and community-residential facilities that meet State standards as specified in an approved waiver.
Payment for room and board costs as part of the costs of respite care services can be authorized only for care provided
in these facilities. 

Section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act requires that a State maintain the overall cost-neutrality of its waiver program.
Significant increases in respite care, particularly institutional respite care because it is generally costly,
could jeopardize the cost-neutrality of a waiver program. A State that wishes to revise its limit on the number of hours
or days of respite care in a previously approved waiver program must submit an amendment to its currently operating
waiver. The amendment must specify the revised limits and revise the cost-neutrality formula to allow for the increased
costs attributable to the revised respite care limits. 



2. Provisions of the Final Rule 



We are not including in these final regulations any limits on the duration of respite care. However, the State must
continue to show cost-neutrality in its waiver program. Because of the changes in the law, the proposed revision to
 440.180(b)(7) that contained limits on respite care has been deleted. We will consider timely comments on
this deletion.

D. Permitting Hospital Level of Care for Certain Ventilator-Dependent Recipients 



1. Background 



Section 9502(b) of COBRA amended sections 1915(c)(1) and (c)(2)(C) of the Act. These amendments allowed States to
provide home and community-based services to individuals who are ventilator-dependent and who, but for the provision
of home and community-based services, would continue to receive inpatient hospital, NF, or ICF/MR services under
a State's Medicaid plan. (The original statute specified SNF or ICF. OBRA '87 struck out ``SNF'' or ``ICF'' and substituted
``NF'' or ``ICF/MR''.) Thus, sections 1915(c)(1) and (c)(2) of the Act authorized waiver payments for individuals
who require an inpatient hospital level of care, if they enter the waiver program directly from a hospital and are ventilator-dependent.
Prior to this legislation, only persons requiring NF or ICF/MR levels of care could be covered under a home and community-based
waiver program. 

Section 9411(a)(1) of OBRA '86 subsequently amended section 1915(c)(1) of the Act to remove the amendments made by
section 9502(b) of COBRA and added a broader authority to permit States to extend home and community-based services
to individuals who, but for the provision of these services, would require the inpatient hospital level of care. Section
9411(a)(2) of COBRA amended section 1915(c)(2)(B) of the Act to also require the State to provide for an evaluation
of the individual's need for inpatient hospital services prior to permitting the use of home and community-based
services as an alternative to inpatient hospital services. 

In the proposed rule, we revised or added provisions under   441.301(a)(3)(i), (b)(1)(ii), and (b)(1)(iii)(A),
  441.302(c)(1), (c)(2)(i), (e), and (f), and   441.303(f)(1), (3), and (5), to incorporate
the provisions of section 1915(c)(2). These provisions extended home and community-based services coverage to
individuals who would otherwise need inpatient hospital care and required States to provide for an evaluation of
the need for inpatient hospital services. In addition, we included a proposed expansion of  441.303(c)(2)
to require States that use a level of care evaluation form other than that used for nursing home placements to assure
us that the outcome of that evaluation form is reliable, valid, and fully comparable to the form used for nursing home
placement. 



2. Provisions of the Final Rule 



We did not receive any comments on these provisions. We have, however, made the following clarifying changes in the
final rule: 

 We substituted ``NF'' or ``ICF/MR'' for ``SNF'' or ``ICF'' to conform the regulations to OBRA '87. 

 We have revised  441.303(c)(2) by substituting ``hospital, nursing facility, or ICF/MR'' for ``nursing
home.'' Level of care evaluation forms from any of these facilities will not need State assurances for reliability
and validity. 



E. Bundling of Services 



1. Background 



We proposed to revise  441.301(b)(4) to require States to describe the services to be furnished under home and
community-based services waivers under section 1915(c) so that each service is separately defined. Multiple services
that are generally considered to be separate services cannot be consolidated under a single definition. Commonly
accepted terms must be used to describe the service and definitions may not be open-ended in scope. 

We received the following comments on the proposed rule: 



Comment:

 Two commenters recommended that States be allowed to combine (bundle) certain services under a single definition
under home and community based services waivers under section 1915(c) for ease of reporting. 



Response:

 We believe that services enumerated in the statute (section 1915(c)(4)(B)), such as personal care or adult day health
services, must stand alone and not be included in a bundled service. In addition, bundling of these services would
not ease the waiver process because the cost of each component of the combined service would need to be computed separately
to show how the single service cost was derived. The bundling of several waiver services into a single service definition
may also unnecessarily restrict an individual's freedom of choice of providers (section 1902(a)(23) of the Act)
by limiting the pool of qualified providers. Bundling would limit the pool of providers able to furnish the bundled
service because fewer providers would be capable of furnishing the broader array of services that result when various
services are combined into bundles. Under a bundling arrangement, a provider must be able to furnish all of the component
services in a bundle to qualify for a provider agreement. We will consider a combined service definition if the State
establishes that the bundling of services will permit more efficient delivery of services and not compromise either
the availability of services or an individual's free choice of providers. If HCFA authorizes the bundling of services,
however, States must continue to compute separately the costs of the component services to support the final cost
of the bundled waiver service for the cost-neutrality formula. 



2. Provisions of the Final Rule 



We have adopted the proposed regulations as final rules with two modifications: 

 We have revised proposed  441.301(b)(4) to specify that HCFA will approve combined service definitions
(bundling) if the definitions will permit more efficient delivery of services and not compromise an individual's
access to or free choice of providers.

<TEXT>
 

 We have added a new paragraph  441.303(f)(10) to require States to continue to compute separately the
costs and utilization of the component services that compose a HCFA-approved bundled service. 



F. Waiver of Comparability Requirement and Certain Income and Resource Eligibility Requirements 



1. Waiver of Comparability Requirement 



Section 9411(c) of OBRA '86 amended section 1915(c)(3) of the Act to limit the Medicaid State plan requirements under
section 1902(a)(10) of the Act that may be waived under section 1915(c) to ``comparability'' of covered services
under section 1902(a)(10)(B); that is, that covered services be equal in amount, duration, and scope for certain
Medicaid recipients. Previously, all of section 1902(a)(10) of the Act could be waived by the Secretary if requested
by States. By indicating that only section 1902(a)(10)(B) of the Act may be waived, the Congress narrowed the scope
of this particular waiver option. Specifically, section 1902(a)(10)(B) of the Act requires that the medical assistance
made available to any eligible categorically needy individual may not be less in amount, duration, or scope than the
medical assistance made available to any other categorically needy individual, and may not be less in amount, duration,
or scope than the medical assistance made available to medically needy individuals. Consequently, a waiver of comparability
affords the State an opportunity to target waivers to certain specific groups without providing those services to
other groups. The amendment made by section 9411(c) is effective for waivers and renewals of waivers approved on or
after October 21, 1986. 

Regulations implementing section 1902(a)(10)(B) are located at  440.240. 

In the proposed rule, we revised  441.301(a)(2) to provide that, when applicable, a request for waiver of Medicaid
requirements could include a waiver of sections 1902(a)(1) and (a)(10)(B) of the Act which concern ``statewide''
application of Medicaid and ``comparability of services.'' Prior to enactment of section 9411 of OBRA '86, a State
could request and receive waivers of section 1902(a)(1) and 1902(a)(10) of the Act. A waiver of 1902(a)(10) included
waiver of comparability as well as all other subsections in that section of the statute. Section 9411(c) of OBRA '86
limited the waiver authority to section 1902(a)(10)(B) or ``comparability of services''. Because of this limitation,
a State could no longer apply rules for deeming of income and resources for institutionalized medically needy recipients
to determine Medicaid eligibility of the waiver population. 



2. Medicaid Eligibility Rules 



Section 4118(a)(1) of OBRA '87 amended section 1915(c)(3) of the Act to allow States to waive section 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III)
which contains rules for determining income and resource eligibility for the medically needy. This option allows
States to use income and resource methods and standards, other than those that would ordinarily be used for medically
needy individuals living in the community, provided that such rules do not conflict with other provisions of the Medicaid
statute which States may not waive. That is, the option permits waiver of rules, such as deeming of income and resources,
that are applied differently in the community than in an institution and are barriers to participation in a waiver
program. 

When this provision was enacted, deeming was the primary barrier. Over time, this has changed. There are now other
eligibility policies applied in an institutional setting that a State may wish to use instead of policies that would
normally be used in the community. For example, under its waiver, a State may wish to apply to a home and community-based
waiver recipient living with a spouse, the spousal impoverishment protection rules of section 1924 of the Act which
would have applied to this recipient had the recipient been living in a medical institution. As a second example, for
its home and community-based recipients, a State might use more liberal income or resource methods that the State
has approved under section 1902(r)(2) of the Act for institutionalized individuals who are eligible under a special
income level under  435.231. 

If a State elects to use more liberal income rules under this waiver authority, it is still subject to the FFP limits
on Medicaid expenditures for the medically needy under section 1903(f) of the Act, as interpreted under  435.1007.
These limits may not be waived. The FFP limit for the medically needy is 133 and 1/3 percent of the highest State's Aid
to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) money payment for a family of the same size which has no income or resources.
Because the legislative history explicitly states that the Congress intended that this waiver option permit States
to use institutional deeming rules, we are interpreting the FFP limits at  435.1007 to mean that the income used
for purposes of determining if the FFP limits are met is income that would be used in the institutional setting. That
is, only the waiver recipient's income would be used in calculating the FFP limits since spousal and parental income
is not deemed to be available in an institution. This interpretation will be reflected in a revision to  435.1007
in a separate rule.

Prior to this amendment to section 1915(c)(3) and the amendment under section 9411(c) of OBRA '86 limiting waivers
under section 1902(a)(10) to ``comparability'' of covered services under section 1902(a)(10)(B), States had been
permitted to waive eligibility requirements for the categorically needy, but not the medically needy. Generally,
States used the waiver authority to use institutional income and resource deeming rules. The result of these two amendments
to section 1915(c) is that this waiver authority no longer extends to the categorically needy, but extends only to
the medically needy. However, a State may continue to use the institutional eligibility rules for categorically
needy waiver recipients, if the individuals are members of an eligibility group that the State may elect to cover under
section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(VI) of the Act and  435.217. 




3. Post-Eligibility Treatment of Income 




In the proposed rule, we revised the post-eligibility rules at  435.726(c)(1) and  435.735(c)(1) to
include the provisions of section 9502(e) of COBRA and section 9435(a) of OBRA '86. Post-eligibility calculations
for individuals who are found eligible under  435.217 determine how much of eligible waiver recipients' income
is applied to the cost of home and community-based waiver services. One of the deductions from waiver recipients'
income included in these calculations is a deduction for the maintenance needs of the waiver recipient. 



Section 9502(e) of COBRA amended section 1915(c) of the Act to reflect a change in the amount States may protect for
the maintenance needs of waiver recipients in the post-eligibility calculations. The amendment in COBRA specifically
allows States to use a higher maintenance needs standard for home and community-based recipients than permitted
under   435.726 and 435.735(c)(1) for waivers approved or renewed on or after April 7, 1986. The amendment
in OBRA '86 further amended section 1915(c) to also permit use of the higher maintenance need standards for waivers
approved or renewed before April 7, 1986. In the proposed rule, we provided that the maintenance amount be based on
a reasonable assessment of need and that States set an upper limit which cannot be exceeded for any one individual.
Should a State choose to use maintenance need standards that vary by individual, it must assure that all individuals
in like circumstances are treated comparably. 



The proposed rule did not address how the rules used to determine income in the post-eligibility income and resource
process for an institutionalized individual who has a spouse who lives in the community would affect home and community-based
waiver recipients whose eligibility is based on section 1924 of the Act. We are addressing this issue in a separate
rule that will propose further revisions to the post-eligibility regulations. These revisions will address application
of the section 1924 rules and other matters. They will include our interpretation of ``institutionalized spouse''
at section 1924(h)(1) as allowing, on a waiver-by-waiver basis, use of the post-eligibility rules at section 1924(d)
to determine Medicaid benefits payable for individuals who are eligible for home and community-based waiver services
under  435.217. That is, an individual would be subject to the section 1924 post-eligibility rules if (1) the
individual's State elected the section 1924(h)(1) post-eligibility option, (2) the individual meets the criteria
of  435.217, and (3) the individual has a spouse who is neither institutionalized in a medical institution or
nursing facility nor receiving home and community-based waiver services.

We caution States to carefully evaluate how section 1924(d) post-eligibility rules will affect the waiver population.
Generally, the election of the section 1924(d) post-eligibility rules would not adversely affect the waiver recipient.
However, there is at least one exception with respect to individuals who 

are not living 

with their community spouses. If the section 1924(d) post-eligibility rules are used for such individuals, the waiver
recipient is not likely to have enough protected income to pay for his or her maintenance needs. This situation can
occur because only the personal needs allowance for institutionalized individuals is protected in the section 1924
post-eligibility calculation. Income above the personal needs allowance would go either to the community spouse
in the form of a monthly income allowance, or for medical and remedial care expenses (including waiver services).
Thus, the waiver recipient is not likely to have income to pay for his or her food, clothing, and shelter in the community.



4. Provisions of the Final Rule 


We are adopting the proposed  441.301(a)(2) to allow a State to request a waiver of section 1902(a)(1) or section
1902(a)(10)(B) as final. We are also adding a provision to that section to allow for waiver of the requirements of section
1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of the Act concerning income and resource rules applicable to institutionalized individuals
with spouses living in the community, as added by section 4118(a)(1) of OBRA '87. 
We are adopting the proposed revisions to  435.726(c)(l) and  435.735(c)(l) as final, without further
modification. 


G. Expenditure for Waiver Services 


1. Prohibition on Imposition of Certain Regulatory Limits on Expenditures 


a. 

Background. 

Section 9502(c) of COBRA amended section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act and added a new section 1915(c)(6). Section 9502(c)(1)
of COBRA clarified section 1915(c)(2)(D) to specify that, under a home and community-based services waiver, a State's
estimated average per capita expenditure for individuals under the waiver must not exceed the estimated average
per capita expenditure for services without the waiver. We refer to this as ``a cost-neutrality test for section 1915(c)
waivers.'' (We have always interpreted section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act in this manner and previously implemented
the applicable standards accordingly.) The cost estimate formula is located in regulations at  441.303(f)(l).

Section 1915(c)(6) of the Act, as enacted by section 9502(c)(2) of COBRA, directs the Secretary to abolish the regulatory
limitation concerning home and community-based services waiver expenditures. This expenditure limitation appears
in existing regulations at   441.302(e)(2) and 441.310(a)(2) and requires a State to provide satisfactory
assurance that actual total expenditures for home and community-based services and the State's claim for FFP for
the services will not exceed the State's approved estimates for waiver services. Under the existing regulations,
expenditures that exceed the State's approved estimates would not have been eligible for FFP. 
In the proposed rule, we revised  441.302 (e) and (f) that deal with a State's assurances on the cost-neutrality
of its waiver programs. Section 441.302(e) deals with a State's estimates as contained in its waiver proposals and
 441.302(f) deals with a State's actual expenditures as reported on the State's annual expenditure reports
as required under section 1915(c)(2)(E) of the Act. We inserted ``100 percent'' in each section to clearly indicate
the intention of section 9502(c) of COBRA that a waiver be cost-neutral (formerly referred to as ``cost-effective'').
The Congress intended that expenditures made under a State waiver not exceed 100 percent of the average per capita
expenditure that the State reasonably estimates would have been made if the waiver had not been granted. 
We also proposed revisions to  441.304(d) to indicate that we will review all estimates very closely to determine
if they are reasonable and based on statistically supportable assumptions. For waivers that are approved and operational,
we will compare the data the State must furnish annually on its actual experience (HCFA form 372) with the approved
expenditures the State estimated would occur absent the waiver. If we find that actual expenditures exceed the State's
approved estimates for expenditures absent the waiver, we will require the State to amend its estimates for the subsequent
waiver year(s). We will compare the revised estimates with the State's actual experience to determine if these estimates
are reasonable. We may terminate a waiver if we find that, based on the revised estimates in the amendment request,
the waiver is not cost-neutral or that the revised estimates are unreasonable. For waiver renewal requests, we will
compare the estimated expenditures for the renewal period against the State's actual experience as shown in its annual
reports. Based on this comparison, we will not approve a waiver renewal request if we find that the renewal request
is not cost-neutral or that the estimates are not reasonable based on the annual reports. 

These revisions were required by section 9502(c)(2) of COBRA. 
We received the following public comments on these proposed provisions. 


Comment: 

A State agency suggested that a single recipient's cost not be used to determine the waiver's cost effectiveness.

Response: 

In virtually all cases, we determine the cost-neutrality of a waiver request by comparing the average costs for all
recipients under the waiver to the estimated average costs absent the waiver. The only time we would review a single
recipient's cost under a home and community-based services waiver would be when a waiver serves only one person. If
the recipient's costs exceeded the appropriate institutional costs, the waiver would not be cost-neutral. However,
section 1915(c)(4)(A) of the Act authorizes a State, at its option, to limit home and community-based services waivers
to those recipients for whom the State has a reasonable expectation that the cost of medical assistance under the waiver
for those individuals will not exceed the cost of medical assistance for those same recipients absent the waiver.
Thus, this section of the Act permits States to include (1) only recipients whose costs under a waiver are reasonably
expected to be less than or the same as the appropriate institutional costs under medical assistance and (2) individual
recipients whose waiver costs are reasonably expected to exceed institutional costs under medical assistance (if
the waiver did not apply), as long as the estimated average per capita cost with the waiver does not exceed the estimated
average per capita cost absent the waiver. 


Comment: 

Two commenters asserted that a State should not be required to submit an amendment to its waiver proposal if the State
exceeds its approved cost and utilization estimates. 


Response: 

Section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act requires that we assess the reasonableness of a State's estimates of the cost-neutrality
of its program. The amendment must be submitted prior to the expiration of the waiver year in question and must include
cost and utilization changes for the current waiver year and all waiver years that follow through the term of the approved
waiver request. If a State anticipates substantive changes in its cost and utilization estimates, we believe that
the State should be required to submit amendments to explain the basis and extent of the changes. The State's recomputed
cost-effectiveness formula, based on the revised cost and utilization, must substantiate continued cost-neutrality.



Comment: 

One commenter requested that we simplify the waiver application process which includes estimations of expenditures
based on an equation specified in the regulations. 


Response: 

We agree with the commenter's request. We are making a significant change in the formula values proposed at  441.303(f)(1)
to simplify the waiver cost-neutrality formula and thus reduce the overall complexity of the waiver application
procedure. We are reducing the formula by retaining only those formula values which are critical in assessing the
cost-neutrality of the program: D, D
', G, and G
'. 
Section 1915(c)(2)(D) requires that States make assurances, satisfactory to the Secretary, that waiver programs
will be cost-neutral to the Medicaid program. Cost-neutrality is defined in terms which require that the average
per capita annual Medicaid expenditure with the waiver in place not exceed the average per capita annual Medicaid
expenditure without the waiver. The waiver formula is intended to provide a uniform method of providing data to the
Secretary, sufficient to allow a determination of whether the State's estimate of per capita cost-neutrality is
reasonable. We believe that, based on many years of program experience, the formula can be simplified to its key elements.
Specifically, we would retain the two factors which represent average per-capita costs for waiver and other Medicaid
services under the waiver (D and D
'). These would be compared to the average per capita cost for alternative institutional care and other related
Medicaid expenditures without the waiver (G and G
'). To ensure these factors are inclusive of all relevant Medicaid expenditures, we have redefined D
' and G
' to include all other medical assistance expenditures and expanded services not under a State plan for early
and periodic screening, diagnostic and treatment (EPSDT) services recipients. The meanings of D and G remain unchanged,
but the definitions have been revised for clarity. We are also deleting the requirement at proposed  441.303(f)(3)
that States must submit data on the estimated number of beneficiaries and expenditures for those who would receive
hospital, NF, or ICF/MR services. With our simplification and redefinition of formula values, there is no longer
a need for these data. We are renumbering the remaining paragraphs in section (f) accordingly. 
The following are our new definitions: 



D = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for home and community-based services for individuals in
the waiver program. 
D
' = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for all other services provided to individuals in
the waiver program. 
G = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for hospital, NF, or ICF/MR care that would be incurred for
individuals served in the waiver, were the waiver not granted.

<DOCNO> FR940725-0-00095 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

G
' = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid costs for all services other than those included in factor
G for individuals served in the waiver, were the waiver not granted.





Even though we have eliminated the ``C'' value (number of unduplicated waiver individuals a State intends to serve
for each year of the waiver) from the equation, we will continue to require each State to report this information to
us as part of a waiver request. This number may be revised when a State determines that it needs to increase or decrease
the number of individuals it estimates it would serve under the waiver. We will include this number in our approval
notices. 


b. 

Provisions of the final rule. 

We are revising  441.303(f) to include the changes noted above. We are simplifying the formula at  441.303(f)(1).
We are providing in  441.303(f)(2) that, for purposes of the formula, the prime factors include the average
per capita cost for all services provided under the State plan that are not accounted for in other formula values and
include expanded EPSDT services. 


To further simplify the waiver application process, we are also revising  441.304 by deleting paragraph (a)(2),
renumbering paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) as paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), and revising paragraph (b). Section
441.304(b) will now read: HCFA will determine whether a request for extension of an existing waiver is actually an
extension request or a request for a new waiver. If a State submits an extension request that would add a new group to
the existing group of recipients covered under the waiver (as defined under  441.301(b)(6)), HCFA will consider
it to be two requests: one as an extension request for the existing group, and the other as a new waiver request for the
new group. Waivers may be extended for additional 5-year periods. 




2. Computation of Estimated Expenditures Under Waivers for Individuals With a Particular Illness or Condition 




a. 

Background. 

Section 9502(d) of COBRA added a new section 1915(c)(7) of the Act that authorized States that have established or
wish to establish separate waivers for institutionalized, physically disabled individuals to estimate the average
per capita expenditure for such individuals separately from the expenditures for all other individuals in NFs and
ICFs/MR. Section 9411(a)(3) of OBRA '86 subsequently changed section 1915(c)(7) to allow such separate demonstrations
of cost-neutrality to be applied in any waiver targeted to inpatients with particular illnesses or conditions. In
both cases, the specific group of eligible individuals must have been inpatients in hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR prior
to being deinstitutionalized into the waiver program. Prior to the enactment of COBRA, States were not authorized
to compute expenditures differently for a specific group of individuals by comparing costs to those in that group
only, rather than total inpatient populations. 


Section 9411(a)(3) of OBRA '86 amended section 1915(c)(7) of the Act to allow States the option of using an alternative
method for estimating costs under section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act. This alternative method applies to waivers for
individuals with a particular illness or condition, who are inpatients in hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR. The State may
determine the average per capita expenditure that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals under
the State plan separately from the expenditures for other individuals who are inpatients of those respective facilities.
Alternatively, States may continue to use the usual method of estimating average per capita expenditures; that is,
include the utilization and cost of all Medicaid recipients otherwise using a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR. 


In the Conference Committee report for OBRA '86 (H. Rept. No. 1012, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 400 (1986)), the Congress indicated
its intention by stating that ``illness or diagnosis'' meant, for example, acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS), or AIDS-related condition (ARC) and that ``condition'' meant, for example, chronic mental illness or ventilator
dependency. Thus, for waivers directed to any specified group, States may make expenditure estimates specific to
that group of patients who are inpatients of hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR, distinguished by illness or condition. 


As with all home and community-based waivers, States must furnish reasonable and verifiable cost estimates for waivers
dealing with individuals with a specific illness or condition.

The provisions of section 1915(c)(7) of the Act, as amended by OBRA '86, apply to applications for waivers (or renewals)
approved on or after October 21, 1986. 


Section 8437(a) of TMRA made a further amendment to section 1915(c)(7)(A) of the Act to extend the principle of specific
illness or condition cost estimates to individuals ``who would require the level of care provided in hospitals, NFs
or ICFs/MR.'' As amended by TMRA, section 1915(c)(7)(A) specifies that, for a home and community-based services
waiver that applies to individuals with a particular illness or condition, who are inpatients in, or who would require
the level of care provided in, hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR, the Secretary must allow the State to determine the average
per capita expenditure that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals under the State plan separately
from the expenditures for other individuals who are inpatients in, or who would require the level of care provided
in, those respective facilities. This provision applies to eligible individuals whether or not those individuals
are institutionalized prior to entering the waiver. 


Section 8437(b) of TMRA made the amendments to section 1915(c)(7)(A) effective for waiver applications submitted
before, on, or after November 10, 1988, the date TMRA was enacted. 



In the proposed rule, we revised  441.303(f)(3) to provide that, for waivers that apply only to individuals
with a particular illness or condition (formerly referred to as physically disabled in section 9502(d) of COBRA)
who are inpatients in hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR, the State may determine the average per capita expenditures that
would have been made in each waiver year for those individuals under the State plan separately from the expenditures
for other inpatients of the respective certified facilities. 



We did not receive public comments on this specific provision. 


b. 

Provisions of the final rule. 

We are adopting this proposed provision as final with the change described below. We will consider timely comments
submitted on this change. 


We have revised proposed  441.303(f)(4) (and renumbered it as  441.303(f)(3) to accommodate other revisions)
to include reference to individuals who would require the level of care provided in hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR. In
addition, we have revised this section to allow an agency to (1) exclude expenditures for other individuals in the
affected hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR when estimating average per capita expenditures for a waiver for individuals
with a particular illness or condition who would otherwise require hospital, NF, or ICF/MR level of care, as provided
for in section 8437(a) of TMRA; and (2) support the accompanying data with documentation to verify that the cost-effectiveness
estimates for these illness or condition specific waivers are reasonable as required under section 1915(c)(2)(D)
of the Act. 




3. Computation of Estimated Expenditures Under Waiver for Institutionalized Developmentally Disabled Individuals





a. 

Background. 

Section 4118(k) of OBRA '87 added a new paragraph (B) to section 1915(c)(7) of the Act concerning computation of the
average per capita expenditure estimates made by a State under section 1915(c)(2)(B) of the Act for a waiver that applies
only to individuals with developmental disabilities who are inpatients in a nursing facility. (The original wording
of the statute specified SNFs and ICFs.) The new provision states that, if the State has determined, on the basis of
an evaluation under section 1915(c)(2)(B) of the Act, that individuals need the level of care provided in an ICF/MR,
the State may determine the average per capita expenditures that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals
under the State plan based on the average per capita expenditures under the State plan for services to individuals
who are inpatients of ICFs/MR (rather than NFs). 




We have determined that the evaluation required under section 1915(c)(2)(B) of the Act should be completed as part
of the preadmission screening annual resident review (PASARR) required under section 1919(e)(7)(B) of the Act entitled
``State Requirements for Annual Resident Review.'' Section 1919(e)(7)(B)(ii) requires that, as of April 1, 1990,
in the case of each resident of a nursing facility who is mentally retarded, the State mental retardation or developmental
disability authority must review and determine_

<DOCNO> FR940725-0-00097 </DOCNO>

(1) Whether or not the resident, because of the resident's physical and mental condition, requires the level of services
of an intermediate care facility described under section 1905(d) (ICF/MR); and 


(2) Whether or not the resident requires specialized services for mental retardation. 


We assume that the evaluation of need noted above would be accomplished during the annual resident review. (The requirement
that the States use the PASARR process in conducting these evaluations was established by HCFA and is not contained
in section 1915(c)(2)(B) of the Act.) 



Section 411(k)(10)(H) of MCCA amended section 1915(c)(7)(B) of the Act to clarify that, in making estimates as to
cost-neutrality in a waiver that applies exclusively to developmentally disabled individuals under section 1915(c)(7)(B)
of the Act, who have been identified as inappropriately placed in NFs, yet requiring the level of services provided
by an ICF/MR, the State may estimate utilization without regard to the availability of ICF/MR beds for such inpatients.
Therefore, section 1915(c)(7)(B) exempts States from the requirement to demonstrate ICF/MR bed capacity for recipients
served by waivers proposed under section 1915(c)(7)(B) of the Act. 


b. 

Provisions of the final rule. 

We have added a new  441.303(f)(4) to provide that, in making estimates for a separate waiver program that applies
only to individuals (1) who are developmentally disabled, (2) who are inpatients of a NF, and (3) who have been determined
by the State through the PASARR process (section 1919(e)(7)(B) of the Act) to require the level of care provided in
an ICF/MR, the State may determine the average per capita expenditures that would have been made in a fiscal year for
those individuals based on the average per capita expenditures for inpatients in an ICF/MR. When submitting estimates
of institutional costs without the waiver, the State may use the average per capita costs of ICF/MR care even though
the deinstitutionalized developmentally disabled individuals were inpatients of NFs. We will consider timely
comments submitted on this addition. 





4. Computation of Expenditure Estimates for Persons With Mental Retardation or a Related Condition in a Decertified
Facility 





a. 

Background. 

Section 4742(c)(1) of OBRA '90 added a new section 1915(c)(7)(C) to the Act relating to waivers for individuals with
mental retardation or a related condition who are residents in an ICF/MR that has had its participation under the State's
Medicaid plan terminated. This added provision allows a State, when making estimates under section 1915(c)(2)(D)
of the Act, to determine the average per capita expenditures under a waiver that would have been made in a fiscal year
for those individuals without regard to the termination and as if Medicaid institutional payment continued. Termination
of an ICF/MR's participation under a State plan does not affect estimates made under section 1915(c)(2)(D). 


Section 4742(c)(2) provides that this provision applies as if included in the enactment of OBRA '81, but only applies
to facilities terminated on or after November 5, 1990, the enactment date of OBRA '90. 


b. 

Provisions of the final rule. 

We are adding a new  441.303(f)(7) to state that in making estimates for waivers that apply to persons with mental
retardation or related conditions, States may include costs and utilization of Medicaid residents in ICFs/MR that
have been terminated on or after November 5, 1990, when determining the average per capita expenditure that would
have been made in a waiver year. We will consider timely comments submitted on this addition. 





5. Adjustments in Estimates To Include Preadmission 
Screening Requirements 




a. 

Background. 

Section 4742(e) of OBRA '90 provides that, under section 1915(c) of the Act, a State may adjust its waiver estimates,
submitted under section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act, of average per capita expenditures for individuals with mental
retardation or a related condition to include expenditures made on or after January 1, 1989, that result from the preadmission
screening program required under section 1919(e)(7)(B) of the Act. The State may include increases in expenditures
for, or utilization of, ICFs/MR resulting from its preadmission screening program for making determinations for
individuals with mental retardation admitted to NFs on or after January 1, 1989.

6. Treatment of Room and Board in Submitting Estimates of Expenditures for Personal Caregivers 



a. 

Background. 

Section 1915(c)(1) of the Act provides for payment, as medical assistance, of part or all of the cost of home and community-based
services under an approved waiver (other than room and board). Except for respite care furnished in a State-approved
facility that is not a private residence, FFP is not available for room and board as part of a home and community-based
service. 


Section 4741(a)(1) of OBRA '90 amended section 1915(c)(1) to specify that, for purposes of this section of the Act,
``the term `room and board' shall not include an amount established under a method determined by the State to reflect
the portion of costs of rent and food attributable to an unrelated personal caregiver who is residing in the same household
with an individual who, but for the assistance of such caregiver, would require admission to a hospital, nursing facility,
or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded.'' 


b. 

Provisions of the final rule. 

We are adding a new  441.303(f)(8) to provide that, in submitting estimates for waivers that include personal
caregivers as a waiver service, the State may include a portion of the rent and food attributed to the unrelated personal
caregiver who resides in the waiver recipient's home or residence. The method of apportioning the costs of rent and
food is determined by the State, subject to review and approval by HCFA. The method used must be explained fully to receive
HCFA's approval. A personal caregiver provides a waiver service to meet the recipient's physical, social, or emotional
needs (as opposed to services not directly related to the care of the recipient; that is, housekeeping or chore services).
FFP for live-in caregivers is not available if the recipient lives in the caregiver's home or in a residence that is
owned or leased by the caregiver. We have interpreted language in the statute that rent and food costs attributable
to the live-in caregiver may now be included in the State's estimates of cost-neutrality to include situations in
which the live-in caregiver resides in the recipient's home and the recipient would incur additional costs for such
a caregiver. When the recipient lives with the caregiver, the caregiver incurs the additional costs for the recipient.
We believe the payment to the caregiver for the recipient's rent and food would violate the room and board exclusion
under section 1915(c)(1) of the Act. We will consider timely comments on this addition.

H. Coordinated Services Between Maternal and Child Health Programs and Home and Community-Based Service Programs




1. Background 



Section 9502(h) of COBRA added a new section 1915(c)(8) to the Act. This section allows the State agency that administers
the Medicaid plan to make cooperative arrangements, whenever appropriate, with the State agency that administers
the program for children with special health care needs under the Maternal and Child Health Program (Title V of the
Act), to improve access to coordinated services to meet the children's needs. The amendment made by section 9502(h)
was effective April 7, 1986. 

In the proposed rule, we redesignated the existing  441.306 as  441.308 and added a new  441.306
to incorporate the provisions of section 1915(c)(8) of the Act, as added by section 9502(h) of COBRA. 

We did not receive any public comments on this provision. 



2. Provisions of the Final Rule 



We are adopting the proposed regulations, without modification, as final rules. 



I. Limitation on Participants in Waiver Programs 



1. Background 



Section 9502(i) of COBRA added a new section 1915(c)(9) to the Act. This addition provides that when a waiver contains
a limit on the number of individuals who can receive home and community-based services, the State may substitute additional
individuals to replace any recipients who die or become ineligible for Medicaid services under the State plan. This
provision was effective on April 7, 1986. 

In the proposed rule, we redesignated existing  441.305 as  441.307 and added a new  441.305 to provide
that a State may substitute additional individuals to replace those under a home and community-based services waiver
who die or become ineligible for waiver services, when the waiver contains a federally imposed limit on the number
of individuals receiving waiver services, as specified in section 1915(c)(9) of the Act, as added by section 9502(i)
of COBRA. 

Section 4118(b) (entitled ``Increase in Number of Individuals Who May Be Served Under Model Home and Community-Based
Services Waiver) of OBRA '87 amended section 1915(c) of the Act by adding a new paragraph (10) that states that ``No
waiver under this subsection shall limit by an amount less than 200 the number of individuals in the State who may receive
home and community-based services under such waiver.'' We interpreted this provision as restricting the Secretary's
ability to limit the number of recipients a State could serve in a model waiver program. That is, the Secretary may not
place a limit below 200 on the number of persons a State may serve. While the provision could, arguably, be read to limit
the actual number of individuals who may receive model waiver services to no less than 200, based on the legislative
history, and the history of the section 1915(c) program, we believe that this reading is unsupportable. First, model
waiver programs have historically had a Federally established limit of 50 individuals who could receive services.
Second, the limited size of the program is specifically noted in the OBRA '87 Conference Report (H. Rept. No. 495, 100th
Cong., 1st Sess. 755 (1987)), in the section describing the current state of the law. Finally, section 4118 of MCCA
is entitled ``Increase in Number of Individuals Who May Be Served Under Model Home and Community-Based Services Waiver.''
On these bases, we believe that the Congress intended to enable States to serve a greater number of persons while maintaining
the Secretary's authority to impose a limit on programs which she believes are of excessive size. 

Section 411(k)(10)(A) of MCCA further amended section 1915(c)(10) of the Act in an attempt to clarify the language
in section 4118(b) of OBRA '87, and confirmed our interpretation of the Congress' intent in enacting that provision.
This amendment restricts the Secretary's power to limit the number of persons who can receive home and community-based
waivers to no lower than 200. Again, in light of the history of the waiver program and the legislative history of this
provision, we interpret this amendment to restrict the Secretary's power to limit the number of participants in the
model waiver program only. Historically, there has been no limit on the number of participants in the regular home
and community-based waiver programs, whereas there has been a 50-person Federally imposed limit on the number of
persons who can participate in a model waiver. Also, section 411(k)(10)(A) was specifically enacted to remedy the
ambiguity in section 4118(b), which itself was aimed only at model waivers. We believe, therefore, that this provision
enables the Secretary to limit the number of participants in a model home and community-based program to 200 persons,
or any amount above 200. Through these regulations, the Secretary has opted to impose a maximum limit of 200 persons
for any State waiver program. On an individual State basis, an approved State plan may contain a maximum limit that
is lower than 200. Thus, no State may serve any more than 200 persons, but any State may be limited to a lower number as
approved in its waiver program. There is no comparable limit on regular waiver programs. Thus, the 200-person limit
represents the maximum number of individuals that a State may serve under a ``model'' home and community-based services
waiver at any one time.

A State may, in accordance with section 1915(c)(9) of the Act, replace individuals who die or lose Medicaid eligibility
for State plan services. However, the State is still limited to serving no more than the number approved in its model
waiver request, or 200 individuals, at any time. 

Section 411(k)(10)(A) is effective as if included in the enactment of OBRA `87, that is, December 22, 1987. Thus, States
may continue to serve less than 200 recipients under approved model waivers and renew these requests by any number
of recipients up to the new 200-person limit. States with model waivers approved prior to December 21, 1987, may submit
an amendment to obtain approval to serve clients in excess of those originally approved, up to the new 200-person limit.


We received the following comments on the proposed rule: 



Comment:

 Two commenters recommended that States be allowed to substitute recipients in a home and community-based services
waiver program under section 1915(c) of the Act, as is permitted under a model waiver program. 



Response:

 The model waiver program derives its legal base from the same statutory authority as the section 1915(c) waiver program
but administratively it has been limited in the total number of recipients that could be served. The original limit
was 50 individuals. As we stated above, the amendment made by section 4118(b) of OBRA `87 increased the limit on model
waivers to 200 individuals and the amendment made by section 9502(i) of COBRA authorized substitution for recipients
who die or lose Medicaid eligibility. Although States may replace recipients, there is no authorization for exceeding
(at any point in time) the 200-person limit on the model waiver request. 

In contrast, HCFA has never prohibited the substitution of recipients under the section 1915(c) waiver program.
In fact, we require that the utilization estimates submitted prior to approval must be based on unduplicated recipient
counts, not ``slots'' or full-time equivalents. ``Unduplicated'' means that once a recipient is counted in a particular
setting (in a NF, for example), that recipient cannot be recounted in that setting if readmitted during the reporting
period (waiver year). This is the same reporting principle used in HCFA Forms 64 and 2082. State waiver utilization
estimates must include an adjustment for Medicaid recipients who die, lose eligibility, or leave the program for
any reason (institutionalization, for example). Therefore, substitutions are expected, and all persons replaced
should already be incorporated into the waiver utilization estimates approved for each year of every waiver program.
Because the unduplicated recipient count includes reasonable estimates of substitution and the statute requires
reasonableness of estimates and cost-neutrality, we are requiring waiver amendments if the State expects to exceed
its approved cost and utilization estimates, regardless of the reason for the change.

Comment:

 Two commenters stated that HCFA is narrowing the legislative intent by requiring institutional bed capacity to offset
increases in waiver recipients, especially since section 9502(c)(2) of COBRA eliminated HCFA's proposed cap on
total waiver costs as established under  441.304(d)(1). The proposed cap was the product of the State's estimate
of waiver participants times the estimated average per capita cost. 



Response:

 We agree. The regulatory cap on total waiver costs has already been eliminated by legislative action (section 1915(c)(6)
of the Act). Moreover, we believe the requirement that States establish that there would be sufficient institutional
bed capacity for their waiver population in the event there was no waiver should be rescinded. While this requirement
served a sound analytical purpose as part of the cost-neutrality test in the early days of the program, our experience
over the last several years has shown it to be of diminishing value. The requirement placed an unreasonable burden
on States by requiring them to project the estimated development of additional institutional capacity. That additional
burden was never the requirement's intent and its development was contrary to the interests of the States and the Federal
Government. Moreover, States have generally been successful in documenting additional bed capacity sufficient
to allow the expansion of their waiver programs. Because the bed capacity test has become an unnecessary and nonproductive
exercise, we are deleting this requirement. In lieu of this test, and in the absence of information to the contrary,
we will accept a State's assurance that, absent the waiver, recipients in the waiver would receive the appropriate
level of Medicaid funded institutional care. Also, because the elimination of the bed capacity test recognizes that
data regarding program utilization will no longer be relevant to the waiver application process, we have simplified
the waiver formula to eliminate those formula values that relate to utilization. Instead, the formula now deals exclusively
with program costs, with and without the waiver. As noted above, we will continue to require States to submit estimates
of the number of unduplicated waiver recipients it will serve in each year of the waiver term. This figure will be indicated
as ``C'' value and may be revised as a State deems necessary. 



2. Provisions of the Final Rule 



We have adopted, as final, the revised  441.303(f) and the proposed new  441.305 that incorporated the
provision of section 1915(c)(9) of the Act as added by section 9502(i) of COBRA, with one change: We have revised paragraph
 441.305(b) to specify that there is a 200-person limit (instead of 50) for model waivers under section 1915(c)(10)
as amended by section 411(k)(10)(A) of MCCA. The revised  441.303(f) reads, ``An explanation with supporting
documentation satisfactory to HCFA of how the agency estimated the average per capita expenditures for services.''
We will consider timely comments on these revisions. 

We are also redesignating proposed  441.302(g) as (h) and adding a new  441.302(g) to require that a State
provide assurance that, absent a waiver, recipients in the waiver would receive the appropriate type of Medicaid-funded
institutional care (hospital, NF, or ICF/MR) that they require. We will consider timely comments on this addition.




J. Waiver Extensions and Renewals 



1. Background 



Initially, section 1915(c) of the Act provided that approved home and community-based services waivers could be
granted for an initial term of 3 years and could be extended for additional 3-year periods if a State requests an extension.
The Secretary could approve a request for a waiver extension if the extension request met the waiver requirements
for the extended period and HCFA determined that the State met all of the required assurances for the term of the initial
waiver. 

Section 9502(f) of COBRA provided that the Secretary, upon a State's request, may extend any home and community-based
services waiver that expired on or after September 30, 1985, and before September 30, 1986, subject to the State's
meeting all requirements for the waiver. The extension granted must be for a period of not less than 1 year and no more
than 5 years. 

Section 9502(g) of COBRA amended section 1915(c)(3) of the Act to revise the periods of time for which a waiver may be
renewed from additional 3-year periods to additional 5-year periods under section 9502(j)(6) of COBRA. This amendment
is effective for waiver renewals approved on or after September 30, 1986. 

In our proposed rule, we revised  441.304(a) to change waiver extension or renewal periods to reflect the statutory
requirements. We did not receive any public comments on this provision. 

Section 4102(c) of OBRA `87 provided that the Secretary extend approval of a State's section 1915(c) waiver for the
elderly on the same terms and conditions through September 30, 1988, when (l) the State as of December 1, 1987, had a
waiver approved for elderly individuals under section 1915(c) of the Act; (2) the waiver was scheduled to expire before
July 1, 1988; and (3) the State notified the Secretary of its intention to file an application for a waiver under section
1915(d) of the Act. 



2. Provisions of the Final Rule 



We have adopted, as a final rule, the proposed  441.304(a) to change the waiver extension and renewal periods
to conform to section 1915(c)(3), as amended by section 9502(g) of COBRA. We have not included in the final rule changes
to paragraph (a)(2) that were included in the proposed rule because those changes are no longer necessary. 



K. Technical/Administrative Changes 



1. Terminology Change 



We have revised proposed  440.185 and amended  441.301 through  441.304 and  441.310 by changing
references to ``SNF'' and ``ICF'' to ``NF'' to conform them to nomenclature changes made to section 1915(c) by section
4211(a)(3) of OBRA `87. 



2. Independent Assessment 



Although not specifically addressed in the proposed rule, a State agency asserted that our requirement in  441.303(g)
for an independent assessment of a State's waiver program that evaluates the quality of care, the access to care, and
the cost effectiveness is costly and duplicates HCFA's regional office (RO) reviews. 

Since the publication of this requirement (50 FR 10028, March 13, 1985), various State agencies have asserted that
the requirement is costly, unproductive, and duplicative of RO assessments. We agree with the commenter and are making
the independent assessment voluntary. If a State determines it will contract for an independent assessment, FFP
is available for the costs attributable to the assessment. The results should be forwarded to HCFA by the 90th day prior
to expiration of the approved waiver and cover at least the first 24 or 48 months of the waiver.

3. Provision of Final Rule 



We are revising 441.303(g) to read as follows: ``The agency, at it option, may provide for an independent assessment
of its waiver that evaluates the quality of care provided, access to care, and the cost-neutrality. The results of
the assessment should be submitted to HCFA at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the waiver and cover the first
24 or 48 months of the waiver. If a State chooses to provide for an independent assessment, FFP is available for the costs
attributable to the independent assessment.'' 



III. Respiratory Care Services 



A. Background 



Until the enactment of OBRA '86, the Medicaid statute did not permit payment for respiratory therapy services in a
patient's home as a separate and distinct State plan service. Previously, such services could only be provided as
a component of other State plan services or as a home and community-based service under a section 1915(c) waiver. For
example, certain types of respiratory therapy services in the home were available when provided as a medically necessary
component of covered home health nursing services. States also had the option of providing respiratory therapy services
as an element of three other optional Medicaid benefits: medical or remedial care provided by a licensed practitioner,
private duty nursing, and rehabilitative services. Thus, when respiratory care was available previously under
the Medicaid State plan, it was provided as a part of a broader coverage authority. Because these authorities did not
allow respiratory care services to be directed only to a specific population but required that such services be available
to all recipients, very few States provided coverage for respiratory care services. Moreover, while respiratory
care services could be provided to a specific population under a home and community-based services waiver, States'
use of this waiver process to provide coverage was limited. 

Section 9408(a) of OBRA '86 amended section 1902(e) of the Act to provide, under paragraph (9), that, at the option
of the State, a State Medicaid plan may be amended to include respiratory care services as medical assistance for an
individual who: 

 Is medically dependent on a ventilator for life support at least 6 hours per day; 

 Has been so dependent on ventilator support for at least 30 consecutive days as an inpatient (or the maximum
number of days of inpatient care authorized under the State plan, if less than 30 days) as demonstrated by a continuous
stay in one or more hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR; 

 But for the availability of respiratory care services, would require respiratory care as an inpatient in a
hospital, NF, or ICF/MR and would be eligible to have payment made for inpatient care under the State plan; 

 Has adequate social support services to be cared for at home; and 

 Wishes to be cared for at home. 

Under this provision, respiratory care services are services provided on a part-time basis in the home of the individual
by a respiratory therapist or other health care professional who is trained in respiratory therapy (as determined
by the State). The services under this benefit may not be included within other items and services furnished to these
individuals as medical assistance under the State Medicaid plan. 

Section 9408(b) of OBRA '86 amended section 1902(a)(10) of the Act by adding item (IX) in the matter following section
1902(a)(10)(E), to provide that a State is not required to make respiratory care services (as defined in section 1902(e)(9)(C)
of the Act) available, or available in the same amount, duration, and scope, to individuals who do not meet the criteria
in section 1902(e)(9)(A) of the Act. However, if the State provides this benefit, it is required to make respiratory
care services available in the same amount, duration, and scope to all Medicaid recipients who do meet the criteria
in section 1902(e)(9)(A) of the Act. 

Section 9408(c) of OBRA '86 includes respiratory care services under the definition of medical assistance in section
1905(a)(20) of the Act and makes technical conforming amendments to sections 1902(a)(10)(C)(iv) and 1902(j) of
the Act. 

In our proposed rule, we added_

 A new  440.185 to allow a State the option to amend State Medicaid plan coverage of respiratory therapy
services for ventilator-dependent individuals under the specific conditions of coverage that were enumerated
by section 9408(a) of OBRA '86; 

 A new  440.250(o) to the list of exceptions to the comparability of service requirement. In following
the statutory language in section 9408(a) of OBRA '86, we also indicated that respiratory care services for ventilator-dependent
individuals are exempt from the general comparability requirement that services be provided in equal amount, duration,
and scope to any eligible group under the State plan. We have, however, required comparability of services among those
Medicaid-eligible persons under the State plan satisfying the explicit conditions of coverage for these services.


Six entities submitted comments concerning respiratory care services as a new optional Medicaid benefit. 



Comment:

 One commenter asked whether respiratory care equipment, particularly ventilators, would be covered as equipment
under the new benefit.

<PARENT> FR940725-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 Ventilators will not be covered under this benefit. Section 1902(e)(9) of the Act, as added by section 9408 of OBRA
'86, provides for respiratory therapy services, not equipment, to be provided to ventilator-dependent individuals
as an optional service. The statute and accompanying conference committee report (H. Rept. No. 1012, 99th Cong.,
2d Sess. 413-414 (1986)) do not suggest that equipment required in the home (such as ventilators, needed to sustain
the recipient's health and welfare) would be included. Such equipment is supplied by the State as a home health benefit
under  440.70(b)(3), that mandates the provision of medical supplies, equipment, and appliances suitable
for use in the home. In addition, States that pay for the optional prosthetic devices benefit may cover ventilators
as a prosthetic device that supports a weak or deformed portion of the body under  440.120(c)(3). 


Comment:

 Another commenter asked us to define a recipient's home. 


Response:

 A recipient's home is a place of residence other than a hospital, NF, ICF/MR, or other institution as defined at  435.1009.
We have revised  440.185 to specify that a recipient's home does not include these facilities. 


Comment:

 Two commenters suggested that more medical direction be required in decisions regarding the provision of respiratory
therapy at home. One commenter proposed the use of medically sound criteria to determine eligibility and the other
commenter recommended that more physician oversight and involvement in the direction of care be required. 


Response:

 We agree with the commenters concerning the need for greater medical direction for individuals in need of respiratory
care services. We have added  440.185(a)(6) to require the direction of a physician who is familiar with the
technical and medical components of home ventilator support and who has determined that in-home care is safe and feasible.



Comment:

 One commenter stated that the regulations implementing the option to provide respiratory care services are too restrictive
and limited as a Medicaid State plan option because respiratory care services would be limited to individuals who
(1) need at least 6 hours of ventilator support for life support, (2) depend on ventilator support for at least 30 consecutive
days and (3) require respiratory care as an inpatient. 


Response:

 Our proposed regulations closely followed the statutory language and the only restrictions we imposed were those
contained in the statute. In response to comments, we are now adding the requirement that a recipient receive respiratory
care services under the direction of a physician who is familiar with the technical and medical components of home
ventilator support and who has determined that in-home care is safe and feasible. 


Comment:

 One commenter was concerned that the payment rate for in-home respiratory therapy would not be adequate. 


Response:

 Under the Medicaid program, the State establishes the payment rate within broad Federal guidelines. We believe it
would be inappropriate to dictate a special payment procedure for this service. 


Comment:

 One commenter requested that HCFA specifically refer to ``respiratory therapy technician'' as approved provider
of respiratory care services to effectively recognize another level of skilled respiratory care practitioner.



Response:

 Section 9408(a) of OBRA '86 does not anticipate or require that we specify which practitioners or technicians are
accepted by the States as providers. In the proposed rule (53 FR 19957 and 19960), we designated a broad and inclusive
category ``other health care professional trained in respiratory therapy (as determined by the State)'' in the preamble
and in  440.185 of the regulation text. This ``other'' category could include the respiratory therapy technician
as well as other types of skilled practitioners to the degree that they are recognized under State law. 


B. Provisions of the Final Rule 


We are adopting the proposed regulations under  440.185 and  440.250(o) as final rules with the following
modifications: 
 We have added  440.185(a)(6) to require that (1) an individual who receives home respiratory care must
receive these services under the care of a physician who is familiar with the technical and medical components of home
ventilator support, and (2) that this physician must determine medically that in-home care is safe and feasible for
the recipient. 
 We have revised  440.185(b) to specify the facilities that are not considered to be a recipient's home.

IV. Regulatory Impact Analysis 


A. Introduction 


Any impact of this final rule with comment period upon providers will be the result of individual State decisions as
developed in waiver requests and including coverage of respiratory care for ventilator-dependent individuals.
Due to the positive reception of the home and community-based waiver program, we believe that this rule will be well-received
by those concerned with such programs. This rule generally benefits States and providers. The revisions to regulations
covering home and community-based waivers offer broader service coverage than current rules and may result in new
waiver applications and expansion of existing waivers. Thus, there may be more funds flowing through waivers. Because
of the appeal of the program to States, the proportion of Medicaid expenditures flowing through home and community-based
waivers is growing. The broader coverage made possible under this final rule with comment period is one factor that
offers opportunity for further growth. Waivers would also be approved for longer periods, which may increase the
aggregate magnitude of granted waivers. 
Thus, although this final rule with comment period should contribute to the growth of expenditures under waivers,
we are unable to isolate the effects of this final rule from other factors affecting the growth of waivers. 
If this final rule with comment period results in a substantial increase in the growth of waivers, it could affect small
entities. Most entities would benefit_contingent upon State decisions that cannot be predicted. Although the changes
being implemented in this final rule will facilitate the approval of an increased volume of waivers, we do not expect
the rule in itself to increase waivers to the extent that a demonstrable significant economic impact would result.
With the exception of the revision to  441.303(f)(1) that eliminates the bed capacity (also called the ``cold
bed test'') factor from the annual average per capita expenditures estimate, regulations establishing terms or
conditions of Federal grants, contracts, or financial assistance call for a different form of regulatory analysis
than do other types of regulations. In some instances, an extensive benefit-cost analysis may be appropriate to inform
the Congress and the President more fully about the desirability of the program, but this would not ordinarily be required
in a regulatory impact analysis. The primary function of an RIA for this type of regulation should be to verify that
the terms and conditions are the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose for which the funds were appropriated. Beyond
controls to prevent abuse and to ensure that funds appropriated to achieve a specific purpose are channeled efficiently
toward that end, maximum discretion should be allowed in the use of Federal funds particularly when the recipient
is a State or local government. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule does not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all providers to be small entities.
Thus, both those providers that lose patients deinstitutionalized into the home or community and the home and community-based
providers of services that receive these patients/recipients are small entities. This final rule will also affect
States and Medicaid recipients, but they are not considered small entities under the RFA. 


C. Effect on Medicaid Program Costs 


We anticipate that the discretionary provision to eliminate the bed capacity test may result in the following costs:

These cost increases are due to the expectation that more individuals will be eligible for home and community-based
waiver services under Medicaid as a result of the elimination of the bed capacity test. However, it should be noted
that the State costs reflected in the above chart may include costs that are currently being, or will be in the future,
spent by States to provide medical assistance under programs other than Medicaid. Additionally, we believe that
costs for waiver growth may be limited as a result of the fiscal capacities of the States. 
Under section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act, the estimated average per capita expenditure under a home and community-based
waiver may not exceed 100 percent of the estimated average per capita expenditure that the State reasonably estimates
would have been made if the waiver had not been granted. All States have assured HCFA of this as a condition of waiver
approval. Thus, under the law, this final rule is expected to be technically budget neutral with the exception of the
costs associated with the elimination of the bed capacity test. However, section 9502 of COBRA and sections 9408 and
9411 of OBRA '86 have negligible costs associated with them overall. It is difficult to determine and may be impossible
to assess precisely whether these changes would substantially affect the rate of growth in Medicaid expenditures.

We expect coverage of home respiratory care for ventilator-dependent individuals to have a similar impact. This
new program also allows home care as an alternative to institutionalization. New programs may be added as alternatives
to institutionalization as a result of this final rule with comment period. 
We do not expect that the adoption of this final rule with comment period will result in a major increase in costs or prices
for consumers, individual industries, or local government agencies in any geographic region. Employment in institutional
care is more capital intensive; home and community services are more labor intensive. Increased costs or revenue
losses may be experienced by providers (both their owners and employees) that formerly served institutionalized
recipients. Although an institutional provider of services may be adversely affected by the existence of a waiver
in its area, it may choose to provide services covered under a home and community-based waiver, and the adverse impact
probably will be offset by increased business. 
In conclusion, home and community-based waivers and respiratory care for ventilator-dependent individuals generally
may result in services being furnished in different settings, often by different providers, with possibly some losses
in revenue by some providers offset by increases to other providers. We do not consider this redistributive effect
to be significant. We do expect recipients to benefit from a deinstitutionalized life and from the services that may
be provided under these provisions. 


D. Rural Hospital Impact Statement 


Section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis
for any final rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.
Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act,
we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside a metropolitan statistical area.
We have determined and the Secretary certifies that this final rule with comment period will not have a significant
impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 


E. Executive Order 12866 


In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this notice was reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget. 


V. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 


Sections 440.180, 441.301 and 441.303 of this final rule with comment period contain information collection requirements
that are subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The public
is not required to comply with the information collection requirements until OMB approves these requirements under
section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507). A notice will be published in the Federal Register

 when approval is obtained.

(8) Day treatment or other partial hospitalization services, psychosocial rehabilitation services and clinic
services (whether or not furnished in a facility) for individuals with chronic mental illness, subject to the conditions
specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

(9) Other services requested by the agency and approved by HCFA as cost effective and necessary to avoid institutionalization.

(c) 

Expanded habilitation services, effective April 7, 1986

_(1) 

General rule.

 Expanded habilitation services are those services specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that are provided
to recipients who have been discharged from a Medicaid-certified NF or ICF/MR, regardless of when the discharge occurred.

(2) 

Services included.

 The agency may include as expanded habilitation services the following services:

(i) Prevocational services, which means services that prepare an individual for paid or unpaid employment and that
are not job-task oriented but are, instead, aimed at a generalized result. These services may include, for example,
teaching an individual such concepts as compliance, attendance, task completion, problem solving and safety. Prevocational
services are distinguishable from noncovered vocational services by the following criteria:

(A) The services are provided to persons who are not expected to be able to join the general work force or participate
in a transitional sheltered workshop within one year (excluding supported employment programs).

(B) If the recipients are compensated, they are compensated at less than 50 percent of the minimum wage;

(C) The services include activities which are not primarily directed at teaching specific job skills but at underlying
habilitative goals (for example, attention span, motor skills); and

(D) The services are reflected in a plan of care directed to habilitative rather than explicit employment objectives.

(ii) Educational services, which means special education and related services (as defined in sections 602(16) and
(17) of the Education of the Handicapped Act) (20 U.S.C. 1401 (16 and 17)) to the extent they are not prohibited under
paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.

(iii) Supported employment services, which facilitate paid employment, that are_

(A) Provided to persons for whom competitive employment at or above the minimum wage is unlikely and who, because of
their disabilities, need intensive ongoing support to perform in a work setting;

(B) Conducted in a variety of settings, particularly worksites in which persons without disabilities are employed;
and

(C) Defined as any combination of special supervisory services, training, transportation, and adaptive equipment
that the State demonstrates are essential for persons to engage in paid employment and that are not normally required
for nondisabled persons engaged in competitive employment.

(3) 

Services not included.

 The following services may not be included as habilitation services:

(i) Special education and related services (as defined in sections 602(16) and (17) of the Education of the Handicapped
Act) (20 U.S.C. 1401 (16) and (17)) that are otherwise available to the individual through a local educational agency.

(ii) Vocational rehabilitation services that are otherwise available to the individual through a program funded
under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 730).

(d) 

Services for the chronically mentally ill

_(1) 

Services included.

 Services listed in paragraph (b)(8) of this section include those provided to individuals who have been diagnosed
as being chronically mentally ill, for which the agency has requested approval as part of either a new waiver request
or a renewal and which have been approved by HCFA on or after October 21, 1986.

(2) 

Services not included.

 Any home and community-based service, including those indicated in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, may not be included
in home and community-based service waivers for the following individuals:

(i) For individuals aged 22 through 64 who, absent the waiver, would be institutionalized in an institution for mental
diseases (IMD); and, therefore, subject to the limitation on IMDs specified in  435.1008(a)(2) of this subchapter.

(ii) For individuals, not meeting the age requirements described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, who, absent
the waiver, would be placed in an IMD in those States that have not opted to include the benefits defined in  440.140
or  440.160.

3. Section 440.185 is added to read as follows:



 440.185

 Respiratory care for ventilator-dependent individuals.



(a) ``Respiratory care for ventilator-dependent individuals'' means services that are not otherwise available
under the State's Medicaid plan, provided on a part-time basis in the recipient's home by a respiratory therapist
or other health care professional trained in respiratory therapy (as determined by the State) to an individual who_

(1) Is medically dependent on a ventilator for life support at least 6 hours per day;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940725-0-00108 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940725-0-00013 </PARENT>

(2) Has been so dependent for at least 30 consecutive days (or the maximum number of days authorized under the State
plan, whichever is less) as an inpatient in one or more hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR;

(3) Except for the availability of respiratory care services, would require respiratory care as an inpatient in a
hospital, NF, or ICF/MR and would be eligible to have payment made for inpatient care under the State plan;

(4) Has adequate social support services to be cared for at home;

(5) Wishes to be cared for at home; and

(6) Receives services under the direction of a physician who is familiar with the technical and medical components
of home ventilator support, and who has medically determined that in-home care is safe and feasible for the individual.

(b) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section, a recipient's home does not include a hospital, NF, ICF/MR
or other institution as defined in  435.1009.

4. In  440.250, a new paragraph (o) is added to read as follows:



 440.250

 Limits on comparability of services.



* * * * *



(o) If the agency makes respiratory care services available under  440.185, the services need not be made available
in equal amount, duration, and scope to any individual not eligible for coverage under that section. However, the
services must be made available in equal amount, duration, and scope to all individuals eligible for coverage under
that section.



* * * * *



C. Part 441 is amended as follows:



PART 441_SERVICES: REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITS APPLICABLE TO SPECIFIC SERVICES



1. The authority citation for Part 441 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 Sec. 1102 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1302).




2. In  441.301, paragraph (a) is revised; the introductory text of paragraph (b) is revised; the introductory
text of paragraph (b)(1) is republished; paragraph (b)(1)(ii) is revised; a new paragraph (b)(1)(iii) is added;
and paragraph (b)(4) is revised to read as follows:



 441.301

 Contents of request for a waiver.



(a) A request for a waiver under this section must consist of the following:

(1) The assurances required by  441.302 and the supporting documentation required by  441.303.

(2) When applicable, requests for waivers of the requirements of section 1902(a)(1), section 1902(a)(10)(B), or
section 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of the Act, which concern respectively, statewide application of Medicaid, comparability
of services, and income and resource rules applicable to individuals with spouses living in the community.

(3) A statement explaining whether the agency will refuse to offer home or community-based services to any recipient
if the agency can reasonably expect that the cost of the services would exceed the cost of an equivalent level of care
provided in_

(i) A hospital (as defined in  440.10 of this chapter);

(ii) A NF (as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act); or

(iii) An ICF/MR (as defined in  440.150 of this chapter), if applicable.

(b) If the agency furnishes home and community-based services, as defined in  440.180 of this subchapter, under
a waiver granted under this subpart, the waiver request must_

(1) Provide that the services are furnished_



* * * * *



(ii) Only to recipients who are not inpatients of a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR; and

(iii) Only to recipients who the agency determines would, in the absence of these services, require the Medicaid covered
level of care provided in_

(A) A hospital (as defined in  440.10 of this chapter);

(B) A NF (as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act); or

(C) An ICF/MR (as defined in  440.150 of this chapter);



* * * * *



(4) Describe the services to be furnished so that each service is separately defined. Multiple services that are generally
considered to be separate services may not be consolidated under a single definition. Commonly accepted terms must
be used to describe the service and definitions may not be open ended in scope. HCFA will, however, allow combined service
definitions (bundling) when this will permit more efficient delivery of services and not compromise either a recipient's
access to or free choice of providers.



* * * * *



3. In  441.302, the introductory paragraph is revised; paragraphs (c) and (e) are revised; paragraph (f) is
redesignated as paragraph (h) and republished; and new paragraphs (f), (g), (i), and (j) are added to read as follows:



 441.302

 State assurances.



Unless the Medicaid agency provides the following satisfactory assurances to HCFA, HCFA will not grant a waiver under
this subpart and may terminate a waiver already granted:

(c) 

Evaluation of need.

_Assurance that the agency will provide for the following:

(1) 

Initial evaluation.

_An evaluation of the need for the level of care provided in a hospital, a NF, or an ICF/MR when there is a reasonable indication
that a recipient might need the services in the near future (that is, a month or less) unless he or she receives home or
community-based services. For purposes of this section, ``evaluation'' means a review of an individual recipient's
condition to determine_

(i) If the recipient requires the level of care provided in a hospital as defined in  440.40 of this subchapter,
a NF as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act, or an ICF/MR as defined by  440.150 of this subchapter; and

(ii) That the recipient, but for the provision of waiver services, would otherwise be institutionalized in such a
facility.

(2) 

Periodic reevaluations.

_Reevaluations, at least annually, of each recipient receiving home or community-based services to determine if
the recipient continues to need the level of care provided and would, but for the provision of waiver services, otherwise
be institutionalized in one of the following institutions:

(i) A hospital;

(ii) A NF; or

(iii) An ICF/MR.



* * * * *



(e) 

Average per capita expenditures.

_Assurance that the average per capita fiscal year expenditures under the waiver will not exceed 100 percent of the
average per capita expenditures that would have been made in the fiscal year for the level of care provided in a hospital,
NF, or ICF/MR under the State plan had the waiver not been granted.

(1) These expenditures must be reasonably estimated and documented by the agency.

(2) The estimate must be on an annual basis and must cover each year of the waiver period.

(f) 

Actual total expenditures.

_Assurance that the agency's actual total expenditures for home and community-based and other Medicaid services
under the waiver and its claim for FFP in expenditures for the services provided to recipients under the waiver will
not, in any year of the waiver period, exceed 100 percent of the amount that would be incurred by the State's Medicaid
program for these individuals, absent the waiver, in_

(1) A hospital;

(2) A NF; or

(3) An ICF/MR.

(g) 

Institutionalization absent waiver.

_Assurance that, absent the waiver, recipients in the waiver would receive the appropriate type of Medicaid-funded
institutional care (hospital, NF, or ICF/MR) that they require.

(h) 

Reporting.

_Assurance that annually, the agency will provide HCFA with information on the waiver's impact. That information
must be consistent with a data collection plan designed by HCFA and must address the waiver's impact on_

(1) The type, amount, and cost of services provided under the State plan; and

(2) The health and welfare of recipients.

(i) 

Habilitation services.

_Assurance that prevocational, educational, or supported employment services, or a combination of these services,
if provided as habilitation services under the waiver, are_

(1) Not otherwise available to the individual through a local educational agency under section 602 (16) and (17) of
the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C. 1401 (16 and 17)) or as services under section 110 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 730); and

(2) Furnished only to individuals who have been deinstitutionalized, regardless of discharge date from a Medicaid-certified
NF or ICF/MR.

(3) Furnished as part of expanded habilitation services on or after April 7, 1986, if the State has requested and received
HCFA's approval under a waiver or an amendment to a waiver.

(j) 

Day treatment or partial hospitalization, psychosocial rehabilitation services, and clinic services for individuals
with chronic mental illness.

 Assurance that FFP will not be claimed in expenditures for waiver services including, but not limited to, day treatment
or partial hospitalization, psychosocial rehabilitation services, and clinic services provided as home and community-based
services to individuals with chronic mental illnesses if these individuals, in the absence of a waiver, would be placed
in an IMD and are_

(1) Age 22 to 64;

(2) Age 65 and older and the State has not included the optional Medicaid benefit cited in  440.140; or

(3) Age 21 and under and the State has not included the optional Medicaid benefit cited in  440.160.

4. In  441.303, the introductory paragraph is revised; the introductory text of paragraph (c) is republished;
paragraph (c)(2) is revised; the introductory text of paragraph (f) is revised; paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) are
revised; (f)(3) is removed; paragraph (f)(4) is redesignated as paragraph (f)(3) and revised; new paragraphs (f)(4),
(5), (6), (7), (8), (9), and (10) are added; paragraph (g) is revised; and new paragraphs (h) and (i) are added to read
as follows:



 441.303

 Supporting documentation required.



The agency must furnish HCFA with sufficient information to support the assurances required by  441.302. Except
as HCFA may otherwise specify for particular waivers, the information must consist of the following:



* * * * *



(c) A description of the agency's plan for the evaluation and reevaluation of recipients, including_



* * * * *



(2) A copy of the evaluation form to be used; and if it differs from the form used in placing recipients in hospitals,
NFs, or ICFs/MR, a description of how and why it differs and an assurance that the outcome of the new evaluation form
is reliable, valid, and fully comparable to the form used for hospital, NF, or ICF/MR placement;



* * * * *



(f) An explanation with supporting documentation satisfactory to HCFA of how the agency estimated the average per
capita expenditures for services.

(1) The annual average per capita expenditure estimate of the cost of home and community-based and other Medicaid
services under the waiver must not exceed the estimated annual average per capita expenditures of the cost of services
in the absence of a waiver. The estimates are to be based on the following equation:



D+D
' > G+G
'.




The symbol ``>'' means that the result of the left side of the equation must be less than or 

equal

 to the result of the right side of the equation.

D = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for home and community-based services for individuals in
the waiver program.

D
' = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for all other services provided to individuals in
the waiver program.

G = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for hospital, NF, or ICF/MR care that would be incurred for
individuals served in the waiver, were the waiver not granted.

G
' = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid costs for all services other than those included in factor
G for individuals served in the waiver, were the waiver not granted.




(2) For purposes of the equation, the prime factors include the average per capita cost for all State plan services
and expanded EPSDT services provided that are not accounted for in other formula values.

(3) In making estimates of average per capita expenditures for a waiver that applies only to individuals with a particular
illness (for example, acquired immune deficiency syndrome) or condition (for example, chronic mental illness)
who are inpatients in or who would require the level of care provided in hospitals as defined by  440.10, NFs as
defined in section 1919(a) of the Act, or ICFs/MR, the agency may determine the average per capita expenditures for
these individuals absent the waiver without including expenditures for other individuals in the affected hospitals,
NFs, or ICFs/MR.

(4) In making estimates of average per capita expenditures for a separate waiver program that applies only to individuals
identified through the preadmission screening annual resident review (PASARR) process who are developmentally
disabled, inpatients of a NF, and require the level of care provided in an ICF/MR as determined by the State on the basis
of an evaluation under  441.303(c), the agency may determine the average per capita expenditures that would
have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals based on the average per capita expenditures for inpatients in
an ICF/MR. When submitting estimates of institutional costs without the waiver, the agency may use the average per
capita costs of ICF/MR care even though the deinstitutionalized developmentally disabled were inpatients of NFs.

(5) For persons diverted rather than deinstitutionalized, the State's evaluation process required by  441.303(c)
must provide for a more detailed description of their evaluation and screening procedures for recipients to ensure
that waiver services will be limited to persons who would otherwise receive the level of care provided in a hospital,
NF, or ICF/MR, as applicable.

(6) The State must indicate the number of unduplicated beneficiaries to which it intends to provide waiver services
in each year of its program. This number will constitute a limit on the size of the waiver program unless the State requests
and the Secretary approves a greater number of waiver participants in a waiver amendment. 

(7) In determining the average per capita expenditures that would have been made in a waiver year, for waiver estimates
that apply to persons with mental retardation or related conditions, the agency may include costs of Medicaid residents
in ICFs/MR that have been terminated on or after November 5, 1990. 

(8) In submitting estimates for waivers that include personal caregivers as a waiver service, the agency may include
a portion of the rent and food attributed to the unrelated personal caregiver who resides in the home or residence of
the recipient covered under the waiver. The agency must submit to HCFA for review and approval the method it uses to
apportion the costs of rent and food. The method must be explained fully to HCFA. A personal caregiver provides a waiver
service to meet the recipient's physical, social, or emotional needs (as opposed to services not directly related
to the care of the recipient; that is, housekeeping or chore services). FFP for live-in caregivers is not available
if the recipient lives in the caregiver's home or in a residence that is owned or leased by the caregiver. 

(9) In submitting estimates for waivers that apply to individuals with mental retardation or a related condition,
the agency may adjust its estimate of average per capita expenditures to include increases in expenditures for ICF/MR
care resulting from implementation of a PASARR program for making determinations for individuals with mental retardation
or related conditions on or after January 1, 1989. 

(10) For a State that has HCFA approval to bundle waiver services, the State must continue to compute separately the
costs and utilization of the component services that make up the bundled service to support the final cost and utilization
of the bundled service that will be used in the cost-neutrality formula. 

(g) The State, at its option, may provide for an independent assessment of its waiver that evaluates the quality of
care provided, access to care, and cost-neutrality. The results of the assessment should be submitted to HCFA at least
90 days prior to the expiration date of the approved waiver-period and cover the first 24 or 48 months of the waiver.
If a State chooses to provide for an independent assessment, FFP is available for the costs attributable to the independent
assessment.

(h) For States offering habilitation services that include prevocational, educational, or supported employment
services, or a combination of these services, consistent with the provisions of  440.180(c) of this chapter,
an explanation of why these services are not available as special education and related services under sections 602
(16) and (17) of the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C. 1401 (16 and 17)) or as services under section 110 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. section 730); 

(i) For States offering home and community-based services for individuals diagnosed as chronically mentally ill,
an explanation of why these individuals would not be placed in an institution for mental diseases (IMD) absent the
waiver, and the age group of these individuals. 

5. In  441.304, paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) are revised to read as follows: 



 441.304 

Duration of a waiver. 



(a) The effective date for a new waiver of Medicaid requirements to provide home and community-based services approved
under this subpart is established by HCFA prospectively on or after the date of approval and after consultation with
the State agency. The initial approved waiver continues for a 3-year period from the effective date. If the agency
requests it, the waiver may be extended for additional periods unless_ 

(1) HCFA's review of the prior waiver period shows that the assurances required by  441.302 were not met; and


(2) HCFA is not satisfied with the assurances and documentation provided by the State in regard to the extension period.


(b) HCFA will determine whether a request for extension of an existing waiver is actually an extension request or a
request for a new waiver. If a State submits an extension request that would add a new group to the existing group of recipients
covered under the waiver (as defined under  441.301(b)(6)), HCFA will consider it to be two requests: One as
an extension request for the existing group, and the other as a new waiver request for the new group. Waivers may be extended
for additional 5-year periods. 



* * * * * 



(d) If HCFA finds that an agency is not meeting one or more of the requirements for a waiver contained in this subpart,
the agency is given a notice of HCFA's findings and an opportunity for a hearing to rebut the findings. If HCFA determines
that the agency is not in compliance with this subpart after the notice and any hearing, HCFA may terminate the waiver.
For example, a State submits to HCFA a waiver request for home and community-based services that includes an estimate
of the expenditures that would be incurred if the services were provided to the covered individuals in a hospital,
NF, or ICF/MR in the absence of the waiver. HCFA approves the waiver. At the end of the waiver year, the State submits
to HCFA a report of its actual expenditures under the waiver. HCFA finds that the actual expenditures under the waiver
exceed 100 percent of the State's approved estimate of expenditures for these individuals in a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR
in the absence of the waiver. HCFA next requires the State to amend its estimates for subsequent waiver year(s). HCFA
then compares the revised estimates with the State's actual experience to determine if the revised estimates are
reasonable. HCFA may terminate the waiver if the revised estimates indicate that the waiver is not cost-neutral or
that the revised estimates are unreasonable. 



 441.305 

[Redesignated as  441.307] 



6. Section 441.305 is redesignated as  441.307. 

7. A new  441.305 is added to read as follows: 



 441.305 

Replacement of recipients in approved waiver programs. 



(a) 

Regular waivers.

 A State's estimate of the number of individuals who may receive home and community-based services must include those
who will replace recipients who leave the program for any reason. A State may replace recipients who leave the program
due to death or loss of eligibility under the State plan without regard to any federally-imposed limit on utilization,
but must maintain a record of recipients replaced on this basis.

(b) 

Model waivers. 

(1) The number of individuals who may receive home and community-based services under a model waiver may not exceed
200 recipients at any one time. 

(2) The agency may replace any individuals who die or become ineligible for State plan services to maintain a count
up to the number specified by the State and approved by HCFA within the 200-maximum limit. 



 441.306 

[Redesignated as  441.308] 



8. Section 441.306 is redesignated as  441.308. 

9. A new  441.306 is added to read as follows: 



 441.306 

Cooperative arrangements with the Maternal and Child Health program. 



Whenever appropriate, the State agency administering the plan under Medicaid may enter into cooperative arrangements
with the State agency responsible for administering a program for children with special health care needs under the
Maternal and Child Health program (Title V of the Act) in order to ensure improved access to coordinated services to
meet the children's needs. 

10. Section 441.310 is revised to read as follows: 



 441.310 

Limits on Federal financial participation (FFP). 



(a) FFP for home and community-based services listed in  440.180 of this chapter is not available in expenditures
for the following: 

(1) Services provided in a facility subject to the health and welfare requirements described in  441.302(a)
during any period in which the facility is found not to be in compliance with the applicable State standards described
in that section. 

(2) The cost of room and board except when provided as_

(i) Part of respite care services in a facility approved by the State that is not a private residence; or 

(ii) For waivers that allow personal caregivers as providers of approved waiver services, a portion of the rent and
food that may be reasonably attributed to the unrelated caregiver who resides in the same household with the waiver
recipient. FFP for a live-in caregiver is not available if the recipient lives in the caregiver's home or in a residence
that is owned or leased by the provider of Medicaid services (the caregiver). For purposes of this provision, ``board''
means 3 meals a day or any other full nutritional regimen and does not include meals provided as part of a program of adult
day health services as long as the meals provided do not constitute a ``full'' nutritional regimen. 

(3) Prevocational, educational, or supported employment services, or any combination of these services, as part
of habilitation services that are_

(i) Provided prior to April 7, 1986; 

(ii) Provided in approved waivers that include a definition of ``habilitation services'' but which have not included
prevocational, educational and supported employment services in that definition; 

(iii) Provided to recipients who were never institutionalized in a Medicaid certified NF,or ICF/MR; or 

(iv) Otherwise available to the recipient under either special education and related services as defined in section
602(16) and (17) of the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C. 1401 (16) and (17)) or vocational rehabilitation
services available to the individual through a program funded under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
(29 U.S.C. 730). 

(4) For waiver applications and renewals approved on or after October 21, 1986, home and community-based services
provided to individuals aged 22 through 64 diagnosed as chronically mentally ill who would be placed in an institution
for mental diseases. FFP is also not available for such services provided to individuals aged 65 and over and 21 and
under as an alternative to institutionalization in an IMD if the State does not include the appropriate optional Medicaid
benefits specified at   440.140 and 440.160 of this chapter in its State plan. 

(b) FFP is available for expenditures for expanded habilitation services, as described in  440.180, if the
services are included under a waiver or waiver amendment approved by HCFA on or after April 7, 1986.

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission grants petitions for reconsideration of previous order amending the Commission's rules regarding
document specifications. The rule is amended to eliminate the character per inch requirement for Commission filings.
Instead, the amended rule requires that Commission filings must utilize type of at least 12-point in height, must
be double spaced, and must be filed on A4 or 8.5  x  11 inch (21.6 cm.  x  27.9 cm.) paper with the printed material
not exceeding 6.5  x  9.5 inches (16.5 cm.  x  24.1 cm.).





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Commission's memorandum opinion and order, adopted on July 7, 1994, and released on July 20,
1994. The full text of the memorandum opinion and order is available for inspection and copying during normal business
hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, D.C. The complete text may also be purchased
from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., Suite 140, 2100 M Street NW.,
Washington, DC 20037.



Summary of Memorandum Opinion and Order



1. By its order the Commission granted reconsideration of a previous order, Amendment of Section 1.49 of the Commission's
Rules, 58 FR 63087 (Nov. 30, 1993), that was intended to ensure against the circumvention of the page limitations by
the use of printing reduction processes. To achieve this goal more effectively, the Commission determined on reconsideration
that it would eliminate the character per inch requirement, but that it would amend  1.49(a) to specify with
greater precision the acceptable format for Commission filings. These changes are designed to ensure that all parties
filing a particular pleading have an equal opportunity to make a substantive presentation to the Commission without
regard to whether they have access to sophisticated word processing equipment.
2. Section 1.49(a) continues to require that all Commission filings be double spaced, but the rule is amended to specify
a distance of at least 7/32 of an inch (0.158 cm.) between the lines. Although footnotes and quoted material may be single
spaced, parties are cautioned against abusing the page limitations with filings that contain excessive single spaced
material. The permissible paper size is unchanged but the rule is amended to specify that the margins must be set so
that the printed material does not exceed 6.5  x  6.9 inches (16.5  x  24.1 cm.).

3. The Commission has adopted the suggestion that pleadings must utilize 12-point or larger type, but it has deleted
the character per inch requirement. Such requirement was deemed unnecessary in light specifications as to point
size, margins, and the minimum distance between each line of text.
4. The Commission also amended 47 CFR 1.50 to reflect that briefs should be typewritten or mechanically produced unless
the Commission specifically requests printed briefs, and that typewritten or mechanically produced briefs must
meet all the general format specifications that are set forth in section 1.49(a) of the rules.

Authority: 

Secs. 4, 303, 48 Stat. 1066, 1082, as amended; 47 U.S.C. 154, 303; Implement, 5 U.S.C. 552 and 21 U.S.C. 853a, unless
otherwise noted.





2. Section 1.49 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:


 1.49


Specifications as to pleadings and documents.



(a) All pleadings and documents filed in any Commission proceeding shall be typewritten or prepared by mechanical
processing methods, and shall be filed on A4 (21 cm.  x  29.7 cm.) or on 81/2  x  11 inch (21.6 cm.  x  27.9
cm.) paper with the margins set so that the printed material does not exceed 61/2  x  91/2 inches (16.5 cm.  x 
24.1 cm.). The printed material may be in any typeface of at least 12-point (0.42333 cm. or 12/72
'
') in height. The body of the text must be double spaced with a minimum distance of 7/32 of an inch (0.5556 cm.)
between each line of text. Footnotes and long, indented quotations may be single spaced, but must be in type that is
12-point or larger in height, with at least 1/16 of an inch (0.158 cm.) between each line of text. Counsel are cautioned
against employing extended single spaced passages or excessive footnotes to evade prescribed pleading lengths.
If single-spaced passages or footnotes are used in this manner the pleading will, at the discretion of the Commission,
either be rejected as unacceptable for filing or dismissed with leave to be refiled in proper form. Pleadings may be
printed on both sides of the paper. Pleadings that use only one side of the paper shall be stapled, or otherwise bound,
in the upper left-hand corner; those using both sides of the paper shall be stapled twice, or otherwise bound, along
the left-hand margin so that it opens like a book. The foregoing shall not apply to printed briefs specifically requested
by the Commission, official publications, charted or maps, original documents (or admissible copies thereof) offered
as exhibits, specially prepared exhibits, or if otherwise specifically provided. All copies shall be clearly legible.

The Commission's preference is for briefs that are typewritten or prepared by mechanical processing methods. Printed
briefs will be accepted only if specifically requested by the Commission. Typewritten or mechanically produced
briefs must conform to all of the specifications for pleadings and documents set forth in  1.49.

1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 11, Area 2A to Reopen on July 19 




The July 6 fishing period in Area 2A (Washington, Oregon, and California) resulted in a catch of 125,000 lb (56.7 mt),
leaving nearly 54,000 lb (24.5 mt) yet to be caught from the 178,750 lb (81 mt) catch limit. Area 2A will reopen on July
19 for 10 hours from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. local time. Fishing period limits as indicated in the following table will
be in effect for this opening. Note that the fishing period limits for the three smallest vessel classes have all been
set at the same level.

<TEXT>
 

The fishing period limit is shown in terms of dressed, head-off weight as well as dressed, head-on weight. Fishermen
should be aware that regulations require that all halibut from Area 2A be landed with heads on. The fishing period limit
applies to the vessel, not the individual fisherman, and any landings over the vessel limit will be subject to forfeiture
and may result in a fine. 


Area 4C to Reopen on August 2 


The IPHC has determined that nearly 676,000 lb (306.6 mt) were harvested from Area 4C during 14 1-day fishing periods
between June 3 and June 30. As the total catch is 24,000 lb (10.9 mt) less than the catch limit of 700,000 lb (317.5 mt),
the IPHC will reopen Area 4C for a single 24-hour fishing period commencing at 12:00 noon Alaska Daylight Time on August
2 and ending at 12:00 noon Alaska Daylight Time on August 3. A 1,500 lb (0.7 mt) catch limit will apply to all vessels during
this fishing period instead of the 10,000 lb (4.5 mt) limit specified in the 1994 Pacific Halibut Fisheries Regulations.



September Fishing Periods and Limits in Areas 2C, 3A, and 3B 


The IPHC has determined that fishing period limits will not be required in Area 2C during the September opening, but
will be required in Areas 3A and 3B to avoid exceeding the catch limit. 
The IPHC has set the fishing period in all three areas at 48 hours. The fishing periods will open on September 12 at 12:00
noon Alaska Daylight Time, and close on September 14 at 12:00 noon Alaska Daylight Time. Fishing period limits for
Areas 3A and 3B are as follows: 







The above fishing period limits reflect the historical average catch, adjusted by anticipated fleet size and catch
rate to avoid exceeding the catch limit. The appropriate length and letter for each vessel class is printed on each
halibut license. Decals showing the letter have been supplied with the license and should be displayed on the vessel.

In the event that the catch limit in one or more of the three areas is not attained, and sufficient poundage remains to
permit further fishing, the next scheduled fishing period is October 10. NMFS should be contacted regarding sablefish
retention during the halibut opening.

the current sport halibut fishery inside the 30-fathom curve nearest to the coastline as plotted on National Ocean
Service charts numbered 18520, 18580, and 18600 from Cape Falcon to the California border will continue until the
overall catch limit for this area is reached. The fishery is open 7 days a week with a daily bag limit of two halibut per
person, one with a minimum overall size limit of 32 in (81.3 cm) and the second with a minimum overall size limit of 50
in (127 cm). This fishery will close when the remaining catch limit of 2,610 lb (1.2 mt) is reached and the season is closed
by the Commission, or September 30, whichever occurs first.

Area 4B to Close July 9


The IPHC estimates that 15 percent (315,000 lb (142.9 mt)) of the catch limit in Area 4B (Aleutian Islands) will be taken
by the end of the July 9 fishing period. As it was decided at the 1994 Annual Meeting to reserve 85 percent of the Area 4B
catch for the August 15 fishery, the IPHC is canceling fishing periods scheduled from July 11 through August 14. Therefore,
Area 4B will close on July 9 at 8:00 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time and reopen on August 15 to take the remaining catch limit.

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska

AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Modification of a closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is rescinding the closure to directed fishing for the ``other rockfish'' species category in the Eastern Regulatory
Area in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to fully utilize the total allowable catch (TAC) for the ``other
rockfish'' species category in the Eastern Regulatory Area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.


In accordance with  672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the annual TAC for the ``other rockfish'' species category in the
Eastern Regulatory Area, was established by the final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 1048
metric tons (mt). The specifications also closed the directed fishery for the ``other rockfish'' species category
in the Eastern Regulatory Area under  672.20(c)(2)(ii). NMFS has determined that as of July 2, 1994, 917 mt remains
unharvested.
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the 1994 TAC for the ``other rockfish'' species category in
the Eastern Regulatory Area has not been reached and that the remaining amount is sufficient to support a directed
fishery. Therefore, NMFS is rescinding the previous closure and is opening directed fishing for the ``other rockfish''
species category in the Eastern Regulatory Area, effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., July 20, 1994.
All other closures remain in full force and effect.


Classification 


This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.

 The previous Subpart B of part 1915 sets out requirements for work in explosive and other dangerous atmospheres in
vessels and vessel sections and applies to shipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking operations and to related
employment. The final rule being promulgated today extends the protection afforded by these previous rules to employees
entering any confined or enclosed space or working in any other dangerous atmosphere in or out of a shipyard. The final
rule also simplifies and clarifies some of the requirements in the previous standards. 



The final rule includes requirements for a shipyard competent person, a Marine Chemist, a Certified Industrial hygienist,
or a Coast Guard authorized person to evaluate conditions within a confined or enclosed space and to institute measures
to ensure that entrants are protected. It also contains requirements for posting unsafe spaces, for safe performance
of cleaning, cold work, and hot work, and for classifying a person as a shipyard competent person.

I. Background 



A. History of the Regulation



In May 1971, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), under authority granted by section 6(a) of
the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act, 84 Stat. 1590; 29 U.S.C. 655(a)), adopted established Federal
standards issued under section 41 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (44 Stat. 1444, as amended;
33 U.S.C. 941), as standards applicable to ship repairing (29 CFR part 1915), shipbuilding (29 CFR part 1916), and
shipbreaking (29 CFR part 1917) operations. Additionally, other Federal standards and national consensus standards
were similarly adopted as general industry standards (29 CFR part 1910) and were made applicable to all aspects of
shipyard operations not specifically covered by parts 1915, 1916, and 1917. On April 20, 1982 (47 FR 16984), parts
1915, 1916, and 1917 were consolidated into a single part 1915, for shipyard employment. The consolidated set of standards,
entitled ``Occupational Safety and Health Standards for Shipyard Employment,'' eliminated duplicate and overlapping
provisions within the former three parts, but did not alter any substantive requirements. The consolidation had
no effect on the applicability of the general industry standards, in part 1910, to hazards or conditions in shipyard
employment not specifically addressed in the shipyard standards. 

On November 29, 1988, OSHA published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 48092) that would revise its previous standards on explosive and other dangerous atmospheres in vessels and
vessel sections, contained in Subpart B of part 1915. The proposed standards covered safe entry into and work on board
vessels and vessel sections in shipyards. The NPRM proposed the following revisions to the previous Subpart B: 

* Expanding the scope so that the entire subpart applied to all phases of shipyard work on board vessels and vessel sections;


* Adding several definitions; changing the sequence of testing so that requirements for oxygen, flammability, and
toxicity testing are presented in that order (the proposal would not, however, have required testing in that order);


* Increasing the oxygen content required for unprotected confined or enclosed space entry from 16.5 percent by volume
to 19.5 percent by volume; adding a requirement that spaces containing concentrations of toxic contaminants above
the permissible exposure limit be labeled ``Not Safe for Workers''; 

* Adding a requirement for hot work that the concentration of oxygen not exceed 22 percent by volume; adding a requirement
to label spaces if those spaces contain, or are adjacent to a space containing, concentrations of flammable gases
or vapors at or above 10 percent of their lower explosive limit; and 

* Adding two new appendices to aid employers and employees. 

The NPRM also proposed a revision of  1915.7, 

Competent Person.

 The previous  1915.7, which is contained in Subpart A of the Shipyard Standards, defines a competent person
for the purposes of Subparts B, C (Surface Preparation and Preservation), D (Welding, Cutting, and Heating), and
H (Tools and Related Equipment). The proposed revision was intended to eliminate the paperwork burden involved in
designating competent persons, to clarify the skills required of them, and to simplify requirements relating to
logging of inspections and tests. 

The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) gave interested persons until February 27, 1989, to submit comments with
respect to the proposal, to file objections, and to request a hearing. OSHA received over 40 comments in response to
the proposed rulemaking. There were no hearing requests, and no hearing was held. 

A short time after the shipyard proposed rule (Subpart B) was published, in November 1988, the Shipyard Employment
Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) was established to provide OSHA with guidance in revising its shipyard standards
and in developing a vertical standard for the shipyard industry. At several SESAC meetings, the proposed rules in
Subpart B were on the agenda. 

Subsequently, on June 5, 1989 (several months after the comment period closed for the proposed revision of Subpart
B), OSHA published a proposed rule for permit-required confined spaces in general industry (54 FR 24080). This general
industry permit space proposal was intended to apply to land-side (that is, other than on vessels or vessel sections)
operations within shipyards, including all operations and work areas, such as fabricating shops, machine shops,
and staging areas. As a result, shipyard employers would have been required to comply with one set of standards for
shipboard operations (part 1915, Subpart B) and another for land-side operations (part 1910,  1910.146).


The general industry permit space proposal was discussed at several SESAC meetings with a view toward incorporating
applicable requirements into a vertical confined space standard for the entire shipyard. This would make it unnecessary
for the general industry standard to apply to hazardous atmospheres in confined spaces in shipyards, as had been proposed
in the 1910 rulemaking.

At SESAC's meeting of April 25-26, 1990, the Committee recommended that the scope of the proposed shipyard standard
on vessels and vessel sections be expanded to include all confined and enclosed space operations within the shipyard
(Tr. 102, 4/25/90). The committee also recommended that the title of the subpart, originally called ``Explosive
and Dangerous Atmospheres in Vessels and Vessel Sections,'' be changed to clarify that this standard addresses all
confined and enclosed spaces and dangerous atmospheres encountered in shipyard employment. Additionally, SESAC
recommended that several provisions similar to those proposed for general industry be added to subpart B to make it
a comprehensive standard for shipyard employment. The provisions they recommended included a paragraph covering
training requirements and duties of confined space entrants; a new paragraph on self-rescue and rescue teams; and
a new paragraph addressing the duties of employers with respect to on-site contractors. As recommended by SESAC,
the additional provisions would make subpart B a comprehensive set of requirements applicable to the hazards posed
by confined and enclosed spaces and dangerous atmospheres encountered throughout shipyard employment. 
In response to issues raised in various comments submitted to the docket concerning the general industry permit-required
confined spaces proposal and to enable OSHA to place the SESAC recommendations into the subpart B rulemaking record,
the Agency reopened the subpart B record for additional comment (57 FR 28152). In the notice reopening the record,
which was published on June 24, 1992, OSHA invited public comment on seven issues. These issues were: 
(1) Whether or not land-side confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres should be treated separately
from spaces in vessels and vessel sections. 
(2) What kind of training should shipyard confined space workers receive. 
(3) Whether or not subpart B should require attendants for shipyard confined spaces. 
(4) What should be a shipyard employer's duty with respect to rescue services. 
(5) What should be a shipyard employer's duty with respect to contractors and other employers. 
(6) Whether or not hot work permits should be required. 
(7) What are the costs associated with applying requirements from the generic confined spaces standard to shipyards.

Interested persons were given until September 22, 1992, to submit comments. OSHA received 53 comments in response
to the notice reopening the record on the revision of subpart B. 
The final rule on general industry permit-required confined spaces was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 14, 1993 (58 FR 4462). Shipyards were omitted from the scope of the final general industry standard because
the Agency felt that it would be more appropriate to address them in the revision of subpart B of part 1915. The relationship
between subpart B and  1910.146 and OSHA's reasons for adopting a separate rule in subpart B are presented in
the summary and explanation discussion of the scope and application section for subpart B ( 1915.11). 
The information OSHA relied upon to prepare the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), comments received in response
to the (NPRM), to the notice of the reopening of the record, and the exhibits (including the written transcripts of
relevant SESAC meetings) submitted during the period allowed for such submissions, constitute the rulemaking record
for this proceeding. The entire record was carefully considered in the preparation of this final rule. 


B. Significant Risk 


The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has determined that there is a significant risk to the health
and safety of workers who enter confined spaces in shipyards. According to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS), SIC 3731 (Ship building and Repairing) has the highest lost workday case incidence rate for injuries
of any industry (``Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, 1991,'' Bureau of Labor
Statistics, May, 1993). 
The industry as a whole therefore poses the highest risk of injury from all hazards for its employees in the U.S. Within
shipyards, confined space operations are one of the riskiest activities, which is why the industry developed its
own effective confined space procedures that were adopted by OSHA as subpart B in 29 CFR part 1915 in the early 1970s.

At the present time, work in confined spaces on vessels is covered by the current shipyard confined space regulations
in subpart B of part 1915, but work in ``land-side'' confined spaces is not. This work on land-side operations is therefore
not currently addressed by a specific OSHA regulation. These operations were originally included in the scope of
the proposed general industry confined space rule ( 1910.146) but were omitted in the final rule. In the preamble
to that final rule, the Agency noted its intention to cover confined spaces, both on vessels and on land, in its revision
of subpart B of part 1915. (58 FR 4471)

Confined space work on ships is extremely hazardous, and accidents and fatalities still occur when the procedures
of subpart B are not adhered to. OSHA has recorded 20 deaths in the shipyard and boat-building industries from 1983
to 1992 from confined space accidents. The Agency has concluded that the new elements in final subpart B will address
non-compliance and lack of discipline in applying subpart B and will reduce significant risk in confined and enclosed
spaces and other dangerous atmosphere work. These new elements include training, duty to employers (contractors),
and rescue. In addition, the Agency concludes that other additions in the final will reduce risk in confined and enclosed
spaces and other dangerous atmospheres work, including: specifying the order of testing of atmospheres, increasing
the required oxygen content from 16.5 percent to 19.5 percent by volume, restricting oxygen content of spaces for
hot work to 22 percent by volume, and posting notification if spaces contain or are adjacent to spaces that contain,
concentration of flammable gases or vapors at or above 10 percent of there LEL. 


II. Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule 


A. Introduction 



The final rule consists of two parts_a revision of the previous shipyard competent person requirements found in subpart
A and a revision of the requirements for explosive and other dangerous atmospheres found in subpart B. In this section
of the preamble, OSHA is providing a brief explanation of these two revisions to help explain the final rule, together
with a brief overview and explanation of the revised standards. A later section will provide a full summary and explanation
of individual provisions, with complete details and discussion of the rulemaking record. 
OSHA is revising  1915.7, which sets out requirements for the designation and qualification of competent persons.
Under this section, employers must designate one or more competent persons. The employer must provide a roster of
competent persons, which must contain the names of these persons and the dates of their training. Competent persons
are required to know and understand the requirements of subpart B (confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous
atmospheres), C (surface preparation and preservation), D (welding, cutting, and heating), and H (tools and related
equipment); to know the locations and designations of spaces where work is to be performed; to have the ability to calibrate
and use test equipment and perform the tests required by subparts B, C, D, and H; to be able to evaluate whether spaces
need to be tested further by a Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist, or Coast Guard authorized person;
to have the ability to understand and carry out instructions and other information provided by Marine Chemists, Certified
Industrial Hygienists, or U.S. Coast Guard authorized persons; and to have the ability to maintain the records required
by  1915.7. The final rule eliminates the requirement for the employer to complete OSHA Forms 73 

(Designation of Competent Persons)

 and 74 

(Log of Inspection and Tests by Competent Person);

 however, the employer must continue to keep records of all testing performed under subparts B, C, D, and H. 
OSHA is also revising subpart B of part 1915. This subpart sets out requirements for safe entry into and work in shipyard
confined spaces, enclosed spaces, and other dangerous atmospheres. The provisions of this subpart apply to spaces
that might contain oxygen-deficient, oxygen-enriched, flammable, or toxic atmospheres. Examples of such spaces
include spaces that have been sealed, spaces that contain or have contained materials that are flammable, toxic,
corrosive, or irritant, and spaces that are adjacent to these spaces. These spaces must be tested by a competent person
to determine whether or not it is safe for an employee to enter into and work within or on the space. 
The revised subpart B uses a two-tiered approach for evaluating the hazards posed by confined and enclosed spaces
and dangerous atmospheres. The initial evaluation of all spaces is performed by a shipyard competent person. When
this evaluation discovers hazards greater than those that a competent person is capable of handling, the services
of a Marine Chemist or certified industrial hygienist are necessary. The shipyard competent person and these other
qualified individuals work in tandem to ensure the safe entry into and work in confined and enclosed spaces and other
dangerous atmospheres.

If the tests demonstrate that it is safe, then employees may enter the space. If the tests show that it is not safe, then
the space must undergo further evaluation by a Marine Chemist or certified industrial hygienist, and corrective
action must be taken before employees may enter. After further evaluation, the space must be designated as ``Not Safe
for Workers_Enter with Restrictions'' (for example, when ventilation is necessary to maintain flammable concentrations
below 10 percent of the lower explosive limit of a gas or vapor) or ``Not Safe for Workers'' (for example, spaces with
atmospheres that are immediately dangerous to life or health). Spaces designated as ``Not Safe for Workers_Enter
with Restrictions'' or ``Not Safe for Workers'' must be posted with their designation so that employees do not enter
the spaces accidentally. 

Employees who enter confined or enclosed spaces or dangerous atmospheres must be trained to perform their work safely.
The standard requires training in hazard recognition, in the use of protective equipment, and in self-rescue techniques.
The employer must certify that entrants have been trained before they are allowed to enter confined and enclosed spaces
or dangerous atmospheres. In addition, employers must provide for rescue, either by having an on-site rescue team
or by arranging for the use of outside rescue services. 

A space that has contained a flammable or toxic substance must be cleaned before it can be made ``Safe for entry'' without
restrictions. The final rule sets requirements for performing the necessary cold work (such as cleaning, scraping,
inspecting the structure, and surveying the space) usually to prepare the spaces for hot work. First, residues of
hazardous materials must be removed (for example, flammable liquids are pumped out, then the space is cleaned). The
atmosphere within the space must be tested for flammability, and these tests must be repeated as often as necessary
throughout the course of work to ensure that the concentration of flammable gases and vapors is in a safe range. (These
tests are in addition to the tests required before entry.) The standard also requires ignition sources to be controlled
or eliminated during cold work to limit further the possibility of explosion or fire. 

If hot work is to be performed, confined and enclosed spaces and dangerous atmospheres are classified in two groups.
If the spaces contain or have contained flammable liquids or gases or if the spaces are adjacent to such spaces, then
a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person must test and certify the space as safe for hot work. Other types of
confined and enclosed spaces and hazardous atmospheres must be tested for safety by a competent person before hot
work is allowed. 

The standard also contains provisions for maintaining safe working conditions. Pipelines that carry hazardous
materials must be blocked or flushed and cleaned to prevent hazardous materials from discharging into a space. The
space must be tested periodically to ensure that safe working conditions are maintained. Additionally, work operations
must be halted and the space exited when conditions change and the space no longer meets the criteria specified by the
Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person for safe work in or on the space. 

The standard sets requirements for the posting of confined and enclosed spaces and dangerous atmospheres. The signs
must be understood by all employees working in the area and must be posted at the means of access to the work area.

The following summary and explanation of the individual provisions within the standard discusses the important
elements of the final standard, explains the purpose of the individual requirements, and explains any differences
between the final rule and previous standards. This section also discusses and resolves issues that were raised during
the rulemaking period, significant comments received as part of the rulemaking record, and substantive changes
from the language of the proposed rule. References in parentheses are to exhibits (Ex.) and transcripts (Tr.)

 in the rulemaking record. 





B. Subpart A,  1915.7_Competent Person 



In this final rule, OSHA is revising various requirements related to the designation and use of competent persons.
Among the revised provisions are the following: allowing an employer to avoid designating competent persons if their
tasks are always performed by a Marine Chemist; allowing employers to select the form in which they may keep records
on competent persons; clarifying the criteria competent persons must meet; and simplifying the way the competent
person's records of tests and inspections may be kept. In this regard, and as proposed, OSHA is only revising  1915.7,
which establishes both the duty for employers to designate competent persons and the criteria for designating such
persons. The definition for competent person in  1915.4 remains the same. The duties of competent persons,
other than the duties contained in Subpart B and addressed below in this rulemaking, also remain the same. 

In addition to substantive and editorial revisions to the regulatory text of  1915.7 contained in the final
rule, OSHA has reorganized the paragraphs for clarity and coherence. OSHA prefers to place paragraphs addressing
the scope or application of a regulation at the beginning of the applicable paragraphs, sections, or subparts of that
regulation. The previous paragraph addressing the application of  1915.7 is contained in paragraph (d) located
at the end of  1915.7. To be consistent with other OSHA rulemaking, OSHA has redesignated the paragraphs of  1915.7
so that the previous paragraph (d) entitled, ``Application,'' becomes new paragraph (a) in the final rule. Previous
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) have been redesignated (b), (c), and (d), respectively. 



Application. 

Paragraph (a) of the final standard sets forth the application of  1915.7 that was previously contained in paragraph
(d) as discussed above. In addition, editorial changes have been made to improve the language. For example, the old
paragraph specified that application would be to ``employers engaged in general ship repair, shipbuilding and shipbreaking''
while in the new paragraph the general inclusive term ``shipyard employment'' is used. The coverage provided to employees
by the new language is identical. 



Designation of a competent person. 

In paragraph (b)(1), OSHA continues the requirement in old paragraph (a)(1) of  1915.7 that the employer designate
at least one competent person for the purpose of testing the atmospheres of work spaces in shipyard employment unless
all of the employer's testing under Subpart B is performed by an NFPA Certified Marine Chemist. 

OSHA also proposed to delete ``National Fire Protection Association Certified Marine Chemist'' in previous paragraph
(a)(1) and to replace it with ``Marine Chemist.'' The phrase ``National Fire Protection Association Certified''
which modifies ``Marine Chemist'' is redundant since the term ``Marine Chemist'' will be defined in the final rule
as ``an individual who possesses a current Marine Chemist Certificate issued by the National Fire Protection Association.''


OSHA proposed to allow an employer to avoid designating competent persons when the employer states that atmospheric
testing is done by other qualified individuals, who include NFPA Certified Marine Chemists. Some commenters (e.g.,
Exs. 6-3, 6-12, 6-15) asserted that competent persons were as capable as the Marine Chemist in performing
the atmospheric tests required in Subparts B, C, D, and H. For example, Bay Shipbuilding Corp.

(Ex. 6-15) commented: 




If an employer is just dealing with a common element like high flash point fuels, oxygen content, carbon monoxide,
or hydrogen sulfide, which are easily detectable with electronic measuring devices, you do not need a skilled chemist,
provided you have a well trained and equipped competent person. 




OSHA agrees that a competent person is capable of testing atmospheric conditions and certifying spaces for entry,
and that Marine Chemists are certainly capable of performing that testing. However, the proposal would also have
allowed the employer not to designate a competent person if the testing were done by a Coast Guard authorized person.
OSHA has determined that this would not promote adequate safety because the Coast Guard authorized person may not
have been trained to have all the skills and knowledge of a competent person. In fact, Coast Guard authorized persons
are only allowed to authorize someone to test and certify a space ``Safe for Hot Work.'' (See the text of 46 CFR 35.01-1(a)
through (c), 71.60(c)(1), and 91.50-1(c)(1) in Appendix B to subpart B). A shipyard that relied only upon Coast
Guard approved persons would not have an individual who had all the skills and knowledge necessary to protect employees
from atmospheric hazards in confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. Therefore, consistent
with the previous standard, an employer can only avoid designating a competent person(s) if the employer states that
all testing will be done by a Marine Chemist. 
In paragraph (b)(2), OSHA has carried forth most of the requirements of previous paragraph (a)(2), which addressed
the recording of information on employees who have been designated competent persons. An employer is still required
to keep a list of his or her competent persons, but the employer will have more flexibility in determining the form of
the record, and instead of being required to send the list to the OSHA area office, employers will be required to maintain
the list and make it available upon request. 
Paragraph (a)(2) of the previous rule required the employer to indicate on a ``Designation of Competent Person''
(OSHA 73 form) either the names of employees designated as competent persons or that the prescribed functions of a
competent person would always be carried out by a NFPA Certified Marine Chemist. In addition, a new OSHA 73 form had
to be completed when additions or changes were made to the information concerning persons designated as competent
persons and that it be filed with the local OSHA area office. 
The exception in paragraph (b)(1) which allows an employer to designate ``any person who meets the applicable portion
of the criteria [for competent persons] set forth in paragraph (c)'' in certain situations was in the previous standard
at  1915.7(d) 

Application

. 
OSHA proposed that the employer prepare a ``certification record,'' that would include the employer's name, the
identification of the designated competent person or a statement that a Marine Chemist or a Coast Guard authorized
person would be used, the date of training, and that the employer maintain the most recent record on file. Coast Guard
authorized persons were also to be added to the exception from designating a competent person. The proposal also eliminated
the need to use an OSHA 73 form for recording the information required by the standard. 
In this final rule, OSHA addresses the proposed requirements under three separate paragraphs. In paragraph (b)(2)(i)
of the final rule, OSHA continues to require employers to keep a record of employees who have been designated as competent
persons or a statement that the employer plans to use a Marine Chemist for the testing of atmospheres. 
Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) continues the requirement that the record of designated persons be maintained but adds a requirement
that the employer make the record available for inspection by OSHA, NIOSH, employees, or their designated representatives.
This is consistent with other OSHA standards including   1915.1025(l)(2) and 1915.1027(o), and with
industry practice. OSHA believes it is imperative that competent persons be easily identified because their skills
are critical for the provision and maintenance of a safe workplace. In addition, the new requirement will facilitate
enforcement of the maintenance of records requirement. 
OSHA has eliminated the requirement to use an OSHA 73 because OSHA believes that the OSHA 73 form requires more information
than is necessary. The primary purpose of the ``Designation of Competent Person'' form was to provide the identification
of employees designated as competent persons or to indicate that a Marine Chemist would be used to perform tests. OSHA
believes that such information can be recorded and provided in other ways. 
Since the OSHA 73 form is no longer required, it no longer needs to be provided to the OSHA area office each time a change
is made. Now employers can maintain the record of designated employees at the place of employment or other location,
such as the main office of the employer, so long as the record can be provided for inspection upon request. 
The U.S. Coast Guard MIONY (Ex. 6-4) and Mr. Alan Spackman (Ex. 6-5) supported the elimination of OSHA Form
73, but only if the employer is required to maintain the alternative method of certification. Mr. Spackman (Ex. 6-5)
stated, 



This action is acceptable only if the employer is required to either post or make the competent person's certification
record available upon request and without retaliation to employee and other persons who may be in the workplaces.
The proposal fails to give this assurance. 



OSHA believes that by allowing alternative reporting media for identifying designated employees and by requiring
that records be maintained and made available for inspection rather than submitted to the local OSHA area office,
the final rule addresses Mr. Spackman's concerns. Bay Shipbuilding Corp. (Ex. 6-15) commented, 



Form 73 is non-productive and obsolete. The form could be revised to indicate information such as name, date, employment/experience
in shipbuilding/repairs/ship breaking, and schooling or training * * *

Therefore, in the final rule, the employer is permitted to use any form or format of reporting that identifies the employees
who are designated as competent persons and the date they were trained or that a Marine Chemist will be used to perform
atmospheric testing. Under the final rule, OSHA will continue to recognize the OSHA 73 form as an acceptable recordkeeping
medium, but will not require its use. Employers are free to use whatever recordkeeping medium they choose as long as
the record contains the minimum information required in the final rule and can be presented for inspection upon request.
By requiring that the record be made available for inspection upon request, OSHA is eliminating the need for employers
to file new OSHA 73 forms or certifications of designated persons with the nearest OSHA area office as required in the
previous language of  1915.7(a)(2). 
In paragraph (b)(2)(iii), OSHA has reorganized the requirements of the certificate designating employees as competent
persons, keeping most that were proposed, but eliminating the requirement to include the date the record was made
and adding a requirement to include the date the competent person was trained. As long as the list of competent persons
represents the current situation, there is no need to know when it was created. However, knowing when a competent person
was trained will enable OSHA to determine easily that the employee was trained, thus facilitating enforcement and
ensuring that the employer is aware of the date the employee was trained. 


Criteria for a competent person. 

In the proposal, the Agency requested public comment on whether there should be OSHA-approved or OSHA-required training
for competent persons, whether competent persons should be certified, when such requirements could be implemented,
and how many persons would need training and certification. 
Several commenters believed that OSHA should not require training or certification of shipyard competent persons.
For example, the Shipbuilders Council of America (SCA) (Ex. 6-3) and Newport News Shipbuilding (Ex. 6-6),
commented: 



The vast majority of confined space entry incidents are the result of poor application of confined space entry procedures.
There are few, if any, confined space incidents involving errors by a competent person. The criteria for designating
competent persons in the present standard in  1915.7 are sufficiently specific and rigorous to ensure qualified
individuals, and should be retained. 



SCA (Ex. 6-3) additionally suggested that, 



OSHA should continue to offer and support Shipyard Competent Person training courses. However, the fact that an individual
has taken the course alone does not ensure competency. 



Other commenters urged OSHA to institute mandatory training and certification (e.g., Ex. 6-14, 6-24,
6-31). For instance, NIOSH recommended that OSHA require and take responsibility for the certification and
training of shipyard competent persons (Ex. 6-14). 
The U.S. Navy's Environmental Health Center (Ex. 6-31) related the issue of shipyard competent persons to their
Gas Free Engineers by stating that: 



OSHA should adopt a formal policy on this issue. Naval shipyards currently have a 3 week Gas Free Engineer (GFE) course
which is given to Navy personnel so that they may perform as Gas Free Engineering Technicians. 



Another commenter, Independent Testing and Consulting, Inc. (Ex. 6-24) expressed this viewpoint: 



The NFPA in conjunction with OSHA has re-introduced a voluntary training program for Competent Persons * * *.
The provision of training by outside agencies lifts a burden from the employer and the benefits outweigh the costs.

The requirements of 1915.7 are adequate but every effort should be made to provide employers with the opportunity
to send personnel to training courses which should be OSHA approved. Such approval should require that persons be
recertified periodically, say every 3-5 years. This would assure that competent persons keep abreast of changes
in technology, law etc. 



OSHA received support for periodic re-training and many suggestions with a variety of time limits (Ex. 6-4,
6-12, 6-14, 6-21, 6-22, 6-27, 6-28, 6-33, 6-36). For example, the U.S.
Coast Guard MIONY (Ex. 6-4) and the Navy's Sea Systems Command (Ex. 6-12) believe that competent persons
should attend initial training and then attend refresher training each year thereafter. NIOSH (Ex. 6-14) recommended
that annual training of the competent person be required for recertification. 
Several commenters, however, believed that the criteria for designating a competent person should remain the same
as the previous standard. The NFPA (Ex. 6-10), for example, stated : 



* * * Emphasis should be placed upon enforcement of existing requirements (the performance requirements
to be designated for a competent person) and that formal training be directed toward the existing duties and responsibilities
of a competent person. 



And as expressed by Delta Laboratory and Gas Testing, Inc. (Ex. 6-35): 



* * * the present system provides a tried and tested system of confined space entry and work * * *.
To change the basic format of the system would be sheer folly and would benefit the few at the expense of many.

While OSHA supports the need for training requirements, OSHA agrees with the position of the majority of commenters
that the competent person criteria contained in  1915.7 achieve the same result, that is, a highly trained individual
who has knowledge of the unique aspects of shipyard operations and the ability to carry out and perform the required
atmospheric tests. The criterion in paragraph (c) of  1915.7 requires the shipyard competent person to have
the skill and knowledge necessary to perform atmospheric testing. Because each shipyard is unique, how much training
a shipyard competent person must have and how often it must be repeated is left to the employer who is in the best position
to determine what skills and knowledge must be reinforced and what resource information needs to be presented. As
such, OSHA is of the opinion that by continuing the previous competent person criteria, employers will ensure that
the necessary training will continue to be provided to shipyard employers who are so designated as competent persons.
Furthermore, OSHA believes that this performance-oriented approach will allow the most flexibility in ensuring
the availability of competent person services and in ensuring that the unique conditions in each shipyard can be addressed.

Paragraph (c)(1) is the same as previous paragraph (b)(1) except that the competent person is now required to be able
to understand and carry out the written or oral instructions left by the Certified Industrial Hygienist as well as
the Marine Chemist and the Coast Guard Authorized Person. Certificates issued by the Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial
Hygienist, or Coast Guard authorized person are written instructions. OSHA had proposed to separate the requirements
to understand certificates and to carry out verbal instructions left by the Marine Chemist or Certified Industrial
Hygienist or Coast Guard authorized person but the Agency has concluded that the requirements are sufficiently interrelated
that they can continue to be listed together in paragraph (c)(1). 
Paragraph (c)(2) continues the requirement of previous paragraph (b)(3) that competent persons have a knowledge
of Subparts B, C, D, and H of part 1915. OSHA did not propose to change this requirement, and has made only an editorial
change in order to improve clarity. 
Paragraph (c)(3) is the same as old paragraph (b)(4), requiring that competent persons have a familiarity with the
structure and knowledge of the location and designation of spaces on the types of vessels on which repair work is done.
OSHA did not propose to change this requirement but in the final rule reflects OSHA's decision to expand the scope of
Subpart B to cover all phases of shipyard employment. 
In paragraph (c)(4), OSHA continues to require competent persons to have the ability to use and interpret the readings
of oxygen indicators, combustible gas indicators, and carbon dioxide indicators, but consistent with the proposal,
the Agency has added a requirement that the competent person be able to calibrate the testing equipment and that the
equipment not be limited to these monitors. 
The proposed language in paragraph (b)(3) was performance-oriented in that it did not limit the testing equipment
to the types recognized specifically in paragraph (b)(2) of the previous rule. As new technologies develop and new
chemical hazards are encountered in the shipyard working environment, it becomes necessary for competent persons
to use new types of environmental monitors and detectors. Skill in the use of this new equipment is necessary for competent
persons to be able to identify sources of hazardous exposures in shipyard employment. In addition, OSHA believes
that in order for the competent person to have the ability to read and interpret the readings of any type of chemical
indicator that may be needed to test atmospheres in the shipyard, a competent person must be familiar enough with the
instrumentation to capably calibrate it. 
In paragraph (c)(5), OSHA continues the requirement contained in the first portion of paragraph (b)(5) in the previous
rule. Paragraph (b)(5) of the previous rule contains two requirements and OSHA has decided to divide the previous
rule into two separate requirements in the final rule: Paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(7). Paragraph (c)(5) requires that
competent persons must have the capability to perform the tests and inspections required by Subparts B, C, D, and H
of part 1915. The requirement in the final rule is consistent with the language proposed in paragraph (b)(6) of the
proposal. There were no comments objecting to this change and OSHA considers it to be editorial. 
In paragraph (c)(6) OSHA is adding a new requirement to the final rule that coincides with shipyard industry practice.
Paragraph (c)(6) requires competent persons to have the ability to evaluate spaces after a test to determine the need
for further testing by Marine Chemists, Certified Industrial Hygienists, or by the U.S. Coast Guard authorized persons.
OSHA has added this new language to make it clear that there may be atmospheric conditions present in the shipyard that
can not be evaluated effectively by a person trained only to the competent person level and that more highly trained
individuals may be needed to accurately evaluate an atmosphere. In such cases, OSHA believes this new language would
make it clear that an individual such as a Marine Chemist, a Certified Industrial Hygienist, or a Coast Guard authorized
person must be called for assistance. 
The State of Washington, Department of Transportation (WADOT) (Ex. 6-26) noted the ``tremendous responsibility''
placed upon the competent person and even recommended further training. 
WADOT commented,

Regarding changes to 1915.7 Competent person: Throughout the existing and proposed regulation, the competent person
is given tremendous responsibility to ensure worker safety through inspection and testing. * * *

* * * a requirement should be added at 1915.7(b)(8): Knowledge of the physical hazards and the air contaminants
which may be produced in the course of the work to be done, the means of preventing employee exposure to them.'' The regulation
could even go so far as to require the competent person to attend a 2-day training class certified by the National Fire
Protection Association. NFPA maintains a list of certified classes. 



OSHA agrees that it may appear from the proposal that competent persons are expected to perform some duties equivalent
to those of the Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist, or Coast Guard authorized person. This was not the
intent. OSHA does not believe, based upon the duties that are expected from a competent person, that it is necessary
to specify the competent persons be trained by the NFPA as suggested by Washington State. Rather, OSHA believes the
knowledge and training requirements in paragraph (c) are appropriate for the testing that a competent person is allowed
to do. However, the competent person needs to be trained to recognize the need for more sophisticated assistance and
must know how to call for that assistance. This new requirement makes it clear that competent persons, rather than
perform all tests and evaluations alone, must have the ability to determine when the expert assistance of the Marine
Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist, or Coast Guard authorized person is needed. 
In paragraph (c)(7) OSHA is continuing the requirement found in the second part of paragraph (b)(5) in the previous
rule. Paragraph (c)(7) requires that a competent person must have the capability to maintain the records required
by the standard. As noted earlier, OSHA has divided the previous requirements of paragraph (b)(5) into two separate
paragraphs, (c)(5) and (c)(7). There were no objections to this change as it was proposed in paragraph (b)(6) and (b)(7).
Therefore, OSHA considers paragraph (c)(7) to be an editorial change to previous paragraph (b)(5). 


Recordkeeping. 

OSHA has redesignated the logging of inspections and test requirements as paragraph (d) Recordkeeping. The changes
proposed to the requirements of previous paragraph (c) addressing logging of inspections and tests were contained
in paragraph (c) of the proposal. 
In paragraph (d)(1) OSHA has made substantive changes to the language of previous paragraph (c)(1). OSHA is requiring
that the employer ensure that the competent person, Marine Chemist or Certified Industrial Hygienist performing
any tests required by Subparts B, C, D, or H of this part, records the test locations, time, date, location of inspected
spaces, and the operations performed, as well as the test results and any instructions. OSHA has combined paragraphs
(c)(1) and (c)(2) of the proposal and eliminated the need for the OSHA 74 form. The new language continues the previous
requirement that persons conducting tests and inspections record the results of those tests and inspections. However,
it eliminates the mandated use of the OSHA 74 form. OSHA believes that the format or instrument of the test report is
not important, so long as the information required by OSHA is contained in the record. 
OSHA received a number of comments urging the Agency to allow other forms of reporting the atmospheric testing results
in addition to the OSHA 74 form. 
The Navy's Sea Systems Command (Ex. 6-12) commented that, 



[Section] 1915.7(c) requires that all tests be logged on the OSHA Form 74. Recommend insertion of the words ``or equivalent''
to allow for use of locally developed (e.g. computer-generated) forms which include at least all of the information
required by the OSHA Form 74. 



Marine Hydraulics International (Ex. 6-21), Colonna's Shipyard (Ex. 6-22), S.T.A.S. (Ex. 6-37)
and Moon Engineering (Ex. 6-38) agreed and submitted identical comments that stated: 



We suggest that the following words be added to the end of this paragraph: ``or equivalent.'' The OSHA 74 does not possess
room for additional instructions to workers, and by allowing the use of an equivalent form, workers could be informed
of other requirements that the Shipyard Competent Person may invoke. 



In previous paragraph (c)(1), competent persons were required to make a record of the locations, operations performed
and the date, time, and results of any test they performed on a ``Log of Inspections and Tests by Competent Person''
(OSHA 74 form). Competent persons were also required under previous paragraph (c)(1) to use a separate form for each
vessel on which tests and inspections were made. By allowing the use of alternative forms to record atmospheric test
results, the employer will have more flexibility in complying. However, employees will be protected and OSHA will
be aided in its enforcement by the fact that employers will still be required to maintain records of tests and inspections.

In paragraph (d)(2) of the final rule, OSHA continues the maintenance of records requirement of previous paragraph
(c)(2). OSHA is requiring the employer to ensure that records created to comply with the recordkeeping requirements
of this section are posted in the immediate vicinity of the affected operations while work is progress and for a period
of at least three months from the completion date of the specific job for which they were generated. OSHA considers
the new language to be a non-substantive change. 
In paragraph (d)(3) of the final rule, OSHA continues the availability of records requirement of previous paragraph
(c)(2). Paragraph (d)(2) requires the employer to ensure that the records required in this section are available
for inspection by the Assistant Secretary, Director, employees, or their representatives while work in the affected
spaces is in progress. The new language contains editorial corrections for clarity and consistency with other OSHA
record inspection requirements. OSHA considers the changes to this paragraph to be non-substantive. 


C. Subpart B, Sections 1915.11 through 1915.16 


1.  1915.11 Scope and Application 


The scope contained in previous  1915.11 applies the requirements in Subpart B to vessels and vessel sections
found in shipyards during ship repair and ship breaking;  1915.16 applies to ship repair only. On November 29,
1988, OSHA proposed to amend its shipyard standards addressing safe entry into and work within spaces containing
explosive and other dangerous atmospheres on board vessels and vessel sections in shipyards (53 FR 48092). Under
this proposal, OSHA would have applied Subpart B to all types of shipyard work on vessels and vessel sections, including
ship building, ship repair, and shipbreaking. The Agency proposed extending the scope of Subpart B in this manner
to protect employees entering and working in explosive and other dangerous atmospheres, regardless of the type of
work they were performing. 
Subsequently, after the closing date for comments on this proposed shipyard rule, OSHA also proposed new rules for
confined spaces in general industry (54 FR 24080, June 5, 1989). The general industry proposal would have had the effect
of covering land-side (that is, other than shipboard) confined spaces in shipyards, such as piping systems in shops
or confined spaces in staging areas. 
As noted earlier, SESAC reviewed the general industry proposal and made recommendations regarding its possible
application to shipyard work. In June 1992, OSHA reopened the record for Subpart B (57 FR 28172, June 24, 1992), to place
the SESAC recommendations in the rulemaking record and to gather additional information on whether or not the proposed
general industry confined spaces standard was appropriate for land-side confined spaces entered during shipyard
work.

The scope of revised Subpart B has been expanded so that the final rule covers all shipyard work, and the title of the
Subpart, originally called ``Explosive and Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Vessel and Vessel Sections,'' has been
changed to ``Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Shipyard Employment.'' OSHA believes
this change more accurately reflects the scope of this Subpart, which now addresses all shipyard employment operations
and which is not limited to confined spaces. The entire subpart applies regardless of whether shipbuilding, ship
repair, or shipbreaking is being done. 

The scope of the 1988 proposal differed from the previous standard in two major respects: 

(1) The proposed standard would have extended coverage to employees in shipbuilding, who were not protected by previous
  1915.12 through 1915.16, and 

(2) the proposed standard would have extended coverage to employees in shipbreaking who were not protected by the
previous  1915.16. 

The notice of proposed rulemaking listed two reasons for extending the scope of Subpart B in this manner: 

(1) That the national consensus standard corresponding to Subpart B (NFPA 306, 

Control of Gas Hazards on Vessels

) imposes the same basic requirements to all shipyard work, regardless of whether ship building, ship breaking, or
ship repair is being performed; and 

(2) that the protective measures required under the previous   1915.12 through 1915.16 are current industry
practice in all aspects of shipyard work. 

NFPA 306 (1988) is the national consensus standard that applies to work covered by revised Subpart B. Like Subpart
B, it contains requirements for atmospheric testing, for cold work and hot work, and for maintaining safe atmospheres
for employees while shipbuilding, shipbreaking, or ship repairing is being performed. Under section 6(b)(8) of
the OSH Act, any standard that OSHA adopts in regard to atmospheric hazards on vessels must be at least as protective
as the NFPA document unless another standard would be more consistent with the purpose of the act.

2

 Expanding the scope of the current standard to all of shipyard employment is consistent with the scope of NFPA 306 and
therefore providing at least equivalent protection. 





Before the publication of the 1988 proposal, 30 groups, representing government agencies, employers, unions, and
associations, commented on the first draft rewrite of Subpart B. All of these groups supported the concept of expanding
Subpart B coverage to both shipbuilding and shipbreaking (53 FR 48094). As noted in the preamble to the proposal, OSHA
believes that this is because the shipyard industry was already applying the requirements of previous Subpart B to
the entire shipyard. In fact, the preliminary regulatory impact analysis identified no cost impact from the application
of the proposal to shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and ship repair (53 FR 48104). 

In response to the 1988 notice of proposed rulemaking, OSHA received no comments in opposition to the extension of
this coverage and several expressions of support for applying the standard uniformly throughout the shipyard (Ex.
6-3, 6-6, 6-23). The position of the 39 commenters is best expressed by the following statements.
The Shipbuilders Council of America (SCA) (Ex. 6-3), which represents 25 major U.S. shipyards that employ 95
percent of shipyard production workers, stated: 




* * * having a single standard addressing this issue would achieve the objective of providing
employees and employers with one set of rules for given situations. 




Newport News Shipbuilding (Ex. 6-6), the largest shipyard in the western hemisphere: 




* * * the industry treats confined spaces ashore and afloat in a similar manner. 




The American Waterways Shipyard Conference (AWSC) (Ex. 6-23), representing the interests of small- to medium-sized
commercial shipbuilding and repair industry stated: 




AWSC is very supportive of OSHA's efforts to develop this vertical standard. The end product will eliminate the confusion
which currently exists concerning the applicability of the General Industry Standards to the shipbuilding and repair
industry, and will up-date all standards to the existing technology level.

* * * * * 



The alternative to the expansion of the scope of this subpart appears to be the institution of a different program for
[shore-side] confined spaces. To introduce a new type of confined space entry program into a shipyard facility which
already has a workable program seems ludicrous. Two programs would only confuse the employee. By extending the current
program, employees will be protected and will immediately recognize the program. 




OSHA has concluded that the requirements contained in revised Subpart B are necessary for the protection of employees
exposed to hazardous atmospheres in shipyards, regardless of the type of work being performed. Hazardous atmospheres
can be found in shipbuilding, as well as in shipbreaking and ship repair. The work practices implemented by employees
working in vessels and vessel sections should be the same from one job to the next. The atmospheric hazards will basically
be the same and the employees move from job to job within the entire shipyard, so the work practices should be consistent.
Using one set of work procedures for atmospheric hazards in a shipbuilding job and another for the same hazards for
a ship repair job would serve to confuse the employee and could easily lead to accidents. Therefore, revised Subpart
B applies to shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and ship repair. 

A short time after the November 1988 publication of the proposed rule on Explosive and Other Dangerous Atmospheres
in Vessel and Vessel Sections, the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) was established. SESAC
was chartered to provide OSHA with guidance in revising, consolidating, and modernizing the varying sets of regulations
that were being applied in the shipyard industry into what is ultimately intended to be a truly vertical standard for
all shipyard employment. Shipyard employers would be required to comply with a single set of occupational safety
and health standards as opposed to a mixture of shipyard and general industry standards. Consequently, the newly
developed shipyard employment standards would apply to all shipyard employment regardless of the type of work being
performed (for example, vessel repair or fabrication of railroad cars) or location (for example, in the traditional
shipyard or ``up river'' or on sea trials). As a step towards this goal, SESAC recommended that the scope of the proposed
Subpart B be expanded beyond vessels and vessel sections, to cover all land-side confined space and hazardous atmosphere
situations (Tr. 101, 4/25/90). 

In order for OSHA to include SESAC's recommendations into the rulemaking record and to consider fully comments submitted
to the docket concerning the general industry confined spaces proposal, OSHA reopened the record on Subpart B (57
FR 28152, June 24, 1992). The Agency raised a number of questions in the notice reopening the record. The most significant
issue that underlines a number of the specific questions is rooted in the unique concept of confined space entry that
has been the accepted practice in the shipyard industry for over 25 years (36 FR 10466, May 29, 1971). The fundamental
basis of OSHA's shipyard standard has been a reliance on preventing employees from ever being exposed to confined
space atmospheric hazards. This has been accomplished by the built-in system of testing and ventilating that has
become industry practice and has been very successful at preventing confine and enclosed spaces and other dangerous
atmospheres accidents. 

The concept of a single standard, Subpart B, for all shipyard employment was unanimously endorsed by SESAC as well
as supported by all of the commenters who addressed this issue in the June 1992, notice (Ex. 11-3, 11-4,
11-5, 11-6, 11-8, 11-10, 11-13, 11-14, 11-15, 11-16, 11-18,
11-19, 11-20, 11-21, 11-24, 11-26, 11-29, 11-31, 11-33, 11-34,
11-35, 11-39, 11-41, 11-48, 11-50). For example, the National Fire Protection Association
(Ex. 11-19), a voluntary membership organization dedicated to the protection of people and property from fire
and related hazards, set out this position as follows: 




NFPA favors the development of a single standard which provides for safety during entry and work in confined spaces
within the shipyard. 



* * * * * 



In general, application of two distinctly different standards for vessels and [land-side] operations would be a
burden on the industry and would be confusing to employees. Specific points are as follows: 

First, * * * employees in the shipyard are familiar with the dangers of all confined spaces, not just
those confined spaces associated with tanks aboard ships. This has occurred due to the absence of prior safety requirements
for general industry. 

The shipyards have already adapted the practices and procedures derived from the vessel requirements and applied
them to the [land-side], as appropriate.

<TEXT>
 

Second, the shipyard industry has demonstrated the effectiveness of the current and proposed 29 CFR 1915, Subpart
B requirements over the past 10 years. 

Third, requiring the 1910 general industry requirements for [land-side] activities instead of the current and proposed
1915 shipyard requirements complicates the training element, by necessitating dual procedures. The training for
both sets of requirements will be incompatible, since the standards each take a different approach_1915 Subpart
B utilizes a ``performance oriented'' approach, while 1910.146 relies on specifications to achieve its objectives.

 


Ingalls Shipbuilding (Ex. 11-20) agreed, stating:

 


The SESAC recommendation stresses preventions, training and self-rescue. This approach, which relies on testing
before entry and use of engineering controls to eliminate the hazards is, in our opinion, much safer than the general
industry standard which requires the use of attendants at each confined space to summon rescue personnel when an emergency
occurs. (SESAC'S recommendations put the emphasis on prevention). In addition to being safer it is also more economical
than the general industry standard.

 


The industry has adopted a single approach to working in and around explosive and dangerous atmospheres throughout
the shipyard for several reasons: 

(1) The number and type of atmospheric hazards associated with products contained in the spaces is unpredictable.
Some vessel repairers encounter over 100 different chemical cargoes (Ex. 11-27); 

(2) The complexity of confined spaces is increased due to the extensive internal structures, adjacent spaces, pipelines,
vent systems, heating coils, and the like (Ex. 11-7, 11-27); and 

(3) The cross-contamination of previous and successive products complicates the atmospheric evaluation process
(Ex. 11-7). 

(4) The nature of the work associated with the confined space entry in shipyards tends to be more complex. This work
frequently involves hot work which can greatly affect atmospheric conditions within the space (Ex. 11-7, 11-27).


Based on the record, OSHA has made a determination that a single standard should be applied for entry into confined
and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres throughout the shipyard industry, following the Subpart B approach.
OSHA has arrived at this conclusion for two basic reasons: 

(1) A single procedure, applicable throughout the shipyard and addressing hazards related to confined and enclosed
spaces and other dangerous atmospheres will best protect employees, and

(2) That the provisions adopted in revised Subpart B will provide shipyard employees with a comprehensive set of protective
safety measures. 

A single standard applying to all shipyard confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres will provide
employees with one procedure for working in any shipyard location, whether on a vessel or on land. The commenters overwhelmingly
agreed that this approach would best protect employees (Ex. 11-3, 11-6, 11-9, 11-13, 11-14,
11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-20, 11-24, 11-25, 11-26, 11-29, 11-35,
11-39, 11-41, 11-50). OSHA agrees with these commenters that two procedures for dealing with confined
and enclosed space and dangerous atmosphere hazards would confuse employees who have to implement those procedures.
The Agency is concerned that the confusion resulting from different standards for shipboard and land-side spaces
would actually lead to accidents rather than prevent them. 

As in the past, the primary focus of Subpart B will continue to be atmospheric hazards. Non-atmospheric hazards such
as those relating to slips, trips, or falls are covered by other provisions of the shipyard standards. A more specific
detailed discussion of non-atmospheric hazards is contained in the following paragraph. 

OSHA believes that land-side confined spaces in shipyards pose hazards similar in nature to those found in vessels
and vessel sections covered by revised Subpart B. The evidence in the record demonstrates that the atmospheric and
non-atmospheric hazards in vessels and vessel sections are also present in land-side confined spaces (Ex. 11-19,
11-26, 11-27, 11-32, 11-39, 11-41, 11-47). The Agency agrees with the vast majority
of commenters who stated that the procedures used to protect workers from these hazards in vessels and vessel sections
could readily be adopted for use in land-side confined space operations (Ex. 11-1, 11-3, 11-6, 11-9,
11-10, 11-11, 11-13, 11-14, 11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-20, 11-24,
11-25, 11-26, 11-29, 11-30, 11-31, 11-32, 11-33, 11-34, 11-37,
11-39, 11-41, 11-42, 11-44, 11-45, 11-46, 11-47, 11-49, 11-50,
11-51). 

A few commenters stated that vessels and vessel sections pose greater hazards (Ex. 11-7, 11-8, 11-11,
11-13, 11-22, 11-27, 11-30, 11-35, 11-46). They noted such differences as greater
complexity with respect to the hazards involved in vessels and vessel sections, movement of the vessel (which causes
movement of atmospheric hazards), the total number of spaces involved, the multitude of systems (for example, fuel,
refrigeration, and compressed air) present on-board ships, and the interrelationships between adjacent vessel
sections (that is, hazards in one section can affect procedures to be used in adjacent sections). Nonetheless, most
of these commenters contended that the Subpart B requirements were still appropriate for land-side confined spaces
(Ex. 11-11, 11-13, 11-30, 11-31, 11-35, 11-44, 11-46). They argued that
the Subpart B provisions would afford employees with greater protection than would be provided by  1910.146,
and that procedures necessary to comply with Subpart B were already in place in most shipyards. 

OSHA has concluded that it is appropriate to apply revised Subpart B to all phases of shipyard work. The Agency has determined,
based on the record, that shipyard employers can readily adapt their ship-side procedures which already conform
to these requirements, for use in land-side confined space entry, as well. 

OSHA has included the phrase ``regardless of geographic location'' in the scope only as a clarification since it has
been the Agency's position that this section, and indeed the entire Part 1915, apply to inland shipyard employment.

SESAC examined requirements proposed in the general industry confined space standard  1910.146, to determine
to what extent that proposal should address shipyard work and to determine whether or not specific provisions within
that proposal were appropriate for application to work in shipyard confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous
atmospheres. The committee agreed that a single standard should apply to this work and recommended the addition to
Subpart B of several provisions based on proposed  1910.146 so that the shipyard standard would be as comprehensive
as its part 1910 counterpart (Tr. 102, 4/25/90). As noted earlier, OSHA reopened the record on the proposed revision
of Subpart B to request comments on SESAC's recommendations in this regard, as well as to explore the possible expansion
of the scope of Subpart B to all aspects of shipyard work. The issues raised in the notice reopening the record addressed
how Subpart B could be revised to make it as protective as the general industry permit space standard. 

Paragraph (c)(1) of  1910.146 requires employers to evaluate the workplace to determine if any spaces are permit-required
confined spaces. Paragraph (c)(6) of that standard requires employers to reevaluate non-permit confined spaces
whenever there are changes that might increase the hazards to entrants. The notice reopening the record on Subpart
B requested comments on whether or not shipyard employers should similarly evaluate their workplaces. 

Most commenters agreed that the shipyard standard should not adopt requirements comparable to paragraphs (c)(1)
and (c)(6) of  1910.146 (Ex. 11-1, 11-3, 11-6, 11-7, 11-9, 11-10, 11-11,
11-13, 11-14, 11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-20, 11-22, 11-24, 11-25,
11-26, 11-29, 11-30, 11-31, 11-34, 11-39, 11-41, 11-42, 11-45,
11-47, 11-49, 11-50, 11-51). They argued that proposed Subpart B was adequate since it already
required testing before initial entry of all confined spaces that could contain atmospheric hazards and additional
frequent testing to ensure that atmospheric conditions are maintained. A few contended that the shipyard industry
treated all confined spaces alike, evaluating them for hazardous conditions before entry (Ex. 11-13, 11-19,
11-31, 11-49). For example, Mr. Joseph J. Ocken (Ex. 11-31) stated:

 


The present practice is to consider ANY confined space NOT SAFE until currently tested and posted otherwise. This
is a simple fail-safe work practice for workers. To expect every space to have been evaluated and posted properly invites
simple error to lead to catastrophe. There are too many confined spaces in shipyards to count on 100% perfection at
all times. Enclosed spaces can also contain confined space hazards and must be approached with suspicion by workers
as well.

 


On the other hand, a few commenters stated that OSHA should adopt requirements similar to those in  1910.146
for evaluating confined spaces (Ex. 11-2, 11-28, 11-33, 11-37, 11-38). They believed
that evaluating confined spaces for the types and extent of hazards is a useful tool in any confined space program.
Con-Space Communications, Ltd. (Ex. 11-28), argued as follows:

 


Evaluation of a workplace to determine if it contains Confined Spaces is the very first step that an employer must take
in a serious company wide entry program. An inventory of Confined Spaces would be a permanent reference which, if updated
on each entry, could be a useful planning tool. In the event of a rescue, this information would be invaluable especially
if the Confined Space is assigned a number along with a list of potential hazards associated with it and special equipment
needed for safe entry. Physical attributes of the space could also be listed.

 


Section 1910.146 places confined spaces into two categories: permit-required confined spaces and non-permit-required
confined spaces. The purpose of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(6) of  1910.146 is to ensure that employers have properly
identified confined spaces posing hazards to entrants. The large class of confined spaces are determined not to be
permit entry spaces, are evaluated only as required in these two paragraphs. Entry into such spaces is essentially
performed without reference to the permit entry procedures of  1910.146 (unless the entrants bring a hazard
into the space or create one during entry operations). 

By contrast, Subpart B treats all confined spaces and other spaces that might contain a hazardous atmosphere equally.
Initial testing and inspection, followed by continuous ventilation and further testing, is required of all these
spaces to ensure the safety of employees working within them. Because of these additional protection which Subpart
B requires on a routine bases, OSHA has determined that no separate, formal evaluation requirements need be adopted
in Subpart B.

Paragraph (e) of  1910.146 requires general industry employers to institute a permit system for permit space
entry operations. This paragraph requires the employer to document, by means of a permit, the completion of measures
required for the safety of entrants. A permit must be completed before entry is allowed into any permit space. The notice,
reopening the record on Subpart B, requested comments on whether or not such permits should be required for entry into
spaces addressed by the shipyard standard. 

The vast majority of commenters stated that a permit system as set out in proposed  1910.146 was unnecessary
for incorporation into Subpart B (Ex. 11-1, 11-3, 11-6, 11-7, 11-9, 11-10, 11-11,
11-13, 11-14, 11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-20, 11-22, 11-24, 11-25,
11-26, 11-29, 11-31, 11-32, 11-35, 11-36, 11-39, 11-40, 11-41,
11-42, 11-44, 11-45, 11-46, 11-47, 11-49, 11-50, 11-51). They argued
that shipyard employee safety would not be increased through the imposition of such a requirement. Many also argued
that the system in use in shipyards and required by proposed Subpart B was the equivalent of a permit system (Ex. 11-3,
11-6, 11-10, 11-11, 11-13, 11-14, 11-18, 11-20, 11-24, 11-25,
11-26, 11-29, 11-32, 11-35, 11-36, 11-39, 11-41, 11-44, 11-49,
11-50, 11-51). These commenters noted that the only spaces employees were permitted to enter were those
designated as ``Safe for Workers'' after initial inspection and testing. For example, Moon Engineering Co., Inc.
(Ex. 11-14), stated: 

 


Moon Engineering feels a permit system is necessary for any confined space entry aboard vessels or any land-side operations.
We do not believe the proposed system described in 1910.146 is feasible for shipboard applications. 

The system, used successfully by Moon Engineering since the early 1970's, is simple and applicable to our operation.
The individual shipyard shops communicate with the Safety Department on a daily basis and advises what spaces they
will be working the following day. The Safety Department uses OSHA Competent Persons and/or NFPA certified Marine
Chemist to test all spaces due to be worked for that particular day. The results of inspection are posted at the entrance
of the space and highlight inspection date, time, tester and whether the space is SAFE FOR WORKERS/SAFE FOR HOT WORK
or whatever the status. This designation is consistent with the language of the existing 1915 standard. This Log of
Inspections is available and it is the responsibility of all employees to view this documentation prior to beginning
their work. This system works and has an excellent track record. 

 


Other commenters believed that a permit system similar to that required under  1910.146(e) should be imposed
(Ex. 11-2, 11-28, 11-30, 11-33, 11-34, 11-37). NIOSH (Ex. 11-33) explained
this position as follows: 

 


NIOSH recommends that entry into a confined space be by permit only. * * * The permit is an authorization
and approval in writing that specifies the location and type of work to be done, certifies that all existing hazards
have been evaluated by the qualified person, and that necessary protective measures have been taken to ensure the
safety of each worker. The permit requirements will vary by the nature of the space, the nature of the hazard, and the
work to be performed. All confined spaces should be evaluated by appropriately trained and qualified persons to determine
that the space involved and the work to be performed will not present a hazard to the worker; the permit system ensures
that this evaluation has been performed. 

 


OSHA has not incorporated a requirement for a formal permit system in the final revised subpart B. The Agency agrees
with the commenters who stated that subpart B provides an informal permit system that contains evaluation mechanisms,
tracking criteria, and control measures that are as protective as the formal one required under  1910.146(e).
Confined and enclosed spaces on vessels and vessel sections that might contain a dangerous atmosphere are certified
``Safe for Workers'' when they are safe for employees to enter, and entry is not permitted until that certification.
Shipyard employees are also trained to remain outside of any space not so certified. Additionally, under  1915.14(a)(1),
a Marine Chemist (or, with certain restrictions, a Coast Guard authorized person) must inspect and test the space
and certify its safety before work in the most hazardous conditions can begin. Furthermore, OSHA believes that imposing
a  1910.146-type permit system for shipyard work because of the content and placement of the permits could undermine
the effectiveness of the Marine Chemist's certificate, which is the primary vehicle for certifying certain spaces
``Safe for Hot Work.''

Paragraph (d)(6) of  1910.146 requires at least one attendant outside a permit space while entry operations
are underway. This attendant monitors entrants and conditions inside and outside the space, prevents the entry of
unauthorized persons, and summons rescue services in an emergency. The notice reopening the record requested comments
on whether attendants should be required for ``permit-required'' confined spaces covered by Subpart B. 

Nearly every commenter stated that attendants were unnecessary for the safety of employees performing work in dangerous
atmospheres or in confined or enclosed spaces in shipyards (Ex. 11-1, 11-2, 11-3, 11-6, 11-7,
11-9, 11-10, 11-11, 11-13, 11-14, 11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-20,
11-22, 11-24, 11-25, 11-26, 11-29, 11-30, 11-31, 11-33, 11-34,
11-36, 11-37, 11-38, 11-39, 11-40, 11-41, 11-42, 11-43, 11-44,
11-45, 11-46, 11-49, 11-50, 11-51). They argued that the procedures required by Subpart
B would make spaces safe for workers and that, as a result, there would be no need for an attendant. Many of these commenters
also contended that the cost of providing attendants for every entry, if such would be necessary, would be prohibitive
(Ex. 11-1, 11-3, 11-11, 11-13, 11-25, 11-29, 11-43, 11-44, 11-49,
11-50). 

One commenter supported a requirement for an attendant to monitor any confined space that was designated as a permit
space (Ex. 11-28). Other commenters, who opposed a general requirement for attendants, acknowledged that
there is a need for an attendant to monitor spaces posing unusual hazards, such as entry into IDLH atmospheres, entry
by an employee working alone, and non-routine entry (Ex. 11-2, 11-3, 11-7, 11-10, 11-13,
11-14, 11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-20, 11-24, 11-25, 11-29, 11-30,
11-31, 11-33, 11-34, 11-41, 11-51). The statement of the NFPA (Ex. 11-19) typified
these comments, as follows: 

 


NFPA believes that the permit described in proposed 1910.146(b)(9) contains information that is not needed by entrants
into confined spaces and could be confusing. NFPA believes that such a permit would not be feasible for confined spaces
in the vessel construction and repair industry, for either vessel or shore-side activities. The proposed 1910.146
permit systems, described in 1910.146(d) establishes specifications for a permit system designed to satisfy several
problems with one form. 

Accident statistics indicate that workers do not recognize the dangers of confined spaces. Statistics also point
out that workers involved in accidents have commonly been authorized to enter the space (source (NIOSH FACE study).
Additionally, a high percentage of fatalities in confined space incidents are personnel attempting to effect worker
rescue. OSHA, with this permit system, has attempted to alert the worker (entrant), establish a control point (person
authorizing entry), and ensure safe rescue attempts are performed by specifying relevant information on one form.


Throughout the industry, shipyards have adapted entry permit systems to make the system simple. Frequently, shipyards
have incorporated a color-coded tag and sign system. The foundation for the various shipyard systems is linked to
the Marine Chemist Certificate and Shipyard Competent Person Inspection Form (OSHA 74 Log of Inspections and Tests).
This allows individual shipyards to tailor their system to the type of confined spaces and work performed at their
yard. In the larger shipyards, the permit and sign system has been incorporated throughout the yard, including both
vessel and shore-side work sites. 

NFPA believes that a specification requiring a permit system as described in 1910.146 would be excessive for many
shipyards since the nature of the spaces and hazards is so variable. NFPA also believes that such a requirement would
not provide any increase in the level of safety. The key to the effectiveness of any permit system will be its simplicity
and the training of workers on its implementation. The 1910.146 proposed system introduces increased confusion
for many of the shipyard applications and will not necessarily result in increased safety. OSHA needs to recognize
that the shipyard industry currently uses a dual permit system for documenting initial and follow-up conditions
for its vessel confined space activities. The advantage of this system has been the lack of specification, thus enabling
individual shipyards to adapt their systems with the performance requirements of current proposed Subpart B. This
approach would work in land-side confined spaces within the shipyard, as well. Use of one system throughout the shipyard
facilitates the training of all workers. 

 


The final revised Subpart B does not require the presence of an attendant for confined and enclosed spaces or for work
in dangerous atmospheres. OSHA notes that the purpose of Subpart B is to ensure that a space is completely safe to enter
and work in. In this regard,  1910.146(c)(5) of the general industry generic confined space standard sets detailed
requirements for atmospheric testing and ventilation for some spaces, and also, recognizes that there are some permit
spaces which can be made safe for entry without the need for written permits or attendants. Final revised Subpart B
provides equivalent requirements for confined and enclosed spaces and for work in dangerous atmospheres in shipyards.
If the testing requirements contained in Subpart B do not indicate a safe atmosphere, then entry is restricted to emergencies
and periods of short duration to accomplish ventilation and additional precautions are required (such as posting
the space as Not Safe for Workers, continuous monitoring, and the absence of ignition sources), by  1915.152
(such as air line respirators, attendants and life lines) and by  1915.94 (frequent checks of employees working
in a confined or enclosed space or alone in an isolated location). Once the hazard is removed and the space is safe for
entry, the employer is required to test frequently to monitor and maintain the space as safe for workers. As a result,
OSHA does not believe it is necessary to require attendants in Subpart B as well.

Paragraph (c)(2) of  1910.146 requires general industry employers to post signs or use other effective means
of informing employees about the existence and location of and the danger posed by permit spaces; paragraphs (c)(3)
and (d)(1) require general industry employers to take measures to prevent unauthorized entry into permit spaces;
and paragraph (i)(8) requires attendants to take measures to keep unauthorized persons out of permit spaces. The
notice reopening the record requested comments on whether or not shipyard employers should be required to take measures,
such as those proposed in  1910.146, to prevent unauthorized entry into work areas covered by Subpart B. 
The commenters agreed that the systems being employed by the shipyard industry have been effective at preventing
unauthorized access under the previous Subpart B (Ex. 11-3, 11-6, 11-7, 11-10, 11-11,
11-13, 11-14, 11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-20, 11-24, 11-25, 11-26,
11-31, 11-32, 11-39, 11-41, 11-42, 11-43, 11-44, 11-45, 11-49,
11-50). They contended that all spaces are made safe before entry and that the posting and training requirements
proposed in Subpart B and outlined in the notice reopening the record would keep employees from entering unsafe areas.
The Jonathan Corporation (Ex. 11-18) presented these arguments as follows: 



As a result of routine training, our employees are cognizant of the fact that only spaces which have been tested and
posted as being SAFE FOR WORKERS are cleared for entry. This system has served our company very well. This proposal
does not recognize our daily involvement with confined spaces. 



Mr. Joseph J. Ocken (Ex. 11-31) agreed, stating: 



Any expectation that every confined space (or enclosed space presenting confined space hazards) will somehow be
properly barricaded courts disaster. My Coast Guard training emphasizes a straight forward safe work practice:
ANY SPACE presenting confined space hazards must be RECENTLY tested by THOROUGHLY trained and equipped individuals
and have appropriate ENGINEERING CONTROLS applied BEFORE ENTRY. Any other space, REGARDLESS OF BARRIERS, is treated
as UNSAFE. 



OSHA concurs with these comments. The revised Subpart B protects employees from ``unauthorized'' entry through
the use of several protective techniques. First,  1915.12(d) requires employees to be trained to recognize
the characteristics of confined spaces and the hazards involved. They are also required to be trained to perform their
duties safely ( 1915.12(d)) and to understand all warning signs and labels ( 1915.16(a)). Second, confined
spaces and spaces containing dangerous atmospheres must be tested and found safe before entry under paragraphs (a),
(b), and (c) of  1915.12. Third, under these same paragraphs, spaces found not to be safe for entry are labeled
``Not Safe for Workers''. Under the unique conditions of shipyard employment, these measures are effective at preventing
unauthorized employees from entering spaces containing dangerous atmospheres. To illustrate, when a space is marked
``Not Safe for Workers,'' the only authorized entrants are those who are entering for emergencies or for short durations
to accomplish ventilation to make the space safe. It is not until the space is retested and certified as ``Safe for Workers''
that employees are allowed to do work in the space. 
Under the general industry standard, only a confined space containing a hazard that may expose an employee to the risk
of death, incapacitation, or impairment of ability to self-rescue is deemed to be a permit space, requiring the adoption
of the protective measures set out in  1910.146. The general industry standard addresses hazards that are exacerbated
by the lack of adequate means of access and egress and by the enclosing nature of the space. By contrast, Subpart B treats
all confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres that could present an atmospheric hazard as having
this potential, and requires protective measures before entry takes place. In the shipyard context, this approach
provides an effective means of protecting employees who must enter confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous
atmospheres. 
Section 1910.146 also requires employers to consider non-atmospheric hazards, such as engulfment and internal
configuration of the space, in determining whether or not a confined space is a permit space. The proposed revision
of Subpart B did not address non-atmospheric issues. Because OSHA was considering the expansion of Subpart B to land-side
confined spaces in lieu of applying  1910.146, the notice reopening the record requested comments on whether
or not Subpart B, as expanded, would adequately address non-atmospheric hazards that may be encountered in confined
space work (Specific Issue B-1, Question J). 
The vast majority of commenters agreed that Subpart B, in combination with other requirements in part 1915, adequately
protected employees (Ex. 11-2, 11-3, 11-6, 11-9, 11-13, 11-14, 11-15, 11-18,
11-19, 11-20, 11-24, 11-25, 11-26, 11-28, 11-29, 11-30, 11-31,
11-35, 11-37, 11-39, 11-40, 11-41, 11-45, 11-47, 11-49, 11-50).
These commenters contended that non-atmospheric hazards are readily identified, are covered by other part 1915
standards, and are the responsibility of line supervisors and employees. The statement of Ingalls Shipbuilding
(Ex. 11-30) was typical of these comments: 



Ingalls believes that such non-atmospheric hazards are adequately addressed by their current respective standards.

Ingalls further believes the foreman or supervisor of the workers is responsible for the above listed non-atmospheric
hazards. Subsequent to an 
'inspection by the competent person, non-atmospheric hazards may develop as a result of ongoing work (for
example, a welder installing his welding leads which create a tripping hazard). The foreman or supervisor is responsible
for the health and safety of his employees and for the actions of his employees on a continual basis throughout the workday.
Non-atmospheric hazards are obvious without the need for special instrumentation, whereas, the tests performed
by the competent person are used to detect unseen atmospheric hazards using specialized instrumentation. 



The Department of the Navy (Ex. 11-30) noted that while Subpart B does not address non-atmospheric hazards,
it should not be amended to address such hazards:

As proposed, Subpart B does not address other dangers in confined spaces. However, the dangers from slips, falls,
electricity, machine guarding etc. are not unique to or necessarily intensified in confined spaces. Precautions
to guard against general non-atmospheric shipyard hazards should be specified for the entire shipyard (all workplaces).
Therefore, it is recommended that Subpart B not be expanded to include general safety hazards; rather, these should
be covered elsewhere in 29 CFR 1915 (e.g., Subpart E/Access and Egress, Subpart F/General Working Conditions, and/or
Subpart M/Fall Protection). 



OSHA does believe that a confined or enclosed space can exacerbate the risk faced by an employee working in a confined
space containing serious non-atmospheric hazards. If an employee is injured in a confined space the limited means
of access and egress makes emergency medical assistance problematic. For this reason, OSHA adopted language in  1910.146
for general industry so as to define permit-required confined space ``in the broadest possible terms'' so that employers
are required to protect affected employees from any serious hazards which may be confronted in a permit space [58 FR
4478-4479].'' 
The Agency believes that shipyard employees will be adequately protected under revised Subpart B without incorporating
additional requirements directed towards non-atmospheric hazards. As part of the pre-entry test, the competent
person is required to make a visual inspection of the confined or enclosed space. At this time, they can alert the employer
to non-atmospheric hazards that are addressed by other standards. For further information, see the discussion of
visual inspection in the preamble to  1915.12 below. 
The notice reopening the record on Subpart B also requested comments on whether or not OSHA should adopt various provisions
from proposed  1910.146 that SESAC had recommended for inclusion in revised Subpart B. These provisions included
those on training, rescue, and exchanging information between employers. The summary and explanation of  1915.12
discusses comments received on these provisions. Additionally, OSHA requested comments on whether any other requirements
from proposed  1910.146 would be appropriate for inclusion in revised Subpart B. No one suggested the adoption
of any proposed  1910.146 provisions other than those relating to attendants, permits, and unauthorized entry
discussed earlier. 
Paragraph (b) of  1915.11 sets definitions for revised Subpart B. These definitions, derived in large part
from NFPA 306, are intended to facilitate compliance with the revised standard. 
Previous Subpart B contains no definitions. The few definitions relating to the previous subpart are contained in
 1915.4, which defines the following Subpart B related terms: hazardous substance, competent person, confined
space, enclosed space, hot work, and cold work. 
In  1915.11(b), the NPRM proposed to add definitions specifically applicable to revised Subpart B. This paragraph
in the proposed rule included the terms ``competent person'' and ``hot work,'' which as noted previously, are also
defined in existing  1915.4. The NPRM also raised issues regarding the definitions of ``inert or inerted atmospheres,''
``Marine Chemist,'' and ``Not Safe for Workers.'' 
The definitions contained in revised Subpart B are discussed in the following summary and explanation of  1915.11(b).
This discussion provides a brief explanation of each defined term, justifies any differences between the existing
or proposed definitions and those contained in the final rule, and discusses comments received regarding the three
terms that were raised as issues in the NPRM (no substantive comments were received on any other terms proposed in  1915.11(b)).

``Adjacent spaces'' means spaces bordering another space in all directions. The wording of the definition of this
term has been revised editorially from the definition in the proposal for consistency with NFPA 306. Additionally,
the final rule defines the term ``adjacent spaces,'' whereas the proposal defined the term ``adjacent compartments
or spaces,'' because the final rule does use the term ``adjacent compartments''. 
The final rule includes a definition of the term ``Assistant Secretary'', which means the Assistant Secretary of
Labor for Occupational Safety and Health or his or her designated representative. This term is used in revised Subpart
B, so OSHA has adopted a definition based on  1910.2. 
OSHA has not carried forward into the final rule the proposed definition of ``bulk''. The Agency believes that a definition
of this term is not necessary to the meaning of the standard. 
``Certified Industrial Hygienist'' (CIH) means an industrial hygienist certified by the American Board of Industrial
Hygiene. This definition is unchanged from the proposal. 
A ``Coast Guard authorized person'' is one who meets the U.S. Coast Guard regulations concerning persons designated
to perform the functions of a Marine Chemist when a Marine Chemist is not reasonably available. The definition in the
final rule is essentially the same as that contained in proposed  1915.11(b); however, substantive requirements
proposed in that definition have not been carried forward, as they are inappropriate for use in a definition. 
OSHA has not carried forward into the final rule the proposed definition of ``competent person''. As noted earlier,
this term is defined in  1915.4, and this definition is appropriate for application to revised Subpart B.

``Dangerous atmosphere'' means an atmosphere that may expose employees to the risk of death, incapacitation, impairment
of ability to self-rescue (i.e., escape unaided from a confined or enclosed space), injury, or acute illness. Although
no definition of this term was proposed, the Agency believes that it is essential for employers and employees to know
what a dangerous atmosphere is in the application of revised Subpart B. 

The final rule includes a definition of the term ``Director'', which means the Director of the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health or his or her designated representative. This term is used in revised Subpart B,
so OSHA has adopted a definition based on Section 3 of the OSH Act. 

The term ``entry'' refers to the act by which a person passes through an opening into a space and to the work performed
in that space. Entry is considered to have occurred as soon as any part of the entrant's body breaks the plane of an opening
into the space. This term was not included in the proposed revision of Subpart B, but OSHA believes that its inclusion
is necessary for clarity. The definition has been taken from  1910.146(b). 

The term ``Enter with Restrictions'' denotes a space where entry is only permitted under specified conditions of
engineering controls, personal protective equipment, clothing, and time. Although this term was not defined in
the proposal, the definition of this term has been included in the final rule to help clarify when entry is permitted
and when it is prohibited. 

In the NPRM, the term ``Not Safe for Workers'' was used to describe compartments or spaces that do not meet the minimum
safety criteria necessary to permit unrestricted entry. The term was used to describe either of two situations that
occur. In the first, the space was not safe for workers to enter unless personal protective equipment was worn or unless
the length of time of employee exposure was limited. In the second, the space was not safe for entry under any circumstances,
regardless of whether personal protective equipment was worn. To address this seeming contradiction, OSHA requested
comments on the issue of whether or not a separate category of ``Safe with Restrictions'' should be included in proposed
Subpart B. 

Three commenters opposed the adoption of an additional category of spaces (Ex. 6-4, 6-5, 6-8). They
argued that the term ``Safe with Restrictions'' might not be understood by all workers and that the term ``Not Safe
for Workers'' was not only more appropriate, but safer as well. For example, Sound Testing, Inc. (Ex. 6-8), stated:

 


If everyone, or even if most people, in the shipyards wore respirators, I would see ``safe with restrictions'' as a
primary designation. But, that's not the case. Moreover, some one third of shipyard workers are reputed to be functionally
illiterate. Thus, ``Safe with Restrictions'' needlessly complicates certificate language. In the most simple
terms, a tank is either safe or not safe, and the workman deserves to be told straightforwardly which is the case.

 


Other commenters supported the additional designation (Ex. 6-10, 6-13, 6-15, 6-18, 6-21,
6-22, 6-23, 6-24, 6-27, 6-28, 6-33, 6-34, 6-37, 6-38). They believed
that the extra designation would recognize existing safe work practices under the OSHA standard. For example, the
U.S. Department of Transportation (Ex. 6-13) stated:

 


Engineering controls are not always capable of reducing confined space hazards to ``safe'' levels. By recognizing
and addressing the existing use of certificates with restrictions, additional protection may be realized. Particular
restrictions will be placed on a space after consideration by the Marine Chemist and an employer's representative.


Such certificates should not be issued for convenience or for the purpose of avoiding the use of preferred control
measures. In addressing this practice under Part 1915, OSHA should specify that entering such spaces is only allowed
when preferred engineering controls are used to the greatest extent feasible and found to be inadequate.

 


Some of these rulemaking participants believed that the term ``Enter with Restrictions'' was a more appropriate
description of the type of location involved (Ex. 6-10, 6-21, 6-22, 6-23, 6-24, 6-27,
6-28, 6-33, 6-34, 6-37, 6-38). NFPA (Ex. 6-10) stated their reasoning behind this
suggested term, as follows:

 


NFPA supports the addition of some provision for ``restricted entry''. NFPA does not support the use of the word ``safe''
in this case since it may be misconstrued and it would be inconsistent with the ``Enter With Restrictions'' designation
in NFPA 306.

 


OSHA agrees with the commenters who supported the use of the term ``Enter with Restrictions''. The Agency believes
that this term better describes the intent of requirements that are intended to limit rather than strictly prohibit
employee entry under all conditions. For example,  1915.12(c)(3) recognizes that a Marine Chemist or a Certified
industrial hygienist may designate a space as ``Enter with Restrictions'' and may provide a list of protective measures
to be taken before entry is allowed. Additionally, this term is consistent with the terminology used in NFPA 306, with
which most shipyard employers are familiar and with which they are complying. For these reasons, OSHA is incorporating
this term in revised Subpart B wherever entry is permitted under certain conditions and is using the term ``Not Safe
for Workers'' wherever entry is strictly forbidden.

``Hot work'' means any activity involving fire- or heat-producing operations, such as riveting, welding, and burning.
The definition of this term also indicates that grinding, drilling, abrasive blasting, and similar spark-producing
operations are also considered to be hot work unless they are isolated from atmospheres containing a concentration
of any flammable or combustible substance greater than 10 percent of the lower explosive limit of that substance.
While the definition in the final rule is substantially the same as that contained in the proposed standard, it has
been editorially revised for clarity. It should be noted that the definition of ``hot work'' in revised Subpart B will
be applied to Subpart B whereas the definition of the same term in  1915.4 applies to the rest of part 1915. 

``Immediately dangerous to life or health''

3

 (IDLH) means an atmosphere that poses an immediate threat to life or that is likely to result in acute or immediate severe
health effects. This definition has been adopted without substantive change from the proposal. 





``Inert or inerted atmosphere'' means an atmospheric condition in which: 

(1) The oxygen content of the atmosphere is maintained at a level less than or equal to 8 percent by volume or at a level
of 50 percent of the amount required to support combustion, whichever is lower, or 

(2) The space is flooded with water and the vapor concentration of flammable or combustible materials in the free space
above the water line is less than 10 percent of the lower explosive limit for the material. This definition has been
adopted without substantive change from the proposal. 

In the NPRM, OSHA raised the issue of whether or not the proposed definition of ``inert or inerted atmosphere'' was
appropriate, especially with respect to the maximum permissible level of oxygen. The Agency asked for guidance on
whether or not specific oxygen levels for various substances should be published along with the rule. 

The persons who commented on this issue felt that OSHA should not publish specific levels in the final rule (Ex. 6-10,
6-18, 6-23, 6-24, 6-27, 6-28, 6-33, 6-34). They argued that since a Marine
Chemist would be the person authorizing and monitoring the inerting of atmospheres and since Marine Chemists are
thoroughly familiar with the selection of appropriate procedures involved, specifying oxygen levels in the OSHA
standard was unnecessary. Endorsing this view, NFPA (Ex. 6-10) stated:

 


Inerting in the marine industry is overseen by Marine Chemists in accordance with the requirements of the ``Control
of Gas Hazards on Vessels_NFPA 306 (1988).'' The provisions for inerting as contained in NFPA 306, 2-3.7(a),
are based upon the industry accepted practice for inerting. It takes into account the theoretical lower limit for
the amount of oxygen to support combustion, which is approximately 11% by volume for most petroleum products. The
procedure specifies either reducing the oxygen content to 8% by volume or 50% of the amount to support combustion,
whichever is less. In practice, because the value of 50% of the amount to support combustion is usually less than 8%
by volume, an even greater margin of safety is achieved. The minimum oxygen for combustion values are contained in
Appendix B, ``Explosion Prevention Systems_NFPA 69 (1986)''. NFPA 306 requires in 2-3.7(a), (c) that the selection
and disposal of the inert gas medium be acceptable to the Marine Chemist who provides specific instructions on his/her
Marine Chemist Certificate. 

NFPA supports the addition of the definition for inerting and the levels as specified in the definition since these
levels are industry accepted and provide for an adequate level of safety when administered by a Marine Chemist in accordance
with NFPA 306.

 


The Marine Chemist Association, Inc. (Ex. 6-34), agreed stating:

 


The Marine Chemist Association feels that inerting is not a procedure free of potential hazards and that inerting
for hot work should only be attempted with the proper skill to determine each of the above mentioned factors. If OSHA
provides only partial details of these factors, it may lead to unauthorized personnel attempting the procedure outside
current regulatory requirement, and could possibly result in the generation of hazardous situations.

 


For the reasons stated by NFPA and the Marine Chemist Association, OSHA is not specifying the precise levels of oxygen
acceptable under the definition of ``inert or inerted atmosphere'', either directly in the definition or in an appendix.
Under  1915.14(a), an atmosphere to be inerted must be tested and certified by a Marine Chemist or a U.S. Coast
Guard authorized person, who would be thoroughly familiar with the proper techniques involved. The Agency fully
concurs with the Marine Chemist Association that setting out these levels within the standard itself might encourage
unqualified persons to undertake the inerting of a hazardous atmosphere, possibly leading to a severe accident.


``Labeled'' means identified with a sign, placard, or other form of written communication that informs all employees
of the status or condition of the work space to which it is attached. This term was not included in the proposed revision
of Subpart B, but OSHA believes that its inclusion is necessary for clarity. 

``Lower explosive limit'' (LEL) means the minimum concentration of vapor below which propagation of a flame does
not occur in the presence of an ignition source. This definition is unchanged from the proposal.

``Marine Chemist'' means an individual who possesses a current Marine Chemist Certificate issued by the National
Fire Protection Association. This definition is substantially the same as the one in the proposal. 

In the NPRM, OSHA requested comments related to the definition of ``Marine Chemist''. Although some comments were
received on this subject, they all related to the issue of whether or not anyone else could perform the duties required
of a Marine Chemist. These comments are discussed under the summary and explanation of   1915.12(c)(3)
and 1915.14(a)(1), later in this preamble. 

``Nationally Recognized Testing laboratory'' (NRTL) means a laboratory recognized by OSHA as meeting the provisions
of Appendix A of  1910.7. In the previous standard, OSHA referred to ``Underwriters Laboratories'' as one of
the organizations that could approve lamps for use in Class I, Group D atmospheres. Since OSHA has promulgated the
NRTL standard, laboratories meeting that standard are the appropriate organizations to approve such lamps. 

``Not Safe for Hot Work'' denotes a space where hot work may not be performed. This definition is substantially the
same as the one in the proposal. 

``Not Safe for Workers'' denotes a space that employees may not enter. The proposed definition of ``Not Safe for Workers''
contained criteria to be used to determine whether or not a space was safe for entry. OSHA has not carried these criteria
forward into the definition of this term in the final rule. The same criteria also appeared under the proposed definition
of ``Safe for Workers''. OSHA believes that removing the redundancy will help clarify revised Subpart B. (See the
summary and explanation of the definition of ``Enter with Restrictions'', earlier in this preamble, for additional
discussion of issues regarding the use of the term ``Not Safe for Workers''.) 

``Oxygen-deficient atmosphere'' means an atmosphere having an oxygen concentration of less than 19.5 percent by
volume. ``Oxygen-enriched atmosphere'' means an atmosphere that contains 22.0 percent or more oxygen by volume.
These two definitions have been carried forward from the proposal without substantive change. 

``Safe for Hot Work'' denotes a space that meets the following criteria: 

(1) The atmosphere is not oxygen-enriched; 

(2) The concentration of flammable vapors in the atmosphere is less than 10 percent of the LEL; 

(3) Residues or materials within the space, under existing atmospheric conditions in the presence of hot work and
while maintained as directed by the Marine Chemist or competent person, are not capable of producing a higher concentration
of oxygen or flammable vapors than permitted under the first two criteria; and 

(4) All adjacent spaces have been cleaned or inerted or otherwise treated sufficiently to prevent the spread of fire.


The definition in the final rule is substantively the same as the corresponding definition in the proposal; however,
the language has been improved for clarity. 

``Safe for Workers'' denotes a space that meets the following criteria: 

(1) The atmosphere is neither oxygen-deficient nor oxygen- enriched; 

(2) The concentration of flammable vapors is below 10 percent of the LEL; 

(3) Any toxic materials associated with cargo, fuel, tank coatings, inerting mediums, or fumigants are within permissible
concentrations at the time of inspection; and 

(4) Residues or materials associated with the work authorized by the Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist,
or competent person will not produce uncontrolled toxic materials under existing atmospheric conditions while
maintained as directed. 

The definition in the final rule is substantively the same as the corresponding definition in the proposal, except
that the language has been improved for clarity and the ``exception'' in the proposal regarding the concentration
of flammable vapors has not been carried forward. OSHA believes that this exception, which is recognized in  1915.13(b)(6)
in the final rule, more properly falls under the new term ``Enter with Restrictions''. 

``Space'' means an area on a vessel, vessel section or within a shipyard such as, but not limited to, a cargo tank or hold,
pump or engine room, storage locker, tank containing flammable or combustible liquids, gases, or solids; a room within
a building, crawl space, tunnel, and accessway. Although no definition of this word was proposed, its meaning is essential
to the content of revised Subpart B. The final rule uses the word ``space'' broadly to encompass all the different types
of areas in a shipyard where dangerous atmospheres might be found. The definition of this word in the final rule is intended
to convey this meaning to employers and employees who must comply with the standard. 

``Upper explosive limit'' (UEL) means the maximum concentration of flammable vapor above which propagation of flame
does not occur on contact with a source of ignition. This definition is unchanged from the proposal. 

``Vessel section'' means a subassembly, module, or other component of a vessel being built, repaired, or broken.
This definition is unchanged from the proposal. 

``Visual inspection'' means the physical survey of the space, surroundings and contents by the competent person,
Marine Chemist, or Certified Industrial Hygienist to identify hazards such as, but not limited to, restricted accessibility,
residues, unguarded machinery, and piping or electrical systems that could create or enhance hazards. This term
is defined in the final rule to clarify what is required of the person preforming the inspection. 

OSHA has not carried forward into the final rule the proposed definition of ``weather deck''. The Agency believes
that a definition of this term is not necessary to the meaning of the standard.

2.  1915.12 Precaution Before Entering Spaces. 



OSHA has made several significant changes to  1915.12. First, OSHA has reformatted this section to address
more appropriately the order of atmospheric testing to be conducted by competent persons when determining hazards
within confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres prior to employee entry. Second, OSHA has raised
the minimum level of oxygen for entry and addressed oxygen-enriched atmospheres in this section. Third, the Agency
has specified when and under what conditions an employee may enter a space that has been found ``not safe for workers.''
Finally, OSHA has added new paragraphs to this section to address: (1) The training of individuals who enter dangerous
and confined spaces (paragraph (d)), (2) rescue teams (paragraph (e)), and (3) the exchange of hazard information
between employers (paragraph (f)). 

OSHA is also making the requirement to visually inspect each space explicit in this final standard. In the NPRM, comments
were solicited on whether the shipyard competent person should be required to conduct a physical examination of the
tank and pipelines when making an inspection. Many commenters supported OSHA's decision (Ex. 6-4, 6-10,
6-12, 6-13, 6-15, 6-18, 6-24, 6-28, 6-31, 6-33, 6-34). For example,
NFPA (Ex. 6-10) stated: 




NFPA strongly supports the inclusion of a requirement that in addition to atmospheric testing the shipyard competent
person should also be required to conduct a physical examination of the space and associated pipelines. NFPA 306,
2-1 requires the Marine Chemist to conduct a physical inspection and to conduct test within the space. For high
flash point, low vapor pressure products such as diesel, a test for flammable or combustible vapors is not sufficient,
since at atmospheric temperatures there are not enough vapors being evolved for the combustible gas indicator to
detect. It is essential that physical inspections be conducted. 




OSHA has decided that a visual inspection is a crucial element in ascertaining that confined and enclosed spaces and
other dangerous atmospheres are safe for entrants. Based on the visual inspection and other information available
to the employer about non-atmospheric hazards, the employer is required to take specific actions as required by other
subparts. For example, precautions to be taken for electrical hazards are covered by  1915.181 (shipboard)
and  1910.147 (shipboard) and machinery is addressed by  1915.164 (for vessels) and  1910.212
(land-side). 

In paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of final  1915.12, OSHA is requiring atmospheres to be tested for oxygen content
first, flammability second, and toxicity third. The format of the previous standard implied that atmospheres be
tested for flammability first, toxicity second, and oxygen deficiency third. 

Even before the revision of Subpart B was proposed, Newport News Shipbuilding and Harbor Testing Laboratory commented
that the proper sequence is testing for oxygen, then flammability, then toxicity (53 FR 48096). To address this problem,
OSHA proposed to present the testing requirements in the proper sequence. However, as noted in the NPRM, the proposed
rule would not have required testing in any particular order. 

OSHA believes that it is important for atmospheric testing to be conducted in the proper sequence. The Agency reached
the same conclusion in the rulemaking on  1910.146, which adopted a rule requiring atmospheric testing in the
correct order in that final rule, for the following reasons: 




A test for oxygen must be performed first because most combustible gas meters are oxygen dependent and will not provide
reliable readings in an oxygen deficient atmosphere. In fact, the Johnson Wax Company (Ex. 14-222) stated that
``there is [a] specific (sensor dependent) oxygen level below which the combustible gas sensor will 

not

 respond at all [emphasis was supplied in original].'' Combustible gases are tested for next because the threat of
fire or explosion is both more immediate and more life threatening, in most cases, than exposure to toxic gases. [53
FR 48096] 




This reasoning applies to the revision of Subpart B as well. Atmospheric testing in confined and enclosed spaces and
other dangerous atmospheres in shipyards is basically the same as atmospheric testing in general industry permit
spaces. Therefore, the revision of  1915.12 requires shipyard employers to perform atmospheric testing in
the following sequence: oxygen content, flammability, toxicity. 

In paragraph (a)(1), OSHA continues the requirement (in  1915.12(c)(1)) for competent persons to test atmospheres
of specific spaces that may contain oxygen-deficient atmospheres. These spaces are listed specifically as follows:


(1) Spaces that have been sealed, 

(2) Spaces and adjacent spaces that contain or have contained combustible or flammable liquids or gases, 

(3) Spaces and adjacent spaces that contain or have contained liquids, gases, or solids that are toxic, corrosive,
or irritant,

(4) Spaces that have been fumigated, and 



(5) Spaces containing materials or residues that could create an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. 
This final rule adopts the language from the NPRM to require competent persons to test atmospheres of these spaces
for ``oxygen content'' rather than just ``oxygen deficiency.'' Paragraph (a)(2) of final  1915.12 addresses
the maximum permissible oxygen concentration within confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres.
Therefore, the testing to be performed must be for content rather than for oxygen deficiency alone. (The rationale
for adopting a requirement for maximum permissible oxygen exposure is discussed under the summary and explanation
of final  1915.12(a)(2).) 



In the previous rule  1915.12(c)(1) required tests to be conducted ``[b]efore employees are initially permitted
to enter'' any of the regulated spaces. Paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) contain this identical language for pre-entry
testing for flammable gases and vapors and for toxic substances. The NPRM used the language ``prior to initial entry''
in proposed  1915.12(a)(1) and the language ``prior to entry'' in proposed  1915.12 (b)(1) and (c)(1).
The preamble to the proposal noted that questions had arisen regarding what was intended by ``initial entry'' in the
previous standard and that the Coast Guard had interpreted the OSHA standard to require retesting if more than 24 hours
had elapsed since the previous testing. The NPRM raised the issues of whether ``initial entry'' should be defined
in Subpart B and, if so, what that definition should be. 



Several commenters believed that OSHA should not specify the maximum time permitted to elapse before additional
testing is required (Ex. 6-3, 6-6, 6-8, 6-12, 6-18). They argued that the length of time
between testing and entry could vary depending on the space and the possible hazards involved. For example, Mr. Charles
K. Klein, representing Newport News Shipbuilding, stated:






OSHA should not specify a time limit regarding re-certification of spaces after ``initial entry'' certification
has been given. The Coast Guard's interpretation for re-certification is based on a 24-hour lapse period since a tank
has been previously determined safe for entry. However, we feel that as long as conditions have not changed since the
space was certified for ``initial entry'', additional certification is not required. Periods longer than 24 hours
may be appropriate in cases where a confined space does not contain a hazardous substance, is not connected to a system
which contains a hazardous substance and has not been closed except for an air or hydrostatic test. However, certain
evolutions involving hazardous substances in or near confined spaces may require testing on a shift basis or more
often. A time limit imposed on ``initial entry'' is unnecessarily restrictive and reduces the employer's flexibility
in providing a safe and healthful work environment in an effective, cost-efficient manner. [Ex. 6-6] 






Two commenters maintained that the certificate issued by a Marine Chemist would control whether or not a space had
to be retested beyond a certain period (Ex. 6-8, 6-18). They believed that retesting was unnecessary unless
conditions changed or unless the Marine Chemist's certificate required it. Sound Testing, Inc., expressed this
position as follows:






It should be made clear that a Marine Chemist's certificate is voided not by the passage of time, but by the change of
conditions. Therefore, if a competent person can ascertain that conditions have not drastically changed, the chemist's
certificate remains in force, regardless of how long between competent person inspections. The corollary of this
is that there should be no explicit time limit on the chemist's certificate unless the chemist himself sees a reason
for such a limit. [Ex. 6-8]






Other rulemaking participants argued that the regulation should clarify what constitutes initial entry or when
additional testing is required before the first entry into the space (Ex. 6-4, 6-5, 6-10, 6-13,
6-21, 6-22, 6-24, 6-27, 6-28, 6-33, 6-34, 6-37, 6-38). Several
of these commenters stated that the standard should specify the maximum interval permitted before additional testing
would have to be performed (Ex. 6-4, 6-5, 6-10, 6-24, 6-27). The intervals suggested
ranged from immediately before the entry (Ex. 6-24) to 24 hours (Ex. 6-27). For example, the U.S. Coast
Guard stated:






It has been our experience that if a minimum is not set the retesting is not done or is done infrequently because of the
competent person's other work obligations. Our policy does not prohibit the inspector from requiring additional
testing if he feels the conditions warrant. We have required additional retesting because of rises in temperature,
excess quantity of cargo residues, and lack of confidence in the competent person. [Ex. 6-4]

Other commenters thought that a definition of ``initial entry'' would clarify the standard (Ex. 6-21, 6-22,
6-23, 6-28, 6-33, 6-34, 6-37, 6-38). Four of them recommended that ``initial entry''
refer to the first entry after testing and that additional testing be required for entry on subsequent days to ensure
that safe conditions are still present (Ex. 6-21, 6-22, 6-37, 6-38). Two of them suggested
that it refer to the time immediately after the initial opening of a space, when the tests and inspections performed
to determine whether or not the space is safe for entry are conducted (Ex. 6-28, 6-34). The American Waterways
Shipyard Conference (AWSC) maintained that ``initial entry'' should be defined as the first entry by shipyard personnel
after the space has been certified by the Marine Chemist (Ex. 6-23). They explained the reasons for their position
as follows:






The United States Coast Guard has interpreted the term to mean ``more than 24 hours have elapsed since a tank has been
determined safe for entry and/or hot work.'' If that time period has elapsed then the tank must be recertified. However,
this interpretation does not take into account the shipyard facility's requirements to maintain conditions. The
shipyard facility must commence work on the vessel within 24 hours, after the certificate has been issued or the Marine
Chemist certificate becomes invalid. As long as the conditions listed on the certificate are maintained, then the
certificate is valid. However, if the conditions, as specified on the certificate change, then the Marine Chemist
is recalled to recheck the space. 



Including the definition for initial entry recommended by AWSC will eliminate confusion within the industry and
impose a standard practice around the country. [Ex. 6-23]






OSHA believes that it is important to clarify the term ``initial entry'' so that employers and employees understand
clearly what OSHA means by the term. With respect to spaces that require certification by a Marine Chemist, it is OSHA's
intent that ``initial entry'' means the first entry into a certificated space after the Marine Chemist's certificate
has been posted. The period of time during which the Marine Chemist's certificate is valid is established by the Marine
Chemist and is logged on the certificate as posted. OSHA believes that the Marine Chemist performing the tests and
inspection of a space to be entered is in the best position to determine the duration of the permit's validity. With
respect to spaces that must be tested but need not be certificated by a Marine Chemist, the Agency will interpret the
``initial entry'' to be the very first entry into the space after testing is performed. (No entry is allowed before
those tests have been performed.) In addition, the tests must be performed close enough to the time of entry to ensure
that they accurately reflect conditions in the spaces. To meet this standard, testing will nearly always be done just
prior to entry by employees; seldom will tests be performed prior to an hour before employees are to enter a space. 



There are also requirements in  1915.15 for periodic monitoring and maintaining atmospheric conditions within
a space as found by the Marine Chemist, Coast Guard authorized person, or competent person. Tests must be repeated
as often as necessary to ensure that the required atmospheric conditions within the space are maintained (paragraphs
(c) and (e)). Additionally, when a change occurs that could alter conditions within a tested space, work in the space
must stop and employees must exit, and the area must be retested (paragraphs (b), (d), and (f)).



OSHA believes it is unnecessary to establish within the regulatory text of  1915.12 a specific time limit beyond
which the initial entry is not permitted after pre-entry testing. As noted in several comments, periods longer than
24 hours may be appropriate if a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere does not contain a hazardous
substance, is not connected to a piping or exhaust ventilation system that contains a hazardous substance, and has
not been closed except for an air or hydrostatic test (Ex. 6-3, 6-6). OSHA has determined that the need for
testing is directly related to the potential for change to occur within spaces. The duty to test as conditions warrant
is imposed by  1915.12 and  1915.15, in combination. These two sections require that, in all cases, testing
of the space must be conducted before employees enter the space and as often as necessary to monitor conditions within
the space as work progresses. Obviously, any change in conditions that could affect the designation of a space as ``Safe
for Workers'' require reinspection, retesting, and recertification of the space by the competent person or Marine
Chemist. 



Therefore, for the purposes of this rule, the term ``initial entry'' is interpreted by OSHA to mean the first entry
into a space. The time period between pre-entry testing and initial entry may vary. However, the space must be reinspected,
retested, and recertified any time conditions in the space might have become unsafe for employees.

As noted earlier, in paragraph (a)(1), OSHA is continuing the previous requirement (in  1915.12(c)(1)) for
competent persons to test atmospheres of specific spaces that may contain oxygen-deficient atmospheres. The following
paragraphs describe each of the spaces itemized in paragraph (a)(1). 
Paragraph (a)(1)(i) of final  1915.12 lists spaces that have been sealed, e.g., those that have been coated
and closed up and those that have been painted and that lack ventilation. OSHA has combined the spaces listed in paragraphs
(c)(1) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of the previous  1915.12 into one paragraph because OSHA considers the hazards
within these spaces to be similar. The primary hazard of these spaces is the lack of proper ventilation and the resultant
possible lack of oxygen. OSHA considers the consolidation of the previous paragraphs into one paragraph to be an editorial
change for clarity because none of the spaces currently listed have been deleted nor have any been added. 
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) lists spaces and adjacent spaces that contain or have contained combustible or flammable liquids
or gases. Paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(1)(iv) list spaces and adjacent spaces that contain or have contained liquids,
gases, or solids that are toxic, corrosive, or irritant or that have been fumigated. These three paragraphs refer
to spaces that were included under the previous  1915.12(c)(1)(i), which reads as follows: 



(i) Spaces in which the test[s] required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section indicate that no flammable or toxic
contaminants are present in the atmosphere. 



Under this previous provision, spaces that require flammability and toxicity testing must also be tested for oxygen
deficiency. In revised subpart B, OSHA has simply named the spaces that are covered under the previous  1915.12
(a) and (b) in lieu of specifying them by reference. Additionally, the final rule requires these spaces to be tested
for oxygen regardless of whether they are found to be safe with respect to the hazards of flammable and toxic substances.
Under the previous standard, which implied that the flammability and toxicity tests were performed before the oxygen
test, once a space was found to be unsafe due to the presence of flammable gases or vapors or toxic air contaminants,
further testing for oxygen deficiency was unnecessary. Under the final rule, tests for oxygen content are conducted
first and must always be performed. 
Paragraph (a)(1)(v) lists spaces containing materials or residues that could create an oxygen-deficient atmosphere.
The previous  1915.12(c)(1)(v) covers only cargo spaces containing cargoes or residues that can create an
oxygen-deficient atmosphere. The corresponding paragraph in the proposal (proposed  1915.12(a)(viii))
also addressed only cargo spaces. The proposed and previous language also provide examples of cargos that can absorb
oxygen and create an oxygen-deficient atmosphere (scrap iron, fresh fruit and molasses, and various vegetable drying
oils). 
As noted in the summary and explanation of final  1915.11(a), earlier in this preamble, the scope of subpart
B is being expanded to address all confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres throughout shipyard
employment. While the previous standard recognizes that the hazard of oxygen deficiency may be found in cargo spaces,
many other confined and enclosed spaces in shipyard employment also pose this hazard. OSHA believes that it is essential
that all such spaces be tested for oxygen content before entry to assure their safety. Therefore, the Agency is eliminating
the reference to cargo spaces and is requiring all spaces containing materials or residues that could create an oxygen
deficiency to be tested. 
Paragraph (a)(2) requires spaces that have been tested and found to contain oxygen-deficient atmospheres to be labeled
``Not Safe for Workers.'' Spaces found to be oxygen-enriched are required to be labeled ``Not Safe for Workers_Not
Safe for Hot Work.'' If employees are to enter a space that has an oxygen-enriched or oxygen-deficient atmosphere,
then ventilation must be provided to maintain the oxygen content of the atmosphere at or above 19.5 percent and below
22.0 percent by volume. After the ventilation produces an acceptable level of oxygen, the warning signs may be removed.

The previous  1915.12(c)(2) only requires ventilation for spaces containing less than 16.5 percent oxygen
by volume. It does not require spaces with oxygen-deficient or oxygen-enriched atmospheres to be labeled, nor does
it address oxygen-enriched atmospheres. Additionally, it requires ventilation to be provided only when the oxygen
content in the space is below 16.5 percent by volume, rather than below 19.5 percent. 
Unlike either the proposal or the previous rule, the final rule addresses hazards associated with oxygen-enriched
atmospheres. Oxygen-enriched atmospheres create significant risks to employees entering confined and enclosed
spaces and other dangerous atmospheres, and precautions must be taken before entry into such atmospheres. The proposal
would have required atmospheres to be tested for oxygen content rather than for oxygen deficiency alone. No rulemaking
participant objected to this requirement. NFPA 306, in Section 2-3.1, sets the criteria for compartments and
spaces to be found ``Safe for Workers.'' The first criterion listed in this section is that the oxygen content of the
space be ``at least 19.5 percent and not greater than 22 percent by volume.'' Thus, OSHA is consistent with the existing
national consensus standard which has adopted provisions restricting entry into oxygen-enriched atmospheres.

The hazards of working in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere are widely recognized. The presence of greater than normal
amounts of oxygen increases the flammability of materials and lowers the flash point of flammable materials. An ignition
source, such as a spark, that would ordinarily be of insufficient energy to ignite a flammable mixture may ignite such
mixture in oxygen-enriched atmospheres. The presence of greater than normal amounts of oxygen can also increase
the chances of spontaneous combustion of flammable materials. Thus, an oxygen-enriched atmosphere in a confined
or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere can place employees at an unacceptable risk of injury due to fire or
explosion. Employers must take measures to find the source of oxygen and then eliminate that source and ventilate
the space in order to control the hazards involved. 
For the foregoing reasons, OSHA has adopted requirements in final  1915.12(a) that are intended to eliminate
the hazards posed by oxygen-enriched atmospheres. The Agency has adopted NFPA's criterion for oxygen enrichment
(that is, an oxygen concentration of 22 percent or more by volume). Thus, the final rule sets a standard that protects
employees to a level equal to that provided by the relevant national consensus standard for the work involved. 
The proposed rule, under  1915.12(a)(4) and (a)(5), would have required labeling spaces with oxygen-deficient
(that is less than 19.5 percent oxygen) atmospheres, but would have permitted employees to enter such spaces provided
they were wearing respirators. 
The final rule raises the minimum acceptable concentration of oxygen from 16.5 percent to 19.5 percent by volume.
As noted earlier, the NPRM proposed raising the minimum acceptable level of oxygen, and several rulemaking participants
commented on this issue (Ex. 6-3, 6-6, 6-10, 6-11, 6-15, 6-18, 6-24, 6-28,
6-33). All of them agreed with the proposed minimum oxygen level. For example, the Shipbuilders Council of America
(Ex. 6-3) stated: 



Routine entry should be allowed only if the oxygen level is at least 19.5 percent. 



Northwest Marine Chemist (Ex. 6-18) maintained that the existing minimum acceptable concentration of oxygen
in  1915.12(c)(1) was outdated, as follows: 



The use of 16.5% oxygen by OSHA is archaic, and not used in the industry in my area. 



Additionally, OSHA's generic confined space standard, in  1910.146(b), defines ``oxygen-deficient atmosphere''
as ``an atmosphere containing less than 19.5 percent oxygen by volume.'' 
OSHA has previously concluded that permitting employees to work in atmospheres in which the concentration of oxygen
is below 19.5 percent by volume presents an unacceptable risk of acute adverse health effects. In the preamble to final
 1910.146, OSHA described the possible results of exposure to oxygen-deficient atmospheres as: dizziness,
tiredness, difficulty in breathing, confusion, unconsciousness, and death (58 FR 4476). Considering these possible
consequences, the Agency continues to believe that the minimum acceptable concentration of oxygen, in the absence
of control measures, is 19.5 percent by volume. 
As noted earlier,  1915.12(a)(2) requires spaces containing oxygen-deficient and oxygen-enriched atmospheres
to be labeled ``Not Safe for Workers'' or ``Not Safe for Workers_Not Safe for Hot Work,'' respectively. The previous
standard does not require such labeling. The proposed rule would have required labeling only for oxygen deficiency,
under  1915.12(a)(5). No one objected to the labeling requirement proposed in  1915.12(a)(5), and OSHA
believes that this labeling is necessary to warn employees to keep out of spaces containing insufficient oxygen to
work safely. Therefore, the Agency is carrying forward the proposed provision that spaces with oxygen-deficient
atmospheres be labeled ``Not Safe for Workers.'' Because OSHA has found it necessary and appropriate to prohibit
entry into oxygen-enriched atmospheres, the Agency also believes that it is necessary to label spaces containing
such atmospheres. Because of the increased risk of fire and explosion associated with these atmospheres, the final
rule requires them to be labeled as ``Not Safe for Hot Work'' as well as ``Not Safe for Workers.'' 
Final  1915.12(a)(2) requires ventilation to be provided to maintain the oxygen content of the atmosphere
in a safe range. Paragraph (c)(2) of the previous  1915.12 contains the same requirement, except that it applies
only when an oxygen deficiency is found. The proposed revision of Subpart B would not have required ventilation but
would have permitted employees to enter oxygen-deficient atmospheres if they were wearing respirators (proposed
 1915.12(a)(4)). 
OSHA has decided not to allow employees to enter confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres that are
designated ``Not Safe for Workers,'' except under tight restriction. (See the summary and explanation of final  1915.12(c)(3),
later in this preamble, for a discussion of issues related to employee entry into such spaces.) Therefore, the final
rule adopts a requirement, similar to the one in the previous  1915.12(c)(2), for ventilation to be provided
any time a space is hazardous because of oxygen deficiency or oxygen enrichment. Once the ventilation brings the oxygen
content to a safe level, signs labeling the space as ``Not Safe for Workers'' or ``Not Safe for Workers_Not Safe for
Hot Work'' may be removed. 
Paragraph (a)(3) of final  1915.12 prohibits employees from entering any confined or enclosed space or other
dangerous atmosphere that is oxygen-deficient or is oxygen-enriched. Exceptions are granted for emergency rescue
and for entries of short duration to install ventilation equipment, provided that the atmosphere is continuously
monitored for oxygen content and that respiratory protection and other personal protective equipment and clothing
are provided in accordance with Subpart I of part 1915. 
The previous  1915.12 prohibits entry into IDLH atmospheres. Paragraph (d) of that section presents exceptions
to the general prohibition which recognize emergency entries and short duration entries performed for the purpose
of installing ventilation equipment or starting operations, provided the work is performed in accordance with paragraphs
(a) and (b) of the previous  1915.152 (contained in Subpart I) relating to respiratory protection. 
Proposed  1915.12(d) presented the same exceptions as the previous rule, but with three additional provisos:

(1) That no ignition sources are present, and 
(2) That the atmosphere in the space is maintained above the upper explosive limit, and 
(3) That the atmosphere is monitored continuously. 
The reference to the Subpart I requirements was placed in a note following the proposed paragraph. As noted earlier,
proposed  1915.12(a)(4) would also have allowed entry into oxygen-deficient atmospheres by employees wearing
respirators in accordance with Subpart I of part 1915. No restrictions on the purpose or length of entry were proposed.

The NPRM requested comments on the issues of whether or not work in IDLH atmospheres should ever be permitted and on
what control measures are necessary for the protection of employees working in IDLH atmospheres. In the preamble
to the NPRM, OSHA recognized that atmospheres containing flammable vapor concentrations greater than the UEL for
a particular vapor do not present a fire or explosion hazard to employees because the atmosphere is too rich in flammable
vapors or gases to burn. However, OSHA expressed concern about employees who work in such atmospheres because such
atmospheres may contain chemical exposures from the flammable vapor that are above the permissible exposure limit
(PEL) for the particular chemical creating the vapors. 

Only one commenter supported OSHA's proposal to allow work in IDLH atmospheres. The American Waterways Shipyard
Conference (Ex. 6-23) stated that OSHA should not put a time limit on ``short duration'' and that the proposal
was appropriate, as follows:




Due to the vast differences in vessel design, it would be extremely difficult to define an ``emergency work'' situation.
Similarly, a time limit for ``brief duration'' would be difficult to ascertain since the work to be performed differs
in every situation. By instituting a time factor for work of brief duration, shipyard employees may be required to
skip safety steps in order to finish the work in the required time frame. 

Work in atmospheres in the Upper Explosive Limit (UEL) should not be prohibited. The work done in an UEL atmosphere
is done on a very infrequent basis, but it is work that could not be done otherwise such as entry of a cargo tank during
tank cleaning operations to set a cargo suction hose.




By contrast, many other rulemaking participants believed that work in IDLH atmospheres is unnecessary and should
be prohibited, either under all conditions (Ex. 6-4, 6-15, 6-18, 6-24, 6-31) or under
all but emergency conditions (Ex. 6-7, 6-8, 6-10, 6-12, 6-21, 6-22, 6-28,
6-33, 6-34, 6-37, 6-38). Independent Testing and Consultation, Inc. (Ex. 6-24), presented
the following arguments against work in atmospheres above the upper explosive limit for a flammable gas or vapor:




The paragraph 1915.12(d) should be deleted for the following reasons. 

(a) There is no way to keep the atmosphere above the upper explosive limit (UEL). If entry to the tank is required, it
follows that there must be a region where the tank atmosphere mixes with the outside atmosphere. In this region the
concentration of gas will be in the explosive range. 

(b) The equipment used to measure gas concentrations above the UEL is not usually available. 

(c) All ignition sources cannot easily be eliminated. There remains possible ignition due to static electricity.
It has been my experience that owners and operators would rather clean or otherwise make safe a tank or compartment
even if the work required in the compartment is of the briefest duration.

 


NFPA (Ex. 6-10) addressed work in IDLH atmospheres as follows:

 


NFPA does not believe that work in IDLH atmospheres should be encouraged, except for the purposes of emergency rescue.
NFPA does not support the proposal of working in UEL atmospheres. The potential hazards associated with ignition
sources, such as static electricity, and the introduction of air to bring an atmosphere above the UEL within the flammable
range, are significant and difficult to control. The additional testing requirements would also be significant.
NFPA 306 only permits such a practice in the case of inerting for flammable compressed gas as described in 2-3.8.
In this case now work is permitted on the tank or pipelines.

 


OSHA agrees with the commenters who stated that working in IDLH atmospheres or in atmospheres containing concentrations
of flammable gases or vapors above their UEL is very hazardous. The limitations on maintaining an atmosphere above
a gas's or vapor's UEL, as noted by Independent Testing and Consultation, Inc., are severe indeed. If a mistake is made
in such an atmosphere, an explosion will almost certainly result. Atmospheres that are IDLH because of toxicity also
present a very serious danger to employees. A failure of the respiratory protective equipment protecting an employee
in this type of atmosphere could quickly lead to his or her death. 

OSHA further believes that conditions somewhat less hazardous than those posed by IDLH atmospheres pose unnecessary
dangers for shipyard employees. The generic permit-required confined space standard, in  1910.146(b), defines
a hazardous atmosphere, in part, as follows:

 




Hazardous atmosphere 

means an atmosphere that may expose employees to the risk of death, incapacitation, impairment of ability to self-rescue
(that is, escape unaided from a permit space), injury, or acute illness from one or more of the following causes: 

(1) Flammable gas, vapor, or mist in excess of 10 percent of its lower flammable limit (LFL);

(3) Atmospheric oxygen concentration below 19.5 percent or above 23.5 percent;

 


OSHA has already determined that these conditions constitute serious hazards, ones that are tightly regulated in
the generic permit-space standard in  1910.146. These conditions can also be found in confined and enclosed
spaces and in other dangerous atmosphere in shipyard work. In order for Subpart B to be as protective as the general
industry permit-space standard, which permits employees to work in hazardous atmospheres using a system of permits
and attendants not required by Subpart B, OSHA believes that Subpart B must require measures that ensure that employees
are not exposed to such hazardous conditions. For this reason, the Agency is adopting requirements in final Subpart
B that prohibit employee entry into confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres presenting an oxygen-deficient
or oxygen-enriched atmosphere or containing concentrations of flammable gases or vapors greater than or equal to
10 percent of the gas's or vapor's lower explosive limit. 

OSHA concludes, however, that entry into such spaces can safely be permitted under certain conditions. First, in
emergencies, where persons are endangered, entry might be necessary to save the life of an entrant or the lives of every
person on that transport. Second, because these spaces will have to be ventilated to make the atmosphere safe for employees,
entry might be necessary to set up the proper ventilation equipment. For these reasons, final Subpart B permits entry
into IDLH and other hazardous atmospheres for emergency rescue and for periods of short duration to install ventilation
equipment necessary for normal entry. 

During such emergency or short duration entries, however, additional precautions must be taken to protect the entrants.
The additional precautions to be taken must be appropriate for the hazards presented by the particular space involved.
Thus, the final rule treats oxygen enrichment and deficiency, the presence of flammable gases and vapors, and atmospheres
containing toxic contaminants at IDLH levels separately. For oxygen-enriched and oxygen-deficient atmospheres,
the space must be continuously monitored for oxygen content (so that appropriate control measures can be taken if
it changes), and respiratory protection and other personal protective equipment and clothing must be provided in
accordance with Subpart I (so that appropriate personal protective equipment is provided and so that an attendant
will be present if the oxygen content makes the space IDLH). The hazards of flammable atmospheres and toxicity are
treated separately in their respective paragraphs (final  1915.12 (b)(3) and (c)(4)). 

Paragraph (b) of final  1915.12 sets precautions to be taken before employees enter areas that present hazards
related to flammable atmospheres. Paragraph (b)(1) applies to spaces that contain or have contained combustible
or flammable liquids or gases and to spaces (called, appropriately, ``adjacent spaces'') that are adjacent to those
spaces. These spaces must be: (1) inspected by a competent person to determine whether or not combustible or flammable
liquids are present, and (2) tested by a competent person before entry by any employee to determine the concentration
of flammable gases and vapors within the space. These precautions also apply to adjacent spaces. 

Previous  1915.12(a)(1) requires the same spaces to be tested by a competent person to determine the concentration
of flammable gases and vapors. 

The proposed rule contained requirements equivalent to the previous standard in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and
(b)(3) of proposed  1915.12. 

The final rule differs from the previous and proposed rules only in that  1915.12(b)(1) includes a requirement
for the competent person to inspect the space, as well as test it, for the presence of combustible or flammable liquids.
The inspection is necessary so that the competent person will be more likely to be made aware of any malfunction in the
testing instrument. Obviously, if the inspection reveals the presence of a flammable liquid, a flammability test
can be expected to result in some detectable concentration of flammable gases or vapors. The lack of any such reading
from the test instrument would be an indication that the device might be defective and should lead to further investigation
of the problem. The inspections will also be necessary if a hazardous concentration of flammable gases or vapors is
found so that the proper precautions can be taken to eliminate the hazard. Although in the previous  1915.12(a)
does not specify that an inspection is to take place, in the previous  1915.7(c), which requires tests 

and inspections 

to be entered into the ``Log of 

Inspections

 and Tests,'' implies that the competent person is to perform inspections in addition to any tests that are required.


Paragraph (b)(2) requires spaces that have been tested and found to contain concentrations of a flammable gas or vapor
greater than or equal to 10 percent of the gas's or vapor's lower explosive limit (LEL) are required to be labeled ``Not
Safe for Workers_Not Safe for Hot Work.'' If employees are to enter a space that has flammable gases or vapors in such
concentrations, then ventilation must be provided to ensure that the concentration of these gases or vapors is maintained
below 10 percent of their LELs. After the ventilation produces an acceptable atmosphere, the warning signs may be
removed. 

Paragraph (a)(2) of the previous  1915.12 requires spaces containing hazardous concentrations of flammable
gases or vapors to be ventilated until the concentration drops below 10 percent of the gas's or vapor's LEL before workers
are permitted to enter the space. No labeling of these spaces is required under the previous standard. 

Paragraph (b)(5) of proposed  1915.12 would have required labeling of spaces in a manner equivalent to that
required under the final rule. Paragraph (b)(4) of proposed  1915.12 would have prohibited entry when the concentration
of flammable gases or vapors was at or above 10 percent of the LEL, but the proposal did not specifically require ventilation
in  1915.12. Ventilation requirements related to flammable atmospheres were proposed in  1915.13(b)(8).


No rulemaking participant objected to the proposed labeling requirement. Therefore, OSHA has carried it forward
into the final rule. The final rule, unlike the proposal, continues to require spaces that are hazardous because of
the presence of flammable gases or vapors to be labeled even when employees are permitted to enter for emergency purposes
or for short durations to install ventilation. The proposal did not require the spaces to be labeled during these entries
(in effect permitting employers to remove the signs at these times). However, such entries require the adoption of
special precautions (see the summary and explanation of final  1915.12(b)(3), later in this preamble). OSHA
believes that the labeling must be maintained during these entries so that unauthorized, unprotected entry is prevented.


Paragraph (b)(3) of final  1915.12 prohibits employees from entering spaces containing concentrations of
flammable gases or vapors at or above their LELs. However, employees may enter these spaces for emergency rescue or
for a short duration for the installation of ventilation equipment provided that: 

(1) No ignition sources are present, 

(2) The atmosphere in the space is monitored continuously; 

(3) The concentrations of flammable gases and vapors in the atmosphere in the space are maintained above their upper
explosive limits (UEL), and

(4) Respiratory protection and other personal protective equipment and clothing must be provided in accordance
with Subpart I of part 1915. 
Previous  1915.12(a)(2) prohibits workers from entering areas containing concentrations of flammable gases
or vapors at or above 10 percent of their LELs. The only exception to this rule is contained in the previous  1915.13(a)(2)
for highly volatile residues. (This provision has not been carried forward into the final rule. See the summary and
explanation of final  1915.13, later in this preamble, for a discussion of the reasons why this exception has
been dropped.) 
The proposal also contained a general prohibition against employees entering spaces containing hazardous concentrations
of flammable gases or vapors. However, as noted earlier, proposed  1915.12(d) also provided exceptions for
emergencies and for brief duration entries. The proposal would have required the same precautionary measures required
by the final rule, except that respiratory equipment and other personal protective equipment was identified as being
required, under Subpart I, through means of a note following proposed  1915.12(d)(3). 
As explained earlier, OSHA has decided to permit entries for emergency rescue and for short duration entries to install
ventilation equipment even if the space contains a hazardous atmosphere. No one objected to the precautionary measures
proposed in  1915.12(d), and they have been carried forward into the final rule. The proposed note regarding
the use of respiratory protection and other personal protective equipment has been converted into a requirement
( 1915.12(b)(3)(iv)). Even though employers are already obligated to comply with these requirements under
Subpart I, OSHA believes that providing a mandatory reference in the text of the regulation will serve to emphasize
the importance of the required personal protective equipment. 
The Agency has concluded that entry made following the requirements contained in the exception to  1915.12(b)(3)
will protect employees by controlling and minimizing the hazards involved. No ignition sources may be present in
the space so that, if the atmosphere becomes flammable, there will be no energy source to ignite it. The atmosphere
in the space must be maintained above the UEL, and the atmosphere must be continuously monitored to minimize the possibility
that a flammable atmosphere could develop. Lastly, personal protective equipment must be worn to protect the employee
from exposure to the hazardous materials involved. 
Paragraph (c) of final  1915.12 sets precautions to be taken before employees enter areas that present hazards
related to toxic atmospheres. Paragraph (c)(1) of final  1915.12 requires spaces and adjacent spaces that
contain or have contained gases, liquids, or solids that are toxic, corrosive, or irritant to be: 
(1) Inspected visually by a competent person to determine whether or not toxic, corrosive, or irritant residue contaminants
are present, and 
(2) Tested by a competent person before initial entry by any employee, to determine the concentration of toxics, corrosives,
and irritants in the air within the space. 
The previous  1915.12(b)(1) requires the following spaces to be inspected and tested by a Marine Chemist, industrial
hygienist, or other qualified person: 
(1) Cargo spaces and other spaces containing or having last contained bulk gases, liquids, or solids of a toxic, corrosive,
or irritant nature, 
(2) Spaces that have been fumigated, and 
(3) Spaces immediately adjacent to these two types of spaces. 
Paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of proposed  1915.12 would have continued the previous language without
change, except that the proposal specified that the tests had to be performed by a Marine Chemist, a certified industrial
hygienist, or a U.S. Coast Guard authorized person. Although this may have appeared to be a departure from the previous
standard, the NPRM explained that the proposal simply codified OSHA interpretation of the previous standard. The
NPRM also requested comments on the proposed definition of ``certified industrial hygienist.'' 
Most commenters agreed that a Marine Chemist or a Certified Industrial Hygienist was qualified to perform the toxicity
tests required under  1915.12(c) (Ex. 6-10, 6-12, 6-13, 6-20, 6-23, 6-24,
6-28, 6-33). They noted that the intensive training in toxicology and in appropriate control measures
these persons receive makes them uniquely qualified to test and inspect confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous
atmospheres. 
OSHA agrees with these comments, and the final rule recognizes that tests and inspections for the presence of toxic,
corrosive, or irritant substances may be performed by Marine Chemists and Certified Industrial Hygienists. 
The rulemaking participants expressed some disagreement, however, over whether or not a Coast Guard authorized
person had the proper qualifications to test and inspect areas for hazards related to the toxicity of various chemicals.
Some believed that a Coast Guard authorized person would be qualified to perform the required tests and inspections
(Ex. 6-24, 6-28, 6-33). These commenters stated that the use of a Coast Guard authorized person would
be limited to situations in which a Marine Chemist or certified industrial hygienist was not available. Several other
commenters argued that a Coast Guard authorized person is not required to receive training in hazards related to the
toxicity of various chemicals (Ex. 6-13, 6-15). In fact, the U.S. Department of Transportation (Ex. 6-13),
which administers requirements in Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations related to Coast Guard authorized persons,
stated:



Testing required by 46 CFR 35.01, 71.60, and 91.50 is primarily concerned with oxygen deficiency and combustibility
prior to conducting hot work. ``Coast Guard authorized persons'' who would be expected to conduct such testing under
Coast Guard regulations should not be considered equivalent to a Marine Chemist or Industrial Hygienist for the purpose
of evaluating toxic hazards in shipyards.

<TEXT>
 

These persons would be acting under authority of a Coast Guard license or document for compliance with regulations
contained in 46 CFR, but it is not clear that they could be effectively held accountable for their performance related
to OSHA regulations.



Coast Guard authorized persons do not typically have training in hazards related to the toxicity of various chemicals.
Since such training is necessary so that the required tests and inspections are performed safely and appropriately,
OSHA concludes that the final rule should not automatically permit these persons to perform tests and inspections
under  1915.12(c). 
Three commenters urged OSHA to include language permitting any qualified person to perform the tests and inspections
required under  1915.12(c) (Ex. 6-3, 6-6, 6-12). They argued that requiring these tests to
be performed by a Marine Chemist or a certified industrial hygienist would unnecessarily restrict an employer's
means of complying with the standard. The Shipbuilders Council of America (Ex. 6-3) stated this position as
follows:

 

SCA recommends that OSHA utilize performance-oriented language and require a ``qualified person'' perform the
testing. 
The required testing has been performed in the Shipbuilding, Ship Repairing and Shipbreaking Industry for years
without incident. With proper training, competent or other qualified persons can test and inspect for toxic substances
and provide for safe entry into confined spaces. The proposed wording will require shipyards to utilize either a Marine
Chemist or Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) for all confined spaces entries or a competent person and a Marine
Chemist or CIH for confined space entry. This requirement is overly restrictive and unnecessarily expensive on the
declining Shipbuilding, Ship Repairing and Shipbreaking Industry without adding any additional degree of safety.
SCA recommends that OSHA delete all references to Marine Chemists and Certified Industrial Hygienists and specify
that a ``qualified person'' perform all required tests (see Issue 

#

2).



OSHA has concluded that a two-pronged approach is necessary for the protection of employees working in confined and
enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres from hazards related to the toxicity of various chemicals. First,
the initial tests and inspections must be performed by a competent person (paragraph (c)(1)). Using the results provided
by the competent person, the employer can then install ventilation, if necessary, to render the space safe for entry
(paragraph (c)(2)). Second, if ventilation fails to bring concentrations of air contaminants to acceptable levels,
a Marine Chemist or Certified Industrial Hygienist must be brought in to develop and implement control measures to
protect employees entering the space (paragraph (c)(4)). 
Under final  1915.7, competent persons have the following skills and knowledge (among others): 
(1) The ability to understand and carry out instructions of Marine Chemists and certified industrial hygienists,

(2) Knowledge of the requirements of Subpart B, 
(3) Knowledge of the structures, locations, and designations of spaces where work is to be performed, 
(4) Ability to calibrate and use test instruments, including carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide indicators,

<TEXT>
 

(5) Ability to perform all required tests and inspections required of competent persons by Subpart B, and 
(6) Ability to inspect, test, and evaluate spaces to determine the need for further testing by a Marine Chemist or a
Certified Industrial Hygienist. 
These skills and this knowledge provide the competent person the ability to perform the initial tests and inspections
necessary to determine whether or not a space contains hazardous quantities of toxic substances, as required by final
 1915.12(c)(1). Once the space has been determined to contain hazardous quantities of toxic substances, it
is then the employer's responsibility to make the space safe for entry through ventilation under final  1915.12(c)(2).
If the space cannot be made safe for entry through the use of ventilation, OSHA believes that it is necessary to require
a Marine Chemist or certified industrial hygienist to develop and implement appropriate control measures to protect
employees from the hazards involved. On the basis of the record, OSHA has concluded that these two groups of persons
are the only ones capable of establishing appropriate control measures to protect shipyard employees under these
circumstances. Considering the complexity of the hazards involved and the protective techniques that need to be
applied, the Agency believes that other, less qualified, individuals cannot be relied on to take all the steps necessary
to protect employees fully. 
Paragraph (c)(2) of final  1915.12 requires spaces containing a concentration of any substance exceeding
its permissible exposure limit (PEL) or, if the substance has no PEL, its IDLH value, to be labeled ``Not Safe for Workers''.
Ventilation must then be provided to ensure that air concentrations of these substances are maintained within their
PELs or below their IDLH values. After the ventilation renders the atmosphere safe for entry, paragraph (c)(2) permits
the signs to be removed. 
The previous  1915.12(b)(2) requires spaces to be ventilated if they contain a substance in concentrations
above a level that is IDLH. The ventilation is required to bring the concentration below that level. 
The NPRM proposed to continue these previous requirements in  1915.12(c)(4). Requirements for labeling spaces
containing concentrations of toxic substances above their PELs were proposed in  1915.12(c)(6). The previous
standard contains no labeling requirement. 
OSHA received no objection to the proposed labeling requirement, and it has been incorporated into the final rule.

The final rule, unlike the previous standard, permits competent persons to test and inspect confined and enclosed
spaces and other dangerous atmospheres for the presence of toxic substances. The previous standard requires these
tests and inspections to be performed by a Marine Chemist or by an industrial hygienist. 
Entry into a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere for the performance of work is permissible only
as long as concentrations of toxic materials are maintained below their PELs. As noted earlier, OSHA has concluded
that a competent person is capable of testing and inspecting spaces for hazards related to the toxicity of various
chemicals. Thus, the competent person can make a determination based on these observations and tests that a space
is or is not safe for entry. If ventilation is necessary, the competent person can make this threshold determination,
as well. However, the competent person is not normally capable of developing the specific control measures necessary
to protect employees from exposure to any substance above its PEL. If a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous
atmosphere exposes an employee to a substance at concentrations above the permissible exposure limit, a Marine Chemist
or a Certified Industrial Hygienist is required to establish the procedures to be used to protect employees. The final
rule makes this concept mandatory. 
For spaces in which ventilation cannot maintain an acceptable atmosphere, paragraph (c)(3) of final  1915.12
requires a Marine Chemist or certified industrial hygienist to retest the space until it can be certified as ``Enter
with Restrictions'' or ``Safe for Workers.'' 
The previous standard, under  1915.12(b)(3), requires employers to comply with the respiratory protection
requirements of Subpart I whenever concentrations of toxic substances are above their PELs but below IDLH levels.
The NPRM proposed to continue this requirement in  1915.12(c)(5). However, OSHA believes, as noted in the summary
and explanation of final  1915.11(a), that employees should not enter, on a routine basis, any confined or enclosed
space or other dangerous atmosphere containing a serious hazard. Atmospheres containing concentrations of toxic
substances above their permissible exposure limits can pose serious hazards, especially to employees working in
the exposure area for extended periods of time. As noted earlier, many of the rulemaking participants asserted that
shipyard employees are better protected by industry practice, under which routine entry is permitted only if the
space involved is certified safe for workers, than by the general industry permit space standard. OSHA agrees that
the shipyard approach provides safety for employees, and is codifying that practice in final  1915.12(c)(3)
and (c)(4) (discussed next).
Paragraph (c)(4) of final  1915.12 prohibits entry into spaces that are ``Not Safe for Workers'' (under paragraph
(c)(1)), except for emergency rescue or for a short duration for the installation of ventilation equipment provided
that:

(1) The atmosphere in the space is monitored continuously, and 
(2) Respiratory protection and other necessary and appropriate personal protective equipment and clothing are
provided in accordance with Subpart I of part 1915. 
As explained earlier, OSHA has decided to permit entries for emergency rescue and for short duration entries to install
ventilation equipment even if the space contains a hazardous atmosphere, which in this case refers to toxic substances.
The procedures required will protect employees from hazards associated with exposure to these toxic substances.
The atmosphere must be monitored continuously during this limited entry to ensure that the control measures are working
as intended and that the entrant is aware of any changes in conditions in the space. Final  1915.12(c)(4) requires
personal protective equipment to protect employees from the adverse effects of exposure to toxic substances. This
control measure is already required by existing Subpart I. However, OSHA believes that providing a mandatory reference
in the text of the regulation will serve to emphasize the importance of the required personal protective equipment.

The Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) reviewed OSHA's proposal and made several recommendations
concerning new areas of shipyard employment that should be regulated in  1915.12 (Tr. 79-80, 90, 99; 4/25/90).
These recommendations included adding requirements to address the training and duties of employees entering confined
and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres, rescue teams, and exchanging hazard information between employers.
SESAC voted unanimously to include training, and overwhelmingly supported provisions for rescue teams and exchanging
hazard information between employers. As noted earlier in this preamble, the notice reopening the record on Subpart
B published the text of the recommended provisions and requested public comment on them. 
Paragraph (d) of final  1915.12 contains requirements for the training and duties of employees entering confined
and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. 
The rulemaking participants overwhelmingly approved the adoption of the training requirements listed in the notice
reopening the record (Ex. 11-2, 11-3, 11-4, 11-5, 11-6, 11-9, 11-13, 11-14,
11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-20, 11-24, 11-25, 11-26, 11-29, 11-30,
11-35, 11-37, 11-39, 11-41, 11-45, 11-47, 11-49, 11-50, 11-51).
These rulemaking participants advocated that the SESAC recommendations be incorporated in their entirety. They
stated that training was essential in preventing accidents and in promoting self-rescue. The Norfolk Shipbuilding
and Drydock Corporation (Ex. 11-6) expressed this view as follows:



We feel that training is essential to employees understanding the potential dangers in entering confined spaces
which have not been checked and verified as being safe. We support the SESAC recommendations.




No commenter objected to any of SESAC's recommended requirements. Therefore, these provisions have been incorporated
into the final rule. 
A few rulemaking participants suggested that the final standard also include some requirements in addition to those
proposed by SESAC. Three commenters recommended the inclusion of provisions requiring the training of shipyard
competent persons (Ex. 11-10, 11-11, 11-44). Marine and Environmental Testing, Inc. (Ex. 11-10),
best represented the arguments of these commenters as follows:

Lack of training was evident in all of the confined space accidents which I have investigated. The current 1915 standard
is not adequate when addressing training requirements. While the 1915 standards state that the SCP [shipyard competent
person] must have certain abilities it does not require formal training. There are also no formal training requirements
for personnel working in confined spaces. These deficiencies should be addressed. 
The SCP should receive formal training on testing, ventilation, fire and explosive and toxic hazards as is being currently
covered by NFPA SCP courses. General workers do not require the same level of training but should be instructed as to
the hazards associated with confined spaces and the employer's testing, entry, hot work and space labeling or identification
program. [Ex. 11-10]



OSHA's requirements for shipyard competent persons are contained in final  1915.7, which is discussed earlier
in this preamble. The employer is responsible for ensuring that these designated individuals have knowledge and
skills appropriate for determining whether or not a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere is safe
to enter. The employer cannot have the necessary information to designate a person as a competent person unless that
employer either provides the necessary training or ensures that the person has already received it. In addition,
if the competent person is not an employee, the employer will not usually be the source of that person's training. Therefore,
rather than specifying shipyard competent person training this final rule focuses on the abilities and skills of
the competent person and holds the employer responsible for determining that the competent person meets those requirements.

Other commenters suggested that OSHA require all exposed shipyard employees to receive training as outlined in the
SESAC recommendation (Ex. 11-19, 11-30, 11-50). They argued that all workers that work in areas
containing confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres should be aware of the hazards of unrestricted
entry into those spaces. For example, the U.S. Department of the Navy (Ex. 11-30) stated:



All workers except those who will never be involved with confined space entry/work should be trained. Minimum knowledge
should be a well understood concept of what a confined or enclosed space is, what the potential hazards are, and the
need for space evaluation by a knowledgeable individual and, in some cases, certification by a ``qualified person''
prior to entry and work.



One commenter, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) (Ex. 11-51), suggested that the
standard specify that employees receive classroom-type training. They were concerned that employees would receive
a simple briefing rather than actual training. They stated their concerns as follows:



The ability to have specific directions to train and provide annual review with classroom type instruction, and where
the instructor has direct inter-play with the employee, is the most desirable, as well as preferred. One of the big
problems that we have always felt has been the issue in training is the addressing of specific training. In the training
of employees at our facility, stand-up safety briefings are used for training in Haz Com. The employee is asked to sign
the back of this briefing to show they have attended and received the training. In the briefings given, the person giving
the briefing has had little or no formal training on the subject material, making it a perfect ``paper program''. The
only way we know it does not work is through interviews with the employees. It is therefore imperative that the recommendations
of SESAC be followed, as they are most inclusive and specific, and that the instructors be knowledgeable of the subject
material.

 

OSHA has not adopted the IBEW's suggestion. Employers may use classroom or ``on-the-job'' instruction or a combination
of the two in complying with final  1915.12(d). The primary objective of final  1915.12(d) is to ensure
that employees will be familiar with the subjects listed under paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3). There may be wide
variations in the combinations of classroom and on-the-job training that may be necessary for different work sites,
configurations, and control measures. On the other hand, OSHA shares IBEW's concern that some employers might try
to comply with the standard through simple briefings that impart little knowledge to employees. In enforcing final
revised Subpart B, the Agency will determine whether employees have learned the subject matter addressed by the standard
by interviewing employees and reviewing the employer's procedures for dealing with communicating hazard information
and ensuring employees have the skills necessary to do their jobs. In addition the Agency will examine the employer's
certification that the training has been provided as required by final  1915.12(d)(5). It should be noted that,
whatever the method of training that is provided, it must be provided before an employee enters a confined or enclosed
space or other dangerous atmosphere, as required by final  1915.12(d)(4). 
The requirements adopted in final  1915.12(d) are based on the recommendations of SESAC as presented in the
notice reopening the record on Subpart B. The purpose of these requirements, along with an explanation of any differences
between the final rule and SESAC's proposed language, is presented in the following discussion. 
In paragraph (d)(1), OSHA is requiring employers to ensure that employees who must enter confined or enclosed spaces
or other dangerous atmospheres are trained to perform their duties safely. This provision is intended to ensure that
employees are familiar with the duties imposed by final revised Subpart B so that the work practices they use will conform
to the standard and will protect them from hazards posed by these spaces. 
In paragraph (d)(2), OSHA is requiring employers to ensure that each employee who must enter confined or enclosed
spaces or other dangerous atmospheres is trained to recognize and understand the hazards or hazardous conditions
he or she may encounter during entry. The specific hazards or hazardous conditions that OSHA addresses are found in
paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(vii) and they include the following: 
(1) Recognition of the characteristics of the space, 
(2) Anticipation and awareness of the hazards that may be encountered during entry, 
(3) Recognition of the signs, symptoms, or other adverse health effects that may be caused by exposure to hazards,

<TEXT>
 

(4) Understanding of the physical signs and reactions of exposure to hazards, 
(5) Knowledge of the types of personal protective equipment that may be needed for safe entry into and exit from the
space, (6) Knowledge of how to use personal protective equipment, and 
(7) When necessary, awareness of the presence and proper use of barriers or other devices that may be needed to protect
an entrant from hazards. 
The final rule combines SESAC's proposed paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) to present all the general topics in which employees
should be instructed in one place. Additionally, the SESAC proposal addressed confined spaces only. Because final
revised Subpart B covers enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres, as well as confined spaces, OSHA has applied
the training requirements to all employees that enter confined and or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres.

In paragraph (d)(3), OSHA is requiring the employer to ensure that an employee who must enter confined or enclosed
spaces or other dangerous atmospheres is trained to exit the space under certain conditions. The specific conditions
for which an entrant must be trained to exit include: 
(1) Upon order of the employer, 
(2) Upon the sounding of an evacuation signal, or 
(3) Whenever the entrant perceives that there is a danger or threat to his or her safety. 
In paragraph (d)(4), OSHA is requiring employers to ensure that employees who must enter confined or enclosed spaces
or other dangerous atmospheres receive their training: 
(1) Before they begin work addressed by this section and 
(2) Whenever there is a change in operations or in an employee's duties that present a hazard about which the employee
has not been trained previously. This provision was not included in SESAC's recommendations on training. Their recommendation
specified that ``appropriate training'' be provided to confined space entrants. OSHA believes that it is essential
to spell out when the training required under paragraph (d)(1) through (d)(3) must be provided and that employees
must receive this instruction before they are exposed to the working conditions and operations covered by the training.
To address this issue, the Agency has incorporated language based on  1910.146(g)(2) (i) through (iii) of the
generic permit-space standard, so that the final rule ensures that employees will be trained before exposure to the
hazards posed by confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres. 
In paragraph (d)(5), OSHA is requiring that the employer certify that the training required by paragraphs (d)(1)
through (d)(4) has been accomplished. The rule also lists the information that must be provided on the certification:
the employee's name, the name of the trainer, and the date or dates of the training. Paragraph (d)(5) requires the certification
of training to be available for inspection by the Assistant Secretary, the Director of NIOSH, the employees, and their
representatives. 
A certification requirement was not included in SESAC's recommendations. However, OSHA believes that its inclusion
in the final rule is necessary for several reasons. Certification of employee training provides a valuable record
to employers who need to be able to keep track of who has been trained. Also, the certification enables employees to
determine whether or not the employer has accurately recorded their training. Lastly, the certification facilitates
OSHA's enforcement of the standard. Standards on employee training routinely incorporate requirements for the
certification of training, and OSHA has found that such requirements ensure that employees are indeed trained in
accordance with these standards. 
Paragraph (e) of final  1915.12 contains requirements for rescue teams. 
The rulemaking participants overwhelmingly approved the adoption of the rescue team requirements listed in the
notice reopening the record (Ex. 11-1, 11-2, 11-3, 11-4, 11-5, 11-6, 11-9,
11-13, 11-14, 11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-20, 11-24, 11-25, 11-26,
11-29, 11-35, 11-37, 11-39, 11-41, 11-45, 11-47, 11-49, 11-50,
11-51). These rulemaking participants advocated that the SESAC recommendations be incorporated in their
entirety. They stated that training was essential in preventing accidents and in promoting self-rescue. 
Paragraph (e) requires that employers either make provisions for a shipyard rescue team or make an arrangement under
which an outside rescue team will respond promptly to a request for rescue service. 
Some commenters urged OSHA to consider addressing the response time of rescue teams (Ex. 11-10, 11-28,
11-30, 11-51). These commenters realized the difficulty involved in specifying an exact response time;
however, they felt that it was important for rescue efforts to begin promptly. For example, Con-Space Communications
Ltd. (Ex. 11-28) stated their recommendations as follows:



This could be a difficult thing to regulate but, minimum requirements should be set to ensure that trained personnel
and equipment are available in the event of an incident. Response time is the hard item to determine. Obviously the
faster the better for the person in difficulty, but if OSHA allows outside rescue services to be used, response time
would be longer than if the rescue team was in-house. 
Response time of an outside rescue service would be totally dependant on its distance from the problem site. 


* * * * * 


Proposed paragraph 1915.12(f) is a practical solution to a difficult problem. Plant rescue teams should be able to
respond more quickly than outside teams but the cost of maintaining an in-plant [shipyard] team could be excessive.
We are left with a simple question, ``is the risk of slow response higher than the possible risk to the life of the person
waiting for help?'' 
If the outside rescue team receives more calls for help than it can handle, who waits and who gets penalized, the employer
or the contracted rescue team or more important_who dies?

Consideration should be given to a two tier rescue system where the employer is required to have a small rescue unit
(two man team) trained by the outside rescue team for immediate response to a problem. Their level of involvement could
be dictated by the rescue contractor who could also determine what rescue equipment should be maintained on-site.




Most commenters argued that response times should not be addressed in the standard (Ex. 11-6, 11-9, 11-11,
11-14, 11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-22, 11-24, 11-26, 11-29, 11-31,
11-36, 11-38, 11-39, 11-40, 11-41, 11-43, 11-44, 11-50). These commenters
argued that there were too many variables involved in shipyards for OSHA to be able to specify an appropriate response
time. Mr. Joseph J. Ocken (Ex. 11-31) went further, suggesting that stressing the importance of rescue would
lead to even more deaths, as follows:




This entire issue focuses on rescue teams: inside and outside teams, team procedures, response times, and protocols/planning.
I have strong reservations about regulating or mandating rescue operations in this manner. There are numerous confined
space entries made on a daily basis while there are very few rescue attempts made. Even so, most confined space deaths
are associated with rescue attempts. Intentionally or unintentionally the tone of the proposed language seems to
communicate very dangerous messages:

RESCUE ATTEMPTS ARE MANDATORY. This may not be intended by OSHA but the language could be misconstrued to suggest it.
Many concerned safety professionals have devoted a lot of energy to communicate the opposite message! These teams
should not even be referred to as ``rescue teams'' but rather ``recovery or retrieval teams'' in order to avoid any
confusion on this point.

HURRY! OSHA's intent is important in that employers need to be reasonable in designating outside rescue resources.
The response time message however, is that rescuers must hurry. Given the poor effectiveness statistics for rescue
attempts the emphasis should be placed on QUALITY OF RECOVERY rather than SPEED OF RESCUE. Employers should be most
concerned with selecting a qualified team and supporting their familiarization with the shipyard, training and
drills to avoid further tragedies.

RELIANCE ON RESCUE. It might be argued that the proposed rescue provisions require such attempts to be quite different
from the haphazard rescue attempts that are notorious for additional fatalities (rather than the desired ``rescue'').
This argument needs to be considered in the context of the environment where it will be applied. The very need for a confined
space rescue implies that a FAILURE HAS ALREADY OCCURRED IN THE PROGRAM. Objectively we should be concerned that such
a demonstrated failure to ensure safe entry in the first place also calls into question the ability to safely conduct
a much more dangerous rescue attempt. A confined space entry standard is being proposed specifically to address a
grim body of statistics which also tells us that rescue in confined spaces is even more dangerous. Rescue teams will
be made up of workers needing protection too. We should be looking to improve other backups rather than emphasizing
rescue.




OSHA has concluded that it is important for rescue attempts to be initiated as soon after an accident occurs as possible.
If rescue attempts are delayed too long, the rescue team could become a body retrieval team instead. OSHA also believes
that rescue teams must be properly equipped and trained so that the dangers noted by Mr. Ocken are minimized. Fatalities
involving rescuers typically have involved untrained or poorly trained individuals who are not properly equipped
for entry into confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres. Final revised Subpart B, generic general
industry permit-space standard,  1910.146, ensures that rescue personnel are properly equipped and fully
trained to perform rescue. To address the issue of timeliness in responding to requests for emergency services, the
introductory text to final  1915.12(e) requires employers to provide a shipyard rescue team or to arrange for
an outside rescue service that can respond promptly. OSHA believes that this requirement places a responsibility
on employers to take whatever actions are necessary to rescue entrants (rather than retrieve bodies) from spaces
covered by Subpart B. Employers must consider such factors as the response time, equipment, and state of training
for rescue services not composed of the host employer's own employees when he or she chooses to arrange for such services.
The rescue service selected by the employer must be able to arrive at the worksite quickly enough to perform rescue
and must be equipped to perform rescue for the employer to be in compliance with the standard.

In paragraph (e)(1), OSHA is requiring that shipyard rescue teams meet certain criteria. These criteria are intended
to ensure that shipyard rescue teams are properly trained and equipped to perform rescue. Outside rescue services
are already covered under the generic permit-space standard in  1910.146(k)(1). Employers providing these
services are general industry employers (not shipyard employers) who will be covered under the general industry
standards for the vast majority of their work. Therefore, the Agency believes that it is reasonable and appropriate
to apply existing  1910.146(k)(1) to these employers rather than to adopt separate requirements for outside
rescue services in the shipyard standards.

Paragraph (e)(1)(i) requires each employee assigned to the shipyard team to be provided with and trained to use the
personal protective equipment they will need to perform their function safely, including respirators and any rescue
equipment necessary for making rescues from confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres.

Paragraph (e)(1)(ii) requires that employees assigned to the shipyard rescue team be trained to perform their rescue
functions safely including entry into confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres.

Paragraph (e)(1)(iii) requires that shipyard rescue teams practice their skills at least once every 12 months. This
provision also requires practice drills that include the use of mannequins and rescue equipment during simulated
rescue operations involving physical facilities that approximate closely those facilities from which rescue may
be needed. OSHA has included a note following this paragraph to explain that the standard recognizes the performance
of an actual rescue as an acceptable substitute for practice drills.

Paragraph (e)(1)(iv) requires that at least one employee on each rescue team maintain current certification in basic
first aid skills that include maintenance of an airway, control of bleeding, maintenance of circulation and cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) skills.

Paragraph (e)(2) requires the employer to inform outside rescue services of the hazards that their teams may encounter
when called to perform rescues from confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres at the employer's
facility. The outside rescue service can then use this information to train and equip their rescue teams appropriately.
This will help to ensure the protection of the rescue service's employees and to minimize the time needed to rescue
an injured employee. OSHA has included a note following final  1915.12(e)(2) to encourage employers to use
the criteria listed in paragraph (e)(1) to evaluate the skills of the outside rescue service and to determine what
in-house hazard information would be most helpful to that service.

In the notice reopening the record on Subpart B, OSHA requested comments on whether or not the standard should require
the use of any protocols (such as preplanning with local rescue services) to accompany the use of an outside rescue
service.

The rulemaking participants agreed that, while preplanning with outside rescue services was necessary, the standard
should not specify any particular protocol (Ex. 11-3, 11-6, 11-13, 11-14, 11-15, 11-18,
11-20, 11-22, 11-24, 11-25, 11-29, 11-35, 11-37, 11-47). For example,
the Shipbuilders Council of America (Ex. 11-29) stated:




We believe that the inclusion of this subject matter will not contribute significantly to an increase in the quality
or response time of a rescue team. Furthermore, such protocols, may be inconsistent with ensuring that shipyards
have the flexibility to independently work out joint efforts that are compatible with local conditions.




Several commenters, however, believed that the standard should require cooperation and planning between the shipyard
employer and the rescue service (Ex. 11-30, 11-39, 11-49, 11-50). These commenters argued
that this cooperation and planning was necessary, if an employer chooses an outside rescue service, in order to ensure
effective rescue. The U.S. Department of the Navy (Ex. 11-30) presented this view as follows:




In those cases where the employer does not have an in-house rescue team, OSHA should require the employer to preplan
with the outside authority who is expected to provide the rescue services. The outside authority must be familiar
with the employer's facility so that delays in performing a rescue will be avoided or minimized. It is recommended
that OSHA require periodic drills to document that a rescue by an outside authority can be performed in a meaningful
time frame.




OSHA agrees with these commenters that planning and cooperation is necessary between employers and outside rescue
services. Without planning, the rescue service will be hindered in getting to the rescue site and in equipping their
rescue teams. Without cooperation, the outside service's rescue team will be on their own when an emergency arises.
Several commenters stated their belief that the language in SESAC's recommendation already required employers
to plan for rescue by outside services and to cooperate with these services to ensure that the rescue teams are properly
trained and equipped (Ex. 11-9, 11-26, 11-39). OSHA agrees with these commenters, and final  1915.12(e)(2)
adopts the SESAC recommended language with only minor editorial changes.

Paragraph (f) of final  1915.12 contains requirements for exchanging hazard information between employers.
This paragraph requires that each employer whose employees work in confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous
atmospheres ensure that all available information on the hazards, safety rules, and emergency procedures concerning
those spaces is exchanged with other employers whose employees may occupy the same spaces. The purpose of this new
rule is to assure that knowledge of the hazards in the place of employment, particularly those hazards that may change
daily or with each new contractor or subcontractor, has been communicated to all employees.

The rulemaking participants overwhelmingly approved the adoption of the requirements related to exchanging hazard
information between employers as listed in the notice reopening the record (Ex. 11-1, 11-2, 11-3,
11-4, 11-5, 11-9, 11-13, 11-15, 11-19, 11-20, 11-24, 11-26,
11-29, 11-35, 11-37, 11-39, 11-47, 11-49, 11-50, 11-52, 11-53).
These rulemaking participants advocated that the SESAC recommendations be incorporated in their entirety. They
maintained that cooperation and the exchange of information between contractor and employer was essential for the
protection of all workers involved. Dreadnought Marine, Inc. (Ex. 11-52), expressed this view as follows:




It is essential that contractors who perform work in confined spaces be provided this information by the employer.
Contractor personnel who work near [confined] spaces need to understand and adhere to the signs, placards, or other
warnings posted by the employer. DMI agrees with SESAC's proposed additions entitled ``(g) Duty to other employers.''




A few commenters believed that OSHA should also require contractors to inform the shipyard employer of any hazard
the contractor introduces into the space (Ex. 11-30, 11-51). They argued that, because the contractor
can bring hazards into confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres that endanger all employees in
the space, the standard should impose duties on the contractor which correspond to those imposed on the employer.
The IBEW (Ex. 11-51) expressed their recommendations as follows:




We concur with the statements made in paragraph (C) noting the last statement, ``Contractors working on a job site
can endanger not only their employees, but other employers' employees as well.'' With this in mind, we feel that a contractor
is also obligated to inform the host employer of the hazards they will introduce into the work area or confined space.




OSHA agrees with the IBEW. Contractors create hazards or bring hazards into the space which affect the safety of all
employees working in the space. Therefore, the final rule incorporates the SESAC recommendation modified as necessary
to obligate all employers to exchange necessary hazard information.



3.  1915.13 Cleaning and Other Cold Work



This section sets forth locations and further testing and precautions that must be observed before and during cleaning
and cold work.

In paragraph (a) of the final rule, OSHA describes the spaces to which this section applies. The old standard referred
to those spaces in  1915.12(a)(1) (i) and (ii) and (b)(1) (i) through (iii). The Agency proposed minor editorial
changes, the most important of which involved listing the spaces that must be tested, and ventilated if necessary,
before cleaning and cold work is begun. OSHA believes that specifying the spaces that will be affected by  1915.13
in the first paragraph will enable the employer to easily determine the scope of the section. This listing, which replaces
the reference to locations, is an editorial revision of the previous requirements. 

Paragraph (b)(1) provides that liquid residues in the tanks shall be removed as thoroughly as practicable before
manual cleaning starts. As in the previous standard, special care is required to be taken to prevent the spilling or
the draining of these materials into the water surrounding the vessel. For consistency with the expanded scope, OSHA
has added the requirement to take special care to prevent spills onto the surrounding work area. If liquid residues
were allowed to contaminate the surrounding water or worksite, employees would be endangered. 

Paragraph (b)(2) requires that tests to determine the concentration of flammable, combustible, toxic, corrosive,
or irritant vapors must be done by a competent person prior to starting cold work. This provision has been brought forward
from previous  1915.13(a)(3), which required tests to maintain flammable vapors below 10 percent of the LEL.
OSHA believes that simply requiring tests does not give the employer enough guidance about what tests are necessary
to protect workers during cleaning and other cold work. Therefore, OSHA is specifying that tests be done for flammable,
combustible, toxic, corrosive, or irritant vapors. 

Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the final rule requires that when the concentration of flammable or combustible vapors is
equal to or greater than 10 percent of the LEL, ventilation must be provided at flow rates sufficient to keep the concentration
of flammable vapors at a level less than 10 percent of the LEL. Toxic, corrosive, or irritant vapors are required to
be maintained within the permissible exposure limits and below IDLH levels by paragraph (b)(3)(ii). 

The previous rule at  1915.13(a)(2) and the proposed rule at  1915.13(a)(8) (53 FR 48108) allowed employers
to ventilate only major portions of a compartment when, due to the high volatility of residues, concentration of flammable
or combustible vapors of less than 10 percent LEL could not be achieved. In these circumstances, employers had to continually
monitor the major portion of the space as pockets of hazardous vapor could shift into the work area thereby putting
workers at risk. OSHA does not believe such an approach to the monitoring provides adequate protection for employees.
The Agency believes that a compartment in which any portion is above 10 percent of the LEL is unsafe. In addition, conditions
at or above 10 percent of the LEL could result in air concentrations which exceed the OSHA PEL or IDLH. This was clearly
illustrated by Marine Chemists, Inc. (Ex. 7-24FF): 




Many flammable products are also toxic or contain toxic ingredients and in many cases 10 percent of LEL is well above
the recommended PEL and in some cases may exceed the IDLH, for example: 






STYRENE

 The LEL is 1% Styrene=10,000 ppm, 10% LEL=0.1% Styrene=1,000 ppm, PEL for Styrene=100 ppm 




In other words 10 percent for Styrene is 10 times the recommended PEL. 




Ventilating only portions of a compartment can mean that pockets of hazardous atmospheres containing a variety of
unknown levels of flammable vapors can remain within a compartment providing a significant potential for fire or
explosion. Ignition could occur through scraping or blasting. For example, the National Fire Protection Association
(Ex. 6-10) noted that ignition may occur from static electricity. 




NFPA does not believe that work in IDLH atmospheres should be encouraged, except for the purposes of emergency rescue.
NFPA does not support the proposal of working in UEL atmospheres. The potential hazards associated with ignition
sources, such as static electricity, and the introduction of air to bring an atmosphere above the UEL within the flammable
range, are significant and difficult to control. The additional testing requirements would also be significant.





This concern was also expressed by Independent Testing and Consultation, Inc. (Ex. 6-24). 




All ignition sources cannot easily be eliminated. There remains possible ignition due to static electricity. It
has been my experience that owners and operators would rather clean or otherwise make safe a tank or compartment even
if the work required in the compartment is of the briefest duration. 




The Department of the Navy (Ex. 6-31) stated that the possibility of an explosion could still be present when
only the major portions of a compartment are required to be ventilated. They noted that ventilation should be used
to alleviate a hazardous atmosphere and that continuous monitoring alone will not prevent the possibility of an explosion.


One commenter, Sound Testing, Inc. (Ex. 6-8), questioned OSHA's acceptance of the 10 percent LEL level. 




It distresses me that even today we are still using the 10% LEL in helping to determine whether a space is ``Safe for Workers''.
I have written about 10,000 Marine Chemist certificates, involving tens of thousands of compartments and I cannot
recall a single instance where I wrote ``Safe for Workers'' about a tank reading even 2% LEL. Why, then, is OSHA giving
a ``reference point'' significance to 10% LEL as ``Safe for Workers'' criterion? 




OSHA agrees with NFPA, Independent Testing and Consultation, Inc. and the Navy and is therefore, persuaded that an
entire compartment must be ventilated sufficiently to bring the level of flammable and combustible materials below
10 percent of the LEL. Because the ventilation to maintain conditions in the major portion of a compartment would already
be in place, increasing or redirecting the ventilation so that it now adequately ventilates the entire compartment
would put little or no additional burden on employers.

As to the use of the ``less than 10 percent LEL'' as the level to be achieved before employees may work in a space, that
level is adopted from the applicable national consensus standard (NFPA 306, Appendix A), which reflects current
practices and sampling technology. The shipyard industry has followed this standard for the past 23 years, and OSHA
believes that it provides a sufficient margin of safety. Of course, employers are free to use a lower level in their
workplaces for additional margins of safety. 

Paragraph (b)(4) of the final rule requires that the flammability tests be conducted by a competent person ``as often
as necessary'' during cleaning or cold work to determine the concentration of flammable or combustible vapors present
in the work space. This provision in the final rule is based on the proposal (53 FR 48098, 48102; Specific Issue 7). The
previous standard required a competent person to test prior to commencement of cold work and with sufficient frequency
thereafter, in accordance with temperature, volatility of the residues, and other existing conditions in and about
the spaces to ensure that the concentrations of flammable vapors were below ten (10) percent of the LEL. As explained
in the preamble to the proposal, some interested parties requested clarification of the term ``frequently'' contained
in the previous  1915.13(a)(3). (53 CFR 48098) They asked OSHA to specify in the regulation how often tanks should
be checked. However, many more commenters (Ex. 6-3, 6-5, 6-10, 6-12, 6-13, 6-15,
6-24, 6-28, 6-33, 6-34) urged the Agency to keep the standard flexible enough to enable employers
and employees to take into consideration all the factors which may influence the need to recheck space conditions,
including temperature, work being performed in the space, time elapsed, unattended tanks, work breaks, and ballasting
or trimming. For example, Bay Shipbuilding Corp. (Ex. 6-15) stated: 




Frequency of testing must be based on the area conditions and complexity of the hazard. Ventilation capability is
also a major factor in hazard control. Once an area has been made safe, and air quality can be maintained with natural
or mechanical ventilation, there are no further steps needed unless the condition is modified by some events such
as a spill, leak, or injection of an environmentally altering element. Otherwise, the only thing to do is to continue
monitoring (which is cost prohibitive); or base the checks on the HMIS scale for health, flammability, and reactivity
of the product. The higher the HMIS rating, the more frequent the checks. 




The Department of the Navy (Ex. 6-31) commented: 




The term frequently is too vague and should be redefined to specify that, re-testing should be dependent on alteration
of specific atmospheric conditions, manipulation of valves, or opening of manholes at the worksite. 




Another commenter, Bath Iron Works Corporation (Ex. 6-28), also in support of flexibility, stated: 




No easy definition exists for all circumstances requiring additional ``frequent'' testing. This is a situation
which requires the judgment of the Marine Chemist, based on his knowledge of the last three cargoes, their properties
and the effectiveness of the cleaning procedures used. Some cargoes, such as alcohols, light fuel oils, etc., leave
no harmful residues after adequate tank cleaning and ventilation. Under such situation, testing every 24 hours is
adequate. Other cargoes leave residues, or, particular tank coatings partially absorb cargo residues, only to release
vapors slowly over time, regardless of how the cleaning operations were conducted. These conditions require atmospheric
testing more frequently. 




OSHA agrees with the commenters' views that the frequency of testing an atmosphere is best determined by the specific
situation encountered and that a requirement to recheck a tank at specified intervals would not necessarily raise
the level of safety. However, it is imperative that the atmosphere be checked often enough to ensure that it is safe
for workers. To that end, Appendix A to Subpart B in the final rule provides supplementary information to assist employers
and employees in determining the frequency with which a tank must be tested in order to ensure atmospheric conditions
are being maintained. The six most common factors (temperature, work in the tank, period of time elapsed, unattended
tanks, work breaks, and ballasting or trimming) are discussed, and examples are provided as guidance. Appendix A
is unchanged from the proposal (53 FR 48110). 

Paragraph (b)(5) requires releases of flammable, combustible, toxic, corrosive, irritant, and fumigant materials
to be cleaned up as work progresses. The requirement that liquid residues of flammable and toxic materials, which
includes all of the contaminants described above, were to be cleaned up as work progresses was brought forward from
the previous provision  1915.13(a)(1). In this final rule, OSHA has listed additional materials, corrosive,
and irritant, that must be cleaned up as work progresses because they can be dangerous to employees working in these
hazardous atmospheres. 

Paragraph (b)(6) prohibits entry into spaces where the concentration of flammable or combustible vapors equals
or exceeds 10 percent of the lower explosive limit and specifies the limited exceptions under which an employee may
enter or work in such spaces. The exception is unchanged from the previous rule,  1915.12(d), but has been placed
in the cleaning and other cold work section for clarification. An employee may enter the space for emergency rescue
or for a short duration to install the ventilation required to start operations. In those instances there must be no
ignition sources present, the space must be monitored continuously, the atmosphere in the space must be maintained
above the UEL, and appropriate personal protective equipment must be provided. A note has been added as a reminder
that other provisions for work in IDLH and other dangerous atmospheres are located in Subpart I, Personal Protective
Equipment, of this part.

Paragraph (b)(7) of the final rule requires that a competent person test ventilation discharge for possible accumulation
in concentrations that may be hazardous to employees. 


Paragraph (b)(8) requires that when the test required in paragraph (b)(7) above indicates that concentrations of
exhaust vapors that are hazardous to employees are accumulating, all work in the contaminated area shall be stopped
and the employees evacuated until the vapors have dissipated or been removed. These two requirements are the same
as the existing requirements in  1915.13(a)(5). OSHA has separated these two requirements for clarity, redesignating
them as proposed paragraphs (b)(9) and (b)(10) and as paragraphs (b)(7) and (b)(8) of the final rule. 


Paragraph (b)(9) of the final rule requires that only approved explosion-proof, self-contained portable lamps
shall be used in spaces described in paragraph (a) of this section before the spaces have been certified as ``Safe for
Workers.'' The previous rule,  1915.13(b), had the same requirement. Paragraphs (b)(7), (b)(8) and (b)(9)
of the final rule are being promulgated with several editorial changes for clarity. 


Paragraph (b)(10) of the final rule requires that signs that can be understood by all employees and that prohibit sources
of ignition be posted. Sources of ignition include smoking and open flames that were specified in the previous  1915.13(c).
This requirement merely states what was implicit before; that is, that signs must be clearly understood by all employees.
Numerous comments were received on the subject of signs (Ex. 6-3, 6-4, 6-6, 6-8, 6-10,
6-12, 6-15). A common concern was expressed by the U.S. Coast Guard who said that in their area, most shipyard
workers possessed a limited command of the English language. They noted that these workers tended to avoid reading
long or confusing documents and that for them, a simple statement at each space would be most effective (Ex. 6-4).
OSHA is addressing this problem by requiring that the sign be understood by all employees. 


The previous standards required signs prohibiting smoking and the use of open flames to be posted on the open deck adjacent
to the access to spaces described in  1915.14(a). With the expansion of the scope to include land-side operations,
the final rule deletes the reference to decks and substitutes directions for posting that apply to the entire shipyard.
Signs must now be prominently posted at the entrance to those spaces, in adjacent spaces, and in the open area adjacent
to those spaces. Signs must be ``prominently posted,'' i.e., clearly visible to affected employees. For example,
signs posted behind a door do not effectively advise or warn employees of the working conditions. The purpose and intent
of the language in paragraph (b)(10) of the final rule is to ensure that all employees are made aware of the danger of
ignition sources in the workplace. 


Paragraph (b)(11) of the final rule requires that all air moving equipment and component parts that are capable of
generating a static electrical charge of sufficient energy to create a source of ignition be bonded electrically
to the structure of a vessel or vessel section or, in the case of land-side spaces, grounded to prevent unintentional
discharge of a static charge. This requirement is the same as the previous rule,  1915.13(d), except that land-side
operations are now covered. 


Paragraph (b)(12) of the final rule requires that fans have non-sparking blades and that portable air ducts be of non-sparking
materials. This requirement is unchanged from the previous rule,  1915.13(e). In its effort to make regulatory
text more concise, OSHA has combined proposed paragraphs  1915.13(b)(14) and (15) as paragraph (b)(12) of
the final rule. 


The Note OSHA proposed to include at the end of this section has been rewritten in note format and is carried forward
into this final rule as follows:

 





Note: 

See  1915.12(c) of this part and applicable requirements of 29 CFR part 1915, subpart Z for other provisions
affecting cleaning or cold work. 





By including this final note in  1915.13, OSHA is reminding employers of other Subparts of part 1915 as well as
paragraphs of this Subpart that may apply. 



4.  1915.14 Hot Work 




This section addresses the safety precautions that must be taken prior to starting hot work in or on spaces and adjacent
spaces that contain or have contained combustible or flammable liquids or gases, related piping and accessories.
The requirement that certain spaces must be certified ``Safe for Hot Work'' by a Marine Chemist or a Coast Guard authorized
person before hot work is permitted is retained from the previous standard. This section also clearly identifies
those locations within shipyard employment where a shipyard competent person is allowed to approve hot work.

The scope has been expanded to cover land-side confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres in the
shipyard as well as vessels and vessel sections, in other words, all of shipyard employment. The original section
covered employees engaged in shiprepairing, with certain sections covering only shipbreaking. OSHA proposed to
expand coverage to all shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and ship repair (53 FR 48094) and with the reopening of the record
OSHA sought comment on expanding the scope to all shipyard employment. 


OSHA requested public comment on whether permits should be required for hot-work in all of shipyard employment, and,
if so, whether the permits need to be posted (57 FR 28155, June 24, 1992). Over 30 commenters responded (Ex. 11-2,
11-3, 11-6, 11-14, 11-15, 11-18, 11-19, 11-20, 11-21, 11-24,
11-25, 11-26, 11-27, 11-28, 11-30, 11-36, 11-37, 11-38, 11-39,
11-40, 11-41, 11-43, 11-44, 11-29, 11-30, 11-31, 11-34, 11-35,
11-45, 11-47, 11-49, 11-50, 11-51, 11-53). Most of the comments set forth the steps
that must be taken before hot work may be done, regardless of whether a formal permit is issued. They noted that the spaces
must be evaluated and tested to determine their conditions before entry or hot work can begin. For confined spaces
determined to be ``safe for hot work,'' they said a certificate is issued by a Marine Chemist and posted at the work site.
They asserted that this practice is followed throughout the maritime industry. Most indicated that requiring hot
work permits in addition to the certificate would not increase the safety of hot work. 


The need for hot work permits in shipyards was considered and unanimously rejected by SESAC at their September 3, 1992,
meeting (Tr. 470). Chairman Linwood Temple, CMC, argued that a permit system would be useless and less protective
(SESAC, Tr. September 3, 1992, 468-469). Lt. Commander Joe Ocken from the 5th Coast Guard District testified
that OSHA ``should not * * * take the general industry standard language [on permits] and carry that
over into 1915.12'' (SESAC Tr. September 3, 1992, 461). Captain Lawrence Reed, representing NIOSH, stated that he
shared: 





* * * The concern of Lt. Commander Joe Ocken * * * that some [of the provisions of the permit
required confined space standard] * * * are less protective than the existing language of 1915.14
and [that he] would propose we go with the existing 1915.14. (SESAC Tr. September 3, 1992, 467-468) 





Mr. Charles Klein, representing Newport News Shipbuilding, stated: 





* * * What the shipbuilding industry and shiprepairing industry is doing right now with respect to
confined spaces is working fine. The number of explosions that you see, the number of fatalities that you see, are virtually
nil, and that would suggest that the existing language that's found in 1915 is more than adequate, and, in fact, probably
would be better taken over to the general industry than what is proposed for general industry. (SESAC Tr. September
3, 1992, 465-466) 





Mr. Lou D'Ambrosio, representing the Washington and Northern Idaho District Council of Laborers' International
Union of North America, agreed that the permit system would be less protective (SESAC Tr. September 3, 1992, 469).



OSHA has considered the evidence and agrees with the SESAC consensus that workers in shipyard employment are adequately
protected by the current hot work standards, without the need for a permit system. Shipyards are unique in that they
rely on Marine Chemist and competent persons to oversee confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres.
In many locations, a Marine Chemist is required to issue a certificate before any hot work can be done. The Marine Chemist
Certificate can only be issued when conditions within and adjacent to spaces which have contained a flammable or combustible
gas or material have been cleaned and inspected and found to be safe (gas free). Moreover, the certificate specifies
other requirements for entry and work such as ventilation, fire watch placement, and personal protective equipment,
and requires a competent person to reinspect and test the space as directed in order to maintain the conditions of the
Marine Chemist certificate. Similarly, the competent person cannot grant permission for hot work in those locations
that he or she is allowed to test and certify until the conditions are safe for hot work. In addition, both the Marine
Chemist and the competent person are required to produce written certifications that must be posted, as required
in   1915.14(a)(2) and 1915.7(d) (1) and (2) respectively. As added protection, the Marine Chemist requires
a competent person to recheck the space to ensure that conditions do not change. If there is a change in the space, the
competent person must stop work and recall the Marine Chemist to recertify that the space is safe for hot work before
work can restart. These certifications and recordings are comparable to permits, in that an employee may not perform
hot work in a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere until a certificate is issued. OSHA is persuaded
that the current requirements, modified for clarity, provide protection comparable to  1910.146 to employees
in the shipyard. Therefore, OSHA is not requiring hot work permits in subpart B.

OSHA also requested comment on whether hot work should be prohibited on insulated bulkheads and if so, whether all
the insulation needed to be removed. The Agency asked whether there have been situations where toxic vapors have evolved
from heated insulation, and whether fires have broken out during and after hot work operations. (53 FR 48102) A number
of parties filed comments on this issue (e.g., 6-8, 6-12, 6-15, 6-18, 6-21, 6-22,
6-23, 6-24, 6-26, 6-31, 6-33, 6-34, 6-36, 6-37). These comments provided
a wide range of views and some anecdotal information, but contained insufficient evidence to indicate that hot work
on insulated bulkheads should be prohibited. Therefore, OSHA is not addressing this issue in subpart B.

Paragraph (a)(1) requires a Marine Chemist or a U.S. Coast Guard authorized person to certify certain spaces as ``Safe
for Hot Work'' before hot-work may be done on or in them. Other than the expansion of coverage to land-side, the requirements
for hot work are the same as in the previous standard. However,  1915.14 has been reorganized and editorial changes
have been made to add clarity.

Paragraph (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) list the confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres
along with their adjacent spaces within shipyard employment that must be inspected and tested by a Marine Chemist
or Coast Guard authorized person prior to hot work. OSHA has deleted all references to tank vessels and dry cargo, miscellaneous
and passenger vessels because the scope now includes all vessels and vessel sections and land-side hot work activities.
The requirements are unchanged from the previous requirements of 1915.14 (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii),
but editorial changes have been made to add clarity.

Paragraph (a)(1)(iv) has been changed and relocated for clarity and consistency. In the previous rule, a Marine Chemist
certificate was not necessary for hot work on dry cargo, miscellaneous, and passenger vessels when the work was performed
on spaces adjacent to cargo tanks, as long as the gas or liquid in the tanks had a flash point below 150
  Fahrenheit and the work was performed at least 25 feet (7.5 m) away from the tank. This exception has been expanded
to any work in shipyards where the criteria are met, because the criteria are equally applicable to land-side operations.

Paragraph (a)(2) carries forth the requirement that the certificate issued by the Marine Chemist or the Coast Guard
authorized person be posted in the immediate vicinity of the affected area and kept on file for a period of at least 3
months from the date of completion of the operation for which the certificate was generated.

Paragraph (b) covers those areas of the vessel and land-side spaces within the shipyard where a competent person can
give permission for hot work to proceed after he or she has inspected and tested the space or area for flammability.
The substantive requirements of this paragraph remain unchanged from the previous requirements except that land-side
confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres are now included.

Paragraph (b)(1) states that hot work is not permitted in or on any of the listed spaces or adjacent spaces in  1915.14(b)(1)
(i) through (v) until the spaces have been tested for flammability and found to contain no concentrations of flammable
vapors equal to or greater than 10 percent of the lower explosive limit. These spaces are: Dry cargo holds; the bilges;
the engine or boiler room where a Marine Chemist's or a Coast Guard's authorized person's certificate is not required;
vessels and vessel sections where a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person's certificate is not required
under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; and land-side enclosed or confined spaces or other dangerous atmospheres
not covered in  1915.14(a). The previous rule, in  1915.14 (b) and (c), contains the same requirements
found in  1915.14(b)(1) (i) through (iv). Section 1915.15(b)(1)(v) extends the coverage to land-side operations
within shipyard employment.

In paragraph (b)(2), requires a space or adjacent space that has been tested and found to contain a concentration of
flammable vapors equal to or greater than 10 percent of the lower explosion limit to be labeled Not Safe for Hot Work.
The space or adjacent space must than be ventilated at volumes and flow rates sufficient to ensure that the vapor concentration
is below 10 percent of the lower explosive limit. This requirement is unchanged from the previous  1915.14 (b)
and (c).

Section 1915.14 (c) and (d) of the previous rule have been deleted because their contents have been moved to other places
in subpart B. For example, hot work performed in engine and boiler rooms is now covered by paragraph (b)(1)(iii), and
the hot work from open decks and tanks without overheads previously addressed by  1915.14(d) is now covered
in  1915.14 (a) and (b).

The previous rule allowed the employer to inert spaces with non-flammable gas or water in shipbreaking operations.
This provision was not included in the 1988 proposal and no commenters addressed this issue. OSHA is not carrying forth
inerting as a specific provision because hot work on an inerted space must be approved by a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard
authorized person. Work requiring a Marine Chemist's certificate is thoroughly covered in paragraph 1915.14(a)
above. Finally  1915.14 ends with a note referring users to Appendix A. Appendix A refers users to various other
sections of part 1915 regulations that are directly relevant to hot work. Those sections, especially Subpart D, Welding,
need to be reviewed carefully prior to starting hot work.

5.  1915.15 Maintenance of Safe Conditions



The principal substantive change to this section continues to reflect OSHA's general decision to expand the scope
of Subpart B to cover all phases of shipyard employment as defined in the final rule. Operations covered by the previous
requirements in  1915.15 were limited to ship repairing and shipbreaking. Under the previous rule, only employers
engaged in ship repairing operations needed to comply with paragraph (a) of  1915.15 and only employers engaged
in shipbreaking operations needed to comply with paragraph (b) of  1915.15. Because of the expansion of the
scope of Subpart B to include all phases of shipyard employment, the final rule consolidates the requirements of  1915.15
paragraphs (a) and (b) into one section of requirements that apply to all phases of shipyard employment.

OSHA raised two issues in the proposal that are related to the maintenance of safe conditions as regulated in this section.
These issues concern the frequency of retesting and the need for testing to be accompanied by visual inspections.

Proposed   1915.13(b)(4) and 1915.15 addressed the requirement to conduct atmospheric tests frequently.
Proposed  1915.13(b)(4) would have required that factors which influence the frequency of rechecking, such
as air temperature and residue volatility, be considered when determining how often to retest, while proposed paragraphs
(d) and (f) addressed the need for frequent atmospheric tests in order to maintain the initial working conditions
in a tank.

Neither OSHA's previous standard nor the proposal specified how frequently a tank should be rechecked. Public comment
was solicited as to whether OSHA should specify the frequency of testing in the standard, and if so, what that frequency
should be and why. OSHA also asked if the factors which influence the need to check tanks frequently should be addressed
directly in the standard. Finally, the Agency sought comment on whether OSHA should change the term ``frequently''
to ``as often as necessary'' and if so, why.

Many commenters addressed this issue and most favored requiring testing ``as often as necessary'' and setting forth
the conditions that determine the actual frequency. For example, the U.S. Navy's Environmental Health Center (Ex.
6-31) commented,




The term frequently is too vague and should be redefined to specify that re-testing should be dependent on alteration
of specific atmospheric conditions, manipulation of valves, or opening of manholes at the work site.




Shipbuilders Council of America, (Ex. 6-3) indicated that OSHA should not attempt to define ``frequently.''
SCA stated that,




If an attempt is made to define the term ``frequently,'' it may create more problems than it would solve. Illustrative
is defining ``frequently'' as every two hours. There may be some tanks that only need monitoring three times a shift
instead of four. There are also some tanks that may require continuous monitoring. Using the terminology ``as often
as necessary'' solves these problems, and allows the individuals monitoring the areas a little more discretion at
utilizing their precious time wisely.




NFPA (Ex. 6-10) agreed that requiring testing ``as often as necessary'' would be appropriate,




The standard is intended to provide minimum requirements. Establishing a predetermined specified frequency for
testing spaces through regulations may not allow for the various factors which may alter conditions * * *
Once the initial entry has been authorized, retesting is necessary at some frequency to ensure that conditions are
not changing thus endangering the safety of the workers in the space. The frequency of retesting must be determined
by the individual conditions and circumstances of the work activity. Various factors as described in Appendix A to
Subpart B may affect the initial conditions. Confined spaces need to be prepared on the basis of initial entry, subsequent
work, and safe exit. Most often where accidents have resulted, there was either no testing for initial entry or no consideration
of the change in conditions which might occur due to the work process or other factors. NFPA supports the concept * * *
that frequency of follow-up testing be expressed in terms of ``as often as necessary''.




On the other hand the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard recommended OSHA specify a 4 hour retesting minimum, although
he also acknowledged that Marine Chemists and competent persons must exercise their judgment on frequency of testing.




* * * A minimum frequency should be specified * * * In general spaces should be tested
``as often as necessary''. This phrasing implies that relevant factors have been considered and a judgment made about
the need for retesting. Testing ``frequently'' does not imply any judgment. * * * 

This period should not exceed 4 hours for an occupied space or 24 hours for an unoccupied space. No person should be allowed
to enter an unoccupied space unless it has been tested/retested within 4 hours. The 24 hour requirement is an extension
of NFPA 306-1988 2-6.1 which states that ``Work authorized by the Certificate must commence within 24
hours unless otherwise noted on the Certificate.'' This should be extended to competent person testing as well as
Marine Chemist testing, especially since the role of the competent person is one of monitoring conditions of spaces.
Even if a space is unoccupied it represents a hazard from explosion or unauthorized entry. 

The 4 hour requirement for occupied spaces is needed to ensure that spaces are not entered unless the on-duty competent
person has first hand knowledge that the conditions of a tank have remained unchanged from those of initial testing
and entry authorization.




NIOSH recommended OSHA set the frequency of testing, but rather than specifying as a minimum time interval, they listed
the factors that should be considered in determining how often an atmosphere must be tested (Ex. 6-14),




NIOSH suggests that OSHA specify the frequency of atmospheric testing. The frequency of atmospheric testing depends
upon a number of factors. These factors should be listed in the standard (such as nature of hazard, temperature within
tank, type of work in tank, elapsed time, unattended tanks, work breaks, residue volatility, etc.). Testing intervals
should be established according to these factors as determined by the following NIOSH-recommended hierarchy: (1)
Marine Chemist, (2) Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) or Certified Safety Professional (CSP), or (3) Coast Guard
Authorized Person [ 1915.11]. Furthermore, NIOSH suggests that `competent person' [ 1915.7], as defined
by OSHA, is not trained sufficiently to determine testing frequency. At a minimum, NIOSH suggests that testing be
done at `time of entry' and continuously or periodically during occupancy, particularly if conditions are changing.




Bay Shipbuilding (Ex. 6-15) commented,




Frequency of testing must be based on the area conditions and complexity of the hazard. Ventilation capability is
also a major factor in hazard control. Once an area has been made safe, and air quality can be maintained with natural
or mechanical ventilation, there are no further steps needed unless the condition is modified by some events such
as a spill, leak, or injection of an environmentally altering element. Otherwise, the only thing to do is to continue
monitoring (which is cost prohibitive); or base the checks on the HMIS scale for health, flammability, and reactivity
of the product. The higher the HMIS rating, the more frequent the checks.




The American Waterways Shipyard Conference (AWSC) (Ex. 6-23) commented,




The requirement to frequently test the confined spaces is already defined by the nature of the work, i.e., the changing
of work shifts, etc. There is no need to further define the term in the regulation.




Independent Testing and Consultation (Ex. 6-24) commented,




There is no way to define all of the parameters which will decide how often a tank or compartment should be tested. The
Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person can indicate on the certificate, how often the space is to be tested.
The wording in 1915.15 (d) and (f) should therefore be changed to `as frequently as necessary to ensure. * * *




Bath Iron Works Corporation (Ex. 6-28) commented,




No easy definition exists for all circumstances requiring additional `frequent' testing. This is a situation which
requires the judgment of the Marine Chemist, based on his knowledge of the last three cargoes, their properties and
the effectiveness of the cleaning procedures used. Some cargoes, such as alcohols, light fuel oils, etc., leave no
harmful residues after adequate tank cleaning and ventilation. Under such situations, testing every 24 hours is
adequate. Other cargoes leave residues, or, particular tank coatings partially absorb cargo residues, only to release
vapors slowly over time, regardless of how the cleaning operations were conducted. These conditions require atmospheric
testing more frequently. Long term experience at Bath Iron Works dealing with Diesel Fuel Marine (DFM), JP-5,
and several preservative coatings have shown no changes in atmospheric conditions from one 24 hour period to another.
In these cases, the Coast Guard guidelines of testing once each 24 hours is adequate.

OSHA has taken reasonable measures of increasing the awareness of the dangers of sealed or confined spaces by providing
guidelines and situations which could create hazardous atmospheres in the discussion presented in Appendix A of
the Proposed Rule. This information, together with the knowledge that the Marine Chemist has of the previous cargoes
and his judgment, when passed on to the Competent Person via instructions on his Marine Chemist Certificate, should
be adequate to define testing frequency under specific conditions. 




Pacific Marine Testing (Ex. 6-33) stated, 




Frequency of testing atmosphere is determined by the specific situation encountered. There are many variables which
must be taken into account before frequency of testing may be prescribed. 




Finally, the Marine Chemist Association, whose members set the frequency of retesting, (Ex. 6-34) commented,





The frequency of testing cannot be specified. There are too many variables that may govern the frequency of testing.
Please note Appendix A Subpart B to the standard. The term `frequency' should not be used and `as often as necessary'
should be substituted. 




OSHA agrees with those commenters who suggested that OSHA use the performance language ``as often as necessary''
rather than cite a specific frequency for retesting. As the majority of commenters suggest, spaces vary and conditions
within a space are subject to change at different time intervals. Therefore, a specific schedule for retesting all
spaces could lead to unnecessary testing in some instances and inadequate testing that may not identify hazardous
conditions as they arise in others. OSHA has concluded that those individuals who test an atmosphere must have the
flexibility to determine the precise frequency of testing. However, OSHA is specifying that the testing be done ``as
often as necessary,'' in order to ensure that changes in conditions are detected for each atmosphere. It is imperative
that the atmosphere be checked often enough to ensure that it is safe for workers. To that end, Appendix A provides supplementary
information to assist employers and employees in determining the frequency with which a tank must be monitored in
order to ensure atmospheric conditions are being maintained. OSHA's decision to use performance language such as
``as often as necessary'' is also consistent with the Agency's continuing position to use performance-based standards
where practicable. 

Therefore, OSHA has amended the language of those requirements in this section that previously required ``frequent''
testing to require the testing of atmospheres ``as often as necessary'' in order to provide flexibility to Marine
Chemists and competent persons who test spaces to determine the time and need for testing of atmospheres based on the
conditions in each dangerous atmospheres. 

OSHA sought public comment on whether the shipyard competent person should be required to conduct a physical examination
of the tank and pipelines when making a follow-up inspection. 

The majority of comments on this issue discussed it in terms of retesting to maintain safe conditions within all types
of work spaces. However, because OSHA believes that a visual inspection is an integral part of any testing the reasoning
in this discussion also pertains to initial testing required in  1915.12, 

Precautions before entering.

 

Most commenters (e.g., Exs. 6-3, 6-4, 6-10, 6-14, 6-18, 6-31) indicated it would
be appropriate for competent persons to conduct physical inspections of spaces they are checking during periodic
retesting of atmospheres. Some of them and others (Exs. 6-10, 6-18, 6-31, 6-33, and 6-34)
also indicated that it is currently industry practice for well trained individuals who conduct follow-up testing
to physically inspect spaces during these follow-up inspections. 

NIOSH (Ex. 6-14) commented, 




The shipyard `competent person' should be required to conduct a physical examination of the tank and pipelines during
follow-up inspections. Original conditions and intended purposes of tanks and pipelines change continually in
ship construction and repair. These new uses can only be detected by physically examining them during follow-up inspections.





The U.S. Coast Guard MIONY (Ex. 6-4) states, 




Shipyard competent persons should be required to make physical examination of each space retested. During ship repair,
vessels are often listed or trimmed for various reasons. This can cause flammable, toxic, and corrosive residues
to leak out of pipelines. In practice these are rarely blanked and the isolation valves may have been opened or leak.
These residues may ignite during hot work, harm workers on contact, or produce a hazardous atmosphere if there is a
temperature increase.

NFPA (Ex. 6-10) agreed, and noted that, 




NFPA strongly supports the inclusion of a requirement that in addition to atmospheric tests the shipyard competent
person should also be required to conduct a physical examination of the spaces and associated pipelines. NFPA 306,
2-1 requires the Marine Chemist to conduct a physical inspection and to conduct tests within the spaces. For
high flash point, low vapor pressure products such as diesel, a test for flammable or combustible vapors is not sufficient,
since at atmospheric temperatures there are not enough vapors being evolved for the combustible gas indicator to
detect. It is essential that physical inspections be conducted. 




The Navy's Sea Systems Command (Ex. 6-12) commented, 




The purpose of the follow-up check is to ensure conditions have not deteriorated. The requirement [for a physical
inspection] is endorsed for hot work rechecks. 




Similarly, the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard commented, 




Because it is important for a Marine Chemist to make such examinations, it is even more important that the competent
person also conducts such examinations. 

By making a physical examination of the confined space the competent person understands the tank conditions better,
and it helps to stress the importance of looking for other potential problems in a confined space. For example, paraffinic
residues on bulkheads are sometimes partially cleaned in areas where minor welding jobs will be done on the opposite
side of the bulkhead (in the adjacent space). Welders are unable to determine if they are welding outside the cleaned
area, but the competent person would have the opportunity to detect a problem. 




The Marine Chemist Association (Ex. 6-34) commented, 




The shipyard competent person should definitely conduct physical examinations of the interior of tanks and pipelines.
Instrumentation used to test the atmosphere of these structures do not always reveal the presence of flammable or
combustible materials. If these persons are required to maintain safe conditions in enclosed and confined spaced
they must evaluate conditions other than atmosphere. 




Northwest Marine Chemist (Ex. 6-18) asserted that, 




There is no way to properly determine the condition of a space without physically entering. 




Independent Testing and Consulting, Inc. (Ex. 6-24) commented, 




The shipyard competent person should be required to conduct a physical examination of the tank (provided it is safe
to enter) and make any necessary tests of piping provided that the piping has been approved for hot work on the Marine
Chemists certificate. 




Chemical Engineering Service, Inc. (Ex. 6-25A) commented, 




The original intent for the position of shipyard competent person was to detect conditions where, for some reason,
there was a decrease in oxygen or an accumulation of combustible gas. Left undetected, these situations could develop
into acute hazards for shipyard personnel. While these conditions are relatively rare, their occurrence could easily
lead to catastrophic loss of life and property. 

A much more chronic problem is fire hazards in the shipyard resulting from the introduction of flammable or combustible
material subsequent to the initial internal inspection for hot work. This could be the result of leaking piping, accidental
or intentional contamination, or gradual buildup of trash and other combustible materials. With the exception of
liquids with a reasonably high vapor pressure, these fairly common conditions can only be detected with an internal
inspection. 

If it is the intent of OSHA to utilize the shipyard competent person to control fire hazards in addition to atmospheric
hazards, internal inspection of all spaces must be required. 




Atlantic Environmental & Marine Services (Ex. 6-27) commented, 




* * * Shipyard Competent Persons should be required to conduct an on-site survey of tanks and pipelines
when making follow up inspections. 




The U.S. Navy's Environmental Health Center (Ex. 6-31) commented, 




Yes, the shipyard competent person should be required to conduct a physical examination of the tank and pipelines
when making a follow-up inspection. The current foundation of the NAVSEA Technical Manual lists a requirement in
Section 23.4 of reference (c) for conducting a physical examination of the tank and pipelines upon reinspection.
The condition for entry must be defined, such as, use of ventilation, PPE, non-sparking tools, and whether there is
to be continuous or periodic testing. 




Pacific Marine Testing (Ex. 6-33) commented, 




The shipyard competent person, when trained properly by a sanctioned training such as the one developed and presented
by NFPA and its supporters, is taught to conduct a physical examination of the tank and pipelines when making a follow-up
inspection. A determination of a safe condition can be made only when the shipyard competent person has conducted
a physical examination. 




Only the Shipbuilders Council of America (Ex. 6-3, pg. 3) and the Newport News Shipbuilding (Ex. 6-6, pg.
4) urged OSHA to allow a qualified person to decide whether a physical examination is necessary. 




The qualified person should not be required to conduct a full physical examination of the tank and pipelines when making
a follow-up inspection. . . . the qualified person should be given appropriate flexibility when making this determination
based on all available data, 

including 

a physical inspection, where necessary. 




OSHA agrees with the majority of commenters on this issue and has concluded that, because of changing conditions,
appropriate retesting must include a physical inspection of a tank or pipelines for leaks or other build-ups of hazardous
substance within a certified space. Physical inspection of a space is an integral part of an effective follow-up inspection
or monitoring program. For example, an actual physical examination is crucial in eliminating housekeeping debris
that could be fire hazards such as rags, insulation, or heavy oil residues in the tank deep spot. Therefore, OSHA is
requiring physical inspections be conducted during follow-up inspections of tested spaces.

In paragraph (a) of the final rule OSHA continues the requirement that was found in the first sentence of paragraph
(a)(1) in the previous text. The employer is required to disconnect, blank off, or otherwise block by a positive method
all pipelines that could carry hazardous materials into spaces that have been tested and found safe for work. There
were no substantive comments addressing this provision. Although OSHA has clarified the language with this rule,
the substance remains the same. 

The second sentence of paragraph (a)(1) in the previous text required that manholes and other closures of a space that
were secured during the testing of the space remain secured afterwards to prevent alteration of the tested space atmosphere.
OSHA has eliminated this requirement from the final rule. OSHA has decided that it would be more appropriate to recognize
that closures of tested spaces may be opened safely for various reasons during work operations and that a requirement
for them to remain secured was unnecessary. What is critical for safety is that the atmospheric conditions within
the space remain within permissible levels. Therefore, OSHA will continue to recognize the need to test and monitor
spaces as necessary. This will assure that safe work atmospheres are maintained and if they are not, work must be stopped
regardless of how the atmosphere becomes contaminated. 
Paragraph (b) of the final rule (as was the third sentence of paragraph (a)(1) of the previous rule) is intended to ensure
that a safe working environment is maintained within a previously tested space, even if outside contaminants may
have been introduced into the space after initial testing. The final rule says that when any changes occur that could
alter conditions within the space or other dangerous atmospheres, work shall be stopped until the space is visually
inspected, retested and found to comply with   1915.12, 1915.13 and 1915.14 of this part, as applicable.
To provide guidance to employers on what changes would require work be stopped, OSHA has included a note with examples.

Paragraph (c) of the final rule requires a competent person to test atmospheric conditions within a previously tested
space as often as necessary to maintain conditions as specified on certificates issued by a Marine Chemist or Coast
Guard authorized person. The Agency has changed the format of the final rule and this new paragraph (c) addresses only
the language that was found in paragraph (a)(4) of the previous rule. The requirements that were found in paragraphs
(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the previous text are not addressed in this section because they are covered elsewhere in OSHA's
requirements or they have been moved to a more appropriate section of the final rule. For example, previous paragraph
(a)(3) required employers to ensure that employees understand and obey all warning signs, tags, and the language
of Marine Chemists' certificates. The requirement addressing employee understanding of the warning labels is found
in  1915.16 of this Subpart. OSHA considers paragraph (c) of the final rule to be an editorial change to the language
that was found in the first sentence of paragraph (a)(4) in the previous rule and therefore, non-substantive. 
In paragraph (d) of the final rule, OSHA requires that if a competent person finds that atmospheric conditions within
a space fail to meet the applicable requirements of   1915.12, 1915.13 and 1915.14 of Subpart B, work in
the space must be stopped, the space retested by a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person and a new certificate
issued in accordance with  1915.14(a) before work may resume. The language found in paragraph (d) is similar
to that found in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(4) of the previous standard and the basic requirement remains
the same. Modifications to the previous language have changed references to the maintenance of gas-free conditions
to the maintenance of conditions meeting   1915.12, 1915.13, and 1915.14. These sections address not
only gas-free conditions but also other hazardous atmospheric conditions to which an employee may be exposed, which
are also within the scope of the certificate. OSHA believes that separating the two requirements found in paragraph
(a)(4) of the previous rule into separate paragraphs (c) and (d) of the final rule will improve compliance by making
the rule easier to understand. 
Paragraph (e) of the final rule requires a competent person to continue to test as necessary those spaces he or she has
tested previously to ensure that the atmospheric conditions within the tested space are maintained. This is consistent
with both NFPA 306 and industry practice. The substance of the final rule is similar to the language proposed in 1988
and the first sentence of paragraph (b)(2) of the previous rule except that, like paragraph (c) above, tests are to
be conducted for all relevant atmospheric conditions. 
In paragraph (f) of the final rule, OSHA requires that all work be stopped in those spaces tested previously by a competent
person when a competent person finds that the conditions within the space no longer meet the requirements set forth
elsewhere in this subpart. The language in paragraph (f) of the final rule is similar to the language proposed in paragraph
(g) of the 1988 proposal and is parallel to the language contained in paragraph (d) above.

Like paragraph (d) above, paragraph (f) of the final rule drops the list of specific atmospheric conditions and instead
references   1915.12, 1915.13 and 1915.14. The substantive requirement for stopping work until a space
found to be hazardous has been retested and found safe for workers has not changed from the previous language. 



6.  1915.16 Warning Signs and Labels



The substantive change OSHA has made to this section involves the expansion of the scope of the previous requirements
to all phases of shipyard employment. The previous language limited the scope of  1915.16 to ship repairing
operations only. The reasons for the expansion in scope of this section are discussed above in  1915.11, Scope
and Application. 

The provisions in final  1915.16 require that signs and labels that are posted to meet the specific requirements
contained in other sections of Subpart B be presented in a manner that can be understood by all employees. Like the previous
standard, an individual tank or other space need not be labeled separately if the whole area has been tested and all
means of access to the area are labeled with a warning sign. 
OSHA solicited public comment on whether  1915.16 should require that all conditions be labeled on tanks. The
majority of responders who considered this issue (Ex. 6-8, 6-15, 6-21, 6-22, 6-23, 6-24,
6-36, 6-37, 6-38) supported the continuation of the previous requirement that only tanks containing
unsafe work conditions need to be labeled. Other commenters (Ex. 6-4, 6-12, 6-28, 6-31) supported
labeling all locations that had been tested, whether safe or unsafe. Still other commenters (Ex. 6-3, 6-6)
suggested that only tanks containing safe work environments be labeled. 
Those commenters who supported continued use of the previous requirement of posting only unsafe tanks are best represented
by the following comments. The American Waterways Shipyard Conference, (Ex. 6-23) commented,




Current shipyard operations only provide warning signs for unsafe tanks. If both conditions are marked with warning
signs, then it ceases to be an instant hazard recognition.




This was further emphasized by a comment from Sound Testing, Inc., (Ex. 6-8):




I have always found the present standard's section on warning signs to be very workable. Not much is gained by labeling
safe places as such, for three reasons: 1. This practice would be very costly; 2. The very idea of using a warning sign
on a safe place is illogical; and 3. Signs would proliferate. The more signs there are, the less is the effect of any single
sign. Signs should be used as sparingly as possible, so that when we really need them they will be effective.




On the other hand, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) (Ex. 6-10) supported the placing of warning
signs on only those tanks that have been tested and found to be safe. NFPA states:




NFPA would support a requirement for placing warning signs on tanks if the signs were specifically restricted to indicating
spaces which have been tested and suitably designated as ``SAFE.'' If signs are required for all tanks which are ``SAFE''
then any tank which does not have a sign is then interpreted by all employees to be ``NOT SAFE.''




OSHA has concluded that requiring only unsafe spaces to be labeled as specified in   1915.12, 1915.13,
or 1915.14 will provide the most effective notice of atmospheric conditions that could endanger employees. The Agency
believes that the identification of hazardous conditions is the most efficient means of utilizing signs or labels.
OSHA agrees with commenters who noted that warning signs should be used only when necessary so that when they are posted,
employees will take notice of them. Shipyard employees are familiar with the labeling of tanks that have been tested
and found to be unsafe. On the other hand, OSHA is not prohibiting the posting of other signs and labels an employer may
find appropriate for that employer's workplace, but the Agency cautions employers about the overuse of signs and
labels, which could lead to decreased effectiveness. Moreover, in response to the NFPA and other commenters who supported
labeling ``safe'' spaces, OSHA notes that spaces that have been tested and found to be safe are required to be identified
by the Marine Chemist's certificate or the competent person's record of testing and recommendations. These certificates
and records provide the appropriate notice of safe working conditions. There is insufficient evidence in the record
to show that changes to the labeling requirements would increase safety. For all these reasons, OSHA is requiring
that all tanks and other spaces that fail to meet the requirements of   1915.12, 1915.13, or 1915.14, as
applicable, be posted with hazard warning signs or labeled with hazard warning messages as required in those sections.

OSHA deleted paragraph (a) of the old and proposed rules which required employers to notify employees of dangerous
work areas. The reason for this is that the posting requirements for various atmospheric conditions are specifically
addressed in their respective sections. 

The final rule text and the proposed rule text differ in that OSHA proposed that employers be responsible for ensuring
that all employees ``obey'' all warning signs. One commenter, Bay Shipbuilding Corp., (Ex. 6-15) addressed
the issue of employee compliance with safety regulations.




The employee must share the responsibility to obey and observe proper practices along with the employer. Every employee
must be held accountable for their actions.




In this regard, OSHA notes that under the OSH Act, employers are responsible for compliance with standards issued
under Section 6, and enforcement is directed at the employer and not the employee. 

In this final rule, OSHA has revised the previous rule by providing two basic requirements addressing hazard warning
messages to employees. 

In paragraph (a), OSHA is requiring that all hazard warning messages that are posted to comply with respective paragraphs
of   1915.12, 1915.13, and 1915.14 be presented in a manner or format that can be perceived and understood
by all employees.

OSHA proposed in paragraph (a) that the employer ensure that employees understand all warning signs and limitations
provided by Marine Chemists and the OSHA Form 74. OSHA has dropped the reference to the OSHA Form 74 since it is no longer
required, and has added new language to clarify that the employer must present warning materials in a manner that can
be understood by all of his or her employees. There are many methods such as dual language signs or pictorial graphics
that an employer may use to ensure that employees can and do understand all warning signs and instruction addressing
dangerous working conditions. This is consistent with the position OSHA has taken on other rulemakings that address
signs, tags, and labels. For example, in 29 CFR  1910.145, OSHA permits the use of accident prevention tags using
graphic or second language text where necessary. Moreover, the obligation to present signs and labels in a manner
that can be perceived by all employees also means that the label or sign must be posted in a place where employees will
see it in the course of their work. Other factors the employer must consider are size, material, and methods of attachment.
In short, this new performance-oriented language requires that employers provide adequate notice to all employees
of dangerous working conditions, but leaves the method of presentation up to the employer. 

In paragraph (b) of the final rule, OSHA continues to allow employers to post the warning signs or labels at all means
of access rather than requiring each tank or space to be labeled, as long as the entire space has been tested and certified.
This is the same as paragraph (c) of the previous standard. 



III. Statutory Considerations 



A. Introduction



OSHA has described the hazards found in confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres in shipyard
employment and the measures required to protect affected employees from those hazards in Section I, 

Background, 

and in Section II, 

Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule,

 earlier in this preamble. The Agency is providing the following discussion of the statutory mandate for OSHA rulemaking
activity to explain the legal basis for its determination that the Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous
Atmospheres standard, as promulgated, is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from significant
risks of injury and death. 

Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory 

occupational safety and health standards

 applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides that ``[e]ach employer
shall comply with 

occupational safety and health standards

 promulgated under this Act'' (emphasis added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 652(8)) provides that ``the
term `occupational safety and health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use
of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide
safe or healthful employment and places of employment.'' 

In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the
OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective
safety standards. In 

International Union, UAW v. OSHA, 

938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout
standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's
interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In


National Grain & Feed Ass'n v. OSHA, 

866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring
the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective,
directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion. 

OSHA rulemakings involve a significant degree of Agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing
courts must defer. (See for example, 

Building & Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock,

 838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988); 

Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst., 

448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the Agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must
be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought clarification
of the Agency's view of the scope of its expertise and authority. In light of those decisions, the preamble to this safety
standard states OSHA's views regarding the limits of its safety rulemaking authority and explains why the Agency
is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided regulatory extremes and continue to do so in this
rule. 

Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate
based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) The proposed standard will substantially reduce a
significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures
being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology
that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or
pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost-effective in that
it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally,
proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior Agency action, must be responsive to significant comment
in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements
limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing
a rule.

B. Congress Concluded That OSHA Regulations Are Necessary To Protect Workers From Occupational Hazards And That
Employers Should Be Required To Reduce or Eliminate Significant Workplace Health and Safety Threats 



At section 2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury
and illness should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising
out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost
production, wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared
``it to be its purpose and policy * * * to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation
safe * * * working conditions [29 U.S.C. 651(b)].'' 

To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing Federal and consensus standards during
the first 2 years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate
the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C. 655(a)].''
Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(3)), based
on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence (29 U.S.C. 655(b)(2)), that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate
to provide safe * * * employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or
health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule
as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].''
Correspondingly, every employer must comply with OSHA standards and in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees

death or serious physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C. 654(a)].'' 

``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs
when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety
as a cost of doing business. * * * Indeed, Congress thought that the 

financial costs

 of health and safety problems in the workplace were as large as or larger than the 

financial costs

 of eliminating these problems [

 452 U.S. 490, 519-522 (1981) (

and serious injuries [

[T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives
and useful years of labor. 

When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate
and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease,
over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated
to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation
and medical expenses. * * *

Only through a comprehensive approach can we hope to effect a significant reduction in these job death and casualty
figures. [

Id.

 at 518-19 (Senator Cranston)] 

 


Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious
employer might experience where inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers_particularly
smaller ones_simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless
all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' 

Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation
is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate
significant workplace health and safety threats.

C. As Construed by the Courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act Sets Clear and Reasonable Limits for Agency Rulemaking Action



OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH Act requires that, before it promulgates ``

any

 permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafe_in the
sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices [

Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst., 

448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality) (

Benzene

); emphasis was supplied in original].'' Thus, the national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress
instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning
the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant
safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not at least lessen risk in a significant way. 

The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized
that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would 

a fortiori 

not be reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See 

Industrial Union Dep't v. Hodgson, 

[499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their
employers out of business.') [

American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc., 

452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically feasible even if it portends disaster for some marginal firms,' but
it is economically infeasible if it threaten[s] massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of,' the industry)].''


By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in 

ATMI 

that economic infeasibility begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably
below this level. (See for example, 

ATMI, 

452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200  u g/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise serious possibility
of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring reconstruction of
90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200  u g/m3 level was not feasible for weaving and that 750  u g/m3
was all that could reasonably be required. See also 54 FR 29245-29246 (July 11, 1989); 

American Iron & Steel Institute, 

939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous foundries to avoid the possibility
of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole could have survived the loss of small
firms.) 
All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the
least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end (

ATMI

, at 514 n. 32; 

Building and Constr. Trades Dep't AFL-CIO v. Brock, 

838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period
of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as 10 years for compliance phase-in. (See 

United Steelworkers of Am. v. Marshall, 

647 F.2d 1189, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1980), 

cert. denied, 

453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized
basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend
the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph
E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990). 
To reach the necessary findings and conclusions, OSHA conducts rulemaking in accordance with the requirements of
section 6 of the OSH Act. The rulemaking process enables the Agency to determine the qualitative and, if possible,
the quantitative nature of the risk with (and without) regulation, the technological feasibility of compliance,
the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other purposes, the
industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the impact of higher
costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See 

ATMI 

at 2501-2503; 

American Iron & Steel Institute 

generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must
support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts
have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See 

Steelworkers, 

647 F.2d at 1206-1207.) 

OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which
provides a neutral forum for employer contests of citations issued by OSHA for noncompliance with health and safety
standards (29 U.S.C. 659-661; noted as an additional constraint in 

Benzene 

at 652 n. 59). OSHA must also respond rationally to similarities and differences among industries or industry sectors.
(See 

Building and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock, 

838 F.2d 1258, 1272-73 (D.C. Cir. 1988).) 

OSHA rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially reduce
a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable of being
done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these bounds,
further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all meaningful
comment militate against regulatory extremes.

D. The Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Shipyard Employment Standard Complies With
the Statutory Criteria Described Above and Is Not Subject to the Additional Constraints Applicable to Section 6(b)(5)
Standards



Standards which regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after
long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like
explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards.
(See 

National Grain & Feed Ass'n v. OSHA (NGFA II), 

866 F.2d 717, 731, 733 (5th Cir. 1989). As noted above, section 3(8) provides that 

all

 OSHA standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA
set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the Confined
and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Shipyard Employment standard is a safety standard, because
the standard addresses hazards, such as asphyxiation, explosions, and fires, that are immediately dangerous to
life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards subject to section 6(b)(5). 
The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety
standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring
safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part:




* * *by exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases
and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition
of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational
safety.




The legislative history makes this distinction even clearer:




[The Secretary] should take into account that anyone working in toxic agents and physical agents which might be harmful
may be subjected to such conditions for the rest of his working life, so that we can get at something which might not be
toxic now, if he works in it a short time, but if he works in it the rest of his life might be very dangerous; and we want to
make sure that such things are taken into consideration in establishing standards. [

Leg. Hist. 

at 502-503 (Sen. Dominick), quoted in 

Benzene 

at 648-49]




Additionally, Representative Daniels distinguished between ``insidious silent killers' such as toxic fumes,
bases, acids, and chemicals'' and ``violent physical injury causing immediate visible physical harm'' (

Leg. Hist. 

at 1003), and Representative Udall contrasted insidious hazards like carcinogens with ``the more visible and well-known
question of industrial accidents and on-the-job injury'' (

Leg. Hist. 

at 1004). (See also, for example, S. Rep. No. 1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 2-3 (1970), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.
News 1970, pp. 5177, 5179, reprinted in Leg. Hist. at 142-143, discussing 1967 Surgeon General study that found
that 65 percent of employees in industrial plants ``were potentially exposed to harmful physical agents, 

such as severe noise or vibration, 

or to toxic materials''; Leg. Hist. at 412; 

id. 

at 446; 

id. 

at 516; 

id. 

at 845; 

International Union, UAW 

at 1315.) 

In reviewing OSHA rulemaking activity, the Supreme Court has held that section 6(b)(5) requires OSHA to set ``the
most protective standard consistent with feasibility'' (

Benzene

 at 643 n. 48). As Justice Stevens observed:




The reason that Congress drafted a special section for these substances * * * was because Congress
recognized that there were special problems in regulating health risks as opposed to safety risks. In the latter case,
the risks are generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been
exposed for long periods of time to particular substances. [

Benzene, 

at 649 n. 54.]




Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities
and uncontrolled energy releases that could expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards
were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how
to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example,
the Court in 

International Union, UAW v. OSHA, 

938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991) rejected the view that section 6(b)(5) provided the statutory criteria for regulation
of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between
health and safety risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported
the OSHA position (

International Union, UAW 

at 1314). Additionally, the Court stated: ``We accord considerable weight to an agency's construction of a statutory
scheme it is entrusted to administer, rejecting it only if unreasonable'' (

International Union, UAW 

at 1313, citing 

Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 

467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984)). 

The Court reviewing the grain dust standard also deferred to OSHA's reasonable view that the Agency was not subject
to the feasibility mandate of section 6(b)(5) in regulating explosive quantities of grain dust (

National Grain & Feed Association v. OSHA (NGFA II), 

866 F.2d 717, 733 (5th Cir. 1989)). It therefore applied the criteria of section 3(8), requiring the Agency to establish
that the standard is ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to protect employees.

As explained in Section I, 

Background

, and Section II, 

Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule

, earlier in this preamble, and Section IV, 

Summary of Final Regulatory Analysis

, below, OSHA has determined that confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres in shipyard employment
pose significant risks to employees and that the provisions of the final rule are reasonably necessary to protect
affected employees from those risks. OSHA believes that compliance is economically feasible, because, as documented
in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or pass on compliance costs. 
As presented in Section IV, 

Summary of Final Regulatory Analysis

, later in this preamble, and in Table 1, the standard's costs, benefits, and compliance requirements are consistent
with those of other OSHA safety standards, such as the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER)
standard. 
OSHA assessed employee risk by evaluating exposure to the hazards associated with confined and enclosed spaces and
other dangerous atmospheres in shipyard employment. Section IV, 

Summary of Final Regulatory Analysis

, later in this preamble, presents OSHA's estimate of the costs and benefits of the Confined and Enclosed Spaces and
Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Shipyard Employment standard. OSHA has set the scope of the Confined and Enclosed
Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres standard to address situations in which employees are exposed to these hazards,
regardless of the location, shipboard vs. land-side. The Agency believes, based on analysis of the elements of the
hazards identified, that there is sufficient information for OSHA to determine that employees in the covered sectors
face significant risks related to confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres in shipyard employment.
Therefore, the Agency has determined that all employees within the scope of the Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other
Dangerous Atmospheres in Shipyard Employment standard face a significant risk of material harm and that compliance
with these standards is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from that risk. 
OSHA has considered and responded to all substantive comments regarding the proposed Confined and Enclosed Spaces
and Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Shipyard Employment on their merits in Section II, 

Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule

, earlier in this preamble. In particular, OSHA evaluated all suggested changes to the proposed rule in terms of their
impact on worker safety, their feasibility, their cost effectiveness, and their consonance with the OSH Act. 


IV. Final Regulatory Impact Analysis, Regulatory Flexibility Certification, and Environmental Impact Assessment



A. Summary 


The Agency has concluded that the final Subpart B standard for confined spaces in shipyards is technologically and
economically feasible. Subpart B incorporates the approach of the previous standard and subpart A (as it applies
to subpart B) while mandating new, comprehensive program elements such as training, duty to other employers, and
rescue. 
The Agency estimates that the final rule will result in no new significant costs for the industry. In addition, the
Agency finds that the final Subpart B is the most cost-effective approach. The Agency agrees with its Shipyard Employment
Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) that the current approach of making confined and enclosed spaces and other
dangerous atmospheres safe before entry and using Marine Chemists and competent persons to test and certify spaces
has succeeded well and will continue to provide a safe working environment for employees.

In addition, extending the scope of Subpart B to land-side activities will benefit the industry and its workers by
ensuring that land-side work activities are covered by a protective standard. Most of the industry has been following
Subpart B for confined space work on land-side for some time. Because workers and the tasks and hazards are essentially
the same whether on vessels or land-side, employing separate standards for each would have the potential to create
confusion and actually increase the risk of an incident occurring. The full regulatory impact analysis is in docket
S-050. 


B. Introduction 


Executive Order 12866 requires the Agency to perform an analysis of the costs, benefits, and regulatory alternatives
of its ``significant regulatory actions.'' A significant regulatory action is one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local,
or tribal governments or communities; 
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in this Executive Order. This final rule directly affects one well-defined industry, the shipbuilding
and ship repair industry, but there are no new costs of compliance. Accordingly, the promulgation of the confined
and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres standard for shipyard employment is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' for the purposes' of E.O. 12866. 
As required by the OSH Act and its judicial interpretations, the Agency must demonstrate that this regulation is both
technologically and economically feasible for the shipyard industry. The Agency has concluded that this standard
meets both tests of feasibility. 
In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) requires Federal agencies to determine whether a regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The Assistant Secretary certifies that this rule will not have such an impact, as the rule
imposes no new cost on firms. 
The Agency must also review this standard in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), the Guidelines of the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ)(40 CFR part 1500), and OSHA's DOL NEPA Procedures
(29 CFR part 11). 
This summary of the Agency's analysis includes an overview of affected industries and employees, estimated benefits,
the technological feasibility of the standard, estimated compliance costs, regulatory flexibility analysis,
economic and environmental impacts, a discussion of the regulatory and non-regulatory alternatives to this final
standard, and the existence of significant risk. The full text of the regulatory analysis has been placed in the shipyard
confined space's Docket S-050. 
OSHA created the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) in 1988 to advise the Agency in consolidating
the shipyard standards. The committee was made up of representatives from industry, labor, government, and professional
organizations. Besides making recommendations to the Agency about its regulations, the committee also provided
information about current industry practices and the costs and benefits of various rules and alternatives. This
information has been reviewed carefully by the Agency in developing the Regulatory Analysis of the final rule. 


C. Industry Profile 


The American shipyard industry has been in a long-term decline since 1981 when the Federal government ended subsidy
programs for commercial ship construction. In the period 1976-1980, the industry built an average of 64 merchant
vessels per year. Only five commercial ships have been built since 1988. The decline in merchant vessel construction
in the 1980s was partially offset by a large increase in military ship construction. However, the end of the military
competition with the former U.S.S.R. has resulted in a sharp drop in military ships on order. The recently completed
``bottom-up'' review of the armed forces has called for a major reduction in the number of active combat ships, and
consequently a drop in the number of future orders. U.S. Navy orders, which averaged 19 per year in the 1980s, is estimated
to fall to 8 per year during the period 1994-1999. Ship repair and construction of inland vessels and barges has
remained constant during the past 5 years. 
Employment in the shipbuilding industry had fallen from 177,000 in 1984 to about 125,000 by 1987 and remained near
that level until 1992. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that employment in the industry had fallen to 106,000
by late 1993. It is likely that employment will continue to fall to below 100,000 in the next few years. In 1992 the value
of output from American shipyards was approximately $9.9 billion. Based on Dun & Bradstreet's estimated mean
return for the shipyard industry of 2.9 percent, the industry earned approximately $287 million. 
The Agency estimates that there are approximately 500 firms in SIC 3731, and a majority of these have fewer than 50 employees.
Employment in the shipyard industry is highly concentrated. The ten largest shipyards employ approximately 70 percent
of all shipyard workers, and only the 100 largest firms have as many as 100 employees. The Agency estimates that approximately
200 firms engaged in ship repair employ fewer than 11 employees. 


D. Population at Risk

Based on data in the 1987 Census of Manufacturers, 75 percent of shipyard employees are production employees. Data
from CONSAD Research Corporation's 1986 report to OSHA estimated that 76.6 percent of shipyard workers were production
workers. Relying on the 1987 Census of Manufacturers, the Agency concludes that there are approximately 79,500 production
workers (75 percent of 106,000 total employees) who are potentially involved in confined space entry in shipyard
employment and are therefore exposed to confined space hazards. 



E. Technological Feasibility 


The shipyard industry has been applying the previous Subpart B on vessels for approximately 30 years_and to some extent
on land-side activities. While the revised final standard mandates new elements such as training, rescue, and duty
to other employers, it makes no fundamental change in the way shipyards perform confined spaces' work. Technologies
such as atmospheric testing instruments, ventilation equipment, and respirators have been in use for many years
throughout the industry. As the new standard does not require any new technology or engineering or other controls,
the Agency concludes that this new confined space standard is technologically feasible. The performance-oriented
criteria of the standard should also allow technological innovation to achieve compliance. 


F. Costs and Benefits 


Several elements in the final rule could impose costs on the shipyard industry: requirements for training of production
workers; duty to other employers (contractors and subcontractors); extending the scope to land-side operations;
and specifications for self-rescue and rescue teams. The Shipyard Employment Safety Advisory Committee (SESAC)
recommended that all of these provisions be included in the final confined spaces standard to make the rule comprehensive.
Submissions to the docket by the shipyard industry, unions, and professionals in the maritime industry indicate
that these elements would not impose new costs on shipyards but would in essence codify current industry practice.
Testimony at SESAC's meetings also consistently indicated that the elements of the new standard would impose no new
costs on the industry (SESAC transcript Sept. 3, 1992, pp. 471-503). The Agency therefore concludes that the
new Subpart B is economically feasible, and will have no effect on profits or the cost of output of the shipyard industry.


A benefit of the final rule is to eliminate a paperwork requirement of reporting the identity of shipyard competent
persons to the Agency on two forms and to clarify the duties of the competent person, Certified Industrial Hygienist,
and Marine Chemist. The Agency believes that full compliance with existing Subpart B would eliminate the average
of one to two annual fatalities. However, the Agency also concludes that mandating the new comprehensive elements
of the final standard (for training, duty to other employers, and rescue) will contribute to compliance and discipline
in applying Subpart B and will reduce the number of fatalities. The Agency also concludes that increasing the oxygen
content to 19.5 percent by volume, specifying the order of atmospheric testing, and limiting oxygen to no more than
22 percent by volume reduces significant risk relative to the requirements of existing Subpart B. The shipyard industry
largely conforms to these practices at the present time. 


G. Regulatory Alternatives 



The Agency also believes that the proposed rule is the most cost-effective regulatory alternative for this industry.
If the general industry ``permit-entry confined spaces'' standard (29 CFR 1910.146) were applied to land-side activities_or
all shipyard work_costs would be incurred to re-train shipyard production workers in a second procedure for entering
and working in confined spaces, for attendants, and for establishing a written program. The Agency estimates that
this would cost the industry approximately $104 million annually. These costs are not as high as estimates found in
the comments to the docket because the final general industry permit spaces rule differed significantly from the
proposed rule, especially on the number of attendants that would be required. Adopting the general industry confined
spaces for only land-side shipyard operations could also result in increased risk of accidents if shipyard workers
had to apply two distinct standards to their work. Confined space work is routine in shipyards and employees frequently
shift back and forth between land-side and vessels. 

A second regulatory alternative would be to apply the general industry standard to all shipyard work. Here the program
costs would be as great as the first alternative but the Agency has concluded that there would not be additional benefits.
The shipyard confined space standard is in many ways a more restrictive subset of the general industry standard. The
additional program-based elements of  1910.146 would not improve the safety of confined space entry in shipyards
because the shipyard standard is even more comprehensive in its coverage of hazardous atmospheres. Further, its
approach to inspection, testing, and ventilating spaces has become an integral part of the routine work activity
in shipyard employment.

<TEXT>
 

Confined and enclosed space and other dangerous atmosphere work in shipyards is unique: it is routine; hazardous
atmospheres are common; and the work activity itself frequently introduces or creates hazards. The confined spaces
of each ship are different. A ship's interior structure may consist of a series of nested confined spaces, one within
the other, each of which may be irregular and accessible through small hatches. Safety procedures based on attendants
or quick rescue are not a safe or a practical solution. 

Evidence in the record from the industry attests to the success of the shipyard industry in protecting employees during
work in confined spaces (Docket S-050: 11-3, 11-6, 
11-12, 11-13, 11-17, 11-30). However, fatalities and injuries do occur: OSHA recorded 20
deaths between 1983-1992 in its Fatality Investigation Reports for the shipyard and boat-building industries
combined. In every case, OSHA's evaluation indicated that the fatality was caused by a failure to follow the requirements
of the previous Subpart B. Although accidents are relatively few given the large number of confined space entries
and the hazards involved, the continuing number of fatalities and injuries indicates that a regulation is necessary
to maintain safe work practices. 



H. International Trade 



In accordance with Executive Order 12866, OSHA assessed the effects of the final standard on international trade.
The shipyard industry actively competes with foreign shipyards for ship repair and shipbuilding orders. If this
OSHA regulation significantly increased the price of products and services of domestic shipyards, foreign shipyards
could benefit. OSHA believes, however, that there will be no significant effect on products or services as a result
of this regulation. 



I. Environmental Impact 



The confined spaces standard has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

V. Effective Date 





In developing the final rule, OSHA has considered whether a delayed effective date is necessary for any of the provisions
of the standard. Employers will need time to integrate their procedures for complying with the provisions in this
standard as applied to land-side confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. Although the record
indicates that the new provisions (training, rescue, and duties to other employers) being used on board vessels and
vessel sections are current industry practice, under this standard they also have been expanded to include land-side
operations. OSHA believes that a period of 90 days will be adequate for this purpose, since most of the requirements
in the final rule do not require extensive training or major modifications of existing work practices. This amount
of time will be adequate for employers to ensure that their work practices conform to the requirements of the revised
standard. 


VI. Information Collection Requirements 





5 CFR part 1320 sets forth procedures for agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collection
requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The final Confined and Enclosed Spaces
and Other Dangerous Atmospheres standard requires the employer to allow OSHA access to the competent person roster,
testing and inspection results, and training records. In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, OSHA certifies that it has submitted the information collection
to OMB for review under section 3504(b) of that Act. 



Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average five minutes per response to allow
OSHA compliance officers access to the employer's records. Send comments regarding this burden estimate, or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of
Information Management, Department of Labor, room N-1301, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210;
and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous
Atmospheres). Washington, DC 20503. 


VII. Federalism 





This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), regarding
Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting state policy options,
consult with states before taking any actions which would restrict state policy options, and take such actions only
if there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for
preemption of state law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any such preemption is
to be limited to the extent possible. 



Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt state laws
relating to issues on which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health standards. Under the OSH
Act, a state can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of
such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States must,
among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as
the Federal standards. Where such standards are applicable to products distributed or used in interstate commerce,
they may not unduly burden commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions. (See section 18(c)(2) of
the OSH Act.) 



The Federal standards on confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres address hazards which are
not unique to any one state or region of the country. Nonetheless, states with occupational safety and health plans
approved under section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own state standards to deal with any special problems
which might be encountered in a particular state. Moreover, because these standards are written in general, performance-oriented
terms, there is considerable flexibility for state plans to require, and for affected employers to use, methods of
compliance which are appropriate to the working conditions covered by the standard. 



In brief, this final rule addresses a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in shipyard
employment. States which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSH Act are not preempted by this standard
and will be able to address any special conditions within the framework of the Federal Act, while ensuring that the
state standards are at least as effective as this standard. 


VIII. State Plan Standards 





The 23 states and 2 territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans must adopt a comparable
standard within 6 months of the publication date of the final standard. These states and territories are: Alaska,
Arizona, California, Connecticut,

4

 Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York,

5

 North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington,
and Wyoming. Until such time as a state standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance,
as appropriate, in these states.

Appendix A to Subpart B_Compliance Assistance Guidelines for Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres



This Appendix is a non-mandatory set of guidelines provided to assist employers in complying with the requirements
of this subpart. This Appendix neither creates additional obligations nor detracts from obligations otherwise
contained in the standard. It is intended to provide explanatory information and educational material to employers
and employees to foster understanding of, and compliance with, the standard. 


Sections 1915.11 through 1915.16. 

These standards are minimum safety standards for entering and working safely in vessel tanks and compartments. 


Section 1915.11(b) Definition of ``Hot work.'' 

There are several instances in which circumstances do not necessitate that grinding, drilling, abrasive blasting
be regarded as hot work. Some examples are: 
1. Abrasive blasting of the hull for paint preparation does not necessitate pumping and cleaning the tanks of a vessel.

2. Prior to hot work on any hollow structure, the void space should be tested and appropriate precautions taken. 


Section 1915.11(b) Definition of ``Lower explosive limit.'' 

The terms lower flammable limit (LFL) and lower explosive limit (LEL) are used interchangeably in fire science literature.



Section 1915.11(b) Definition of ``Upper explosive limit.'' 

The terms upper flammable limit (UFL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are used interchangeably in fire science literature.



Section 1915.12(a)(4).

 After a tank has been properly washed and ventilated, the tank should contain 20.8 percent oxygen by volume. This is
the same amount found in our normal atmosphere at sea level. However, it is possible that the oxygen content will be
lower. When this is the case, the reasons for this deficiency should be determined and corrective action taken. 
An oxygen content of 19.5 percent can support life and is adequate for entry. However, any oxygen level less than 20.8
percent and greater than 19.5 percent level should also alert the competent person to look for the causes of the oxygen
deficiency and to correct them prior to entry. 


Section 1915.12(b)(4) Flammable atmospheres.

 Atmospheres with a concentration of flammable vapors at or above 10 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) are
considered hazardous when located in confined spaces. However, atmospheres with flammable vapors below 10 percent
of the LEL are not necessarily safe. 
Such atmospheres are too lean to burn. Nevertheless, when a space contains or produces measurable flammable vapors
below the 10 percent LEL, it might indicate that flammable vapors are being released or introduced into the space and
could present a hazard in time. Therefore, the cause of the vapors should be investigated and, if possible, eliminated
prior to entry. 
Some situations that have produced measurable concentrations of flammable vapors that could exceed 10 percent of
the LEL in time are: 
1. Pipelines that should have been blanked or disconnected have opened, allowing product into the space. 
2. The vessel may have shifted, allowing product not previously cleaned and removed during washing to move into other
areas of the vessel. 
3. Residues may be producing the atmosphere by releasing flammable vapor.
