 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared an environmental assessment
and a finding of no significant impact for the shipment of an unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing.
A risk analysis, which forms the basis for the environmental assessment, has led us to conclude that shipment of the
unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing will not have a significant impact on the quality of the
human environment. Based on our finding of no significant impact, we have determined that an environmental impact
statement need not be prepared.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A veterinary biological product regulated under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151 

et seq.

) must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological product license may be issued.
A field test is generally necessary to satisfy prelicensing requirements for veterinary biological products. In
order to ship an unlicensed product for the purpose of conducting a proposed field test, a person must receive authorization
from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 


In determining whether to authorize shipment for field testing of the unlicensed veterinary biological product
referenced in this notice, APHIS conducted a risk analysis to assess the product's potential effects on the safety
of animals, public health, and the environment. Based on that risk analysis, APHIS has prepared an environmental
assessment. APHIS has concluded that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing
will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Based on this finding of no significant impact,
we have determined that there is no need to prepare an environmental impact statement. 

An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for the shipment of the following
unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing: 






The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)(42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979).

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Today's notice announces the availability of the ROD for Non-Federal Participation Capacity Ownership Contracts
and Section 9(c) Policy.



Capacity Ownership allows non-Federal utilities to purchase up to 725 megawatts (MW) of contract rights of use BPA's
share of alternating current (AC) Intertie capacity, which was increased upon completion of the Third AC Intertie
transmission project. The Capacity Ownership contracts establish the terms and conditions for use of the non-Federal
parties' share of the Pacific Northwest-Pacific Southwest AC Intertie. 

The Non-Federal Participation, Northwest Power Act, Section 9(c) Policy (Non-Federal Participation Section 9(c)
Policy) establishes the guidelines for BPA determinations of whether the export of a regional resources will result
in an increase in the electric requirements of any of BPA's customers in the Pacific Northwest, and whether the resource
could be conserved or otherwise retained in the Pacific Northwest for service to load in the Pacific Northwest. The
guidelines will pertain to Non-Federal Participation determinations related to initial exports by non-Federal
parties of up to 725 MW of regional resources over their Capacity Ownership share; and subsequent related determinations
whenever Pacific Northwest resources are exported whether by such non-Federal parties or by third parties over a
New Owner's Capacity Ownership share.

The transmission service sought by RMLD in the Application is: 

1. Pool-Wide network transmission service, of precisely the same kind and character as is presently available under
 13.2(b) of the NEPOOL Agreement; 

2. Over transmission facilities rated 69 kV or above, previously or hereafter constituting Pool Transmission Facilities
(PTF) within the definition presently contained in Section 13.1 of the NEPOOL Agreement; 

3. At a pool-wide rate established in accordance with the methodology set forth in   13.4, 13.5 and 13.9
of the NEPOOL Agreement; 

4. To be used for the transfer of an ownership interest or output entitlement of RMLD in a generating unit having a gross
rating of 25 MW or higher, as to which the appropriate committee operating under the NEPOOL Agreement has not unreasonably
withheld such designation as may be necessary to permit RMLD to acquire an ownership interest or output entitlement
consistent with the requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 164A; and 

5. With Economy Flow, Scheduled Outage, Unscheduled Outage, Deficiency service and other hour-to-hour service
provided by NEPEX under the terms of the NEPOOL Agreement, as referenced in  13.2(a). 

The initiation and termination dates for the service requested, and the total amount of transmission service requested,
are not presently determinable with precision. The service sought will not become effective unless the proposed
Thirtieth Amendment to the NEPOOL Agreement, currently pending before the Commission in Docket No. ER93-985-000,
becomes effective. If the Thirtieth Amendment becomes effective, RMLD expects: (1) To require the availability
of the service requested in the Application within approximately five years; 
(2) that the exact initiation and termination dates of the service will depend on the nature of the ownership interest
or output entitlement that RMLD acquires in the generating unit or units described in item 4 above; and (3) that the
total amount of transmission capacity requested will be within the range historically required by RMLD under Section
13.2(b) of the NEPOOL Agreement.

<DOCTITLE>Northern States Power Co., et al.; Intention to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and Conduct Public Scoping
Meetings</DOCTITLE>


July 19, 1994.


The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received applications for six new licenses for the continued
operation of the Big Falls Water Power Project No. 2390; the Pixley Project No. 2395, the Lower Hydro Project No. 2421,
the Crowley Project No. 2473, the Thornapple Project No. 2475, and the Upper Hydro Project No. 2640. The projects are
located on the Flambeau River. The projects are located in Rusk, Price, and Ashland Counties, Wisconsin.
The FERC staff has determined that licensing these projects would constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff's
EIS will objectively consider both sites Specific and cumulative environmental effects of the projects and reasonable
alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis.
A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decisions.


Scoping Meetings


FERC staff will conduct two scoping meetings. The evening scoping meeting is primarily for public input while the
day-time meeting will focus on resource agency and non-governmental organization (NGO) concerns. All interested
individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental
issues that should be analyzed in the EIS.
To help focus discussion, a preliminary scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed at the meeting will
be distributed by mail to interested parties on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the preliminary scoping document
will also be available at the scoping meetings.
The public scoping meeting which will be conducted by staff will be held at 7:00 p.m. on August 16, 1994, at the Park Falls
Public Library, 410 Division Street, Park Falls, Wisconsin. The agency meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m. on August
17, 1994, at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Office at 875 South 4th Avenue, Park Falls, Wisconsin.


Objectives


At the scoping meetings, the staff will: (1) Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis
in the planned EIS; (2) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantifiable
data, on the resources at issue, (3) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed
in the EIS, including viewpoints in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views, (4) determine
the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EIS, and (5) identify resource issues that are not important
and do not require detailed analysis.


Procedures


The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and will become part of the formal record of the Commission proceeding
on the Flambeau River Projects under consideration. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked
to sign in before the meeting starts and to clearly identify themselves for the record.
Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EIS.
Participants wishing to make oral comments in the public meeting are asked to keep them to five minutes to allow everyone
the opportunity to speak.
Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues, may submit written statements for inclusion
in the public record at the meeting. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed with the Secretary, Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426. All correspondence should clearly
show one or more of the following captions on the first page: Big Falls Project No. 2390-003; Pixley Project No.
2395-003; Lower Project No. 2421-003; Crowley Project No. 2473-002; Thornapple Project No. 2475-006;
and, Upper Project No. 2640-010.
All those that are formally recognized by the Commission as intervenors in the Flambeau Projects' proceedings are
asked to refrain from engaging the staff in discussions of the merits of the projects outside of any announced meetings.
Further, parties are reminded of the Commission's Rules of practice and Procedure, which require parties filing
documents with the commission, to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name is on the official service list,
including agents of the applicants.

<DOCTITLE>Jerry Kaufman; Surrender of Exemption</DOCTITLE>


July 19, 1994.


Take notice that Jerry Kaufman, exemptee for the Garden Bar Power Plant Project No. 7745-003 on Camp Far West
Ditch, near Lincoln, Placer County, California, requested that his exemption from licensing be terminated. The
exemption was issued on March 30, 1984. The exemptee states that no construction has been done on this project. Mr.
Kaufman intends to remove the power plant; the turbines are old and the cost of putting the plant back into operation
is too prohibitive. The liability of having the plant sit is also unacceptable.
The exemptee filed the request on November 17, 1993, and the exemption shall remain in effect through the thirtieth
day after issuance of this notice unless that day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday as described in 18 CFR 385.007, in
which case the exemption shall remain in effect through the first business day following that day. New applications
involving this project site, to the extent provided under 18 CFR Part 4, may be filed on the next business day.

with the public interest, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes. 

The Commission reserves the right to require a further showing that neither public nor private interests will be adversely
affected by continued approval of Vesta's issuances of securities or assumptions of liability. 

Notice is hereby given that the deadline for filing motions to intervene or protests, as set forth above, is August

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of permits. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing, as a direct final action, 5-year Phase I Acid Rain Permits
to 12 utility plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72). 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by
promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated
final rules implementing the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On November 18, 1993, EPA published a notice of proposed
revisions to rules regarding Phase I substitution and reduced utilization plans [sections 404 (b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B)
of the Act]. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties 
signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. 



In today's action, EPA is issuing permits that are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement. Except as noted below,
EPA approves for 1995-1999 all compliance options for which EPA deferred action for 1996-1999 in the draft
permits. In addition, except as noted below, the numbers of substitution and compensating unit allowances allocated
to each unit for 1995-1999 are identical to the numbers of allowances allocated to each unit for 1995 in the draft
permits. The additional allowances discussed below, according to the settlement, are a one-time allocation and
entail a simultaneous deduction of an equal number of allowances in a future year. Upon activation of conditionally-approved
plans, substitution or compensating unit allowances are allocated for the remaining years the plan is in effect.
EPA issues the following permits: 

Hutsonville in Illinois: 9,661 substitution allowances for each year and 368 additional allowances to unit 05; 9,837
substitution allowances for each year and 936 additional allowances to unit 06.

<DOCTITLE>Program Announcement and Grant Orientation Conferences for the Health Careers Opportunity Program </DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 
announces that applications for fiscal year (FY) 1995 Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP) grants will be accepted
under the authority of Section 740 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Pub. L. 102-408, dated October
13, 1992. 

Section 740 authorizes the Secretary to make grants to and enter into contracts with schools of allopathic medicine,
osteopathic medicine, public health, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, allied health, chiropractic
and podiatric medicine and public and nonprofit private schools which offer graduate programs in clinical psychology
and other public or private nonprofit health or educational entities to carry out programs which assist individuals
from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter and graduate from such schools. The assistance authorized by the section
may be used to: (1) Identify, recruit, and select individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds for education and training
in a health profession; (2) provide for a period prior to the entry of such individuals into the regular course of education
of such a school, preliminary education designed to assist them to complete successfully such regular course of education
at such a school or referring such individuals to institutions providing such preliminary education; (3) facilitate
the entry and retention of such individuals in health and allied health professions schools; and (4) provide counseling
and advice on financial aid to assist such individuals to complete successfully their education at such schools.


The Administration's FY 1995 budget request for this program is $30.7 million. The statute requires that, of the amount
appropriated for any fiscal year, 20 percent ($6.1 million) must be obligated for stipends to disadvantaged individuals
of exceptional financial need who are students at schools of allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, or dentistry.
Of the remaining balance, $20.8 million will be used to continue support of 107 multi-year projects previously approved
and funded. It is estimated that $3.7 million will be available to fund approximately 22 competing projects averaging
$168,000 each. 

In addition, the statute requires that, of the amounts appropriated for any fiscal year, 10 percent must be obligated
to community-based programs and 70 percent must be obligated for grants or contracts to institutions of higher education.
Not more than 5 percent of such funds may be obligated for grants and contracts having the primary purpose of informing
individuals about the existence and general nature of health careers. 

The legislative authority for this program was extended through FY 1994. This program announcement is subject to
the extension of this authority and to the appropriation of funds. Applicants are advised that this application announcement
is a contingency action being taken to assure that should the authority be extended and funds become available for
this purpose, they can be awarded in a timely fashion consistent with the needs of the program as well as to provide for
an even distribution of funds throughout the fiscal year. 



Previous Funding Experience 



Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions
regarding submission of an application for this program. In FY 1994, HRSA reviewed 200 applications for HCOP Grants.
Of those applications, 88 percent were approved and 12 percent were disapproved. Thirty-five projects, or 20 percent
of the approved applications, were funded. In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 248 applications for HCOP Grants. Of those applications,
86 percent were approved and 14 percent were disapproved. Seventy-two projects, or 35 percent of the approved applications,
were funded. 

To receive support, applicants must meet the requirements of the program regulations which are located at 42 CFR part
57, subpart S. The period of Federal support will not exceed 3 years. 



National Health Objectives for the Year 2000 



The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. The Health Careers Opportunity Program
is related to the priority area of Educational and Community-Based programs. Potential applicants may obtain a copy
of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary
Report; Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing

(b) The number and types of individuals who can be expected to benefit from the project;

(c) The administrative and management ability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project in a cost effective
manner;

(d) The adequacy of the staff and faculty;

(e) The soundness of the budget; and

(f) The potential of the project to continue without further support under this program.

In addition, the following factor will be applied in determining the funding of applications:

A funding priority is defined as the favorable adjustment of aggregate review scores when applications meet specified
objective criteria.

The following funding priorities will be used in the distribution of grant awards in FY 1995.



Statutory Funding Priority



Public Law 102-408 requires the Secretary to give priority in funding to the following schools:

1. A school which previously received an HCOP grant and increased its first-year enrollment of individuals from disadvantaged
backgrounds by at least 20 percent over that enrollment in the base year 1987 (for which the applicant must supply data)
by the end of 3 years from the date of the award of the HCOP grant; and

2. A school which had not previously received an HCOP grant that increased its first-year enrollment of individuals
from disadvantaged backgrounds by at least 20 percent over that enrollment in the base year 1987 (for which the applicant
must supply data) over any period of time (3 consecutive years).



Established Funding Priority



The following funding priority was established in fiscal year 1990 after public comment at 55 FR 11264, dated March
27, 1990, and is being continued in FY 1995, with the exception that wording related to alternative means of documenting
enrollment in terms of increases and retention rates for disadvantaged students has been deleted. Progress in these
areas is considered as a part of the merit review process for this program and applicants will be informed of relevant
benchmarks in application materials.

A funding priority will be given to HCOP applications from health professions schools that have a disadvantaged student
enrollment of 35 percent or more. Traditionally, disadvantaged students have been disproportionally underrepresented
in the health profession schools and the health professions. A funding priority will also be given to schools of allied
health offering baccalaureate or higher level programs in physical therapy, physician assisting, respiratory
therapy, medical technology or occupational therapy that have a disadvantaged student enrollment of 35 percent
or more among those programs.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940725-2-00046 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940725-2-00034 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The applicant must indicate on the upper right-hand corner of the face page of the application the funding priority
for which the applicant wishes consideration. However, the final determination of the category of funding priority
will be based on a staff assessment of the contents of the proposal. An applicant may only be given credit for one funding
priority. Applicants which do not request consideration of a funding priority will be reviewed and given full consideration
for funding in the peer review process.

In addition, consideration will be given to an equitable geographic distribution of projects, and the assurance
that a combination of all funded projects represents a reasonable proportion of the health professions specified
in the legislation.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), in collaboration with the Administration for Children,
Youth and Families (ACYF), announces the availability of fiscal year 1994 funds for Maternal and Child Health (MCH)
Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) Set-Aside Program grants authorized under section 502(b)(1)(A) of
Title V of the Social Security Act, to support development and expansion of successful community integrated service
strategies. Funding for new CISS projects is Congressionally focused on development of home visiting programs which
carry out the intent of the ``Home Visiting Services for At-Risk Families'' Program, as authorized by Title V of the
ADAMHA Reorganization Act (P.L. 102-321). Funds were appropriated under Public Law 103-112. $2.5 million
will be available to support 50 new CISS projects of $50,000 per grant for a one year budget period. Awards will be for
one year, beginning October 1, 1994. 


The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
and goals of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. The MCH CISS program addresses
the Healthy People 2000 objectives related to improving maternal, infant, child and adolescent health by developing
comprehensive, coordinated, culturally-competent and family centered services at the community level which address
health and related needs for all pregnant women, infants, children, and their families. Potential applicants may
obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or Healthy People

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Program Background and Objectives 



At the request of Congress, new fiscal year (FY) 1994 CISS funds will focus on the home visiting approach described
in section 501(a)(3) of the Social Security Act and will begin to implement the intent of the ``Home Visiting Services
for At-Risk Families'' program, authorized by Title V of the ADAMHA Reorganization Act. The purpose of the latter
program is to increase the frequency of early prenatal care, improve birth outcomes, increase health and related
social services to at-risk families, and to reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect. To optimize the CISS funds
devoted to at-risk home visiting and to amplify the impact of the Family Preservation and Support Services initiative,
HRSA and ACYF are collaborating to promote State efforts to develop comprehensive systems of services_including
home visiting_that meet both the health and welfare needs of families. 



Inter-Agency Coordination 



These CISS/Home Visiting for At-Risk Families (HVAF) grants are intended to be a coordinated initiative with the
Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) Family Preservation and Family Support (FP/FS) Services
program, as authorized under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act. The CISS/HVAF grants will complement FP/FS
planning activities to promote development of comprehensive systems of services which meet both the health and social
service needs of families. 

The ACYF will participate with the HRSA in developing the program guidance for the CISS/HVAF initiative, monitoring
the CISS home visiting awards made during FY 1994, and providing ongoing technical assistance and consultation to
the HRSA regarding the required collaboration and linkages between a CISS/HVAF applicant and the relevant State
Title IV-B Child Welfare agency. Grants funded under this program are expected to exemplify full, effective
collaboration between Title IV-B and Title V agencies. 



Purpose 



Funds are available in FY 1994 to support planning activities that aim to integrate community systems of care for vulnerable
children and their families. Such an integrated system would include at-risk pregnant women, as well as their children
and families as target populations; pay particular attention to the increased resources needed by children with
special health care needs and their families; emphasize primary prevention and family support activities; and where
appropriate use a system of home visiting as a significant component of any community system of care. 

All CISS/HVAF activities are intended to be conducted within the context of overall State efforts to develop comprehensive
community based systems of services and to focus on unmet needs and service gaps identified in the State's MCH Block
Grant plan and FP/FS planning process. (Project elements relating to collaboration with ACYF-sponsored programs
are described more fully in the program guidance included in the application packet.) 



Funding Category 



At the request of Congress, the sole funding category for new CISS projects in FY 1994 is the home visiting strategy
described in section 501(a)(3), i.e., case management services provided in the home. 



Special Concerns 



MCH CISS Set-Aside Program grantees are expected to participate in community-wide, comprehensive planning activities
that coordinate primary care, public health and child welfare activities; to place emphasis on rural communities
and metropolitan areas with high rates of infant mortality and low birth weights, especially among minority populations;
and, to coordinate with the 15 communities in the Nation which have received grants from the HRSA under the Healthy
Start initiative. Healthy Start communities include: Aberdeen Area Indian Nations, NE/ND/SD; Baltimore MD; Birmingham,
AL; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Cleveland, OH; Detroit, MI; Lake County, IN; New Orleans, LA; New York, NY; Oakland, CA;
Philadelphia, PA; Pittsburgh, PA; PeeDee Region, SC; and, Washington, DC.

In its administration of the MCH Services Block Grant, the MCHB places special emphasis on improving service delivery
to women and children from culturally identifiable populations who have been disproportionately affected by barriers
to care. This means that FY 1994 MCH CISS/HVAF projects are expected to involve members of ethno-culturally distinct
groups in planning activities, unless there are compelling programmatic or other justifications for not doing so.


Projects funded under the MCH CISS Set-Aside Program are selected and administered under the same procedures and
practices as are currently in effect for the MCH Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS)
set-aside activities. The regulation implementing the MCH SPRANS Set-Aside Program was published in the March 5,
1986, issue of the 

Federal Register

 at 51 FR 7726 (42 CFR Part 51a). 



Availability of Funds 



$2.5 million is available under the MCH CISS Set-Aside Program to support approximately 50 HVAF projects, not exceeding
$50,000 per award for a one year budget period. Awards will be made for project periods of one year. Applicants are advised
that support for implementation of planning components developed under this program will not be available through
the MCH CISS Set-Aside Program after FY 1994. 



Eligible Applicants 



Eligibility for funding is limited to a single application from each State. State Maternal and Child Health (MCH)
and Child Welfare (CW) agencies must either act as co-applicants or collaborate in the identification of the applicant.
Each CISS/HVAF grant award in FY 1994 is contingent upon a funded Family Preservation and Support Services program.
Well defined roles for the State MCH and Title IV-B agencies are essential to ensure maximum collaboration and
coordination across the MCH-CW service systems. Projects must promote community/State partnerships. 



Project Review and Funding 



The Department will review applications as competing applications and will fund those which, in the Department's
view, are consistent with the statutory purpose of the CISS set aside program; focus on coordination and collaboration
across the MCH-CW service systems; pay particular attention to involvement of women and persons from culturally
distinct populations; and, address the achievement of applicable Healthy People 2000 objectives in communities
with demonstrated need. 

Final funding decisions for CISS/HVAF grants are the responsibility of the Director, MCHB, and will be carried out
in consultation with the Commissioner, ACYF.

Review Criteria 


Review panels composed mainly of nonfederal members will evaluate applications for awards. Staff from MCHB and ACYF
will also serve on review panels. The following review criteria will be used to review and evaluate CISS/HVAF applications:




_Documentation of joint involvement of State MCH and State Child Welfare agencies in the development of the application
and their intent to work together in developing the health component of the Five-Year FP/FS State Plan including a
time-framed strategy to ensure completion of required tasks. 
_Extent of existing and planned collaborative activities to be conducted in conjunction with any MCH systems initiatives
including the MCH Block Grant, MCH State Systems Development Initiative (SSDI), Community Integrated Service Systems
(CISS) or related Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) and the assurance of mechanisms
to promote collaboration between MCH and CW in developing the State's MCH Services Block Grant application. 
_Extent to which CISS/HVAF applicants will build on existing and planned collaborative initiatives with other agencies
(health, education, mental health, justice) to link and coordinate services for children and families at the community
level. 
_The quality and feasibility of the project plan or methodology and its relation to the project's goals and objectives.

_Level of proposed community input and involvement in design of the plan. 
_Use of requested grant funds to carry out proposed health planning activities.

categories or groups of approved applications in a discretionary 
program, or favorable adjustment of the formula which determines 
the grant award in a formula grant program. 

A funding priority is defined as the favorable adjustment of 
aggregate review scores of individual approved applications when 
applications meet specified criteria in a discretionary program, 
or favorable adjustment of the formula which determines the grant 
award in a formula grant program. 

Special consideration is defined as the enhancement of 
priority scores by merit reviewers based on the extent to which 
applications address special areas of concern in a discretionary 
program, or favorable adjustment of the formula which determines 
the grant award in a formula grant program. 

It is not required that applicants request consideration for 
a funding factor. Applications which do not request 
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full 
consideration for funding.

The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within 60 days from the date of this published
Notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the licenses would not be consistent
with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
Nitric Oxide (NO) has been implicated as an important bioregulatory mediator in a variety of processes including
the normal physiological control of blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation/adhesion, bronchodilation,
neurotransmission, immunologically induced cytostasis and penile erection. National Cancer Institute scientists
have discovered that compounds of the structure X-[N(O)NO]-, which will be designated as ``NONOates'', have the
ability to sustain the release of nitric oxide into a biological medium. Various compounds of this family have been
synthesized and shown to have different kinetics of NO release. Several of these compounds have been tested 

in vitro

 and 

in vivo

 in model systems and have shown potent biological effects. 
Requests for a copy of these patent applications, inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated
license should be directed to: Ms. Carol Lavrich, Office of Technology Transfer, National Institutes of Health,
6011 Executive Blvd., Rockville, MD 20892. Telephone: (301) 496-7735, ext. 287; Facsimile: (301) 402-0220.
A signed confidentiality agreement will be required to receive copies of patent applications. Properly filed competing
applications for a license filed in response to this notice will be treated as objections to the contemplated license.
Only written comments and/or applications for a competing license which are received by the NIH Office of Technology
Transfer within sixty (60) days of this notice will be considered.

 Notice of Availability of Funds and Request for Applications.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) is issuing this announcement for a program to support domestic conferences
for the purpose of coordinating, exchanging, and disseminating information in furtherance of its mission to ensure
the availability of effective treatment and recovery services for individuals who suffer from problems related
to alcohol and other drugs (AOD) of abuse. This program is authorized under Section 507 of the Public Health Service
Act. 


Applications are invited for conferences relating to AOD abuse treatment, including conferences for the purposes
of information dissemination to the services community and the general public, and development of strategies for
improving substance abuse treatment. The intended audiences for this announcement are principally consumer and
treatment services-oriented constituency groups, including those representing State and local government, professional
associations, voluntary organizations, and self-help groups that share a mutual interest with CSAT with respect
to community consensus building, leadership, and advocacy of goals relating to AOD abuse treatment. 
This notice consists of three parts: 


Part I

 covers information on the legislative authority and the applicable regulations and policies related to the Substance
Abuse Treatment Conference Grants program. 


Part II

 includes the programmatic description and activities and discusses eligibility, availability of funds, period
of support and the receipt dates for applications. 


Part III

 describes special requirements of the program, the application process, the review and award criteria and lists
contacts for additional information. 


Part I_Legislative Authority and Other Applicable Regulations and Policies 


Grants awarded under this announcement are authorized under Section 507(b)(6) of the Public Health Service Act,
as amended (42 U.S.C. 290bb). 
Federal regulations at Title 45 CFR Parts 74 and 92, generic requirements concerning the administration of grants,
are applicable to these awards. 
Grants must be administered in accordance with the 

PHS Grants Policy Statement 

(Revised April 1, 1994). 
The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for this program is 93.218. 
As required by the ``PHS Grants Policy Statement,'' grantees are responsible for submitting an original and two (2)
copies of the final report to the Grants Management Office, CSAT, within 90 days of completion or termination of a grant
in support of a conference. 
Consistent with CSAT policy and in view of the addictive properties of nicotine and the established link between use
of tobacco products and disease, the use of smoke-free conference meeting rooms is encouraged. 
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national public health initiative. This Program Announcement, Substance Abuse
Treatment Conference Grants, is related to the priority areas of addictions as articulated in the National Drug Control
Strategy (e.g., women and their children, hard core abusers, relationship between alcohol/drug abuse and violence,
service needs/delivery within the criminal justice system, comorbidity or the provision of mental health services
as part of addictions treatment, health care reform). Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000
(Full Report: Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report: Stock No. 017-001-00473-1)

Part II_Programmatic Description and Activities, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date 




Program Description:

 CSAT will provide support for up to fifty percent (to a maximum of $50,000) of the total costs of planned meetings and
conferences sponsored by new or ongoing constituent organizations or coalitions in their efforts to provide treatment
for drugs of abuse. In making award decisions, CSAT will give special consideration to applications that demonstrate
the potential for knowledge dissemination, interface with health promotion concepts and practices, promote appropriate
resource utilization and/or consensus building, and yield a product (report or document) of specific relevance
to furthering of the CSAT mission of improved delivery of addiction treatment and recovery services at the State or
community level. 
For the purposes of this grant program, a Conference is a symposium, workshop, or any other organized and formal meeting
lasting one or more days where persons assemble to exchange information and address information or strategy development
needs in such areas as sharing new technologies, problem-solving, network-building or public policy deliberations.
While a conference may result in educational experiences, this is not a program to impart training. The conference
program should be consistent with the CSAT mission. Under the authority of Section 507, CSAT may sponsor regional
workshops on improving the quality and availability of treatment services; however, sponsors of regional workshops
may invite people from other regions in the country. The conference may be conducted at more than one site, provided
that each separate workshop, meeting, etc., relates directly to the central conference topic.
Conferences supported by this program are not intended to carry out research or to synthesize or disseminate research
information for the non-clinical scientific research community. However, transmitting scientific information
via the conference to those involved in AOD related services or in training to provide AOD services is supportable.

This program addresses the HHS Secretary's themes of fostering independence through empowering the people served,
preventing future problems, and improving services to customers through modern management approaches.





Eligibility:

 Applications may be submitted by public and non-profit private entities. An individual is not eligible to receive
grant support for a conference. 


Availability of Funds:

 It is estimated that approximately $400,000 will be available to support approximately eight (8) awards under this
program in FY 1995. Actual funding levels will depend upon the availability of appropriated funds.
Approved awards will be limited to a maximum of fifty percent of the total costs or $50,000, whichever is less.


Period of Support:

 Awards will be made for a maximum of 12 months. Support for only one conference, as defined above, may be requested in
any single application. 


Application Receipt and Review Schedule:

 The first receipt date for applications is October 24, 1994. Thereafter, the schedule for receipt and review of applications
under this announcement will be as follows:



 

Applications must be received by the above receipt date(s) to be accepted for review. An application received after
the deadline may be acceptable if it carries a legible proof-of-mailing date assigned by the carrier (private metered
postmarks are not acceptable as proof of timely mailing) and that date is not later than one week prior to the deadline
date. If the receipt date falls on a weekend, it will be extended to Monday; if the date falls on a holiday, it will be extended
to the following work day. 


Consequences of Late Submission:

 Applications received after the specified receipt dates are subject to assignment to the next review cycle or may
be returned to the applicant without review.

of a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). The purpose of the PEIS is to assess the relative risks associated
with alternative hatchery operating scenarios and to identify opportunity for maintaining biological diversity,
promoting the integrated operation of Columbia River anadromous fish hatcheries, minimizing risks to long-term
fitness of stocks, fulfilling Federal treaty trust responsibilities to Native Americans, accomplishing mitigation
obligations to provide for other fisheries, and protecting and recovering fish stocks listed under the Endangered
Species Act.



This notice is being furnished pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing The
Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Regulations (40 CFR 1508.22).
To satisfy Federal environmental policy requirements, the USFWS, NMFS, and BPA are conducting a joint scoping process
for the preparation of the PEIS. Interested agencies, organizations, and individuals are encouraged to provide
written comments of the issues which should be addressed in the PEIS.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

USFWS, NMFS, and BPA need a better understanding of the cumulative effects of the interaction between anadromous
fish produced under current fish hatchery programs and naturally spawning salmon and steelhead in the Columbia River
Basin.





The need for a comprehensive analysis has arisen because:
 There are approximately 90 Federally operated and/or funded anadromous fish hatcheries in the Columbia River
system and more facilities are planned.
 Most of these hatcheries and facilities were designed and constructed to augment the naturally spawning salmon
and steelhead runs that were severely depleted by Federally funded or licensed water development throughout the
Columbia River Basin.

 The augmentation was intended to mitigate for fisheries losses experienced by non-Indian sport and commercial
fisheries as well as to meet treaty trust responsibilities to Native Americans.

<TEXT>
 

 Since construction, and although original objectives remain unmet, the scope of this hatchery system's obligations
has been substantially expanded to meet: 

(1) Protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species.

(2) Production obligations incurred under the auspices of the U.S./Canada negotiations.

(3) The court approved Columbia River Salmon and Steelhead Management Framework Plan. 

 Regional human population growth has increased demands for consumptive use of salmon at a time when natural
production habitat conditions such as instream flow, spawning gravels, streamside vegetation, etc. are at an all
time low. 

 Public pressure on Federal agencies has increased to meet all of these demands while insuring minimal risk
to the genetic integrity of naturally spawning populations.

In the proposed PEIS, an array of alternatives with a range of artificial vs. natural production strategies will be
evaluated pursuant to NEPA. As envisioned, this document will serve as a foundation for planning at the hatchery level
and site-specific environmental analysis may be tiered off of this document. 

Any proposed Federal actions evolving from this evaluation may or may not be a departure from current fish hatchery
operating programs.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Plan Amendment</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

This notice of intent is to advise the public that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) intends to consider a proposal
which would require amending an existing planning document.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The BLM is proposing to amend the Warm Springs Resource Management Plan, which includes BLM-administered lands in
Millard County, Utah. The purpose of the amendment would be to identify certain lands as suitable for transfer to the
State of Utah, through State indemnity selection, for agricultural purposes.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The lands identified for transfer comprise 200 acres in Millard County described as follows: T. 21 S., R. 19 W., Sec.
29, W1/2SW1/4, E1/2SE1/4, SW1/4SE1/4, Salt Lake Meridian, Utah. The existing plan does not identify these lands
for disposal. However, the State of Utah filed a State indemnity selection application, UTU-71695, to have
200 acres of Federally owned land and interest in land transferred to the State of Utah pursuant to sections 2275 and
2276 of the Revised Statutes, as amended, (43 U.S.C. 851-852). Satisfaction of indemnity selection rights
and disposal of parcels for that purpose are considered as ``serving the national interest'' in the context of Section
102(a)(1) of the 

Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 

(FLPMA) and in connection with land use planning. Therefore, this proposal appears to have merit and will be considered
through the plan amendment process.

</AGENCY>
<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Notice of intent to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement and announcement of a period during which
written comments regarding the scope of the environmental impact statement (EIS) analysis will be received.







</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) intends to prepare a supplemental
EIS to the 1990 Bureau of Land Management EIS that will update the identified impacts and analyze and new probable impacts
of mining at the Proposed Fence Lake Mine, Cibola and Catron Counties, New Mexico and Apache County, Arizona. As required
by the New Mexico State Program, Salt River Project (SRP) has submitted an administratively complete permit application
for the proposed surface coal mine. The permit application contains life-of-mine information that the Department
of the Interior will use to evaluate alternative actions in the EIS and will assist the Department in making decisions
on the surface coal mining operation northwest of Quemado, New Mexico and in the State of Arizona. OSM requests that
other agencies and the public submit written comments or statements to it concerning the scope of the EIS analysis.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

SRP's proposed Fence Lake Mine consists of Federal, State and private coal leases situated on approximately 18,000
acres northwest of Quemado, New Mexico. The Federal Coal Leases Nos. are NMNM 78371 and NMNM 86717. The proposed mine
would remove approximately 80 million tons of coal, by surface methods, over the 47 year life-of-mine. Approximately
1.8 million tons of coal would be removed per year through year 28 with about 3 million tons of coal per year being removed
from year 29 through year 40. The project described in the application also includes a proposed 45-mile railroad spur
that would be constructed west from the mine to supply coal to the existing Coronado Generating Station, located approximately
6 miles from St. Johns, Arizona.



OSM will prepare the supplemental EIS, which will evaluate alternative actions that the Department could take on
Federal decisions related to this project. In accordance with the New Mexico State Program the New Mexico Mining and
Minerals Department must take permitting actions on the proposed surface coal mining operation within the State
of New Mexico. The major alternative actions thus far identified for consideration are approval of the mining plan
and permit application with such conditions, if any, as would be necessary to assure it compliance with requirements
of the Surface mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, its implementing regulations, and other Federal laws;
disapproval of the mining plan and permit application; and no action. Other alternative actions may be identified
based on comments received by OSM regarding the scope of the supplemental EIS analysis.

OSM is requesting that any interested party submit written comments or statements regarding the scope of the supplemental
EIS. Comments/statements regarding the scope of the supplemental EIS. Comments/statements received by OSM will
assist that agency in gathering information and further defining existing issues or identifying new issues or concerns
that the supplemental EIS should address. Public meetings will be held in the vicinity of the proposed Fence Lake surface
coal mining operation to allow presentation of oral comments and statements prior to the closing of the scoping comment
period. Actual times and locations of these meetings will be announced in local newspapers at a later date.

James H. Brown, M.D.; Revocation of Registration



On May 26, 1989, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to James H. Brown, M.D. (Respondent), of New Orleans, Louisiana, proposing to
revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration, AB3370967, and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration.
The statutory basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Brown's continued registration would be inconsistent
with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f).

Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause. Following prehearing
procedures, a hearing was held in New Orleans, Louisiana, on March 31 and April 1, 1993. On January 25, 1994, in her findings
of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's
DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked.

On February 11, 1994, Respondent filed exceptions to Judge Bittner's recommended ruling pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.66,
and on February 28, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the then-Acting Administrator.
The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67,
hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.

The administrative law judge found that the Respondent is a psychiatrist who graduated from medical school in 1947.
Respondent, as of the date of the hearing, maintained a private practice as a psychiatrist in New Orleans, Louisiana.

The administrative law judge found that in November or December 1986, an informant told DEA that Respondent issued
prescriptions for controlled substances in exchange for money. Consequently, on several occasions between December
3, 1986 and February 26, 1987, the informant and an undercover police officer purchased controlled substance prescriptions
from Respondent for no legitimate medical reason.

During the first visit on December 3, 1986, the informant advised the Respondent that she wanted to purchase Valium,
a Schedule IV controlled substance, to use with her boyfriend. The informant did not provide the Respondent with any
medical problem or condition, and paid the Respondent $80.00 in exchange for a prescription for 60 dosage units of
Valium.

During the second visit on December 12, 1986, the informant told the Respondent that her boyfriend had swapped some
of the Valium Respondent had prescribed for Seconal, a Schedule II controlled substance. The informant then asked
for some Seconal, telling Respondent that she and her friends liked to use the drug. The Respondent issued a prescription
for 30 Seconal in exchange for $80, and told the informant to destroy the pill bottle.

On January 8, 1987, an undercover police officer accompanied the informant to Respondent's office, posing as her
boyfriend. The Respondent wrote both the undercover officer and the informant prescriptions for 30 Seconal in exchange
for $160. The officer testified at the hearing that Respondent did not perform any physical examination on either
of them, nor was there any discussion of any medical problems.

On February 10, 1987, the informant returned alone to Respondent's office. Respondent issued two prescriptions,
one in the informant's name, and one in the name of the undercover officer. Each prescription was for 30 Seconal and
informant paid the Respondent $160. On February 26, 1987, the undercover officer went to Respondent's office alone,and
received two prescriptions for Seconal, in exchange for $160, again with one prescription in the name of the undercover
officer and the other in the informant's name.

On August 3, 1987, a search warrant was executed at Respondent's office which revealed handwritten notes regarding
the informant and the undercover officer in a file, and prescription bottles of various controlled substances which
bore the names of other physicians. Respondent stated that the bottles were brought in by patients who no longer used
those drugs, and that he dispensed them to other patients as needed. Respondent did not maintain an inventory of the
drugs nor did he know the expiration dates of the medication. Respondent testified at the hearing that patients sometimes
gave him medications they they had been prescribed by other physicians, and that he sometimes gave small quantities
of these drugs to other patients as a trial before issuing prescriptions for the patients.

On July 30, 1987, Respondent was indicted by the grand jury of the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Louisiana on eight felony counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 841 for issuing prescriptions for controlled substances
to the informant and the officer. On September 15, 1987, a superseding information was filed charging Respondent
with one misdemeanor count of violating 18 U.S.C. 2 and 21 U.S.C. 844 by aiding and abetting the possession of Valium
that was not dispensed in the normal course of professional practice or for a legitimate medical purpose. On September
17, 1987, Respondent pled guilty to the misdemeanor count, and the indictment was dismissed. On November 20, 1987,
Respondent was placed on two years active probation, ordered to perform 250 hours of community service, fined $25,000,
and ordered to pay a special assessment of $25. On March 29, 1988, the court denied Respondent's motion for reduction
of sentence. 

On November 12, 1987, Respondent surrendered his DEA registration with respect to Schedule II controlled substances.
Respondent testified that he was initially asked to surrender his registration in all schedules, but refused, believing
that he was to retain his Schedule III through V privileges as part of the plea agreement, and that when he was later issued
a registration in Schedules III through V, he understood it to be pursuant to the plea agreement. The administrative
law judge found that the plea agreement specified that Respondent would surrender his DEA registration in Schedule
II, did not refer to Schedules III through V, and explicitly stated that ``no other promise has been made or implied
by or for either the [Respondent] or the [United States Attorney's Office]''.

On March 5, 1993, Respondent filed a Motion to Enforce Plea Agreement in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Louisiana, alleging that he agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and to surrender his DEA registration
in Schedules I and II in return for the Government's agreement to dismiss the indictment and forego forfeiture and
administrative revocation proceedings. On March 10, 1993, the court denied Respondent's motion on grounds that
the plea agreement was not ambiguous but, rather, silent as to Respondent's Schedule III through V privileges, and
that if it had been the intention of the parties to preclude DEA from proceeding against Respondent's registration
in those schedules, it could have been indicated in the plea agreement.

The administrative law judge found that on July 22, and November 18, 1988, the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board) conducted a hearing on charges that Respondent's prescribing to the informant and the officer violated the
Louisiana Medical Practice Act. On December 9, 1988, the Board issued a decision in which it found that Respondent's
prescribing was for an illegitimate purpose motivated by financial gain. However, based on its finding that Respondent's
activity was unlikely to recur in the future, the Board suspended Respondent's medical license for two years, stayed
all but four months of the suspension and imposed terms of probation, including that Respondent not handle any controlled
substances, that he obtain at least 50 hours of continuing medical education per year, and that he pay a fine of $5,000.

On December 19, 1988, Respondent filed an Application for Rehearing, which was denied by the Board on January 5, 1989.
Respondent then filed a request in state court for reversal of the Board's order or a remind for further proceedings.
Following an evidentiary hearing, on April 29, 1991, the court remanded the case to the Board for issuance of a new decision.
On June 20, 1991, the Board issued another decision making the same findings and imposing the same sanctions as the
initial decision. Respondent again appealed to the court, which stayed the Board's order. The stay was still in effect
as of the date of the hearing in this matter. 

Respondent admitted at the administrative hearing that he was ``lax'' with respect to his prescribing to the informant
and the officer. Respondent also testified that the individuals paid him for their office visits, not for the prescriptions,
and that the informant told him that she was nervous and had headaches. However, Respondent later acknowledged that
the informant denied having headaches or tension, and that Seconal is not prescribed for headaches. Respondent testified
that he believed that the informant and the undercover officer manipulated him. The Respondent further testified
that the loss of his DEA registration would make it difficult to treat his patients, and to his willingness to cooperate
with DEA in verifying compliance with the rules and regulations surrounding a DEA registration.

Respondent presented the testimony of several witnesses as to his professional competence and concern for his patients.
Included among these witnesses was a patient of Respondent, two psychiatrists, Respondent's brother, two of his
sons, as well as his daughter-in-law. The witnesses testified to Respondent's exemplary character and his exceptional
abilities as a medical provider; to the devastating impact of the criminal and disciplinary proceedings upon the
Respondent; and to the unlikelihood that Respondent would abuse his controlled substance privileges in the future.
However, the administrative law judge accorded little weight to their testimony since the witnesses did not appear
to be fully apprised of the extent of Respondent's misconduct.

Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4) the Deputy Administrator may revoke a registration and deny any application
for such registration, if he determines that the continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.
In determining the public interest, the following factors are considered.

(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.

(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing controlled substances.

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the distribution, or dispensing of
controlled substances.

(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.

It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Administrator may properly
rely on any one or a combination of the factors and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. 

See Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D., 

Docket No. 88-42, 54 FR 16422 (1989).

In considering whether grounds exist to revoke Respondent's DEA registration, the administrative law judge found
factors one through four relevant in light of the evidence regarding the prescriptions Respondent issued to the informant
and undercover police officer; his transfer of controlled substances among patients; the action taken by the Board;
and Respondent's subsequent conviction.

The administrative law judge found that the informant obtained Valium from the Respondent on her first visit to him,
although she presented no medical condition warranting the prescription. The administrative law judge also found
that on the next visit, the informant told Respondent that her boyfriend swapped some of the previously prescribed
Valium for Seconal; Respondent warned the informant that she should not use the drug ``just to get high''; and the informant
did not indicate any medical need for controlled substances. Nonetheless, Respondent gave the informant a prescription
for Seconal. In addition, Respondent issued prescriptions for Seconal for the informant and the undercover officer
when they visited him together; when the informant later visited Respondent by herself; and when the officer subsequently
visited Respondent by himself.
The administrative law judge found that the Respondent took no medical history and conducted no physical examinations
during any of the visits, and that neither of the individuals demonstrated a medical need for the prescriptions they
received. Therefore, the administrative law judge found that Respondent's prescriptions to the informant and the
officer were not issued for a legitimate medical purpose.

The administrative law judge further found that although Respondent conceded that he was ``lax'' in his prescribing
of controlled substances, he has not acknowledged that he abused the privileges he held as a DEA registrant, and that
under the circumstances, little credence should be placed upon Respondent's testimony that he will be more careful
in the future if permitted to retain his DEA registration in Schedules III through V. Therefore, Judge Bittner concluded
that Respondent's continued registration would not be consistent with the public interest, and recommended that
Respondent's DEA registration be revoked and that any pending applications be denied. The Respondent filed exceptions
to the administrative law judge's recommendation incorporating the arguments in his post-hearing brief filed on
July 17, 1993.

The Deputy Administrator having considered the entire record adopts the administrative law judge's findings of
fact, conclusion of law, and recommended ruling in its entirety. The Deputy Administrator considered the arguments
made by Respondent in his exceptions to the extent already considered by the administrative law judge in rendering
her recommendation and adopted herein.

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
AB3370967, issued to James H. Brown, M.D., be and it hereby is, revoked, and any pending applications be, and they hereby
are, denied. This order is effective August 24, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Roland W. Jones III, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>


On August 25, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Roland W. Jones, III, M.D. (Respondent), of Orange, Texas.
The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Jones' DEA Certificate of Registration, AJ1690406, and deny any pending
applications for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent was not currently
authorized to handle controlled substances in the State of Texas and that Respondent's continued registration would
be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).
The Order to Show Cause alleged that on November 9, 1990, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) placed
Respondent's license to practice medicine on ten years probation with several terms and conditions. The Board found
that Respondent engaged in the intemperate use of alcohol, that he had been disciplined by a hospital, and that he failed
to keep accurate records of purchases and disposals of controlled substances.
The Order to Show Cause further alleged that based upon Respondent's failure to follow the terms and conditions of
the November 9, 1990 probation order, effective August 20, 1992, the Board suspended Respondent's state license
to practice medicine. In addition, effective June 26, 1992, the Texas Department of Public Safety canceled Respondent's
state registration to handle controlled substances. As a result, Respondent is no longer authorized by state law
to handle controlled substances.
Respondent filed a request for a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was docketed
before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On January 24, 1994, the Government filed a motion for summary
disposition, which was accompanied by a copy of the Texas Department of Public Safety Certification of Non-Registration.
Respondent did not file a response to the Government's motion.
On February 28, 1994, in her opinion and recommended decision, the administrative law judge found that the Respondent
did not deny that his state license to practice medicine has been suspended or that his state registration to handle
controlled substances has been canceled. The administrative law judge therefore, granted the Government's motion
for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked.
On March 30, 1994, The administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator
has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final
order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.
The Deputy Administrator adopts the opinion and recommended decision of the administrative law judge in its entirety.
The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly
authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f)
and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld.

Elliott Monroe, M.D.,

Bobby Watts, M.D.,

 53 FR 11919 (1988).
The administrative law judge properly granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. It is well-settled
that when no question of fact is involved, or when the facts are agreed upon, a plenary, adversary administrative proceeding
involving evidence and cross-examination of witnesses is not obligatory. The rationale is that Congress does not
intend administrative agencies to perform meaningless tasks.

Since Respondent is not currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the State of Texas, it is not necessary
to reach a conclusion regarding whether his continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest.

in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,

for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 24, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Boitshoko P. Marang, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>


On December 10, 1993, the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show
Cause and Immediate Suspension of Registration to Boitshoko P. Marang, M.D. (Respondent). The Order to Show Cause
proposed to revoke DEA Certificate of Registration, BM1482506, and deny any pending applications for renewal of
such registration. The grounds for the issuance of the Order to Show Cause were that the State of Michigan had revoked
Respondent's license to practice medicine and that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the public
interest. Additionally, citing his preliminary finding that Respondent's continued registration posed an imminent
danger to the public health and safety, the Acting Administrator ordered the immediate suspension of Respondent's
registration pending the outcome of these proceedings. 21 U.S.C. 824(d).
On December 10, 1993, the Order to Show Cause and Immediate Suspension of Registration was personally served on Respondent
at the Wayne County Jail, 570 Clinton Street, Detroit, Michigan. By letter dated January 9, 1994, Respondent requested
a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause. The matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge
Paul A. Tenney. 
On February 15, 1994, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition. A copy of the motion was forwarded to Respondent
at the address he provided in his request for a hearing, the Wayne County Jail.
The envelope which contained the Government's motion for summary disposition was returned to the Government with
the notation ``addressee unknown.'' Government counsel verified that the Respondent remained an inmate in the Wayne
County Jail and on March 14, 1994, again forwarded a copy of the Government's motion.
On February 16, 1994, the administrative law judge attempted to serve Respondent with an order which allowed Respondent
14 days in which to respond to the Government's motion for summary disposition. The envelope was returned, marked,
``addressee unknown.'' On April 7, 1994, the administrative law judge forwarded a second order to Respondent, by
certified mail. Respondent failed to file a response to the order.
By order dated April 25, 1994, the administrative law judge found that Respondent waived his opportunity for a hearing,
and recommended that a final order be entered under 21 CFR 1301.57. Alternatively, the administrative law judge granted
the Government's motion for summary disposition. Neither party filed exceptions to the administrative law judge's
order and on May 23, 1994, the record was transmitted to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator concludes
that Respondent has waived his opportunity for a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause and, pursuant
to 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57, enters this final order based upon the record as it now appears.
The Deputy Administrator finds that an administrative complaint had been filed with the Michigan Board of Medicine
(``the Board'') against the Respondent. After careful consideration of the documents filed in that cause, the Board
concluded that the continued licensure of Respondent constitutes a threat to the public health, safety and welfare
requiring emergency action. Therefore, on December 1, 1993, the Board summarily suspended Respondent's license
to practice medicine. Consequently, Respondent is not currently authorized to handle controlled substances in
the State of Michigan.
The DEA does not have the Statutory authority under the Controlled Substances Act to issue or maintain a registration
if the applicant or registrant is without state authority to handle controlled substances. See 21 U.S.C. 802(21),
823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. 

See Roy E. Hardman, M.D., 

57 FR 49195 (1992) (noting that ``Michigan law provides that a suspension of an individual's medical license shall
result in the nullification of the individual's authority to handle controlled substances''); 

see also, Myong S. Yi, M.D., 

54 FR 30618 (1989); 

DePietro's Pharmacy, 

54 FR 22499 (1989); 

Bobby Watts, M.D., 

53 FR 11919 (1988); and cases cited therein. 
Since there is no dispute about Respondent's lack of authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Michigan,
the administrative law judge properly granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. When no question
of fact is involved, or when the facts are agreed upon, a plenary, adversarial administrative proceeding with the
full panoply of due process rights is not obligatory. 

See Philip E. Kirk, M.D., 

48 FR 32887 (1983), 

aff'd sub nom Kirk v. Mullen, 

749 F.2d 297 (6th Cir. 1984); 

United States v. Consolidated Mines and Smelting Company, Ltd., 

455 F.2d 432, 453 (9th Cir. 1971).
Having considered the facts and circumstances in this matter, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Dr. Marang's
DEA Certificate of Registration should be revoked due to his lack of authorization to handle controlled substances
in the State of Michigan. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant
to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100) (b) and 0.104 [59 FR 23637], hereby orders that
DEA Certificate of Registration, BM1482506, previously issued to Boitshoko P. Marang, M.D., be, and it hereby is,
revoked. The Deputy Administrator further orders that any pending applications for the renewal of such registration,
be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective July 25, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Harold S. Stinson, D.O.; Grant of Restricted Registration</DOCTITLE>



On August 18, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Harold S. Stinson, D.O. (Respondent), of Key Largo, Florida, proposing to deny
his pending application for registration as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f) for reason that his registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4).

Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was
docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held
in Miami, Florida on March 11, 1993. On January 25, 1994, in her opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions
of law, and decision, the administrative law judge recommended that the Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate
of Registration be granted, subject to certain restrictions. No exceptions were filed by either party. The Deputy
Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues
his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.

The administrative law judge found that the Respondent received his doctor of osteopathy degree from Kirksville
College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1957 and following a one-year internship, went into practice with another physician
in Eureka, Missouri. Five years later, Respondent established a solo practice which he maintained until about 1985,
and was board certified in family practice in 1974.

On May 2, 1985, a DEA Special Agent along with local police officers, arrested an individual on an outstanding warrant
following her indictment for forging prescriptions for Dilaudid, a Schedule II controlled substance. The individual
later informed the Special Agent that between 1979 and 1982, she purchased Dilaudid from the Respondent approximately
50 times; that between 150 and 200 people received drugs illegally from the Respondent; and that she owed Respondent
$2,000 for the drugs that she had purchased.

Following her arrest, the individual agreed to attempt to make a controlled purchase of Dilaudid from the Respondent.
On June 7, 1985, the individual attempted without success to purchase Dilaudid from the Respondent. During the visit,
the individual offered to pay Respondent $500 on her outstanding debt, however, Respondent indicated that he did
not want to have any further dealings with the individual. Nevertheless, he agreed to meet with her at a future date,
and the individual assured the Respondent that she would pay back the $2,000 debt that she owed him in installments.

On June 15, 1985, the individual met with Respondent in his car at a restaurant, where Respondent sold the individual
100 Dilaudid for $2,000. The individual also paid the Respondent an additional $1,000 as payment on her prior debt.
During the meeting, Respondent admitted to the individual that after being audited with respect to his dispensing
of Dilaudid, he was able to falsify his dispensing records because one of his patients failed to keep records of how
much Dilaudid she received or purchased from Respondent, and therefore, Respondent could ascribe drugs to her that
he in fact provided to others.

On June 17, 1985, the individual met Respondent at his office where she purchased 100 Dilaudid for $2,000, and paid
the final $1,000 of her debt. During this meeting, the individual informed the Respondent of a friend from Philadelphia
that could help make the Respondent's drug transactions more profitable. On August 2, 1985, the individual again
met the Respondent at a restaurant where she purchased 80 Dilaudid for $2,000. The individual again mentioned her
friend from Philadelphia, and Respondent agreed to contact the individual the following week.

On August 27, 1985, the individual and a DEA Special Agent, posing as her friend from Philadelphia, purchased 98 Dilaudid
from the Respondent for $2,940. During the conversation, Respondent mentioned that police officers had come to his
house in response to a burglary alarm and had seen a military rifle equipped with a silencer.

In September 1985 a search warrant was executed at Respondent's office, in which his records were seized, as well as,
a silencer in a desk drawer. On January 23, 1986, the Respondent was indicted in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Missouri on four counts of unlawful distribution of Dilaudid, three counts of making false
statements on Federal income tax returns, and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. Following a jury trial,
Respondent was convicted of the counts pertaining to distribution of Dilaudid and possession of an illegal firearm,
and was acquitted on the tax counts. On October 3, 1986, Respondent was sentenced to six years incarceration on each
of the drug charges to run concurrently, and two years on the firearm charge to run consecutively, for a total of eight
years. Respondent was further sentenced to serve a special parole term of five years and to pay a $40,000 fine, and two
of his vehicles were forfeited. On December 9, 1986, Respondent surrendered his DEA registration.

At the hearing, Respondent presented the testimony of witnesses as to his exemplary abilities as a physician and his
favorable reputation in the community. Several witnesses, and numerous written statements filed on Respondent's
behalf, also spoke of his successful efforts towards rehabilitation. Included among this evidence was a letter dated
September 25, 1992, from the Assistant Attorney General of the State of Florida and counsel to the Florida Board of
Osteopathic Medicine (Board), advising that Respondent had complied with the terms of his probation and the Board
did not oppose his application for DEA registration.

The Respondent testified regarding his accomplishments while incarcerated, including: his organizing of smoking
cessation clinics for inmates; his conducting counseling and lecture sessions on health related issues for inmates,
as well as, a continuing education program for incarcerated health professionals; and his becoming versed in Spanish
for the purpose of becoming a medical missionary in Spanish-speaking areas. The Respondent further testified that
in May 1989, he was released to a halfway house where he wrote a column on travel medicine for a hunting and fishing magazine.
On October 20, 1992, the director of the halfway house wrote to DEA recommending that Respondent be granted DEA registration
in light of his satisfactory rehabilitation.

Respondent also presented the testimony of an attorney specializing in post-conviction issues, who testified that
he represented the Respondent at the sentencing phase of the criminal proceeding, as well as, before the Parole Commission,
and that Respondent was granted parole after serving forty months of his eight-year sentence. The witness testified
that the silencer conviction resulted in imposition of a special parole term, but that he successfully sought early
termination of Respondent's special parole term in light of Respondent's exemplary conduct while incarcerated.
The witness further testified that the institution recommended early termination of Respondent's special parole
and that the reduction of four years in a five year term was highly unusual.

Prior to, and after moving to the State of Florida in the fall of 1990, Respondent took continuing education courses,
including a course in prescribing controlled substances, and on March 26 and 27, 1991, Respondent took the State's
examination to practice medicine and passed. On June 22, 1991, the Board approved the Respondent for licensure subject
to a two-year probation, with terms including: that if and when Respondent obtained a DEA registration, he write Schedule
II controlled substances prescriptions in triplicate; that he practice only under the indirect supervision of another
physician; and that the monitoring physician file semi-annual reports with the Board regarding the level of care
provided by the Respondent.

In late 1991, Respondent was hired as the only full-time medical professional at a clinic in Cutler Ridge, a low income
area of South Miami. The president and chief executive officer of the clinic testified at the hearing that Respondent
told him about his history and lack of DEA registration, and that Respondent was very professional in treating mostly
welfare patients.

The witness further testified that when the Cutler Ridge clinic building collapsed during Hurricane Andrew in August
1992, and reopened in a trailer in late September 1992, Respondent continued to see 40 to 50 patients per day despite
difficult operating conditions. Another witness testified at the hearing that after the hurricane and prior to the
reopening of the clinic, Respondent worked as a volunteer at the South Miami Hospital in Homestead, Florida, where
he provided good medical care despite handling an increased patient load and working long hours.
The Respondent testified, as did witnesses on his behalf, that he needed a DEA registration in order to obtain hospital
privileges; that the lack of a controlled substances registration would adversely impact upon Respondent's ability
to care for his patients; and that Respondent's ability to accept offers of employment at various health care facilities
was contingent upon his obtaining a DEA Certificate of Registration. Respondent testified that his patients that
required controlled substances were required to see another physician, and that the growth of the Cutler Ridge clinic
practice required more patients to be admitted to hospitals, but that he was unable to apply for hospital privileges
without a DEA registration.
Respondent also testified that he did not want to ever again handle Dilaudid and that he would be in favor of such restrictions
on his DEA registration as a prohibition on dispensing, requirements that he use triplicate prescriptions, and a
blanket agreement to inspections at any time. Respondent attributed his misconduct to a mid-life crisis and his lack
of character, and based on his rehabilitative effort as well as the support of his family, such misconduct would not
be repeated.
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), the Deputy Administrator may deny an application for registration, if he determines
that granting the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. In determining the public interest,
the following factors are considered:
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing controlled substances.
(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the distribution, or dispensing of
controlled substances.
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.
(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.
It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one or a combination
of the factors and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. 

See Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D.,

 Docket No. 88-42, 54 FR 16422 (1989).
In considering whether grounds exist to deny Respondent's application for registration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f),
the administrative law judge found factors one through five relevant. Factor one is relevant in light of the September
25, 1992 letter from the counsel to the Board; factor two is applicable in light of Respondent's delivery of Dilaudid
to the individual; factors three and four are relevant in view of Respondent's conviction for unlawfully distributing
controlled substances; and factor five is relevant based upon Respondent's conviction for unlawful possession
of a silencer.
The administrative law judge further found that Respondent's practice of medicine was valuable to the community;
that Respondent needs a DEA registration to fully serve his patients; and that Respondent demonstrated remorse for
his past misconduct. Therefore, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's application for DEA
registration be granted, with the following restrictions: (1) Respondent shall not dispense directly or administer
any controlled substance except in a hospital setting; (2) Respondent shall use triplicate forms for all controlled
substance prescriptions and shall maintain at his registered location one copy of each form and arrange for another
copy to be received by the Special Agent in Charge of DEA's Miami Field Division or his designee; and (3) Respondent
shall consent to inspections of his registered premises pursuant to notices of inspection as described in 21 U.S.
C. 880.
The Deputy Administrator having considered the entire record adopts the administrative law judge's findings of
fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 28 CFR 0.1000(b) and 0.104
(59 FR 23637), hereby orders that the application for DEA registration submitted by Harold S. Stinson, D.O., be granted
in Schedules II through V subject to the restrictions enumerated above. This order is effective July 25, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>GPU Nuclear Corp.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-16 issued to GPU Nuclear Corporation (GPUN, the licensee) for operation of Oyster Creek Nuclear
Generating Station located in Ocean County, New Jersey.

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification Section 2.3.P.(2) safety limit to raise the degraded
voltage setpoint from 3671 volt to 3840 volts, and to revise the allowable setpoint range from 

#

1% to +20V, ^40V.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

By August 24, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Ocean City Library, Reference Department, 101 Washington
Street, Toms River, New Jersey 08753. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above
date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party of the proceedings; (2) the nature
and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number; date petition was mailed;
plant name; and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Ernest L. Blake, Jr., Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, 2300 N Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20037 attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

If a request for a hearing is received, the Commission's staff may issue the amendment after it completes its technical
review and prior to the completion of any required hearing if it publishes a further notice for public comment of its
proposed finding of no significant hazards consideration in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91 and 50.92.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated July 8, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Ocean County Library, Reference Department, 101 Washington

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing
and Trading of Options and Full-Value and Reduced-Value Long-Term Options on the Nikkei Stock Index 300



July 15, 1994.



I. Introduction



On April 19, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of options and long-term options (``LEAPS'')
 based on the Nikkei Stock Index 300 (``Nikkei 300 Index'' or ``Index''), as well as LEAPS based on a reduced-value Index.
On June 28, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.









The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on May 24, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the Exchange's proposal and Amendment
No. 1 thereto.





II. Description of the Proposal



A. General



The CBOE proposes to trade standardized index option contracts based on the Nikkei 300 Index, an index comprised of
300 representative stocks of the first section
 of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (``TSE'').
 The CBOE also proposes to list LEAPS on the full-value Index and LEAPS on a reduced-value Index that will be computed
at one-tenth of the value of the Index. Nikkei 300 Index LEAPS will trade independently of and in addition to regular
Nikkei 300 Index options traded on the Exchange; however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index
LEAPS and regular Index options will be aggregated.
 The Exchange believes that options on the Index, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will provide
investors with a low-cost means of participating in the performance of the Japanese economy and hedging against the
risk of investing in that economy.







B. Composition and Maintenance of the Index



The Nikkei 300 Index was designed by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. (``NKS''). The CBOE represents that Index component
stocks were selected by NKS for their high market capitalizations and their high degree of liquidity, and are representative
of the industrial composition of the broader Japanese equity market. On June 20, 1994, the CBOE formally executed
a licensing agreement with NKS to list options on the Nikkei 300 Index.






As of March 31, 1994, the total capitalization of the Index was US$2.25 trillion.
 Market capitalizations of the individual stocks in the Index ranged from a high of US$76.5 billion to a low of US$875
million, with a median of US$3.3 billion and a mean of US$7.5 billion. In addition, the average daily trading volume
of the stocks in the Index, for the six-month period ending May 31, 1994, ranged from a high of 6,279,901 shares to a low
of 11,525 shares, with a median of approximately 488,000 shares and a mean of approximately 846,000 shares. The highest
weighted component stock in the Index accounts for 3.41 percent of the Index. The five largest Index components account
for approximately 15.14 percent of the Index's value. The lowest weighted component stock comprises 0.04 percent
of the Index, and the five smallest Index components account for approximately 0.20 percent of the Index's value.





The Index is maintained by NKS. To maintain the continuity of the Index, NKS will adjust the Index divisor to reflect
certain events relating to the component stocks. These events include, but are not limited to, changes in the number
of shares outstanding, spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. The CBOE represents
that NKS reviews the composition of the Index periodically.

C. Calculation of the Index



The Nikkei 300 Index is capitalization-weighted and reflects changes in the prices of the Index component securities
relative to the base data of the Index (October 1, 1982). The value of the Index is calculated by multiplying the price
of each component security by the number of shares outstanding of each such security, adding the products, and dividing
by the current Index divisor. The Index divisor is adjusted to reflect certain events relating to the component stocks.
 The Index had a closing value of 303.99 on June 24, 1994.





Because trading does not occur on the TSE during the CBOE's trading hours, the CBOE calculates the Index once each day
based on the most recent official closing price of each Index component security as reported by the TSE. This closing
value will be disseminated throughout the trading day on the CBOE.



D. Contract Specifications



The proposed options on the Nikkei 300 Index will be cash-settled, European-style options.
 The CBOE is proposing to trade options on the Index from 8:00 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. (Chicago Time). The proposed starting
time for Index options is one-half hour earlier than trading in options normally begins at the CBOE. The multiplier
for the Index will be 100. Strike prices on Index options and full-value Index LEAPS will be set to bracket the Index
level at $5.00 intervals. The Exchange intends to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar
months, plus up to three additional calendar months in the March, June, September, December cycle. As described in
more detail below, the Exchange also intends to list Index LEAPS, and LEAPS on a reduced-value Index, that will expire
from 12 to 36 months from the date of the issuance.





Options on the Index (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS) will expire on the Saturday following
the third Friday of the expiration month. The last trading day in an option series normally will be the second to last
business day preceding the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (normally a Thursday). Trading
in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day. The exercise settlement value for all
of the Index's expiring options will be calculated based upon the most recent official closing price of each of the
component securities as reported by the TSE at the close of the regular Friday sessions in Japan (ordinarily at 3:00
p.m. Tokyo time). When expirations are moved in accordance with Exchange holidays, such as when the CBOE is closed
on the Friday before expiration, the last trading day for expiring options will be Wednesday and the exercise settlement
value of expiring Index options will be determined at the close of the regular Thursday trading sessions in Japan,
even if the Japanese markets are open on Friday. If the Japanese markets will be closed on the Friday before expiration
but the CBOE will not be closed, the last trading day for expiring options will be Wednesday and the exercise settlement
value of expiring Index options will be determined at the close of the regular Thursday trading sessions in Japan.



E. Listing of Long-Term Options on the Full-Value or Reduced-Value Index



The Exchange may list series of LEAPS on the Nikkei 300 Index that expires from 12 to 36 months from the date of their issuance
on either the full-value Index or a reduced-value Index computed at one-tenth of the full-value index, subject to
existing Exchange requirements applicable to full-value and reduced-value LEAPS.
 The current and closing values for reduced-value Index LEAPS on the Index will be computed by dividing the value of
the full-value Index by ten and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. For example, a Nikkei
300 Index value of 303.99 would be 30.40 for the reduced-value Index LEAPS, and 303.94 would become 30.39. The reduced-value
Index LEAPS will have a European-style exercise and will be subject to the same rules that govern trading of all of the
Exchange's index options, including sales practices rules, margin requirements, and floor trading procedures.
Strike price intervals for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will be no less than $2.50, instead of $5.00.







F. Position and Exercise Limits, Margin Requirements, and Trading Halts



Position limits for options (including Index LEAPS) on the Nikkei 300 Index will be set at no more than 25,000 contracts
on the same side of the market, provided that no more than 15,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration
month.
 Exercise limits will be set at the same level as position limits.
 For purpose of calculating applicable position and exercise limits, positions in reduced-value options on the Index
will be aggregated with each other and with positions in the full-value Index options.
 Ten reduced-value contracts will equal one full-value contract for purposes of aggregating these positions.

Exchange rules applicable to options on the Index will be identical to the rules applicable to other broad-based index
options for purposes of trading rotations, halts, and suspensions,
 and margin treatment.






G. Surveillance


The Exchange will use the same surveillance procedures currently utilized for each of the Exchange's other index
options to monitor trading in Index options and Index LEAPS. The Exchange currently is pursuing a market surveillance
agreement with the TSE, which agreement the Exchange expects will enable it to better carry out its regulatory responsibilities
with respect to the surveillance of trading in the stocks comprising the Index.





III. Commission Findings and Conclusions


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of options based on the Nikkei 300 Index will serve to protect
investors, promote the public interest, and help to remove impediments to a free and open securities market by providing
investors with a means to hedge exposure to market risk associated with the Japanese equity market and provide a surrogate
instrument for trading in the Japanese securities market.
 The trading of options based on the Nikkei 300 Index should provide investors with a valuable hedging vehicle that
should reflect accurately the overall movement of the Japanese equity market.





In addition, the Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the CBOE has adequately addressed issues
related to customer protection, index design, surveillance, and market impact of Nikkei 300 Index options.


A. Index Design and Structure


The Commission finds that it is appropriate and consistent with the Act to classify the Index as a broad-based index.
Specifically, the Commission believes the Index is broad-based because it reflects a substantial segment of the
Japanese equity market, and, among other things, it contains a large number of stocks that trade in that market. First,
the Index consists of 300 actively-traded stocks traded on the first section of the TSE. Second, the market capitalizations
of the stocks comprising the Index are very large. Specifically, the total capitalization of the Index, as of March
31, 1994, was US$2.25 trillion, with the market capitalization of the individual stocks in the Index ranging from
a high of US$76.5 billion to a low of US$875 million, with a median value of US$3.3 billion and a mean of US$7.5 million.
Third, no one particular stock or group of stocks dominates the Index. Specifically, no single stock comprises more
than 3.41 percent of the Index's total value, and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounts
for 15.14 percent of the Index's value. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is appropriate to classify the Index
as broad-based.
In addition, because none of the Index component stocks are traded in the United States in any form, and the primary
market for component stocks is closed throughout the CBOE's trading day, the Commission believes it is not unreasonable
for the Exchange to decide to begin trading Index options at 8:00 a.m. (Chicago time).


B. Customer Protection


The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Nikkei 300 Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized,
exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that (1) The special
risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks
of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts.
Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized
options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the
protection of investors in Nikkei 300 Index options and full-value and reduced-value Nikkei 300 Index LEAPS.

C. Surveillance



As a general matter, the Commission believes that comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the relevant
foreign and domestic exchanges are important where an index product comprised of foreign securities is to be traded
in the United States. In most cases, in the absence of such a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement, the Commission
believes that it would not be possible to conclude that a derivative product, such as a Nikkei 300 Index option, was
not readily susceptible to manipulation.

Although the CBOE and the TSE do not yet have a written surveillance sharing agreement that covers the trading of Nikkei
300 Index options,
 a number of factors support approval of the proposal at this time. First, while the size of an underlying market is not
determinative of whether a particular derivative product based on that market is readily susceptible to manipulation,
the size of the market for the securities underlying the Nikkei 300 Index makes it less likely that the proposed Index
options are readily susceptible to manipulation.
 In addition, the Commission notes that the TSE is under the regulatory oversight of the Japanese Ministry of Finance
(``MOF''). The MOF has responsibility for both the Japanese securities and derivatives markets. Accordingly, the
Commission believes that the ongoing oversight of the trading activity on the TSE by the MOF will help to ensure that
the trading of Nikkei 300 Index options will be carefully monitored with a view toward preventing unnecessary market
disruptions.






Finally, the Commission and the MOF have concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (``MOU'') that provides a framework
for mutual assistance in investigatory and regulatory matters.
 Moreover, the Commission also has a longstanding working relationship with the MOF on these matters. Based on the
longstanding working relationship between the Commission and the MOF and the existence of the MOU, the Commission
is confident that it and the MOF could acquire information from one another similar to that which would be available
in the event that a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement were executed between the CBOE and the TSE with respect
to transactions in TSE-traded stocks related to Nikkei 300 Index option transactions on the CBOE.







Nevertheless, the Commission continues to believe strongly that a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement
between the TSE and the CBOE covering Nikkei 300 Index options would be an important measure to deter and detect potential
manipulations or other improper or illegal trading involving Nikkei 300 Index options. Accordingly, the Commission
believes it is critical that the TSE and the CBOE continue to work together to consummate a formal comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement to cover Nikkei 300 Index options, and the component securities, as soon as practicable.






D. Market Impact



The Commission believes that the listing and trading on the CBOE of Nikkei 300 Index options, including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will not adversely impact the securities markets in the United States or Japan.
 First, as described above, the Index is broad-based and presently is comprised of 300 stocks with no one stock dominating
the Index. Second, as noted above, the stocks contained in the Index have large capitalizations and are actively-traded.
Third, the proposed position and exercise limits of 25,000 contracts on the same side of the market, provided that
no more than 15,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month, will serve to minimize potential
manipulation and market impact concerns. Lastly, existing CBOE stock index options rules and surveillance procedures
will apply to options on the Index.

E. Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 



The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication on notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Amendment No. 1 reduces the proposed position limits with respect to Nikkei 300 Index options from 50,000 contracts
on the same side of the market to 25,000 contracts (provided that no more than 15,000 contracts, as opposed to 30,000
contracts as originally proposed, are in series in the nearest expiration month). By reducing the position limits,
this amendment will serve to protect investors and the public interest, and further minimize the potential for manipulation.
Further, the proposal containing the higher position limits was published for the full 21-day comment period, and
no comments were received. Therefore, the Commission finds that no new regulatory issues are raised by Amendment
No. 1. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve
Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposal on an accelerated basis. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the foregoing that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications
relating to the foregoing between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filings also will be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-CBOE-94-14, and should be submitted by August 15, 1994. 

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-94-14), as amended, is approved. 

 




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc., Relating to Expanding the Services Provided by Members Registered as ``Stock Services''</DOCTITLE>



July 18, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 1, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change






Currently CBOE Rule 6.77, ``Stock Execution Services,'' states that a stock service is a member registered with the
Exchange for the purpose of providing stock execution services to market makers on the CBOE's floor. The CBOE proposes
to amend CBOE Rule 6.77 to replace ``stock service'' with ``order service firm'' and to allow order service firms to
take market maker orders for the purchase or sale of commodity futures contracts and options thereon and forward the
orders to the appropriate futures exchange. In addition, the CBOE proposes to adopt CBOE Rule 6.78, ``Letters of Guarantee
Required of Order Service Firms,'' which requires an order service firm to have on file with the Exchange and in effect
an Order Service Firm Letter of Guarantee issued for the service firm by a member of the Options Clearing Corporation
(``OCC''). Under proposed CBOE rule 6.78(b), the letter of guarantee must provide that the issuing clearing member
accepts financial responsibility for all orders handled by the order service firm on the CBOE floor and for all financial
obligations of the order service firm to the Exchange. 


The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.




(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposal is to permit members that are registered as ``stock services'' under
CBOE Rule 6.77 to expand the scope of their activity on the floor of the CBOE to encompass order handling services in
connection with commodity interests. Currently CBOE Rule 6.77 provides that a member organization that is registered
with the CBOE as a ``stock service'' may provide stock execution services to market makers on the floor of the Exchange.
 The proposal would revise CBOE Rule 6.77 to permit designated member organizations also to take orders for the purchase
or sale of commodity interests from market makers on the floor of the Exchange and forward such orders to the appropriate
futures exchange. The execution of all orders to purchase or sell commodity interests would occur on a futures exchange
that has been designated as a contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''). To reflect
more accurately the expanded scope of activities permitted under CBOE Rule 6.77, the term ``stock service'' would
be deleted from CBOE Rules 3.1, ``Public Securities Business,'' 6.20, ``Admission to and Conduct on the Trading Floor,''
and 6.77 and replaced with the term ``order service firm.''





The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change will facilitate market making capacity in stock index options. Market
makers in stock index options are subject to the risk that market price will change before they can liquidate their
positions, and hedge this risk by executing transactions in related commodity interests.
 The proposed rule change would facilitate the ability of market makers in stock index options to execute hedging transactions
by providing them with a more efficient means of effecting such transactions.

<TEXT>
 

Order service firms that accept orders to buy or sell commodity interests may be required to comply with certain provisions
of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1974, as amended (``CEA''). For example, Section 4(a)(1) of the CEA generally provides
that transactions in commodity futures contracts may be executed only on a board of trade which has been designated
as a ``contract market'' in the underlying commodity by the CFTC. In addition, Sections 4d and 4k of the CEA generally
provide that any person that is engaged in soliciting or accepting orders for the purchase or sale of commodity interests
must be registered as an introducing broker or as an associated person. The proposed rule change adds section (d) to
CBOE Rule 6.77 to state expressly that to the extent an order service firm accepts and forwards orders for the purchase
or sale of commodity interests, such firms must comply with the CEA and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Additionally, the proposal requires such firms to keep the CBOE's Department of Financial Compliance (``Department'')
apprised of its registration status under the CEA on an ongoing basis, including any financial reporting or capital
requirements. 

In addition to revising CBOE Rule 6.77, the proposed rule change adds CBOE Rule 6.78 to the Exchange's rules. Under
proposed Rule 6.78, any member organization that intends to act as an order service firm must file with the Exchange
a letter of guarantee issued by a member of the OCC. Pursuant to this letter of guarantee, the clearing member must accept
financial responsibility for all orders handled by the order service firm on behalf of Exchange market makers and
all financial obligations of the order service firm to the Exchange. In order to limit the potential risk to any single
clearing member, no clearing member shall be permitted to guarantee more than three order service firms without the
prior written approval of the Department. In considering a request to guarantee more than three such firms, the Department
shall consider the clearing member's level of excess net capital, additional financial resources, and such other
facts as the Department deems appropriate. 

The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it would facilitate the ability of options market makers
for which there are related commodity interests to reduce their exposure to market risk by providing them with a more
efficient means of effecting hedging transactions in such commodity interests. 



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 



The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. 



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days after the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 

(a) by order approve such proposed rule change, or 

(b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by August 15, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change
by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to Pricing Increments and Priority Principles on Combined
Trades</DOCTITLE>



July 18, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder
 notice is hereby given that on November 17, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On July 14, 1994,
the CBOE submitted Amendment No. 1 (``Amendment No. 1'') to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.







I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 6.42 and 6.45 and Interpretations and Policies to Rule 6.42 concerning pricing and
priorities on spread, straddle, and combination orders. The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the
Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The CBO states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is twofold: first, to revise the minimum increments permissible
for bids and offers on spread, straddle, and combination orders and, second, to prescribe the priority principles
to apply to such orders when priced net at a multiple of one sixteenth of a dollar. The CBOE believes that these changes
will facilitate the orderly execution of spread, straddle, and combination orders.

The first change, to Rule 6.42, clarifies the language of the rule and adds a new Interpretation and Policy .02. This
new Interpretation reflects the determination of the CBOE's Floor Procedure Committee that quotes for spreads,
straddles, and combination orders (``combined trades'') may be expressed in any fractional or decimal price, which
will makes it easier for members to price combined trades in relation to the current market. The second change, to paragraph
(d) of Rule 6.45, adjusts the priority principles applicable to combined trades. As revised, a CBOE member holding
an order on a combined trade that is priced net at a multiple of 1/16 (i.e., 1/4, 3/8, 7/16, 1/2, etc.) has priority over
bids and offers in the trading crowd if all legs of the combined trade would trade at a price that is at least equivalent
to quotes in the crowd. Furthermore, the order will also take priority over bids and offers in the customer limit order
book if, in addition to all legs of the combination at least matching quotes in the crowd, at least one leg of the combination
trades at a price that is better than the corresponding bid or offer in the book. Bids or offers that are part of a combined
trade and that are not priced at a net multiple of 1/16, while permissible, will not be entitled to priority under the
exception contained in paragraph (d) to Rule 6.45.

Also under the proposed rule change, special priority principles will apply to stock-option combination orders
that are priced net at a multiple of 1/16. Under this change, a stock-option order, as defined in CBOE Rule 1.1(ii)(a),
that consists of an order to buy or sell a given number of shares of an underlying stock and an opposite side of the market
order to buy or sell an option covering the same number of shares will be considered to be a combined trade for purposes
of priority over bids and offers in the crowd, but not over bids and offers in the book. A stock-option order, as defined
in CBOE Rule 1.1(ii)(b), that consists of an order to buy or sell an underlying stock with the purchase and sale of an
equal number of puts and calls, each having the same exercise price, expiration date and covering the same number of
shares of the underlying stock, each being on the opposite side of the market from the order to buy or sell stock, and
covering in the aggregate twice the number of shares represented by the stock order, will be considered to be a combined
trade and will have priority over orders in the crowd and in the book.

As an illustration, assume that Option A is quoted at 5 bid, 51/8 asked, and option B is quoted at 6 bid, 61/8 asked, and
assume that all four quotes are represented in the book. In that instance, a spread involving the purchase (or sale)
of option A and the sale (or purchase) of option B may trade at a net credit or debit of 1 (e.g., a net credit of 1 if option
A is bought at 5 and option B sold at 6, or a net debit of 1 if option A is sold at 51/8 and option B is bought at 61/8. In this
example, because the net price is a multiple of 1/16 and the execution of the spread involves taking the same side of
the market as the book on only one side of the spread, the spread would receive priority even though it ``touches'' quotes
in the book on both sides. (That is, in the spread consisting of the purchase of option A at 5 and the sale of option B at
6, only the 

purchase

 of option A occurs at the same price and on the same side of the market as the book, which is bid at 5; the 

sale

 of option B at 6 is on the opposite side of the market in the book, which is 

bid

 at 6.) In the same example, it would not be permissible under Rule 6.45(d) to trade the spread at a net debit of 7/8 by selling
the first option at 51/8 and buying the second at 6, because this trade would be executed at the same price and on the same
side of the market as the book on 

both sides

 of the spread.

To qualify for priority treatment, combined orders must meet the existing requirements of Rule 6.45(d), i.e., one
member must represent all legs of the combined trade, each leg must cover the same number of options, and the trade must
be executed against one other member. In those circumstances, the CBOE believes, it is fair to give combined trades
priority when priced net at a multiple of 1/16. Additionally, the CBOE represents that it has the systems capacity
to disseminate transactions in decimals and also has a prefix field which will be used to identify, among other things,
trades effected as part of a spread. Any transaction effected at non-standard prices would be disseminated in decimals
and identified as being part of a spread by entering an ``S'' in the prefix field.






The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles
of trade and to protect investors and the public interest.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Changes and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval to Amendments to Proposed Rule Changes Relating to Market Index Option Escrow Receipts</DOCTITLE>



July 19, 1994.



I. Introduction



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''), the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'') and the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'')
 submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') proposed rule changes to permit,
on a permanent basis, the use of cash, cash equivalents, one or more qualified equity securities, or a combination
thereof, as collateral for market index option escrow receipts (``MIOERs'') issued to cover short call positions
in broad-based stock index options.
 On May 12, 1994, May 25, 1994 and July 5, 1994, respectively, the CBOE, PSE and Phlx submitted to the Commission Amendment
Nos. 1, 7 and 5 to the proposed rule changes in order to conform their proposals with recently approved amendments to
the rules of the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'').










The proposed rule changes were noticed in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 24253 (March 24, 1987), 52 FR 10433
(April 1, 1987) (File No. SR-CBOE-87-03); 24708 (July 15, 1987), 52 FR 27604 (File No. SR-PSE-87-21);
and 24383 (April 23, 1987), 52 FR 15796 (April 30, 1987) (File No. SR-Phlx-87-05). No comments were
received on the proposals. This order approves the proposed rule changes, including the most recent amendments on
an accelerated basis.




II. Background



For various reasons, such as state and federal regulations, many institutions may write call options only on a covered
basis in a cash account.
 Many of these institutions, however, are legally restrained from having deposits of cash or securities at a brokerage
firm. Accordingly, in lieu of such a deposit, a bank may issue to the broker an escrow receipt on behalf of their mutual
customer, in order to meet the margin requirements for any short options the customer may have written.







Because it is difficult to apply the traditional concept of ``cover'' to broad-based, cash-settled index options,
 in 1984, the Commission approved SRO proposals to allow index options writers to enter into escrow agreements without
requiring them to collateralize the agreements with all the securities underlying the index.
 The original MIOER program permitted the use of escrow receipts for short call positions if, among other things, a
bank or trust company held for the customer a ``basket'' of at least ten qualified equity securities. Due to inadequate
recordkeeping procedures, settlement delay and financial disincentives, many market participants found this
program to be impracticable and uneconomic, particularly in comparison to similar products traded on commodities
exchanges.









Accordingly, in 1985, the Commission approved, on a pilot basis, SRO proposals to change the type of property acceptable
as an escrow deposit.
 These pilot programs subsequently have been extended eight times,
 in order to provide the exchanges and OCC with the opportunity to resolve certain matters concerning the format of
the receipt and administration of the program.

<TEXT>
 

Currently, a MIOER may be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, one or more qualified equity securities, or a
combination thereof. Pursuant to Regulation T, the term ``cash equivalents'' is defined to mean the market value
of any of the following instruments with one year or less to maturity: (1) Securities issued or guaranteed by the United
States or its agencies; (2) negotiable bank certificates of deposit; or (3) bankers acceptances issued by banking
institutions in the United States and payable in the United States.
 An equity security (other than warrants, rights or options) is qualified to be used as collateral for MIOERs issued
to cover short call positions if it is traded on a national securities exchange and substantially meets the listing
requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') or American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') or if it is enumerated
on the current list of over-the-counter margin stocks published by the Federal Reserve Board.





The current escrow receipt program requires that, at the time the option is written, the total value of the collateral
underlying the MIOER must be at least equal to the aggregate initial position value (

i.e., 

the index value at trade date times the applicable index multiplier times the number of options contracts covered
by the collateral). Although the escrow deposit may include only one or even no securities, the customer must affirm
that he is writing index options against a diversified portfolio. In addition, the issuing bank or trust company must
be approved by OCC if the receipt is to be forwarded to OCC to meet the clearing member's margin obligations.






Thereafter, the terms of the MIOER
 specify that, if the value of the collateral falls below 55% of the current position value, the issuing bank or trust
company promptly must notify the customer and request that the escrow deposit be supplemented. If the value of the
collateral falls below 50% of the current position value, the bank or trust company promptly must notify OCC and the
broker who, in turn, will disregard the MIOER and request that margin be deposited for the previously covered short
position.





III. Description of the Proposals



The exchanges' most recent amendments (Amendment Nos. 1, 7 and 5 to the CBOE, PSE and Phlx filings, respectively) propose
to convert their MIOER programs
 from pilot to permanent status and to conform their rules with recently approved amendments to OCC's rules.
 Despite certain refinements, as discussed in more detail below, the current rules will, for the most part, continue
to apply.






First, the SROs proposals will limit acceptable ``cash equivalents'' to securities issued or guaranteed by the United
States and having one year or less to maturity (``short-term United States government securities''). As a result,
securities issued or guaranteed by agencies of the United States, certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances
will no longer be eligible as collateral for MIOERs issued to cover short call position.

In addition, the definition of ``qualified equity securities'' will be amended to incorporate all exchange-traded
securities, whether or not they meet NYSE or Amex listing standards. The proposals also will make certain editorial
changes to the exchanges' rules regarding the use of over-the-counter securities to collateralize an escrow receipt,
in order to conform that language with the phrasing used in OCC's rules.

The exchanges believe that the proposed rule changes are consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general and, in particular,
with Section 6(b)(5), in that they are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to foster
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information
with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market and a national market system, as well as to protect investors and the public interest by establishing
a MIOER consistent with OCC rules and procedures.

IV. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposals are consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that
the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest.




After careful review of the operation of the pilot programs, the Commission has concluded that the revised MIOER should
help provide a safe and efficient mechanism by which index call options can be written in a cash account. As set forth
in more detail in its order approving the pilot procedures,
 the commission believes that the range of collateral permitted thereunder should provide market participants with
greater flexibility, prevent settlement delays and eliminate many of the problems encountered under the original
MIOER program. To the extent that the revised escrow receipt is a cost-effective means for institutions restricted
to cash account transactions to manage portfolio risk, its implementation on a permanent basis should encourage
broader participation in the index options market, thereby adding depth and liquidity to that market.




Based on their experience with the pilot program, however, the SROs, along with OCC, have proposed certain minor refinements
to the types of property acceptable as collateral for MIOERs issued to cover short call positions. As the Commission
noted in regard to the recently approved OCC proposal,
 these new standards will ensure that only liquid assets are eligible to underlie escrow receipts. Specifically,
the Commission believes that the proposed rule changes are a reasonable response to OCC's finding that certificates
of deposit and bankers acceptances present an undue risk to OCC because it has no means of ensuring that issuers of such
instruments are financially sound.
 Thus, the Commission agrees with the SROs that limiting ``cash equivalents'' to short-term United States government
securities will enhance the integrity of escrowed collateral. Moreover, the changes to the definition of ``qualified
equity security'' are consistent with the Federal Reserve Board's definition of ``margin security'' or existing
OCC rules.





Finally, the Commission has determined that the escrow receipt contains safeguards (

e.g.,

 minimum collateral levels; the requirement that issuing banks or trust companies notify customers and OCC of reductions
in collateral
 that should help ensure the adequacy of the collateral posted and diminish the risks associated with MIOERs. To date,
the SROs' experience with the pilot program supports the Commission's earlier conclusion that, absent extremely
unusual circumstances, the value of the collateral should be greater than the cash difference between the current
index value and the exercise price of the option (

i.e.,

 the amount that must be delivered upon assignment).
 The Commission therefore believes that implementation on a permanent basis is now appropriate.





The Phlx proposal regarding the types of property acceptable as collateral for escrow receipts issued to cover short
put positions
 is identical to existing rules in other options markets.
 The Commission finds that the Phlx proposal will provide sufficient investor protection while facilitating hedging
transactions in both broad-based stock index options and individual stock options.






The commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1, 7 and 5 to the CBOE, PSE and Phlx proposals, respectively,
prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof. These amendments merely conform
the exchanges proposals with recently approved amendments to OCC rules.
 Finally, the Commission did not receive any comments on either original CBOE, PSE and Phlx proposals or the comparable
OCC proposal, both of which were noticed for he full statutory period.




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the most recent amendments
to the proposed rule changes. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent
amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rules changes that are filed with the Commission,
and all written communications relating to these amendments between the Commission and any persons, other than those
that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for
inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
Copies of such filings will also be available at the principal offices of the CBOE, PSE and Phlx. All submissions should
refer to File Nos. SR-CBOE-87-03; SR-PSE-87-21; and SR-Phlx-87-05
and should be submitted by August 15, 1994.


V. Conclusion


It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule changes permitting, on a permanent basis, the use of cash, cash equivalents, one or more qualified
securities, or a combination of the foregoing, as collateral for escrow receipts issued to cover short call positions
in broad-based stock index options, in lieu of margin (SR-CBOE-87-03; SR-PSE-87-21;
and SR-Phlx-87-05) hereby are approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; International Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Temporarily Approving
on an Accelerated Basis a Proposed Rule Change Amending ISCC's Clearing Fund Formula</DOCTITLE>



July 15, 1994.



On June 9, 1994, International Securities Clearing Corporation (``ISCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'').
 The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 on June 22, 1994.
 No comments were received on the notice. As discussed below, the Commission is temporarily approving the proposed
rule change on an accelerated basis through July 18, 1995.







I. Description



In 1986, ISCC and the London Stock Exchange (``LSE'') entered into a linkage agreement which allows ISCC to obtain
comparison and settlement services in the United Kingdom from the LSE on behalf of ISCC members. Pursuant to this linkage
agreement, ISCC is responsible for paying for all securities believed. ISCC has no requirement to complete open pending
trades.
 On July 18, 1994, the LSE is moving to a ten day rolling settlement cycle with trades settling ten days after trade date.
 In response to this change, ISCC is adjusting its method of calculating its clearing fund requirements.








ISCC bases its clearing fund calculations on the assumption that it will take one day to sell all of a defaulting participant's
positions. This results in an eleven day exposure for market risk with ten days between trade date and settlement date
and one day between settlement date and close out of positions. There also will be a one day exposure for foreign exchange
risk. (ISCC will convert U.S. dollars into British pounds on settlement day and will convert the proceeds from the
close out of positions into U.S. dollars the next day.) The formula, therefore, is the sum of two components_the amount
collected to cover market risk and the foreign exchange factor.

To calculate the amount of clearing fund deposit attributable to market risk, ISCC establishes a market risk factor
which is the largest percentage change over eleven days in the Financial Times Index over a minimum of 365 days. Initially,
the market risk factor will be set at seven percent.
 The market risk factor is multiplied by the largest single daily gross debit value for the applicable week less 15%
of the Institutional Net Settlement (``INS'') receive value for that day based on debit values for the calendar week
following the week in which the calculation is performed (``adjusted gross debit value'').







The foreign exchange factor is calculated by multiplying the adjusted gross debit value by the largest one day percentage
change in the U.S. Dollar-British Pound foreign exchange rate over a minimum of 365 days (``estimated foreign exchange
volatility'').
 The product is then reduced by the product of the adjusted gross debit value times the estimated foreign exchange volatility
times the market risk factor. The reduction is made because the risk of foreign exchange is on the amount of money converted
into U.S. dollars after sale of the securities not on the entire amount of dollars ISCC originally converted into British
pounds.

<PARENT> FR940725-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Previously for ISCC members on surveillance status, the market risk factor and the foreign exchange factor of the
clearing fund formula were increased, in the discretion of ISCC, by requiring up to an additional 3%, 5%, and 7% of average
daily debits for members on Advisory, Class A, and Class B surveillance, respectively. Under the new formula, both
the market risk factor and the foreign exchange factor may be increased by a maximum of 3%, a maximum of 5%, and a maximum
of 7% for members on Advisory, Class A, and Class B surveillance, respectively.



II. Discussion



The Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and, therefore, is approving
the proposal. Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
 of the Act in that it better enables ISCC to safeguard securities and funds for which it is responsible. ISCC's adjustments
to its clearing fund formula will result in a more accurate reflections of its risks. Instead of basing the formula
on past obligations of the ISCC member, the formula is now based on the actual obligations of such member during the
relevant time period. This should provide ISCC increased protection when an ISCC member has unusually heavy trading
activity. In addition, the previous ISCC clearing fund formula relied on a calculation of market risk factor and of
foreign exchange risk factor that is now outdated. ISCC's increase in the size of these factors provides ISCC with
greater protection consistent with likely movements in securities prices and in foreign exchange rates.





On June 17, 1980, the Commission issued a release announcing the standards to be used by the Division of Market Regulation
in connection with the registration of clearing agencies.
 In that release, the Commission stated that it is appropriate for a clearing agency to establish an appropriate level
of clearing fund contributions based, among other things, on its assessment of the risks to which it is subject. In
addition, contributions to the clearing fund should be based on a formula that applies to users on a uniform, nondiscriminatory
basis. The Commission believes that ISCC's proposal is consistent with these guidelines. The new clearing fund formula
is based on the risks (

i.e., 

time, market, and foreign exchange risks) created by the LSE's method of settlement. In addition, the formula is applied
uniformly to all ISCC members in accordance with their usage of the LSE link.





The Commission preliminarily finds that the proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act. The Commission believes
that in light of its significance to ISCC and its members, the proposed revisions to ISCC's clearing fund formula should
be carefully monitored before they become a permanent feature. For this reason, the Commission is approving the proposal
on a temporary basis through July 18, 1995.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of the notice of filing. The LSE is scheduled to move to its new settlement cycle on July 18, 1994. ISCC needs
to have its new clearing fund formula in place at the same time in order to sufficiently cover its new risks. The Commission
therefore believes that it is appropriate to accelerate approval of the proposal.



III. Conclusion



It is therefore ordered pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-ISCC-94-01)
be, and hereby is, temporarily approved through July 18, 1955.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Granting Approval on an Accelerated
Basis of a Proposed Rule Change Modifying NSCC's Trade Comparison Service</DOCTITLE>


July 15, 1994.


On June 3, 1994, the National Securities Clearance Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-07) under Section 19(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposed rule change was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 24, 1994, to solicit comment from interested persons.
 No comments have been received by the Commission. This order approves the proposal.





I. Description of the Proposal


The proposed rule change will modify NSCC's Rules and Procedures relating to trade comparison. The proposed rule
change is designed to support the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''
in their efforts to implement trade-date comparison systems.
 To achieve trade-date comparison, the NYSE and Amex require their member organizations to submit trade comparison
data to the NYSE and Amex rather than to NSCC for comparison processing.




Prior to the NYSE and Amex implementing their trade-date comparison systems, NSCC received locked-in trade data
from the NYSE and Amex and initial two-sided, uncompared trade data from its member organizations. The uncompared
trade data from its members were matched by NSCC and were reported back to the members on contract lists. The locked-in
trade data, which is compared at the point of execution by the exchanges, bypasses NSCC's comparison process but for
record purposes is reported back to the members organizations on contract lists.
Under the new systems, the NYSE and Amex will process the initial two-sided, uncompared trade data in their trade-date
comparison system. When these trades do no compare, the NYSE and Amex will report such unmatched trades (known as ``questioned
trades'' or ``QTs'' at the NYSE and ``don't knows'' or ``DKs'' at the Amex) to NSCC along with the matched, two-sided
trades and the locked-in trades. The compared trades (including the locked-in trades and the matched, two-sided
trades) will bypass NSCC comparison processing, but the unmatched trades will be included in NSCC's comparison process
and in NSCC's trade correction process if necessary. 
NSCC states that the proposed rule change will permit the NYSE and Amex to submit on behalf of NSCC members uncompared
trade data relating to trades for regular way, when-issued, cash, next day, and sellers-option settlement in equity
securities executed on such exchanges directly to NSCC for inclusion in NSCC's comparison process. Even though the
NYSE and Amex require their members to submit their trade data to the exchanges, the revisions to NSCC's Rules and Procedures
still permit NSCC members to submit such data directly to NSCC in order to have the data included in that day's processing.
This authority is necessary because a member may miss the exchanges' submission time frames. NSCC notes that the NYSE
and Amex have concurred in this procedure.
As member organizations become accustomed to the NYSE's and Amex's trade-date comparison systems, NSCC expects
that the NYSE and Amex will no longer permit members to submit data directly to NSCC. At the time, NSCC, upon the request
of the NYSE and Amex, will file a rule change under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act eliminating the ability of NSCC members
to submit such data directly to NSCC other than on an exception basis.


II. Discussion


For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly
with Section 17A of the Act. Section 17A(b)(5) of the Act states that the rules of a clearing agency should be designed
to foster cooperation and coordination with person engaged in the clearance and settling of securities transactions,
to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

The risks posed by uncompared trades and by the long span of time between trade execution and trade comparison (

i.e., 

as long as five business days for equity trades) came under intense scrutiny after the Market Break of October 1987.
The leading studies of the Market Break of 1987 identified uncompared trades as a major stress point in post-trade
processing which, together with the unprecedented trading volume and the unprecedented price volatility during
the Market Break, posed an unacceptable threat to the marketplace.
 The Commission, in its recommendations to Congress in February of 1988, proposed that markets accelerate their efforts
to compare all trades on trade date.







Since 1988, NSCC, among others, has sought to improve clearing operations and to reduce exposure to losses associated
with market volatility occurring during the period between execution and settlement. The NSCC, together with the
NYSE and Amex, reduced the comparison cycle in stocks first from T+5 to T+3 in 1989 and then to T+1 in 1990.






As stated above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change, by shortening the NYSE and Amex comparison
cycles for equity trades from T+1 to trade date, will make the comparison process safer in terms of the risks resulting
from market price volatility. The Commission believes that the proposal will offer additional protection to NSCC
and investors, brokers, and other persons that safeguard investors' funds and facilitate investors' transactions.
The proposal also should help in the implementation under the Act of Rule 15c-6 which requires settlement of
securities transactions on T+3 effective on June 1, 1995.
 In the Commission's view, this proposal should help provide fundamental and important improvements to the marketplace.





NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing in the 

Federal Register. 

Accelerated approval will permit NSCC to coordinate with the NYSE and Amex in the early phases of those exchanges'
efforts to move toward trade-date comparison. Therefore, the Commission believes there is good cause for approving
the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-07) be, and hereby is, approved.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Notice of Partial Withdrawal and Order Temporarily
Approving Proposed Rule Changes Relating to the Acceptance of Certain Currencies as Margin Deposits</DOCTITLE>



July 15, 1994.



On September 22, 1992, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-OCC-92-31
and SR-OC-92-32) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section
19(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 On December 3, 1992; OCC filed a technical amendment to File No. SR-OCC-92-31. Notices of the proposals
were published in the 

Federal Register 

on December 18, 1992, and December 7, 1992, respectively, to solicit comments from interested persons.
 No comments were received. On July 13, 1994, OCC withdrew the portions of the proposed rule changes related to the acceptance
of foreign sovereign debt as margin deposits.
 As discussed below, this order approves the remainder of the proposed rule changes through December 31, 1995.







I. Description



Generally, the purpose of the proposed rule changes is to allow OCC to expand the categories of non-U.S. dollar denominated
collateral it will accept as margin deposits. First, the proposed rule changes allow all OCC clearing members to deposit
with OCC margin consisting of any foreign currency which is the trading currency
 or the underlying currency
 for an OCC-cleared foreign currency option or for an OCC-cleared cross-rate foreign currency option (``cross-rate'').
 Currently, only cross-rate clearing members are permitted to deposit foreign currencies, specifically only trading
currencies, as margin.







To accommodate the acceptance of non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies as margin, OCC is making several changes
to its By-Laws and Rules. Presently for each class of cross-rates in which a cross-rate clearing member maintains
positions, OCC Rule 2108 requires the cross-rate clearing member to establish and to maintain a bank account with
an approved OCC clearing bank in the country of origin of each trading and underlying currency and to authorize OCC
to withdraw funds from such bank accounts in accordance with OCC's rules. OCC will impose those same requirements
on all clearing members desiring to deposit trading and underlying currencies as margin. Accordingly, amended Rule
203 will require every clearing member that desires to deposit foreign currency as margin to establish and to maintain
an account with an OCC-approved clearing bank in each country of origin and must authorize OCC to withdraw funds from
such bank account in accordance with OCC's rules. The criteria used in approving banks to act as custodians for deposits
of the trading and underlying currencies deposited as margin will be the same as the criteria currently used in approving
banks to settle cross-rates.






OCC is amending Rule 604(a) to add trading currencies and underlying currencies to the forms of collateral that clearing
members may deposit to satisfy margin requirements.
 OCC also is adding and defining, as appropriate, the terms underlying currency and trading currency in various Articles
of its By-Laws.

II. Discussion



The Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the purposes and requirements of Section 17A of the Act.
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal meets the requirement of Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) that
a clearing agency be organized and have the capacity to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or
for which it is responsible.







In accepting the deposit of trading and underlying currencies, OCC is recognizing the global nature of the financial
industry today. For example, by accepting foreign currencies as margin deposits, OCC may reduce the risk of having
to buy-in a foreign currency clearing member or a cross-rate clearing member upon default of a delivery obligation
because the deposit of the underlying currency may be used to meet such obligation. The Commission believes that the
acceptance of trading and underlying currencies as margin will provide OCC with added flexibility in managing a clearing
member's default of a delivery obligation and, therefore, should further OCC's ability to meet its safeguarding
obligations. For this reason, the Commission is temporarily approving those portions of the proposals enabling
OCC to accept trading and underlying currencies as margin deposits.

The Commission is temporarily approving the filings in order that the Commission and OCC will have adequate time and
data to review the program before the Commission grants permanent approval. OCC has agreed to undertake a review of
the program for accepting non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies as margin collateral after the program has been
operational for one year. OCC's review will be submitted in writing to the Commission and will include such things
as a study of the effects of accepting foreign currencies as margin collateral, any perceived risk to liquidity, and
any perceived need for concentration limits.






III. Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that OCC's proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act.






It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-OCC-92-31 and SR-OCC-92-32) be,
and hereby are, approved through December 31, 1995.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to the Quote Spread Parameters for National Over-the-Counter Index (``XOC'') Options</DOCTITLE>



July 19, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 13, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



Currently, PHLX Rule 1014, ``Obligations and Restrictions Applicable to Specialists and Registered Options Traders,''
and PHLX Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') F-6, ``Option Quote Spread Parameters,'' establish a maximum
quote spread of $1.00 for index options with bids of $20.00 or more. The PHLX proposes to amend its rules to establish
the following maximum quote spreads for National Over-the-Counter Index (``XOC'') options: $2.00 for XOC options
with bids of $20.00 to less than $40.00; and $3.00 for XOC options with bids of $40.00 or more.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The PHLX proposes to amend the quote spread parameters (bid/ask differential) applicable to XOC options. The current
parameters appear in PHLX Rule 1014(c) as well as Advice F-6. The PHLX proposes to widen the quote spread parameters
applicable to higher-priced quotations for XOC options as follows: $2.00 for XOC options with bids of $20.00 to less
than $40.00; and $3.00 for XOC options with bids of $40.00 or more.

The PHLX states that quote spread parameters, also referred to as bid/ask differentials, govern the width of market
quotations;
 specifically, the maximum widths between the bid and ask for PHLX options are mandated by PHLX Rule 1014(c). Although
specific parameters appear in PHLX Rule 1014(c), this rule also permits the Exchange to establish differentials
other than those listed for one or more series or classes of options. The Exchange notes that although a violation of
the maximum quote spread may result in a fine,
 the quote spreads are not applicable during fast market conditions, pursuant to Advice F-10, ``Extraordinary
Market Conditions (Fast Markets).''








Currently, the bid/ask differentials applicable to equity and index options are identical; with respect to higher-priced
premiums, where the bid is $20.00 or more, the quote spread parameter is $1.00. The PHLX states that recent volatility
in the XOC resulted in temporary floor official relief, pursuant to Advice F-6,
 being granted to the XOC crowd allowing for the proposed wider quotation. The Exchange proposes to codify these wider
quote spread parameters for higher-priced XOC series.





The purpose of the wider quotations is to reflect the wider bid/ask differential in the over-the-counter (``OTC'')
securities underlying the XOC. In order to hedge XOC exposure, positions in these OTC securities are typically purchased
and sold. According to the Exchange, the aggregate bid/ask differential for the XOC's component securities is often
greater than $5.00 wide.






The wider bid/ask differential particularly problematic with respect to higher-priced option series because the
higher bids represent a greater premium dollar value and thus more risk. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to widen
the XOC quote spread parameter applicable to higher-priced series only. The Exchange believes that this limitation
is appropriate because a $40.00 bid, for example, represents a $4,000 premium. The Exchange notes that the XOC series
priced at $20.00 or less are most often chosen for investment by public customers (

i.e.

, ``customers'' who are not associated with broker-dealer organizations or subject to discretionary authorization
by assisted persons of broker-dealers).

The PHLX received one letter stating that wider quote spread parameters for XOC options will not benefit public customers
and may discourage public customers from purchasing index options on the Exchange.
 In response to the March 24 Letter, the PHLX indicates that the Exchange's Committee on Options considered the quote
spread parameters established by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. for its Nasdaq 100 Index. In addition,
the PHLX notes that the XOC trading crowd has increased its minimum volume guarantee to 20 contracts for public customer
orders in series with previous-close bid values of $10.00 or less.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular
with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, as well as to protect investors and the public interest, because widening higher-priced
XOC quote spread parameters should facilitate hedging, and, in turn, liquidity.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.

 

(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



One written comment in opposition to the change was received from a registered representative of Smith Barney Shearson.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(a) by order approve such proposed rule change, or
(b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by August 15, 1994.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Preferred Life Insurance Company of New York, et al.</DOCTITLE>



July 18, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for an Amended Order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Preferred Life Insurance Company of New York (``Company''), Preferred Life Variable Account C (``Variable Account''),
and NALAC Financial Plans, Inc.




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Amended Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an Amended Order to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge under certain variable
annuity contracts from the assets of the Variable Account, or any other separate account established by the Company
in the future to support materially similar variable annuity contracts.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference
Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Company is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the state of New York. The Company is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (``Allianz''). Allianz is a stock life insurance company
organized under the laws of Minnesota.

2. The Variable Account is a segregated investment account of the Company and is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit
investment trust. The Variable Account was established to fund certain variable annuity contracts (``Contracts'')
issued by the Company. The Variable Account is subdivided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in a fund of the
Franklin Valuemark Funds, a Massachusetts business trust registered under the 1940 ``Act'' as a diversified open-end
management investment company. 

3. NALAC Financial Plans, Inc., a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is the distributor
of the Contracts. 

4. The Contracts are individual flexible payment deferred variable annuity contracts (``Deferred Contracts'')
or individual immediate variable annuity contracts (``Immediate Contracts''). The Contracts are available in
connection with retirement plans that qualify for Federal tax advantages and for plans that do not so qualify.

5. The Contracts provide for certain charges. Any premium taxes or other taxes payable to a state or other governmental
entity will be charged against the Contract values. The Company may, in its sole discretion, pay taxes when due and
deduct that amount from the Contract at a later date.

6. Owners of Deferred Contracts may transfer all or a part of their interest in a sub-account to another sub-account.
The Company reserves the right to charge, per transfer, the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount transferred. Prior to the
date annuity payments begin (``Annuity Date''), there is no charge for the first three transfers per Contract year.
Currently, the Company permits twelve transfers per Contract year without a transfer fee.

Owners of Immediate Contracts may transfer all or part of their interest in a sub-account to another sub-account without
the imposition of any transfer fee. 

7. For Deferred Contracts, the Company will deduct an annual contract maintenance charge of $30. Applicants represent
that this charge has not been set at a level greater than actual cost and contains no element of profit. There is no contract
maintenance charge for Immediate Contracts. 

8. The Company deducts an administrative expense charge that is equal on an annual basis to .15% of the average daily
net assets of the Variable Account. This charge, together with the contract maintenance charge, is designed to reimburse
the Company for the expenses it incurs in the establishment and maintenance of the Contracts and the Variable Account.
The Company does not intend to profit from this charge. Should this charge be insufficient, the Company will not increase
this charge and will incur the loss. Applicants rely on Rule 26a-1 to deduct the contract maintenance charge
and the administrative expense charge. Applicants represent that the administrative expense charge will be reduced
in the future to the extent that the amount of this charge is in excess of that necessary to reimburse the Company for
its administrative expenses.

<TEXT>
 

9. The Contracts do not provide for a front-end sales charge to be deducted from purchase payments. Under the Deferred
Contracts, a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') is imposed on full or partial surrenders to reimburse the
Company for expenses incurred in connection with the promotion, sale, and distribution of the Contracts. The CDSC
applies only to purchase payments received within five years of the date of surrender. No CDSC is imposed on distributions
made as annuity payments. In calculating the CDSC, purchase payments are allocated to the amount surrendered on a
first-in, first-out basis. The amount of the CDSC is calculated by (i) allocating purchase payments to the amount
surrendered; (ii) multiplying each allocated purchase payment that has been held under the Contract by a percentage
corresponding to the period for which the payment was held; and (iii) adding the product of each multiplication in
(ii) above. Under certain of the Deferred Contracts, the percentages are as follows:






Under other of the Deferred Contracts, the percentages are as follows:






In no event will the aggregate CDSC exceed 9% of the total purchase payments made. A Contract owner may surrender no
more than once annually 15% of purchase payments less prior surrenders without incurring a CDSC. The Company may eliminate
or reduce the CDSC under Company procedures then in effect. There is no CDSC imposed on Immediate Contracts.
10. For all Contracts issued in connection with the Variable Account, the Company deducts a mortality and expense
risk charge that is equal, on an annual basis, to 1.25% of the average daily net assets of the Variable Account. Of this
1.25% charge, approximately .90% is for mortality risks and .35% is for expense risks.
The mortality risks assumed by the Company arise from its contractual obligation to make annuity payments after the
Annuity Date for the life of the annuitant in accordance with the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts. The expense
risk assumed by the Company is that all actual expenses involved in administering the Contracts, including Contract
maintenance costs, administrative costs, mailing costs, data processing costs, legal fees, accounting fees, filing
fees, and the costs of other services may exceed the amount recovered from the contract maintenance charge and the
administrative expense charge.


Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions


1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor
or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited
with a qualified trustee or custodian and held under arrangements that prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal
underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing
bookkeeping and other administrative services.
2. Applicants request an amended order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act exempting them from Sections 26(a)(2)(C)
and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge
from the assets of the Variable Account under the Contracts. Applicants request that the Amended Order also permit
the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of any other separate account established by
the Company in the future to support variable annuity contracts offered on a basis similar in all material respects
to the basis on which the Contracts are offered.
3. Applicants submit that their request for an Amended Order that applies to the Variable Account and to future separate
accounts issuing contracts that are substantially similar to the Contracts is appropriate in the public interest.
Such an amended order would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need
for the Company to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing its administrative expenses and maximizing
the efficient use of its resources. Applicants further submit that the requested relief is consistent with the purposes
of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. Investors would not receive any benefit or additional
protection by the Company by being required repeatedly to seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed
in this application.
4. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable in relation to the risks undertaken
by the Company and within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants
base this representation on an analysis of the mortality risks, taking into consideration such factors as any contractual
right to increase charges above current levels, the guaranteed annuity purchase rates, the expense risks taking
into consideration the existence of charges against separate account assets for other than mortality and expense
risks, and the estimated costs, now and in the future, for certain product features as well as an examination of comparable
annuity products. The Company represents that it will maintain at its principal office a memorandum, available to
the Commission, setting forth in detail this analysis. 

5. If a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be viewed as
being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. The Company represents that there is a reasonable
likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Variable Account and Contract
owners. The basis for such conclusion will be set forth in a memorandum maintained by the Company at its principal office
and available to the Commission upon request. 
6. The Company represents that the Variable Account will invest only in management investment companies that undertake,
in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, to
have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within the meaning of Section
2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan.



Conclusion


Applicants assert that, for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Variable
Account under the Contracts meet the standards in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions
requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1993 Jaguar Sovereign passenger cars not originally manufactured
to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United
States because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale

vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has determined that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Revision of OMB Circular No. A-130, Transmittal 2, 

Management of Federal Information Resources.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Management and Budget is revising Circular No. A-130, 

Management of Federal Information Resources 

(hereafter referred to as Circular A-130). The revision is being done in stages.



Transmittal 1 to Circular A-130, effective June 25, 1993, and published on July 2, 1993 (58 FR 36068) addressed
the Information Management Policy section of the Circular (Section 8a), as well as Appendix I, ``Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records About Individuals.'' That issuance dealt primarily with how the Federal government manages
its information holdings, particularly information exchange with the public.

The revisions contained herein address agencies' internal management practices for information systems and information
technology (Section 8b). These revisions to the circular: (1) promote agency investments in information technology
that improve service delivery to the public, reduce burden on the public, and lower the cost of Federal program administration;
(2) encourage agencies to use information technology as a strategic resource to promote fundamental reevaluation
of federal agency work processes, organizational structures, and ways of interacting with the public; and (3) recognize
the changes in the technical, legal, and operational environment that agencies face when managing information technology.


Also, the revisions make minor changes to Section 5, ``Background,'' Section 6, ``Definitions,'' Section 7, ``Basic
Considerations and Assumptions,'' and Appendix IV, ``Analysis of Key Sections'' of the Circular. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION



Background



The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) assigns the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
responsibility for maintaining a comprehensive set of information resources management policies, and for promoting
the application of information technology to improve the use and dissemination of information in the operation of
Federal programs. To fulfill these responsibilities, OMB originally issued Circular No. A-130, 

Management of Federal Information Resources 

(50 FR 52730; December 24, 1985), which provided a policy framework for Federal information resources management
(IRM). Since the Circular was issued in 1985, Congress has enacted several laws bearing on the information technology
management section of the Circular, especially amendments to the Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 99-500).


OMB published four notices relating to this revision of the Circular. On March 4, 1991, OMB published a notice setting
forth plans for revising all of the Circular (56 FR 9026) and on April 29, 1992, OMB specifically requested comments
on topics for the proposed revision to Section 8b, 

Information Systems and Information Technology Management

, of the Circular (57 FR 18296). On July 2, 1993, OMB published a notice (58 FR 36068) amending most of the Circular; in
that notice, OMB stated its plans for amending other parts of the Circular (58 FR 36069-70). On September 10,
1993, OMB published a notice (58 FR 47790) requesting comment on the proposed changes to the information technology
portion of the Circular. 
 


Structure of this Revision



This revision substantially reorganizes Section 8b, 

Information Systems and Information Technology Management

, which was issued in 1985 (50 FR 52736-37, December 24, 1985). For the convenience of readers of the circular,
this issuance fully incorporates and supersedes Transmittal 1 of Circular A-130, which revised Section 8a
and other related sections dealing with information management (58 FR 36070, July 2, 1993). This revision primarily
addresses portions of the Circular that were not revised in the July 1993 

Federal Register

 notice (i.e., Section 8b and Appendix II). However, this issuance also affects Section 5, 

Background

, Section 6, 

Definitions

, Section 7, 

Basic Considerations and Assumptions

, and Appendix IV, 

Analysis of Key Sections

, which were previously revised in the July 1993 notice.

Summary of Revisions



Section 5. 

Background. 

This revision substitutes the term ``information resources management'' for the term ``information management''
in the first sentence.

Section 6. 

Definitions. 

This revision to the Circular adds definitions for the terms ``full costs,'' ``information management,'' ``information
resources,'' ``information processing service organization,'' ``information systems life cycle,'' ``major
information systems,'' and ``service recipient.'' In addition, the revision amends the definitions for the terms
``information resources management'' and ``information system.'' The following summarizes the changes to Section
6.
 
The term ``full costs'' describes the costs agencies should account for when charging for services provided by an
Information Processing Service Organization (IPSO). This definition is changed from the September 10, 1993, proposal
(58 FR 47793). The new definition has been made more detailed in response to agency comments.

The term ``information management'' is defined to distinguish the management of information from the management
of information technology where necessary.

The term ``information resources,'' implied in Circular A-130's previous definition of ``information resources
management'' (Sec. 6i, 58 FR 36070), is defined specifically in order to broaden the applicability of some policy
statements beyond just information technology or just information.

The term ``information resources management'' is changed from the July 2, 1993, issuance (Sec. 6i, 58 FR 36070) to
emphasize the process of managing information resources instead of listing management activities for information
resources. 
 
The term ``information system'' is changed from the July 2, 1993, issuance (Sec. 6j, 58 FR 36070) to stress that information
systems are discrete sets of resources_not just processes.

``Information systems life cycle,'' a term formerly contained in Appendix IV (50 FR 52749), is moved into Section
6 consistent with the discussion of information systems management oversight in Section 8b(3).

The new term ``information processing services organization'' (IPSO) replaces the term ``information technology
facility'' (Sec. 6l, 58 FR 36071), which is deleted. This final issuance defines the term differently than proposed
(Sec. 6l, 58 FR 47793) in response to agency comments.

The definition of ``major information system'' is changed slightly from the proposal (Sec. 6m, 58 FR 47793) for clarity.

``Service recipient'' is a new term used solely in the context of interagency sharing or cross-servicing of information
resources for purposes of establishing charge-back mechanisms. This term is being adopted rather than the term ``user''
proposed in the September 10, 1993, notice (Sec. 6t, 58 FR 47793).

Section 7. Basic Considerations and Assumptions. 

The September 10, 1993, notice proposed to amend two statements of basic considerations and assumptions (Sec. 7i
and 7l), and to add one (Sec. 7n) (58 FR 47793). This notice amends Section 7i, as proposed; adds a new Section 7n, revised
from the proposal; amends Section 7l, with most of the proposed revision being moved to new Sections 7o and 7p; and adds
a new Section 7q. These changes address:
(1) The need for agencies to apply information resources to meet the mission needs of the agency as agreed upon through
agency strategic planning processes,
(2) The need for skills, training, and knowledge to support the management of information resources as the government
moves toward program delivery to the public that relies more heavily on automation, and
(3) The need for federal managers with program delivery responsibilities to assume responsibility for the effective
stewardship of information resources to fulfill mission needs. 
(4) One basic consideration and assumption proposed (Section 7l, 58 FR 47793) is split into two separate statements
in this issuance to emphasize:
(a) The need for agencies to recognize the opportunity that the introduction of information technology presents
for organizational streamlining, work process redesign, and making public interactions with the Federal government
more ``user-friendly'';
(b) The availability of government information in electronic forms to improve the management and use of this information
for the government and the public; and 
(5) The role of information resources in supporting the achievement of mission goals.

Section 8b. Information Systems and Information Technology Management Policy. 

(1) Evaluation and Performance Measurement.

This section expands on the guidance for evaluating investments in information technology previously found in Section
43 of OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates

, and OMB Circular No. A-94, 

Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs 

(57 FR 53519, November 10, 1992). Additionally, OMB broadens the criteria for evaluating information systems to
include benefits to the public. This policy requires agencies to prepare a benefit-cost analysis for each information
system as a management oversight tool. The policy also requires agencies to devise an agency-wide investment strategy,
using benefit-cost analyses for individual systems, that maximizes the return on investment on information technology
across the agency. 

This section has been changed from the proposal (Sec. 8b(1), 58 FR 47793-4) to emphasize the role of reengineering
in ensuring the greatest return possible from investments in information technology. Other changes add operational
risk as a criterion for evaluating individual information systems and require agencies to review benefits that have
accrued from implementing an information system. Finally, this issuance requires agencies to consider the return
on investments in information technology from an organization-wide perspective. These changes reflect comments
from the General Accounting Office.

(2) 

Strategic Information Resources Management (IRM) Planning. 

This section describes a planning framework that links the management of information resources to operational and
strategic IRM planning and agency-wide strategic planning. In addition, it expands the scope of the current planning
requirement beyond automatic data processing equipment to planning for all information resources. 

This section reflects changes from the proposal (Sec. 8b(2), 58 FR 47794) to provide more detailed instructions on
the content of agency planning requirements, in response to agency comments. In particular, some material previously
required to be reported to OMB in Section 43 of OMB Circular A-11 are now included in this Circular as required
elements of agency operational information technology plans. 

(3) Information Systems Management Oversight.

Section 8b(3) addresses the need for agencies to create management oversight processes that ensure information
systems meet mission requirements. This represents a slight change in language and emphasis from the proposal (Sec.
8b(3), 58 FR 47794). The language in this final issuance stresses a higher level of agency management attention to
the progress of major information systems projects, with less emphasis on the term ``life cycle management.''
A new policy at Section 8b(3)(g) links the oversight of financial management systems through Circular No. A-127,
Financial Management Systems

 (58 FR 41014-19, July 23, 1993), to the management of information systems more generally. 

(4) 

Use of Information Resources.

A new policy is added at 8b(4) that prompts agencies to address the need for organization-wide frameworks for using
information resources. This clarifies the proposal concerning information and information technology architectures
contained in the section on IRM planning (Sec. 8b(2)(c), FR 58 47794), in response to agency comments. 

The policy statement on the use of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) is dropped from Section 8b of the
Circular (Sec. 8b(14), 50 FR 52737) because it is now covered in Section 8a(1)(h). This change recognizes that the
Computer Security Act of 1987 amended the Brooks Act to give the Secretary of Commerce the responsibility for determining
the applicability of FIPS (see 40 U.S.C. 759(d)).

This section incorporates guidance formerly found in Appendix II (50 FR 52741-42) into Section 8b(4). This
reflects changes in the technical environment surrounding the sharing of federal information processing services
that allow for sharing of more than just mainframe computing resources. Moving this guidance into the policy section
of the Circular gives it more prominence and fosters better integration of these principles in agencies' information
technology management programs.

Section 8b(4) also collapses and simplifies the guidance found in proposed Section 8b(5) (58 FR 47794-5). This
change reflects agency comments that the proposal for Section 8b(5) was too burdensome and detailed to serve its intended
purposes cost-effectively.

Sec. 8b(4)(f) adds a policy statement stating the high-level policy principles of the Computer Security Act of 1987
(U.S.C. 759 note), as requested in several comments. 

(5) Acquisition of Information Technology.

This section applies the economic principle of maximizing return on investment when acquiring information technology.
This supports the criterion used in 8b(1) to evaluate investments in information technology for improvements in
service delivery to the public. It had been proposed as part of a different section (Sec. 8b(4), 58 FR 47794), but now
stands as a separate section in this issuance.

4. Appendix II: Cost Accounting, Cost Recovery, and Interagency Sharing of Information Technology Facilities.


In the July 1993 

Federal Register

 notice (58 FR 36069-70), OMB stated its intention to revise the guidance in Appendix II, issued in 1985 (50 FR
52741-42). In the September 10, 1993, notice OMB proposed to delete the guidance in Appendix II and place revised
guidance in Section 8b (58 FR 47793). This notice contains the revised guidance in Section 8b. Accordingly, policy
pertaining to cost accounting, cost recovery, and interagency sharing of information technology facilities has
been deleted from Appendix II. Appendix II will be reserved for future policy topics.

5. Appendix IV: 

Analysis of Key Sections. 

OMB has completely revised the portion of this appendix pertaining to Section 8b, Information Systems and Information
Technology Management 

(see 50 FR 52748-50) to reflect the changes made in Section 8b. Accordingly, Appendix IV now consists of the discussion
concerning sections 1-8 and 9a(11) of the Circular, contained herein, plus the discussion of Section 9, 

Assignment of Responsibilities

, and 10, 

Oversight

, in Appendix IV from the 1985 issuance (50 FR 52750-51), which remains in effect. 



Development of Future Topics



Section 9, 

Assignment of Responsibilities

, and Section 10, Oversight. As part of the final stage of revising the Circular, OMB will review the assignment of responsibilities
and oversight provisions to ensure that they reflect changes in Section 8, Policies, of the Circular.

Appendix III: 

Security of Federal Automated Information Systems. 

OMB did not amend Appendix III (50 FR 52742-44) in the July 1993 

Federal Register

 notice, and is not amending Appendix III in this notice. OMB intends to issue a proposal that would revise Appendix
III to incorporate requirements of the Computer Security Act of 1987 including requirements for security plans described
in OMB Bulletin 90-08. Those revisions will incorporate changes based on the experience gained in recent computer
security visits to agencies by teams of staff from OMB, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
and the National Security Agency. OMB will also work with NIST to implement recommendations of the Computer Security
and Privacy Advisory Board (established by the Computer Security Act) regarding better coordination between this
Circular and OMB Circular No. A-123.

Accordingly, Circular A-130 is revised as set forth below.

activities in an efficient, effective, and economical manner. To assist agencies in an integrated approach to information
resources management, the Act requires that the Director of OMB develop and implement uniform and consistent information
resources management policies; oversee the development and promote the use of information management principles,
standards, and guidelines; evaluate agency information resources management practices in order to determine their
adequacy and efficiency; and determine compliance of such practices with the policies, principles, standards,
and guidelines promulgated by the Director.

6. 

Definitions:

a. The term ``agency'' means any executive department, military department, government corporation, government
controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Federal government, or any independent
regulatory agency. Within the Executive Office of the President, the term includes only OMB and the Office of Administration.

b. The term ``audiovisual production'' means a unified presentation, developed according to a plan or script, containing
visual imagery, sound or both, and used to convey information.

role in the administration of agency programs, finances, property, or other resources.

r. The term ``records'' means all books, papers, maps, photographs, machine-readable materials, or other documentary
materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government
under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation
by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations, or other activities of the government or because of the informational value of the data in them. Library
and museum material made or acquired and preserved solely for reference or exhibition purposes, extra copies of documents
preserved only for convenience of reference, and stocks of publications and of processed documents are not included.
(44 U.S.C. 3301) 
s. The term ``records management'' means the planning, controlling, directing, organizing, training, promoting,
and other managerial activities involved with respect to records creation, records maintenance and use, and records
disposition in order to achieve adequate and proper documentation of the policies and transactions of the Federal
Government and effective and economical management of agency operations. (44 U.S.C. 2901(2))

t. The term ``service recipient'' means an agency organizational unit, programmatic entity, or chargeable account
that receives information processing services from an Information Processing Services Organization (IPSO). A
service recipient may be either internal or external to the organization responsible for providing information
resources services, but normally does not report either to the manager or director of the IPSO or to the same immediate
supervisor.

7. Basic Considerations and Assumptions:

a. The Federal Government is the largest single producer, collector, consumer, and disseminator of information
in the United States. Because of the extent of the government's information activities, and the dependence of those
activities upon public cooperation, the management of Federal information resources is an issue of continuing importance
to all Federal agencies, State and local governments, and the public.

b. Government information is a valuable national resource. It provides the public with knowledge of the government,
society, and economy_past, present, and future. It is a means to ensure the accountability of government, to manage
the government's operations, to maintain the healthy performance of the economy, and is itself a commodity in the
marketplace.

c. The free flow of information between the government and the public is essential to a democratic society. It is also
essential that the government minimize the Federal paperwork burden on the public, minimize the cost of its information
activities, and maximize the usefulness of government information.

d. In order to minimize the cost and maximize the usefulness of government information, the expected public and private
benefits derived from government information should exceed the public and private costs of the information, recognizing
that the benefits to be derived from government information may not always be quantifiable.

e. The nation can benefit from government information disseminated both by Federal agencies and by diverse nonfederal
parties, including State and local government agencies, educational and other not-for-profit institutions, and
for-profit organizations.

f. Because the public disclosure of government information is essential to the operation of a democracy, the management
of Federal information resources should protect the public's right of access to government information.

g. The individual's right to privacy must be protected in Federal Government information activities involving personal
information.

h. Systematic attention to the management of government records is an essential component of sound public resources
management which ensures public accountability. Together with records preservation, it protects the government's
historical record and guards the legal and financial rights of the government and the public.

i. Agency strategic planning can improve the operation of government programs. The application of information resources
should support an agency's strategic plan to fulfill its mission. The integration of IRM planning with agency strategic
planning promotes the appropriate application of Federal information resources.

j. Because State and local governments are important producers of government information for many areas such as health,
social welfare, labor, transportation, and education, the Federal Government must cooperate with these governments
in the management of information resources.

k. The open and efficient exchange of scientific and technical government information, subject to applicable national
security controls and the proprietary rights of others, fosters excellence in scientific research and effective
use of Federal research and development funds.

l. Information technology is not an end in itself. It is one set of resources that can improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of Federal program delivery.

m. Federal Government information resources management policies and activities can affect, and be affected by,
the information policies and activities of other nations.

n. Users of Federal information resources must have skills, knowledge, and training to manage information resources,
enabling the Federal government to effectively serve the public through automated means.

o. The application of up-to-date information technology presents opportunities to promote fundamental changes
in agency structures, work processes, and ways of interacting with the public that improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of Federal agencies. 

p. The availability of government information in diverse media, including electronic formats, permits agencies
and the public greater flexibility in using the information.

q. Federal managers with program delivery responsibilities should recognize the importance of information resources
management to mission performance.

8. Policy:

a. Information Management Policy

(1) Information Management Planning. 

Agencies shall plan in an integrated manner for managing information throughout its life cycle. Agencies shall:

(a) Consider, at each stage of the information life cycle, the effects of decisions and actions on other stages of the
life cycle, particularly those concerning information dissemination;

(b) Consider the effects of their actions on members of the public and ensure consultation with the public as appropriate;

(c) Consider the effects of their actions on State and local governments and ensure consultation with those governments
as appropriate;

(d) Seek to satisfy new information needs through interagency or intergovernmental sharing of information, or through
commercial sources, where appropriate, before creating or collecting new information;

(e) Integrate planning for information systems with plans for resource allocation and use, including budgeting,
acquisition, and use of information technology;

(f) Train personnel in skills appropriate to management of information;

(g) Protect government information commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm that could result from the loss,
misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of such information;

(h) Use voluntary standards and Federal Information Processing Standards where appropriate or required;

(i) Consider the effects of their actions on the privacy rights of individuals, and ensure that appropriate legal
and technical safeguards are implemented;

agency programs, and to protect the legal and financial rights of the Federal Government;

(k) Incorporate records management and archival functions into the design, development, and implementation of
information systems;

(l) Provide for public access to records where required or appropriate.

(2) 

Information Collection. 

Agencies shall collect or create only that information necessary for the proper performance of agency functions
and which has practical utility.

(3) 

Electronic Information Collection. 

Agencies shall use electronic collection techniques where such techniques reduce burden on the public, increase
efficiency of government programs, reduce costs to the government and the public, and/or provide better service
to the public. Conditions favorable to electronic collection include:

(a) The information collection seeks a large volume of data and/or reaches a large proportion of the public;

(b) The information collection recurs frequently;

(c) The structure, format, and/or definition of the information sought by the information collection does not change
significantly over several years;

(d) The agency routinely converts the information collected to electronic format;

(e) A substantial number of the affected public are known to have ready access to the necessary information technology
and to maintain the information in electronic form; 

(f) Conversion to electronic reporting, if mandatory, will not impose substantial costs or other adverse effects
on the public, especially State and local governments and small business entities.

(4) 

Records Management. 

Agencies shall:

(a) Ensure that records management programs provide adequate and proper documentation of agency activities;

(b) Ensure the ability to access records regardless of form or medium;

(c) In a timely fashion, establish, and obtain the approval of the Archivist of the United States for, retention schedules
for Federal records; and

(d) Provide training and guidance as appropriate to all agency officials and employees and contractors regarding
their Federal records management responsibilities.

(5) 

Providing Information to the Public. 

Agencies have a responsibility to provide information to the public consistent with their missions. Agencies shall
discharge this responsibility by:

(a) Providing information, as required by law, describing agency organization, activities, programs, meetings,
systems of records, and other information holdings, and how the public may gain access to agency information resources;

(b) Providing access to agency records under provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act, subject
to the protections and limitations provided for in these Acts; 

(c) Providing such other information as is necessary or appropriate for the proper performance of agency functions;

(6) 

Information Dissemination Management System. 

Agencies shall maintain and implement a management system for all information dissemination products which shall,
at a minimum:

(a) Assure that information dissemination products are necessary for proper performance of agency functions (44
U.S.C. 1108);

(b) Consider whether an information dissemination product available from other Federal or nonfederal sources is
equivalent to an agency information dissemination product and reasonably fulfills the dissemination responsibilities
of the agency;

(c) Establish and maintain inventories of all agency information dissemination products;

(d) Develop such other aids to locating agency information dissemination products including catalogs and directories,
as may reasonably achieve agency information dissemination objectives;

(e) Identify in information dissemination products the source of the information, if from another agency; 
(f) Ensure that members of the public with disabilities whom the agency has a responsibility to inform have a reasonable
ability to access the information dissemination products;

(h) Provide electronic information dissemination products to the Government Printing Office for distribution
to depository libraries;

(i) Establish and maintain communications with members of the public and with State and local governments so that
the agency creates information dissemination products that meet their respective needs;

(j) Provide adequate notice when initiating, substantially modifying, or terminating significant information
dissemination products; and

(k) Ensure that, to the extent existing information dissemination policies or practices are inconsistent with the
requirements of this Circular, a prompt and orderly transition to compliance with the requirements of this Circular
is made.

(7) 

Avoiding Improperly Restrictive Practices. 

Agencies shall:

(a) Avoid establishing, or permitting others to establish on their behalf, exclusive, restricted, or other distribution
arrangements that interfere with the availability of information dissemination products on a timely and equitable
basis;

(b) Avoid establishing restrictions or regulations, including the charging of fees or royalties, on the reuse, resale,
or redissemination of Federal information dissemination products by the public; and,

(c) Set user charges for information dissemination products at a level sufficient to recover the cost of dissemination
but no higher. They shall exclude from calculation of the charges costs associated with original collection and processing
of the information. Exceptions to this policy are:

(i) Where statutory requirements are at variance with the policy;

(ii) Where the agency collects, processes, and disseminates the information for the benefit of a specific identifiable
group beyond the benefit to the general public;

(iii) Where the agency plans to establish user charges at less than cost of dissemination because of a determination
that higher charges would constitute a significant barrier to properly performing the agency's functions, including
reaching members of the public whom the agency has a responsibility to inform; or

(iv) Where the Director of OMB determines an exception is warranted.

(8) 

Electronic Information Dissemination. 

Agencies shall use electronic media and formats, including public networks, as appropriate and within budgetary
constraints, in order to make government information more easily accessible and useful to the public. The use of electronic
media and formats for information dissemination is appropriate under the following conditions:

(a) The agency develops and maintains the information electronically;

(b) Electronic media or formats are practical and cost effective ways to provide public access to a large, highly detailed
volume of information;

(c) The agency disseminates the product frequently;

(d) The agency knows a substantial portion of users have ready access to the necessary information technology and
training to use electronic information dissemination products;

(e) A change to electronic dissemination, as the sole means of disseminating the product, will not impose substantial
acquisition or training costs on users, especially State and local governments and small business entities.

(9) 

Safeguards. 

Agencies shall:

(a) Ensure that information is protected commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from
the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of such information;

(b) Limit the collection of information which identifies individuals to that which is legally authorized and necessary
for the proper performance of agency functions;

(c) Limit the sharing of information that identifies individuals or contains proprietary information to that which
is legally authorized, and impose appropriate conditions on use where a continuing obligation to ensure the confidentiality
of the information exists;

(d) Provide individuals, upon request, access to records about them maintained in Privacy Act systems of records,
and permit them to amend such records as are in error consistent with the provisions of the Privacy Act.

b. 

Information Systems and Information Technology Management. 

(1) Evaluation and Performance Measurement. 

Agencies shall promote the appropriate application of Federal information resources as follows: 

(a) Seek opportunities to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of government programs through work process
redesign and the judicious application of information technology;

(b) Prepare, and update as necessary throughout the information system life cycle, a benefit-cost analysis for each
information system: 

(i) at a level of detail appropriate to the size of the investment; 

(ii) consistent with the methodology described in OMB Circular No. A-94, ``Guidelines and Discount Rates for
Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs;'' and 

(iii) that relies on systematic measures of mission performance, including the:

(a) effectiveness of program delivery;
(b) efficiency of program administration; and
(c) reduction in burden, including information collection burden, imposed on the public; 

(c) Conduct benefit-cost analyses to support ongoing management oversight processes that maximize return on investment
and minimize financial and operational risk for investments in major information systems on an agency-wide basis;
and

(d) Conduct post-implementation reviews of information systems to validate estimated benefits and document effective
management practices for broader use.

(2) 

Strategic Information Resources Management (IRM) Planning. 

Agencies shall establish and maintain strategic information resources management planning processes which include
the following components:

(a) Strategic IRM planning that addresses how the management of information resources promotes the fulfillment
of an agency's mission. This planning process should support the development and maintenance of a strategic IRM plan
that reflects and anticipates changes in the agency's mission, policy direction, technological capabilities,
or resource levels;

(b) Information planning that promotes the use of information throughout its life cycle to maximize the usefulness
of information, minimize the burden on the public, and preserve the appropriate integrity, availability, and confidentiality
of information. It shall specifically address the planning and budgeting for the information collection burden
imposed on the public as defined by 5 C.F.R. 1320;

(c) Operational information technology planning that links information technology to anticipated program and
mission needs, reflects budget constraints, and forms the basis for budget requests. This planning should result
in the preparation and maintenance of an up-to-date five-year plan, as required by 44 U.S.C. 3506, which includes:

(i) a listing of existing and planned major information systems;

(ii) a listing of planned information technology acquisitions;

(iii) an explanation of how the listed major information systems and planned information technology acquisitions
relate to each other and support the achievement of the agency's mission; and 

iv) a summary of computer security planning, as required by Section 6 of the Computer Security Act of 1987 (40 U.S.C.
759 note); and 

(d) Coordination with other agency planning processes including strategic, human resources, and financial resources.


(3) 

Information Systems Management Oversight. 

Agencies shall establish information system management oversight mechanisms that:

(a) Ensure that each information system meets agency mission requirements; 

(b) Provide for periodic review of information systems to determine:

(i) how mission requirements might have changed; 

(ii) whether the information system continues to fulfill ongoing and anticipated mission requirements; and 

(iii) what level of maintenance is needed to ensure the information system meets mission requirements cost effectively;


(c) Ensure that the official who administers a program supported by an information system is responsible and accountable
for the management of that information system throughout its life cycle;

(d) Provide for the appropriate training for users of Federal information resources;

(e) Prescribe Federal information system requirements that do not unduly restrict the prerogatives of State, local,
and tribal governments;

(f) Ensure that major information systems proceed in a timely fashion towards agreed-upon milestones in an information
system life cycle, meet user requirements, and deliver intended benefits to the agency and affected publics through
coordinated decision making about the information, human, financial, and other supporting resources; and

(g) Ensure that financial management systems conform to the requirements of OMB Circular No. A-127, ``Financial
Management Systems.''

(4) 

Use of Information Resources. 

Agencies shall create and maintain management and technical frameworks for using information resources that document
linkages between mission needs, information content, and information technology capabilities. These frameworks
should guide both strategic and operational IRM planning. They should also address steps necessary to create an open
systems environment. Agencies shall implement the following principles: 

(a) Develop information systems in a manner that facilitates necessary interoperability, application portability,
and scalability of computerized applications across networks of heterogeneous hardware, software, and communications
platforms;

(b) Ensure that improvements to existing information systems and the development of planned information systems
do not unnecessarily duplicate information systems available within the same agency, from other agencies, or from
the private sector;

(c) Share available information systems with other agencies to the extent practicable and legally permissible;

(d) Meet information technology needs through intra-agency and inter-agency sharing, when it is cost effective,
before acquiring new information technology resources;

(e) For Information Processing Service Organizations (IPSOs) that have costs in excess of $5 million per year, agencies
shall: 

(i) account for the full costs of operating all IPSOs;

(ii) recover the costs incurred for providing IPSO services to all service recipients on an equitable basis commensurate
with the costs required to provide those services; and 

(iii) document sharing agreements between service recipients and IPSOs; and

(f) Establish a level of security for all information systems that is commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the
harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information contained in these
information systems.

(5) 

Acquisition of Information Technology. 

Agencies shall:

(a) Acquire information technology in a manner that makes use of full and open competition and that maximizes return
on investment;

(b) Acquire off-the-shelf software from commercial sources, unless the cost effectiveness of developing custom
software to meet mission needs is clear and has been documented;

(c) Acquire information technology in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-109, ``Acquisition of Major Systems,''
where appropriate; and

(d) Acquire information technology in a manner that considers the need for accommodations of accessibility for individuals
with disabilities to the extent that needs for such access exist.

9. 

Assignment of Responsibilities:

a. All Federal Agencies. 

The head of each agency shall:

(1) Have primary responsibility for managing agency information resources;

(2) Ensure that the information policies, principles, standards, guidelines, rules, and regulations prescribed
by OMB are implemented appropriately within the agency;

(3) Develop internal agency information policies and procedures and oversee, evaluate, and otherwise periodically
review agency information resources management activities for conformity with the policies set forth in this Circular;

Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A-130_Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals



1. 

Purpose and Scope.

This Appendix describes agency responsibilities for implementing the reporting and publication requirements
of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended (hereinafter ``the Act''). It applies to all agencies subject
to the Act. Note that this Appendix does not rescind other guidance OMB has issued to help agencies interpret the Privacy
Act's provisions, e.g., Privacy Act Guidelines (40 FR 28949-28978, July 9, 1975), or Final Guidance for Conducting
Matching Programs (54 FR at 25819, June 19, 1989).

2. Definitions.

a. The terms ``agency,'' ``individual,'' ``maintain,'' ``record,'' ``system of records,'' and ``routine use,''
as used in this Appendix, are defined in the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(a)). 

b. Matching Agency. 

Generally, the Recipient Federal agency (or the Federal source agency in a match conducted by a nonfederal agency)
is the matching agency and is responsible for meeting the reporting and publication requirements associated with
the matching program. However, in large, multi-agency matching programs, where the recipient agency is merely performing
the matches and the benefit accrues to the source agencies, the partners should assign responsibility for compliance
with the administrative requirements in a fair and reasonable way. This may mean having the matching agency carry
out these requirements for all parties, having one participant designated to do so, or having each source agency do
so for its own matching program(s).

c. 

Nonfederal Agency. 

Nonfederal agencies are State or local governmental agencies receiving records from a Federal agency's automated
system of records to be used in a matching program. 

d. 

Recipient Agency. 

Recipient agencies are Federal agencies or their contractors receiving automated records from the Privacy Act systems
of records of other Federal agencies, or from State or local governments, to be used in a matching program as defined
in the Act.

e. 

Source Agency. 

A source agency is a Federal agency that discloses automated records from a system of records to another Federal agency
or to a State or local agency to be used in a matching program. It is also a State or local agency that discloses records
to a Federal agency for use in a matching program. 

3. 

Assignment of Responsibilities.

a. All Federal Agencies. 

In addition to meeting the agency requirements contained in the Act and the specific reporting and publication requirements
detailed in this Appendix, the head of each agency shall ensure that the following reviews are conducted as often as
specified below, and be prepared to report to the Director, OMB, the results of such reviews and the corrective action
taken to resolve problems uncovered. The head of each agency shall:

(1) 

Section (m) Contracts. 

Review every two years a random sample of agency contracts that provide for the maintenance of a system of records on
behalf of the agency to accomplish an agency function, in order to ensure that the wording of each contract makes the
provisions of the Act binding on the contractor and his or her employees. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(m)(1))

(2) 

Recordkeeping Practices. 

Review annually agency recordkeeping and disposal policies and practices in order to assure compliance with the
Act, paying particular attention to the maintenance of automated records.

(3) 

Routine Use Disclosures. 

Review every four years the routine use disclosures associated with each system of records in order to ensure that
the recipient's use of such records continues to be compatible with the purpose for which the disclosing agency collected
the information. 

(4) 

Exemption of Systems of Records. 

Review every four years each system of records for which the agency has promulgated exemption rules pursuant to Section
(j) or (k) of the Act in order to determine whether such exemption is still needed.

(5) 

Matching Programs. 

Review annually each ongoing matching program in which the agency has participated during the year, either as a source
or as a matching agency, in order to ensure that the requirements of the Act, the OMB guidance, and any agency regulations,
operating instructions, or guidelines have been met.

(6) 

Privacy Act Training. 

Review annually agency training practices in order to ensure that all agency personnel are familiar with the requirements
of the Act, with the agency's implementing regulation, and with any special requirements of their specific jobs.

(7) 

Violations. 

Review annually the actions of agency personnel that have resulted either in the agency being found civilly liable
under Section (g) of the Act, or an employee being found criminally liable under the provisions of Section (i) of the
Act, in order to determine the extent of the problem and to find the most effective way to prevent recurrence of the problem.

(8) 

Systems of Records Notices. 

Review annually each system of records notice to ensure that it accurately describes the system of records. Where
minor changes are needed, e.g., the name of the system manager, ensure that an amended notice is published in the 

Federal Register

. Agencies may choose to make one annual comprehensive publication consolidating such minor changes. This requirement
is distinguished from and in addition to the requirement to report to OMB and Congress significant changes to systems
of records and to publish those changes in the 

Federal Register

 (See paragraph 4c of this Appendix).

b. 

Department of Commerce. 

The Secretary of Commerce shall, consistent with guidelines issued by the Director, OMB, develop and issue standards
and guidelines for ensuring the security of information protected by the Act in automated information systems.

c. 

The Department of Defense, General Services Administration, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.


These agencies shall, consistent with guidelines issued by the Director, OMB, ensure that instructions are issued
on what agencies must do in order to comply with the requirements of Section (m) of the Act when contracting for the operation
of a system of records to accomplish an agency purpose.

d. 

Office of Personnel Management. 

The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall, consistent with guidelines issued by the Director, OMB:

(1) Develop and maintain government-wide standards and procedures for civilian personnel information processing
and recordkeeping directives to assure conformance with the Act.
(2) Develop and conduct Privacy Act training programs for agency personnel, including both the conduct of courses
in various substantive areas (e.g., administrative, information technology) and the development of materials
that agencies can use in their own courses. The assignment of this responsibility to OPM does not affect the responsibility
of individual agency heads for developing and conducting training programs tailored to the specific needs of their
own personnel.

e. National Archives and Records Administration. The Archivist of the United States through the Office of the Federal
Register, shall, consistent with guidelines issued by the Director, OMB:

(1) Issue instructions on the format of the agency notices and rules required to be published under the Act.

(2) Compile and publish every two years, the rules promulgated under 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) and agency notices published
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) in a form available to the public at low cost.

(3) Issue procedures governing the transfer of records to Federal Records Centers for storage, processing, and servicing
pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3103. For purposes of the Act, such records are considered to be maintained by the agency that
deposited them. The Archivist may disclose deposited records only according to the access rules established by the
agency that deposited them. 
f. 

Office of Management and Budget. 

The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will:

(1) Issue guidelines and directives to the agencies to implement the Act.

(2) Assist the agencies, at their request, in implementing their Privacy Act programs.

(3) Review new and altered system of records and matching program reports submitted pursuant to Section (o) of the
Act.

(4) Compile the biennial report of the President to Congress in accordance with Section (s) of the Act.

(5) Compile and issue a biennial report on the agencies' implementation of the computer matching provisions of the
Privacy Act, pursuant to Section (u)(6) of the Act.

4. 

Reporting Requirements. 

The Privacy Act requires agencies to make the following kinds of reports:






House of Representatives: 
The Chair of the House Committee on Government Operations, 2157 RHOB, Washington, D.C. 20515-6143.
Senate: 
The Chair of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, 340 SDOB, Washington, D.C. 20510-6250.
Office of Management and Budget: 
The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, ATTN: Docket
Library, NEOB Room 3201, Washington, D.C. 20503. 

a. Biennial Privacy Act Report. 

To provide the necessary information for the biennial report of the President, agencies shall submit a biennial report
to OMB, covering their Privacy Act activities for the calendar years covered by the reporting period. The exact format
of the report will be established by OMB. At a minimum, however, agencies should collect and be prepared to report the
following data on a calendar year basis:

(1) A listing of publication activity during the year showing the following:



*-Total Number of Systems of Records (Exempt/NonExempt)
*-Number of New Systems of Records Added (Exempt/NonExempt)
*-Number Routine Uses Added
*-Number Exemptions Added to Existing Systems
*-Number Exemptions Deleted from Existing Systems
*-Total Number of Automated Systems of Records (Exempt/NonExempt)

The agency should provide a brief narrative describing those activities in detail, e.g., ``the Department added
a (k)(1) exemption to an existing system of records entitled ``Investigative Records of the Office of Investigations;''
or ``the agency added a new routine use to a system of records entitled ``Employee Health Records'' that would permit
disclosure of health data to researchers under contract to the agency to perform workplace risk analysis.''

(2) A brief description of any public comments received on agency publication and implementation activities, and
agency response.

(3) Number of access and amendment requests from record subjects citing the Privacy Act that were received during
the calendar year of the report. Also the disposition of requests from any year that were completed during the calendar

the results of any such litigation that resulted in a change to agency practices or affected guidance issued by OMB.

(5) Results of any reviews undertaken in response to paragraph 3a of this Appendix.

(6) Description of agency Privacy Act training activities conducted in accordance with paragraph 3a(6) of this Appendix.

b. Biennial Matching Activity Report 

(See 5 U.S.C. 552a(u)(3)(D)). At the end of each calendar year, the Data Integrity Board of each agency that has participated
in matches covered by the computer matching provisions of the Privacy Act will collect data summarizing that year's
matching activity. The Act requires that such activity be reported every two years. OMB will establish the exact format
of the report, but agencies' Data Integrity Boards should be prepared to report the data identified below both to the
agency head and to OMB.

(1) A listing of the names and positions of the members of the Data Integrity Board and showing separately the name of
the Board Secretary, his or her agency mailing address, and telephone number. Also show and explain any changes in
membership or structure occurring during the reporting year.

(2) A listing of each matching program, by title and purpose, in which the agency participated during the reporting
year. This listing should show names of participant agencies, give a brief description of the program, and give a citation
including the date to the 

Federal Register

 notice describing the program.

(3) For each matching program, an indication of whether the cost/benefit analysis performed resulted in a favorable
ratio. The Data Integrity Board should explain why the agency proceeded with any matching program for which an unfavorable
ratio was reached. 

(4) For each program for which the Board waived a cost/benefit analysis, reasons for the waiver and the results of match,
if tabulated.

(5) A description of each matching agreement the Board rejected and an explanation of why it was rejected.

(8) For any litigation based on allegations of inaccurate records, an explanation of the steps the agency used to ensure
the integrity of its data as well as the verification process it used in the matching program, including an assessment
of the adequacy of each.

c. 

New and Altered System of Records Report. 

The Act requires agencies to publish notices in the 

Federal Register

 describing new or altered systems of records, and to submit reports to OMB, and to the Chair of the Committee on Government
Operations of the House of Representatives, and the Chair of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate.
The reports must be transmitted at least 40 days prior to the operation of the new system of records or the date on which
the alteration to an existing system takes place.

(1) 

When to Report Altered Systems of Records. 

Minor changes to systems of records need not be reported. For example, a change in the designation of the system manager
due to a reorganization would not require a report, so long as an individual's ability to gain access to his or her records
is not affected. Other examples include changing applicable safeguards as a result of a risk analysis or deleting
a routine use when there is no longer a need for the disclosure. The following changes are those for which a report is
required:

(a) A significant increase in the number of individuals about whom records are maintained. For example, a decision
to expand a system that originally covered only residents of public housing in major cities to cover such residents
nationwide would require a report. Increases attributable to normal growth should not be reported.

(b) A change that expands the types or categories of information maintained. For example, a file covering physicians
that has been expanded to include other types of health care providers, e.g., nurses, technicians, etc., would require
a report.

(c) A change that alters the purpose for which the information is used.

(d) A change to equipment configuration (either hardware or software) that creates substantially greater access
to the records in the system of records. For example, locating interactive terminals at regional offices for accessing
a system formerly accessible only at the headquarters would require a report.

(e) The addition of an exemption pursuant to Section (j) or (k) of the Act. Note that, in examining a rulemaking for a
Privacy Act exemption as part of a report of a new or altered system of records, OMB will also review the rule under applicable
regulatory review procedures and agencies need not make a separate submission for that purpose.

(f) The addition of a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3).

(2) 

Reporting Changes to Multiple Systems of Records. 

When an agency makes a change to an information technology installation or a telecommunication network, or makes
any other general changes in information collection, processing, dissemination, or storage that affect multiple
systems of records, it may submit a single, consolidated report, with changes to existing notices and supporting
documentation included in the submission.

(3) 

Contents of the New or Altered System Report. 

The report for a new or altered system has three elements: a transmittal letter, a narrative statement, and supporting
documentation that includes a copy of the proposed 

Federal Register

 notice. There is no prescribed format for either the letter or the narrative statement. The notice must appear in the
format prescribed by the Office of the Federal Register's 

Document Drafting Handbook.

(a) Transmittal Letter. 

The transmittal letter should be signed by the senior agency official responsible for implementation of the Act within
the agency and should contain the name and telephone number of the individual who can best answer questions about the
system of records. The letter should contain the agency's assurance that the proposed system does not duplicate any
existing agency or government-wide systems of records. The letter sent to OMB may also include requests for waiver
of the time period for the review. The agency should indicate why it cannot meet the established review period and what
will be the consequences of not obtaining the waiver, (see paragraph 4e below).

(b) 

Narrative Statement. 

The narrative statement should be brief. It should make reference, as appropriate, to information in the supporting
documentation rather than restating such information. The statement should:

1. Describe the purpose for which the agency is establishing the system of records.

2. Identify the authority under which the system of records is maintained. The agency should avoid citing housekeeping
statutes, but rather cite the underlying programmatic authority for collecting, maintaining, and using the information.
When the system is being operated to support an agency housekeeping program, e.g., a carpool locator, the agency may,
however, cite a general housekeeping statute that authorizes the agency head to keep such records as necessary.

3. Provide the agency's evaluation of the probable or potential effect of the proposal on the privacy of individuals.

4. Provide a brief description of the steps taken by the agency to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the system
of records. A more detailed assessment of the risks and specific administrative, technical, procedural, and physical
safeguards established shall be made available to OMB upon request.

5. Explain how each proposed routine use satisfies the compatibility requirement of subsection (a)(7) of the Act.
For altered systems, this requirement pertains only to any newly proposed routine use.

6. Provide OMB Control Numbers, expiration dates, and titles of any OMB approved information collection requests
(e.g., forms, surveys, etc.) contained in the system of records. If the request for OMB clearance of an information
collection is pending, the agency may simply state the title of the collection and the date it was submitted for OMB
clearance.

(c) 

Supporting Documentation. 

Attach the following to all new or altered system of records reports:

1. A copy of the new or altered system of records notice in 

Federal Register

 format, consistent with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4). For proposed altered systems the agency should supply
a copy of the original system of records notice to ensure that reviewers can understand the changes proposed.

2. A copy in 

Federal Register

 format of any new exemption rules or changes to published rules (consistent with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(f),(j),
or (k)) that the agency proposes to issue for the new or altered system. 

(4) 

OMB Concurrence. 

Agencies may assume that OMB concurs in the Privacy Act aspects of their proposal if OMB has not commented within 40
days from the date the transmittal letter was signed. Agencies should ensure that letters are transmitted expeditiously
after they are signed. Agencies may publish system of records and routine use notices as well as proposed exemption
rules in the 

Federal Register

 at the same time that they send the new or altered system report to OMB and Congress. The period for OMB and congressional
review and the notice and comment period for routine uses and exemptions will then run concurrently. Note that exemptions
must be published as final rules before they are effective.

d. 

New or Altered Matching Program Report. 

The Act requires agencies to publish notices in the 

Federal Register

 describing new or altered matching programs, and to submit reports to OMB, and to Congress. The report must be received
at least 40 days prior to the initiation of any matching activity carried out under a new or substantially altered matching
program. For renewals of continuing programs, the report must be dated at least 40 days prior to the expiration of any
existing matching agreement.

(1) 

When to Report Altered Matching Programs. 

Agencies need not report minor changes to matching programs. The term ``minor change to a matching program'' means
a change that does not significantly alter the terms of the agreement under which the program is being carried out.
Examples of significant changes include: 

(a) Changing the purpose for which the program was established.

(b) Changing the matching population, either by including new categories of record subjects or by greatly increasing
the numbers of records matched.

(c) Changing the legal authority covering the matching program.

(d) Changing the source or recipient agencies involved in the matching program.

(2) 

Contents of New or Altered Matching Program Report. 

The report for a new or altered matching program has three elements: a transmittal letter, a narrative statement,
and supporting documentation that includes a copy of the proposed 

Federal Register

 notice. There is no prescribed format for either the letter or the narrative statement. The notice must appear in the
format prescribed by the Office of the Federal Register's 

Document Drafting Handbook.

(a) Transmittal Letter. 

The transmittal letter should be signed by the senior agency official responsible for implementation of the Privacy
Act within the agency and should contain the name and telephone number of the individual who can best answer questions
about the matching program. The letter should state that a copy of the matching agreement has been distributed to Congress
as the Act requires. The letter to OMB may also include a request for waiver of the review time period.

(b) 

Narrative Statement. 

 The narrative statement should be brief. It should make reference, as appropriate, to information in the supporting
documentation rather than restating such information. The statement should provide:

1. A description of the purpose of the matching program and the authority under which it is being carried out.

2. A description of the security safeguards used to protect against any unauthorized access or disclosure of records
used in the match.

3. If the cost/benefit analysis required by Section (u)(4)(A) indicated an unfavorable ratio or was waived pursuant
to OMB guidance, an explanation of the basis on which the agency justifies conducting the match.

(c) 

Supporting Documentation. 

Attach the following:

1. A copy of the 

Federal Register

 notice describing the matching program.

2. For the Congressional report only, a copy of the matching agreement.

(3) 

OMB Concurrence. 

Agencies may assume that OMB concurs in the Privacy Act aspects of their proposal if OMB has not commented within 40
days from the date the transmittal letter was signed. Agencies should ensure that letters are transmitted expeditiously
after they are signed. Agencies may publish matching program notices in the 

Federal Register

 at the same time that they send the matching program report to OMB and Congress. The period for OMB and congressional
review and the notice and comment period will then run concurrently.

e. 

Expediting the Review Process. 

The Director, OMB, may grant a waiver of the 40-day review period for either systems of records or matching program
reviews. The agency must ask for the waiver in the transmittal letter and demonstrate compelling reasons. When a waiver
is granted, the agency is not thereby relieved of any other requirement of the Act. If no waiver is granted, agencies
may presume concurrence at the expiration of the 40 day review period. Note that OMB cannot waive time periods specifically
established by the Act such as the 30 days notice and comment period required for the adoption of a routine use proposal
pursuant to Section (b)(3) of the Act. 

5. 

Publication Requirements. 

The Privacy Act requires agencies to publish notices or rules in the 

Federal Register

 in the following circumstances: when adopting a new or altered system of records, when adopting a routine use or exemption
for a system of records, or when proposing to carry out a new or altered matching program. (See paragraph 4c(1) and 4d(1)
above on what constitutes a reportable alteration.)

a. 

Publishing New or Altered Systems of Records Notices and Exemption Rules.

(1) Who Publishes. 

The agency responsible for operating the system of records makes the necessary publication. Publication should
be carried out at the departmental or agency level. Where a system of records is to be operated exclusively by a component,
the department rather than the component should publish the notice. Thus, for example, the Department of the Treasury
would publish a system of records notice covering a system operated exclusively by the Internal Revenue Service.
Note that if the agency is proposing to exempt the system under Section (j) or (k) of the Act, it must publish a rule in
addition to the system of records notice.

(a) 

Government-wide Systems of Records. 

Certain agencies publish systems of records containing records for which they have government-wide responsibilities.
The records may be located in other agencies, but they are being used under the authority of and in conformance with
the rules mandated by the publishing agency. The Office of Personnel Management, for example, has published a number
of government-wide systems of records relating to the operation of the government's personnel program. Agencies
should not publish systems of records that wholly or partly duplicate existing government-wide systems of records.

(b) 

Section (m) Contract Provisions. 

When an agency provides by contract for the operation of a system of records, it should ensure that a system of records
notice describing the system has been published. It should also review the notice to ensure that it contains a routine
use under Section (e)(4)(D) of the Act permitting disclosure to the contractor and his or her personnel.

(2) 

When to Publish. 

(a) System Notice. 

It must appear in the 

Federal Register

 before the agency begins to operate the system, e.g., collect and use the information. 

(b) 

Routine Use. 

Must be published in the 

Federal Register

 30 days before agency discloses records pursuant to its terms. If the sole change to an existing system of records is
to add a routine use, the agency should either republish the entire system of records notice, a condensed description
of the system of records, or a citation to the last full text 

Federal Register

 publication. (Note that the addition of a routine use to an existing system of records requires a report to OMB and Congress,
and that the review period for this report is 

40 

days.)

(c) 

Exemption Rule. 

Must be established through informal rulemaking pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. This process generally
requires publication of a proposed rule, a period during which the public may comment, publication of a final rule,
and the adoption of the final rule. Agencies may not withhold records under an exemption until these requirements
have been met. 

(3) 

Format. 

Agencies should follow the publication format contained in the Office of the Federal Register's 

Document Drafting Handbook 

obtainable from the Government Printing Office.

b. 

Publishing Matching Notices.

(1) Who Publishes. 

Generally, the Recipient Federal agency (or the Federal source agency in a match conducted by a nonfederal agency)
is responsible for publishing in the 

Federal Register

 a notice describing the new or altered matching program. However, in large, multi-agency matching programs, where
the recipient agency is merely performing the matches, and the benefit accrues to the source agencies, the partners
should assign responsibility for compliance with the administrative requirements in a fair and reasonable way.
This may mean having the matching agency carry out these requirements for all parties, having one participant designated
to do so, or having each source so for its own matching program(s). 

(2) 

Timing.

 Publication must occur at least 30 days prior to the initiation of any matching activity carried out under a new or substantially
altered matching program. For renewals of programs agencies wish to continue past the 30 month period of initial eligibility
(i.e., the initial 18 months plus a 1 year extension), publication must occur at least 30 days prior to the expiration
of the existing matching agreement. (But note that a report to OMB and the Congress is also required with a 40 day review
period).

(3) 

Format.

 The matching notice shall be in the format prescribed by the Office of the Federal Register's 

Document Drafting Handbook 

and contain the following information:

(a) The name of the Recipient Agency.

(b) The Name(s) of the Source Agencies.

(c) The beginning and ending dates of the match.

(d) A brief description of the matching program, including its purpose; the legal authorities authorizing its operation;
categories of individuals involved; and identification of records used, including name(s) of Privacy Act Systems
of records.

(e) The identification, address, and telephone number of a Recipient Agency official who will answer public inquiries
about the program.

Appendix IV to OMB Circular No. A-130


Analysis of Key Sections




1. Purpose

The purpose of this Appendix is to provide a general context and explanation for the contents of the key Sections of
the Circular.

2. Background

The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980, Public Law 96-511, 94 Stat. 2812, codified at Chapter 35 of Title 44
of the United States Code, establishes a broad mandate for agencies to perform their information activities in an
efficient, effective, and economical manner. Section 3504 of the Act provides authority to the Director, OMB, to
develop and implement uniform and consistent information resources management policies; oversee the development
and promote the use of information management principles, standards, and guidelines; evaluate agency information
management practices in order to determine their adequacy and efficiency, and determine compliance of such practices
with the policies, principles, standards, and guidelines promulgated by the Director.

The Circular implements OMB authority under the Act with respect to Section 3504(b), general information policy,
Section 3504(e), records management, Section 3504(f), privacy, and Section 3504(g), Federal automatic data processing
and telecommunications; the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a); the Chief Financial Officers Act (31 U.S.C. 3512
et seq.); Sections 111 and 206 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C.
759 and 487, respectively); the Computer Security Act (40 U.S.C. 759 note); the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 (31
U.S.C. 1 et seq.); and Executive Order No. 12046 of March 27, 1978, and Executive Order No. 12472 of April 3, 1984, Assignment
of National Security and Emergency Telecommunications Functions. The Circular complements 5 CFR Part 1320, Controlling
Paperwork Burden on the Public, which implements other Sections of the PRA dealing with controlling the reporting
and recordkeeping burden placed on the public.

In addition, the Circular revises and consolidates policy and procedures in seven previous OMB directives and rescinds
those directives, as follows:

A-3_Government Publications

A-71_Responsibilities for the Administration and Management of Automatic Data Processing Activities Transmittal
Memorandum No. 1 to Circular No. A-71_Security of Federal Automated Information Systems 

A-90_Cooperating with State and Local Governments to Coordinate and Improve Information Systems

A-108_Responsibilities for the Maintenance of Records about Individuals by Federal Agencies

A-114_Management of Federal Audiovisual Activities

A-121_Cost Accounting, Cost Recovery, and Interagency Sharing of Data Processing Facilities 

3. Analysis

Section 6, Definitions. Access and Dissemination. 

The original Circular No. A-130 distinguished between the terms ``access to information'' and ``dissemination
of information'' in order to separate statutory requirements from policy considerations. The first term means giving
members of the public, at their request, information to which they are entitled by a law such as the FOIA. The latter
means actively distributing information to the public at the initiative of the agency. The distinction appeared
useful at the time Circular No. A-130 was written, because it allowed OMB to focus discussion on Federal agencies'
responsibilities for actively distributing information. However, popular usage and evolving technology have
blurred differences between the terms ``access'' and ``dissemination'' and readers of the Circular were confused
by the distinction. For example, if an agency ``disseminates'' information via an on-line computer system, one speaks
of permitting users to ``access'' the information, and on-line ``access'' becomes a form of ``dissemination.''

Thus, the revision defines only the term ``dissemination.'' Special considerations based on access statutes such
as the Privacy Act and the FOIA are explained in context.



Government Information. 

The definition of ``government information'' includes information created, collected, processed, disseminated,
or disposed of both by and for the Federal Government. This recognizes the increasingly distributed nature of information
in electronic environments. Many agencies, in addition to collecting information for government use and for dissemination
to the public, require members of the public to maintain information or to disclose it to the public. Sound information
resources management dictates that agencies consider the costs and benefits of a full range of alternatives to meet
government objectives. In some cases, there is no need for the government actually to collect the information itself,
only to assure that it is made publicly available. For example, banks insured by the FDIC must provide statements of
financial condition to bank customers on request. Particularly when information is available in electronic form,
networks make the physical location of information increasingly irrelevant.

The inclusion of information created, collected, processed, disseminated, or disposed of for the Federal Government
in the definition of ``government information'' does not imply that responsibility for implementing the provisions
of the Circular itself extends beyond the executive agencies to other entities. Such an interpretation would be inconsistent
with Section 4, Applicability, and with existing law. For example, the courts have held that requests to Federal agencies
for release of information under the FOIA do not always extend to those performing information activities under grant
or contract to a Federal agency. Similarly, grantees may copyright information where the government may not. Thus
the information responsibilities of grantees and contractors are not identical to those of Federal agencies except
to the extent that the agencies make them so in the underlying grants or contracts. Similarly, agency information
resources management responsibilities do not extend to other entities. 



Information Dissemination Product. 

This notice defines the term ``information dissemination product'' to include all information that is disseminated
by Federal agencies. While the provision of access to on-line databases and search software included on compact disk,
read-only memory (CD-ROM) are often called information services rather than products, there is no clear distinction
and, moreover, no real difference for policy purposes between the two. Thus, the term ``information dissemination
product'' applies to both products and services, and makes no distinction based on how the information is delivered.

Section 8a(1). 

Information Management Planning. 

Parallel to new Section 7, Basic Considerations and Assumptions, Section 8a begins with information resources management
planning. Planning is the process of establishing a course of action to achieve desired results with available resources.
Planners translate organizational missions into specific goals and, in turn, into measurable objectives.

The PRA introduced the concept of information resources management and the principle of information as an institutional
resource which has both value and associated costs. Information resources management is a tool that managers use
to achieve agency objectives. Information resources management is successful if it enables managers to achieve
agency objectives efficiently and effectively.

Information resources management planning is an integral part of overall mission planning. Agencies need to plan
from the outset for the steps in the information life cycle. When creating or collecting information, agencies must
plan how they will process and transmit the information, how they will use it, how they will protect its integrity,
what provisions they will make for access to it, whether and how they will disseminate it, how they will store and retrieve
it, and finally, how the information will ultimately be disposed of. They must also plan for the effects their actions
and programs will have on the public and State and local governments. 


The Role of State and Local Governments. 

OMB made additions at Sections 7a, 7e, and 7j, Basic Considerations and Assumptions, concerning State and local governments,
and also in policy statements at Sections 8a(1)(c), (3)(f), (5)(d)(iii), and (8)(e).

State and local governments, and tribal governments, cooperate as major partners with the Federal Government in
the collection, processing, and dissemination of information. For example, State governments are the principal
collectors and/or producers of information in the areas of health, welfare, education, labor markets, transportation,
the environment, and criminal justice. The States supply the Federal Government with data on aid to families with
dependent children; medicare; school enrollments, staffing, and financing; statistics on births, deaths, and
infectious diseases; population related data that form the basis for national estimates; employment and labor market
data; and data used for census geography. National information resources are greatly enhanced through these major
cooperating efforts.

Federal agencies need to be sensitive to the role of State and local governments, and tribal governments, in managing
information and in managing information technology. When planning, designing, and carrying out information collections,
agencies should systematically consider what effect their activities will have on cities, counties, and States,
and take steps to involve these governments as appropriate. Agencies should ensure that their information collections
impose the minimum burden and do not duplicate or conflict with local efforts or other Federal agency requirements
or mandates. The goal is that Federal agencies routinely integrate State and local government concerns into Federal
information resources management practices. This goal is consistent with standards for State and local government
review of Federal policies and programs.



Training. 

Training is particularly important in view of the changing nature of information resources management. Decentralization
of information technology has placed the management of automated information and information technology directly
in the hands of nearly all agency personnel rather than in the hands of a few employees at centralized facilities. Agencies
must plan for incorporating policies and procedures regarding computer security, records management, protection
of privacy, and other safeguards into the training of every employee and contractor.

Section 8a(2). 

Information Collection. 

The PRA requires that the creation or collection of information be carried out in an efficient, effective, and economical
manner. When Federal agencies create or collect information_just as when they perform any other program functions_they
consume scarce resources. Such activities must be continually evaluated for their relevance to agency missions.

Agencies must justify the creation or collection of information based on their statutory functions. Policy statement
8a(2) uses the justification standard_``necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency''_established
by the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3504(c)(2)). Furthermore, the policy statement includes the requirement that the information
have practical utility, as defined in the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3502(16)) and elaborated in 5 CFR Part 1320. Practical utility
includes such qualities of information as accuracy, adequacy, and reliability. In the case of general purpose statistics
or recordkeeping, practical utility means that actual uses can be demonstrated (5 CFR 1320.7(o)). It should be noted
that OMB's intent in placing emphasis on reducing unjustified burden in collecting information, an emphasis consistent
with the Act, is not to diminish the importance of collecting information whenever agencies have legitimate program
reasons for doing so. Rather, the concern is that the burdens imposed should not exceed the benefits to be derived from
the information. Moreover, if the same benefit can be obtained by alternative means that impose a lesser burden, that
alternative should be adopted.

Section 8a(3). 

Electronic Information Collection. 

Section 7l articulates a basic assumption of the Circular that modern information technology can help the government
provide better service to the public through improved management of government programs. One potentially useful
application of information technology is in the government's collection of information. While some information
collections may not be good candidates for electronic techniques, many are. Agencies with major electronic information
collection programs have found that automated information collections allow them to meet program objectives more
efficiently and effectively. Electronic data interchange (EDI) and related standards for the electronic exchange
of information will ease transmission and processing of routine business transaction information such as invoices,
purchase orders, price information, bills of lading, health insurance claims, and other common commercial documents.
EDI holds similar promise for the routine filing of regulatory information such as tariffs, customs declarations,
license applications, tax information, and environmental reports.

Benefits to the public and agencies from electronic information collection appear substantial. Electronic methods
of collection reduce paperwork burden, reduce errors, facilitate validation, and provide increased convenience
and more timely receipt of benefits. 

The policy in Section 8a(3) encourages agencies to explore the use of automated techniques for collection of information,
and sets forth conditions conducive to the use of those techniques.

Section 8a(4). 

Records Management. 

Section 8a(4) begins with the fundamental requirement for Federal records management, namely, that agencies create
and keep adequate and proper documentation of their activities. Federal agencies cannot carry out their missions
in a responsible and responsive manner without adequate recordkeeping. Section 7h articulates the basic considerations
concerning records management. Policy statements concerning records management are also interwoven throughout
Section 8a, particularly in subsections on planning (8a(1)(j)), information dissemination (8a(6)), and safeguards
(8a(9)).

Records support the immediate needs of government_administrative, legal, fiscal_and ensure its continuity. Records
are essential for protecting the rights and interests of the public, and for monitoring the work of public servants.
The government needs records to ensure accountability to the public which includes making the information available
to the public. 
Each stage of the information life cycle carries with it records management responsibilities. Agencies need to record
their plans, carefully document the content and procedures of information collection, ensure proper documentation
as a feature of every information system, keep records of dissemination programs, and, finally, ensure that records
of permanent value are preserved.

Preserving records for future generations is the archival mission. Advances in technology affect the amount of information
that can be created and saved, and the ways this information can be made available. Technological advances can ease
the task of records management; however, the rapid pace of change in modern technology makes decisions about the appropriate
application of technology critical to records management. Increasingly the records manager must be concerned with
preserving valuable electronic records in the context of a constantly changing technological environment.

Records schedules are essential for the appropriate maintenance and disposition of records. Records schedules
must be prepared in a timely fashion, implement the General Records Schedules issued by the National Archives and
Records Administration, be approved by the Archivist of the United States, and be kept accurate and current. (See
44 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) The National Archives and Records Administration and the General Services Administration
provide guidance and assistance to agencies in implementing records management responsibilities. They also evaluate
agencies' records management programs to determine the extent to which they are appropriately implementing their
records management responsibilities.

Sections 8a(5) and 8a(6). 

Information Dissemination Policy. 

Section 8a(5). Every agency has a responsibility to inform the public within the context of its mission. This responsibility
requires that agencies distribute information at the agency's initiative, rather than merely responding when the
public requests information.

The FOIA requires each agency to publish in the 

Federal Register

 current descriptions of agency organization, where and how the public may obtain information, the general methods
and procedural requirements by which agency functions are determined, rules of procedure, descriptions of forms
and how to obtain them, substantive regulations, statements of general policy, and revisions to all the foregoing
(5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)). The Privacy Act also requires publication of information concerning ``systems of records''
which are records retrieved by individual identifier such as name, Social Security Number, or fingerprint. The Government
in the Sunshine Act requires agencies to publish meeting announcements (5 U.S.C. 552b (e)(1)). The PRA (44 U.S.C.
3507(a)(2)) and its implementing regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) require agencies to publish notices when they submit
information collection requests for OMB approval. The public's right of access to government information under
these statutes is balanced against other concerns, such as an individual's right to privacy and protection of the
government's deliberative process.

As agencies satisfy these requirements, they provide the public basic information about government activities.
Other statutes direct specific agencies to issue specific information dissemination products or to conduct information
dissemination programs. Beyond generic and specific statutory requirements, agencies have responsibilities
to disseminate information as a necessary part of performing their functions. For some agencies the responsibility
is made explicit and sweeping; for example, the Agriculture Department is directed to ``...diffuse among people
of the United States, useful information on subjects connected with agriculture....'' (7 U.S.C. 2201) For other
agencies, the responsibility may be much more narrowly drawn.

Information dissemination is also a consequence of other agency activities. Agency programs normally include an
organized effort to inform the public about the program. Most agencies carry out programs that create or collect information
with the explicit or implicit intent that the information will be made public. Disseminating information is in many
cases the logical extension of information creation or collection.

In other cases, agencies may have information that is not meant for public dissemination but which may be the subject
of requests from the public. When the agency establishes that there is public demand for the information and that it
is in the public interest to disseminate the information, the agency may decide to disseminate it automatically.

The policy in Section 8a(5)(d) sets forth several factors for agencies to take into account in conducting their information
dissemination programs. First, agencies must balance two goals: maximizing the usefulness of the information to
the government and the public, and minimizing the cost to both. Deriving from the basic purposes of the PRA (44 U.S.C.
3501), the two goals are frequently in tension because increasing usefulness usually costs more. Second, Section
8a(5)(d)(ii) requires agencies to conduct information dissemination programs equitably and in a timely manner.
The word ``equal'' was removed from this Section since there may be instances where, for example, an agency determines
that its mission includes disseminating information to certain specific groups or members of the public, and the
agency determines that user charges will constitute a significant barrier to carrying out this responsibility.


Section 8a(5)(d)(iii), requiring agencies to take advantage of all dissemination channels, recognizes that information
reaches the public in many ways. Few persons may read a 

Federal Register

 notice describing an agency action, but those few may be major secondary disseminators of the information. They may
be affiliated with publishers of newspapers, newsletters, periodicals, or books; affiliated with on-line database
providers; or specialists in certain information fields. While millions of information users in the public may be
affected by the agency's action, only a handful may have direct contact with the agency's own information dissemination
products. As a deliberate strategy, therefore, agencies should cooperate with the information's original creators,
as well as with secondary disseminators, in order to further information dissemination goals and foster a diversity
of information sources. An adjunct responsibility to this strategy is reflected in Section 8a(5)(d)(iv), which
directs agencies to assist the public in finding government information. Agencies may accomplish this, for example,
by specifying and disseminating ``locator'' information, including information about content, format, uses and
limitations, location, and means of access.

Section 8a(6). 

Information Dissemination Management System. 

This Section requires agencies to maintain an information dissemination management system which can ensure the
routine performance of certain functions, including the essential functions previously required by Circular No.
A-3. Smaller agencies need not establish elaborate formal systems, so long as the heads of the agencies can ensure
that the functions are being performed.

Subsection (6)(a) carries over a requirement from OMB Circular No. A-3 that agencies' information dissemination
products are to be, in the words of 44 U.S.C. 1108, ``necessary in the transaction of the public business required by
law of the agency.'' (Circular No. A-130 uses the expression ``necessary for the proper performance of agency
functions,'' which OMB considers to be equivalent to the expression in 44 U.S.C. 1108.) The point is that agencies
should determine systematically the need for each information dissemination product.

Section 8a(6)(b) recognizes that to carry out effective information dissemination programs, agencies need knowledge
of the marketplace in which their information dissemination products are placed. They need to know what other information
dissemination products users have available in order to design the best agency product. As agencies are constrained
by finite budgets, when there are several alternatives from which to choose, they should not expend public resources
filling needs which have already been met by others in the public or private sector. Agencies have a responsibility
not to undermine the existing diversity of information sources.

At the same time, an agency's responsibility to inform the public may be independent of the availability or potential
availability of a similar information dissemination product. That is, even when another governmental or private
entity has offered an information dissemination product identical or similar to what the agency would produce, the
agency may conclude that it nonetheless has a responsibility to disseminate its own product. Agencies should minimize
such instances of duplication but could reach such a conclusion because legal considerations require an official
government information dissemination product.

Section 8a(6)(c) makes the Circular consistent with current practice (See OMB Bulletins 88-15, 89-15,
90-09, and 91-16), by requiring agencies to establish and maintain inventories of information dissemination
products. (These bulletins eliminated annual reporting to OMB of title-by-title listings of publications and the
requirement for agencies to obtain OMB approval for each new periodical. Publications are now reviewed as necessary
during the normal budget review process.) Inventories help other agencies and the public identify information which
is available. This serves both to increase the efficiency of the dissemination function and to avoid unnecessary
burdens of duplicative information collections. A corollary, enunciated in Section 8a(6)(d), is that agencies
can better serve public information needs by developing finding aids for locating information produced by the agencies.
Finally, Section 8a(6)(f) recognizes that there will be situations where agencies may have to take appropriate steps
to ensure that members of the public with disabilities whom the agency has a responsibility to inform have a reasonable
ability to access the information dissemination products.



Depository Library Program. 

Sections 8a(6)(g) and (h) pertain to the Federal Depository Library Program. Agencies are to establish procedures
to ensure compliance with 44 U.S.C. 1902, which requires that government publications (defined in 44 U.S.C. 1901
and repeated in Section 6 of the Circular) be made available to depository libraries through the Government Printing
Office (GPO).

Depository libraries are major partners with the Federal Government in the dissemination of information and contribute
significantly to the diversity of information sources available to the public. They provide a mechanism for wide
distribution of government information that guarantees basic availability to the public. Executive branch agencies
support the depository library program both as a matter of law and on its merits as a means of informing the public about
the government. On the other hand, the law places the administration of depository libraries with GPO. Agency responsibility
for the depository libraries is limited to supplying government publications through GPO. 

Agencies can improve their performance in providing government publications as well as electronic information
dissemination products to the depository library program. For example, the proliferation of ``desktop publishing''
technology in recent years has afforded the opportunity for many agencies to produce their own printed documents.
Many such documents may properly belong in the depository libraries but are not sent because they are not printed at
GPO. The policy requires agencies to establish management controls to ensure that the appropriate documents reach
the GPO for inclusion in the depository library program.

At present, few agencies provide electronic information dissemination products to the depository libraries. At
the same time, a small but growing number of information dissemination products are disseminated only in electronic
format. 

OMB believes that, as a matter of policy, electronic information dissemination products generally should be provided
to the depository libraries. Given that production and supply of information dissemination products to the depository
libraries is primarily the responsibility of GPO, agencies should provide appropriate electronic information
dissemination products to GPO for inclusion in the depository library program.

While cost may be a consideration, agencies should not conclude without investigation that it would be prohibitively
expensive to place their electronic information dissemination products in the depository libraries. For electronic
information dissemination products other than on-line services, agencies may have the option of having GPO produce
the information dissemination product for them, in which case GPO would pay for depository library costs. Agencies
should consider this option if it would be a cost effective alternative to the agency making its own arrangements for
production of the information dissemination product. Using GPO's services in this manner is voluntary and at the
agency's discretion. Agencies could also consider negotiating other terms, such as inviting GPO to participate
in agency procurement orders in order to distribute the necessary copies for the depository libraries. With adequate
advance planning, agencies should be able to provide electronic information dissemination products to the depository
libraries at nominal cost.

In a particular case, substantial cost may be a legitimate reason for not providing an electronic information dissemination
product to the depository library program. For example, for an agency with a substantial number of existing titles
of electronic information dissemination products, furnishing copies of each to the depository libraries could
be prohibitively expensive. In that situation, the agency should endeavor to make available those titles with the
greatest general interest, value, and utility to the public. Substantial cost could also be an impediment in the case
of some on-line information services where the costs associated with operating centralized databases would make
provision of unlimited direct access to numerous users prohibitively expensive. In both cases, agencies should
consult with the GPO, in order to identify those information dissemination products with the greatest public interest
and utility for dissemination. In all cases, however, where an agency discontinues publication of an information
dissemination product in paper format in favor of electronic formats, the agency should work with the GPO to ensure
availability of the information dissemination product to depository libraries.



Notice to the Public. 

Sections 8a(6)(i) and (j) present new practices for agencies to observe in communicating with the public about information
dissemination. Among agencies' responsibilities for dissemination is an active knowledge of, and regular consultation
with, the users of their information dissemination products. A primary reason for communication with users is to
gain their contribution to improving the quality and relevance of government information_how it is created, collected,
and disseminated. Consultations with users might include participation at conferences and workshops, careful
attention to correspondence and telephone communications (e.g., logging and analyzing inquiries), or formalized
user surveys.

A key part of communicating with the public is providing adequate notice of agency information dissemination plans.
Because agencies' information dissemination actions affect other agencies as well as the public, agencies must
forewarn other agencies of significant actions. The decision to initiate, terminate, or substantially modify the
content, form, frequency, or availability of significant products should also trigger appropriate advance public
notice. Where appropriate, the Government Printing Office should be notified directly. Information dissemination
products deemed not to be significant require no advance notice.

Examples of significant products (or changes to them) might be those that:

(a) are required by law; e.g., a statutorily mandated report to Congress; 

(b) involve expenditure of substantial funds; 
(c) by reason of the nature of the information, are matters of continuing public interest; e.g., a key economic indicator;


(d) by reason of the time value of the information, command public interest; e.g., monthly crop reports on the day of
their release; 

(e) will be disseminated in a new format or medium; e.g., disseminating a printed product in electronic medium, or
disseminating a machine-readable data file via on-line access. 

Where members of the public might consider a proposed new agency product unnecessary or duplicative, the agency should
solicit and evaluate public comments. Where users of an agency information dissemination product may be seriously
affected by the introduction of a change in medium or format, the agency should notify users and consider their views
before instituting the change. Where members of the public consider an existing agency product important and necessary,
the agency should consider these views before deciding to terminate the product. In all cases, however, determination
of what is a significant information dissemination product and what constitutes adequate notice are matters of agency
judgment.



Achieving Compliance with the Circular's Requirements. 

Section 8a(6)(k) requires that the agency information dissemination management system ensure that, to the extent
existing information dissemination policies or practices are inconsistent with the requirements of this Circular,
an orderly transition to compliance with the requirements of this Circular is made. For example, some agency information
dissemination products may be priced at a level which exceeds the cost of dissemination, or the agency may be engaged
in practices which are otherwise unduly restrictive. In these instances, agencies must plan for an orderly transition
to the substantive policy requirements of the Circular. The information dissemination management system must be
capable of identifying these situations and planning for a reasonably prompt transition. Instances of existing
agency practices which cannot immediately be brought into conformance with the requirements of the Circular are
to be addressed through the waiver procedures of Section 10(b). 

Section 8a(7). 

Avoiding Improperly Restrictive Practices. 

Federal agencies are often the sole suppliers of the information they hold. The agencies have either created or collected
the information using public funds, usually in furtherance of unique governmental functions, and no one else has
it. Hence agencies need to take care that their behavior does not inappropriately constrain public access to government
information.

When agencies use private contractors to accomplish dissemination, they must take care that they do not permit contractors
to impose restrictions that undercut the agencies' discharge of their information dissemination responsibilities.
The contractual terms should assure that, with respect to dissemination, the contractor behaves as though the contractor
were the agency. For example, an agency practice of selling, through a contractor, on-line access to a database but
refusing to sell copies of the database itself may be improperly restrictive because it precludes the possibility
of another firm making the same service available to the public at a lower price. If an agency is willing to provide public
access to a database, the agency should be willing to sell copies of the database itself.

By the same reasoning, agencies should behave in an even-handed manner in handling information dissemination products.
If an agency is willing to sell a database or database services to some members of the public, the agency should sell
the same products under similar terms to other members of the public, unless prohibited by statute. When an agency
decides it has public policy reasons for offering different terms of sale to different groups in the public, the agency
should provide a clear statement of the policy and its basis.

Agencies should not attempt to exert control over the secondary uses of their information dissemination products.
In particular, agencies should not establish exclusive, restricted, or other distribution arrangements which
interfere with timely and equitable availability of information dissemination products, and should not charge
fees or royalties for the resale or redissemination of government information. These principles follow from the
fact that the law prohibits the Federal Government from exercising copyright. 

Agencies should inform the public as to the limitations inherent in the information dissemination product (e.g.,
possibility of errors, degree of reliability, and validity) so that users are fully aware of the quality and integrity
of the information. If circumstances warrant, an agency may wish to establish a procedure by which disseminators
of the agency's information may at their option have the data and/or value-added processing checked for accuracy
and certified by the agency. Using this method, redisseminators of the data would be able to respond to the demand for
integrity from purchasers and users. This approach could be enhanced by the agency using its authority to trademark
its information dissemination product, and requiring that redisseminators who wish to use the trademark agree to
appropriate integrity procedures. These methods have the possibility of promoting diversity, user responsiveness,
and efficiency as well as integrity. However, an agency's responsibility to protect against misuse of a government
information dissemination product does not extend to restricting or regulating how the public actually uses the
information. Agencies should not attempt to condition the resale or redissemination of its information dissemination
products by members of the public. 



User charges. 

Title 5 of the Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952 (31 U.S.C. 9701) establishes Federal policy regarding
fees assessed for government services, and for sale or use of government property or resources. OMB Circular No. A-25,
User Charges, implements the statute. It provides for charges for government goods and services that convey special
benefits to recipients beyond those accruing to the general public. It also establishes that user charges should
be set at a level sufficient to recover the full cost of providing the service, resource, or property. Since Circular
No. A-25 is silent as to the extent of its application to government information dissemination products, full
cost recovery for information dissemination products might be interpreted to include the cost of collecting and
processing information rather than just the cost of dissemination. The policy in Section 8a(7)(c) clarifies the
policy of Circular No. A-25 as it applies to information dissemination products.

Statutes such as FOIA and the Government in the Sunshine Act establish a broad and general obligation on the part of
Federal agencies to make government information available to the public and to avoid erecting barriers that impede
public access. User charges higher than the cost of dissemination may be a barrier to public access. The economic benefit
to society is maximized when government information is publicly disseminated at the cost of dissemination. Absent
statutory requirements to the contrary, the general standard for user charges for government information dissemination
products should be to recover no more than the cost of dissemination. It should be noted in this connection that the
government has already incurred the costs of creating and processing the information for governmental purposes
in order to carry out its mission.

Underpinning this standard is the FOIA fee structure which establishes limits on what agencies can charge for access
to Federal records. That Act permits agencies to charge only the direct reasonable cost of search, reproduction and,
in certain cases, review of requested records. In the case of FOIA requests for information dissemination products,
charges would be limited to reasonable direct reproduction costs alone. No search would be needed to find the product,
thus no search fees would be charged. Neither would the record need to be reviewed to determine if it could be withheld
under one of the Act's exemptions since the agency has already decided to release it. Thus, FOIA provides an information
``safety net'' for the public.

While OMB does not intend to prescribe procedures for pricing government information dissemination products, the
cost of dissemination may generally be thought of as the sum of all costs specifically associated with preparing a
product for dissemination and actually disseminating it to the public. When an agency prepares an information product
for its own internal use, costs associated with such production would not generally be recoverable as user charges
on subsequent dissemination. When the agency prepares the product for public dissemination, and disseminates it,
costs associated with preparation and actual dissemination would be recoverable as user charges.

When agencies provide custom tailored information services to specific individuals or groups, full cost recovery,
including the cost of collection and processing, is appropriate. For example, if an agency prepares special tabulations
or similar services from its databases in answer to a specific request from the public, all costs associated with fulfilling
the request would be charged, and the requester should be so informed before work is begun.

In a few cases, agencies engaging in information collection activities augment the information collection at the
request of, and with funds provided by, private sector groups. Since the 1920's, the Bureau of the Census has carried
out, on request, surveys of certain industries at greater frequency or at a greater level of detail than Federal funding
would permit, because gathering the additional information is consistent with Federal purposes and industry groups
have paid the additional information collection and processing costs. While the results of these surveys are disseminated
to the public at the cost of dissemination, the existence and availability of the additional government data are special
benefits to certain recipients beyond those accruing to the public. It is appropriate that those recipients should
bear the full costs of information collection and processing, in addition to the normal costs of dissemination.

Agencies must balance the requirement to establish user charges and the level of fees charged against other policies,
specifically, the proper performance of agency functions and the need to ensure that information dissemination
products reach the public for whom they are intended. If an agency mission includes disseminating information to
certain specific groups or members of the public and the agency determines that user charges will constitute a significant
barrier to carrying out this responsibility, the agency may have grounds for reducing or eliminating its user charges
for the information dissemination product, or for exempting some recipients from the charge. Such reductions or
eliminations should be the subject of agency determinations on a case by case basis and justified in terms of agency
policies.

Section 8a(8). 

Electronic Information Dissemination. 

Advances in information technology have changed government information dissemination. Agencies now have available
new media and formats for dissemination, including CD-ROM, electronic bulletin boards, and public networks.
The growing public acceptance of electronic data interchange (EDI) and similar standards enhances their attractiveness
as methods for government information dissemination. For example, experiments with the use of electronic bulletin
boards to advertise Federal contracting opportunities and to receive vendor quotes have achieved wider dissemination
of information about business opportunities with the Federal Government than has been the case with traditional
notices and advertisements. Improved information dissemination has increased the number of firms expressing interest
in participating in the government market and decreased prices to the government due to expanded competition. In
addition, the development of public electronic information networks, such as the Internet, provides an additional
way for agencies to increase the diversity of information sources available to the public. Emerging applications
such as Wide Area Information Servers and the World-wide Web (using the NISO Z39.50 standard) will be used increasingly
to facilitate dissemination of government information such as environmental data, international trade information,
and economic statistics in a networked environment.

A basic purpose of the PRA is ``to maximize the usefulness of information collected, maintained, and disseminated
by the Federal Government.'' (44 U.S.C. 3501(3)) Agencies can frequently enhance the value and practical utility
of government information as a national resource by disseminating information in electronic media. Electronic
collection and dissemination may substantially increase the usefulness of government information dissemination
products for three reasons. First, information disseminated electronically is likely to be more timely and accurate
because it does not require data re-entry. Second, electronic records often contain more complete and current information
because, unlike paper, it is relatively easy to make frequent changes. Finally, because electronic information
is more easily manipulated by the user and can be tailored to a wide variety of needs, electronic information dissemination
products are more useful to the recipients.

As stated at Section 8a(1)(h), agencies should use voluntary standards and Federal Information Processing Standards
to the extent appropriate in order to ensure the most cost effective and widespread dissemination of information
in electronic formats.

Agencies can frequently make government information more accessible to the public and enhance the utility of government
information as a national resource by disseminating information in electronic media. Agencies generally do not
utilize data in raw form, but edit, refine, and organize the data in order to make it more accessible and useful for their
own purposes. Information is made more accessible to users by aggregating data into logical groupings, tagging data
with descriptive and other identifiers, and developing indexing and retrieval systems to facilitate access to particular
data within a larger file. As a general matter, and subject to budgetary, security or legal constraints, agencies
should make available such features developed for internal agency use as part of their information dissemination
products.

There will also be situations where the agency determines that its mission will be furthered by providing enhancements
beyond those needed for its own use, particularly those that will improve the public availability of government information
over the long term. In these instances, the agency should evaluate the expected usefulness of the enhanced information
in light of its mission, and where appropriate construct partnerships with the private sector to add these elements
of value. This approach may be particularly appropriate as part of a strategy to utilize new technology enhancements,
such as graphic images, as part of a particular dissemination program.

Section 8a(9). 

Information Safeguards. 

The basic premise of this Section is that agencies should provide an appropriate level of protection to government
information, given an assessment of the risks associated with its maintenance and use. Among the factors to be considered
include meeting the specific requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Computer Security Act of 1987. 

In particular, agencies are to ensure that they meet the requirements of the Privacy Act regarding information retrievable
by individual identifier. Such information is to be collected, maintained, and protected so as to preclude intrusion
into the privacy of individuals and the unwarranted disclosure of personal information. Individuals must be accorded
access and amendment rights to records, as provided in the Privacy Act. To the extent that agencies share information
which they have a continuing obligation to protect, agencies should see that appropriate safeguards are instituted.
Appendix I prescribes agency procedures for the maintenance of records about individuals, reporting requirements
to OMB and Congress, and other special requirements of specific agencies, in accordance with the Privacy Act.

This Section also incorporates the requirement of the Computer Security Act of 1987 that agencies plan to secure their
systems commensurate with the risk and magnitude of loss or harm that could result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized
access to information contained in those systems. It includes assuring the integrity, availability, and appropriate
confidentiality of information. It also involves protection against the harm that could occur to individuals or
entities outside of the Federal Government as well as the harm to the Federal Government. Such protection includes
limits on collection and sharing of information and procedures to assure the integrity of information as well as requirements
to adequately secure the information. 



Incorporation of Circular No. A-114. 

OMB Circular No. A-114, Management of Federal Audiovisual Activities, last revised on March 20, 1985, prescribes
policies and procedures to improve Federal audiovisual management. Although OMB will rescind Circular No. A-114,
its essential policies and procedures will continue. This revision provides information resources management
policies and principles independent of medium, including paper, electronic, or audiovisual. By including the term
