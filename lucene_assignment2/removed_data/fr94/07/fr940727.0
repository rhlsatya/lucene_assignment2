AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is updating the table of normal cost percentages that Federal agencies pay
to finance the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). This regulation is necessary for the table to reflect
the changes in the rates that are effective in October 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 21, 1993, OPM published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice changing the normal cost percentages effective in October 1994. Subpart D of Part 841 of Title 5, Code of Federal
Regulations, contains the methodology that OPM uses to determine the rates that agencies must pay to fund the cost
of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the procedures that OPM must follow to change the rates. Under
those procedures, OPM must publish a notice of changes in the rates at least 3 months before the beginning of the fiscal
year in which the new rates become effective.





Appendix A to Subpart D of Part 841 contains a table of the normal cost percentages. This table has no regulatory effect.
It merely provides information about the rates. This final rule amends that table to reflect the rates that will become
effective in October 1994.

Under section 553(b)(3)(B) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice
of proposed rulemaking. Notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary because this final rule merely provides information
and has no regulatory effect.



Correction of Prior Notice of Final Rulemaking



On March 16, 1994, OPM published (59 FR 12143) a final rule concerning payment of survivor deposits by actuarial reduction.
(FR Doc. 94-6046) This document adopted OPM's interim rule on that subject as final rules. In two places, reference
to the page number for the interim rule was stated incorrectly. In both places, the incorrect reference to 58 FR 56877
is corrected to 58 FR 52877.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation only provides information about the rate of payment by Federal agencies to OPM for the normal
cost of their employees' FERS benefits.

Papayas Grown in Hawaii; Suspension of Grade Requirements 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule suspends all grade requirements currently in effect under the marketing order for Hawaiian
papayas. This rule also eliminates inspection requirements for papayas and is expected to help the papaya industry
reduce expenses.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 928 [7 CFR Part 928] regulating the handling
of papayas grown in Hawaii, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 120 papaya handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh papayas
grown in Hawaii, and approximately 400 producers of papayas in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of these
handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
This rule suspends for an indefinite period the minimum grade and the inspection requirements in effect under the
order. This action was recommended by the Papaya Administrative Committee (committee) on April 22, 1994, by a vote
of 8 in favor, 2 opposed, and 2 abstentions. 
The committee meets prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis
for papayas regulated under the order. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well
as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules
and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Section 928.52 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container regulations
for fresh shipments of papayas. Section 928.53 allows for the modification, suspension or termination of such regulations
when warranted. Section 928.55 provides that whenever papayas are regulated pursuant to  928.52 or  928.53,
such papayas must be inspected by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service and certified as meeting the applicable
requirements of such regulation. The cost of inspection and certification is borne by handlers. 
Section 928.313 of the rules and regulations currently in effect under the order establishes minimum grade requirements
for fresh shipments of Hawaiian papayas. This rule suspends  928.313, which requires that such papayas grade
at least Hawaii No. 1, except that not more than 5 percent of the fruit may be immature, and that the weight requirements
specified in the Hawaiian grade standards do not apply. 
The current minimum grade requirement has been in effect since 1984. The objective of this requirement was to provide
that only acceptable quality fruit enter fresh market channels, thereby ensuring consumer satisfaction, increasing
sales, and improving returns to papaya producers. 
While the industry continues to believe that quality is an important factor in maintaining sales, the committee recommended
this suspension because it believes the cost of inspection and certification (mandated when the grade regulations
are in effect) exceeds the benefits derived. The cost of papaya inspections on a per pound basis averages about $.006,
which is nearly as much as the assessment rate established under the order to cover the order's administrative and
promotion costs. 
Committee members supporting the suspension stated that such action would be in the best interests of producers,
because eliminating the cost of inspection will increase producer returns. Those members contend that the marketplace
will dictate fruit quality, and competition among shippers will ensure shipments of good quality fruit.
In addition, the industry is pursuing alternative means of improving and ensuring quality, such as providing financial
incentives to producers to deliver good quality fruit to handlers. Current industry practice is for producers to
deliver their fruit to handlers for grading, packing and marketing. Producers are paid by handlers based, in part,
on the quality of fruit they deliver. Producer prices are reduced to reflect the amount of fruit that is discarded during
handling because it is of unacceptable quality. All producers delivering fruit to a particular handler are typically
paid the same amount for their fruit, based on the average quality delivered by all producers. This practice causes
producers delivering high quality fruit to be penalized by producers delivering poorer quality fruit. A newly formed
producers' bargaining cooperative is attempting to change this practice by having low quality fruit attributed
to individual producers. That is, an individual producer would be paid based upon the quality of fruit that individual
delivered to the handler. Thus, producers would have a financial incentive to harvest and deliver high quality product.
This should help improve and maintain the quality of papayas entering the fresh market. 
Committee members opposed to the suspension stated that it would allow poor quality fruit on the market and have a negative
impact on the market. Additionally, those members believe that such a suspension will be perceived negatively by
the State of Hawaii Department of Agriculture. They are also concerned about the length of time necessary to reinstate
the grade requirements, if it is determined that such action is needed in the future to ensure that only fruit of acceptable
quality is shipped to fresh markets. 
The majority of committee members acknowledge the possibility that fruit quality could decline as a result of this
action, but do not believe that this is likely. They believe that the reduction in handling costs due to elimination
of mandatory inspection will outweigh any declines in returns attributable to reduced quality. Further, the committee
will monitor the impact this action has on the market, and will recommend reinstatement of quality standards if warranted.

This rule suspends grade and inspection requirements in effect for fresh papayas. Such suspension will enable handlers
to ship papayas to the fresh market at a reduced cost, since handlers will no longer be required to have their fruit inspected
and pay the resulting inspection costs. Suspending grade requirements for fresh papayas is expected to increase
producer returns by reducing costs and maintaining the quality of fruit offered for sale. The industry is committed
to instituting alternative means of quality assurance by providing incentives to producers to harvest and deliver
only acceptable quality fruit. This activity should ensure that consumers continue to receive good quality fresh
papayas. This rule is in the best interest of producers, handlers and consumers, and is expected to increase returns
to papaya producers.
The Department's view is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on producers and handlers, since it will permit
the industry to ship fruit without paying the cost of inspection, thus improving producers' returns, and is not expected
to adversely impact the quality of fruit entering fresh markets.
Consistent with the suspension of  928.313, this rule also suspends   928.150 and 928.152 of the
rules and regulations in effect under the order. Section 928.150 provides a means for handlers to receive waivers
from the mandatory inspection requirement under certain circumstances, and  928.152 authorizes exemptions
from the current grade requirement relating to fruit maturity. Since this action suspends mandatory inspection
and grade requirements, these rules authorizing exemptions from such requirements would no longer be needed.
A conforming change is also made in  928.160, which requires handlers to file monthly utilization reports with
the committee. Among the information required to be submitted are the inspection certificate numbers applicable
to each fresh shipment of papayas. Since inspection will no longer be mandatory, the requirement that handlers submit
inspection certificate numbers would no longer be needed. Thus,  928.160 is revised to suspend such requirement.
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number
0581-0102.
This rule should reduce the reporting burden on approximately 5 papaya handlers who have been completing PAC Form
7, Application to be an Approved Handler of Immature Papayas, and PAC Form 7(c), Immature Papaya Order Form. Form 7
is estimated to take 15 minutes to complete, and Form 7(c) about 10 minutes per form. No reduction in reporting burden
is expected as a result of the revision in  928.160 pertaining to monthly utilization reports. While handlers
will no longer be required to provide inspection certificate numbers, the remaining information on the reports will
continue to be collected. It is estimated that each report requires 1 hour to complete.
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that the suspension of these sections, as set forth below, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) This rule suspends grade requirements for papayas grown in Hawaii; (2) Hawaiian papaya handlers are
aware of this suspension, which was recommended by the committee at a public meeting, and they will need no additional
time to comply with this suspension; (3) shipment of the 1994 season Hawaiian papaya crop is currently in progress;
(4) this rule needs to be made effective by July 1, 1994, to be of maximum benefit to the Hawaiian papaya industry; and
(5) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any comments received will be considered prior to any finalization
of this interim final rule.

Olives Grown in California and Imported Olives; Revisions of Outgoing Inspection Requirements and Size Requirements
for Whole Pitted Olives 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule amends outgoing inspection regulations under the California olive marketing order to authorize
handlers to use in-plant Quality Assurance Programs (QAPs) in lieu of continuous in-line inspection. This rule also
permits handlers to size whole pitted olives by diameter as an alternative to the current requirement that such olives
be sized by weight prior to pitting. Conforming changes are made to the size requirements for imported whole pitted
olives so that the requirements for domestic and imported olives are applied similarly. The changes in the California
olive requirements are designed to result in more efficient handling operations. The changes in import requirements
are necessary under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 148 and Marketing Order No. 932 [7 CFR Part 932], both
as amended, regulating the handling of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 



This interim final rule is also issued pursuant to section 8e of the Act, which provides that whenever certain specified
commodities, including olives, are subject to grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements under a Federal marketing
order, the same or comparable requirements shall be applied to imports of those commodities. 

The Department is issuing this interim final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule
is not intended to have retroactive effect. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 

There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the impact of this interim final rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued
under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders.

There are 5 handlers of olives regulated under the order, and approximately 1,350 producers in the regulated area.
In addition, there are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to the requirements of the olive import regulation.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms, which include olive handlers and importers,
are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of the olive producers and importers
may be classified as small entities. None of the olive handlers may be so classified. 

The California Olive Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order, met on
December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended revising outgoing inspection procedures to permit handlers to establish
a QAP in lieu of maintaining continuous in-line outgoing inspection of processed olives. Outgoing inspection is
the assignment of a final grade to the product after processing is completed, according to the requirements of the
U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (Standards) [7 CFR 52.3751 to 52.3764]. The committee also recommended
that handlers be allowed to size whole pitted olives by diameter after pitting, as an alternative to the current requirement
that such olives be sized by weight prior to pitting. 

Pursuant to  932.52 of the order, and  932.152 of the current regulations, handlers are required to maintain
continuous in-line outgoing inspection for the handling of processed olives. Pursuant to  932.53, such outgoing
inspection is performed by the Processed Products Branch (PPB) of the Department. Continuous in-line outgoing inspection
consists of inspection and grading services in an approved plant whereby one or more PPB inspector(s) are present
at all times the plant is in operation to make in-process checks on the preparation, processing, packing, and warehousing
of all products and to assure compliance with sanitary requirements. However, costs for continuous in-line outgoing
inspection have increased in recent years. Thus, the PPB is prepared to develop QAP inspection procedures which will
provide quality assurance certification for California olive handlers, thereby reducing handlers' inspection
costs. 

Currently, most handlers employ their own quality-control personnel. The PPB is prepared to establish QAPs with
individual handlers as provided in the ``Regulations Governing Inspection and Certification of Processed Fruits
and Vegetables and Related Products'' [7 CFR 52.2]. As established, handlers will be permitted to use a QAP inspection
procedure rather than the currently-mandated continuous in-line outgoing inspection. Under a QAP, the PPB provides
training for the handler's quality-control personnel. The handler's quality-control personnel will be trained
in the same procedures currently used by the PPB inspectors. Once the handler's quality-control personnel are trained
to properly perform the same duties and responsibilities as a PPB inspector, a period of evaluation of the reliability
of the handler's quality control responsibilities begins. This is the reliability evaluation period. At such time
as the handler's quality-control personnel successfully complete the reliability evaluation period, a QAP will
begin operation with oversight provided by the PPB. The PPB inspectors will continue to issue certificates of inspection.
Certificates of inspection will be based on outgoing inspection records maintained by the handler's QAP personnel.
These will be verified through spot-checks and sample regrading by PPB inspectors. A QAP will continue to assure safe,
wholesome, and uniformly high-quality processed products. 

Under a QAP, each handler and the PPB will develop an individually written plan tailored to each handler's facility.
A contract between the handler and the PPB will also be developed based upon the terms of the QAP. The contract will be
signed at the beginning of the reliability evaluation. Once a handler's QAP is approved, the handler is notified in
writing and the PPB begins verifying the work of the handler's QAP personnel. Such verification may include reviews
of plant sanitation, quality and non-quality product analyses, procedures and/or techniques, case-stamping,
checkloading, condition of container, or other types of procedures normally performed by the PPB. Inclusion of any
or all of these verification procedures will be determined by the operating characteristics of each handler's facility
or facilities.

In the event deviations from proper QAP procedures are 
detected by the PPB during the reliability verification 
process, the handler will be informed of the problem and 
corrective action required. If corrective action is taken, 
the QAP continues in operation. Continued deviations may 
result in suspension of QAP approval. The suspension may be 
permanent or temporary and may only be restored upon 
concurrence by the PPB. During any suspension, the handler 
would be required to use continuous in-line inspection. 
Establishing a QAP inspection procedure meets marketing 
order inspection requirements, and provides handlers with an 
alternative to continuous in-line inspection (which requires 
the presence of a PPB inspector during final processing 
prior to the packaging of olives). To effectuate this 
change, paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of  932.152, Outgoing 
regulations, are revised to add authority for handlers to 
use either the QAP process or continuous in-line inspection. 
Section 932.52 authorizes sizing of whole pitted olives 
based upon count-per-pound designations (the actual weight 
of individual fruit) or modifications recommended by the 
committee and approved by the Secretary. Section 932.152 
currently specifies that all processed olives must be sized 
in accordance with the count-per-pound designations 
established for canned whole ripe olives, and further 
requires that such sizing be done prior to pitting. This 
interim final rule provides an alternative method for sizing 
whole pitted olives to provide handlers with more 
flexibility in their operations while ensuring that 
appropriate size standards are continued for whole pitted 
olives. 
The Standards provide a method for sizing whole pitted 
fruit on the basis of illustrations and approximate diameter 
ranges (section 52.3754, Table I). For example, olives that 
are ``Jumbo'' in size are those that are approximately 22 to 
24 millimeters in diameter and conform closely with the 
applicable illustration in Table I. The committee believes 
that this sizing method may be more appropriate for whole 
pitted olives, which now account for a substantial majority 
of the California olives packaged in the whole form. Thus, 
this rule authorizes the sizing of whole pitted olives after 
pitting in accordance with the illustrations and approximate 
diameter ranges provided in the Standards. 
The Standards also provide allowances for size 
variances for whole pitted olives in  52.3756. The 
requirements of U.S. Grade C (the minimum allowed under the 
order), provide that of the 60 percent, by count, of the 
olives that are most uniform in size, the diameter of the 
largest olive cannot exceed the diameter of the smallest 
olive by more than 4 millimeters. These variances will be 
applied to whole pitted olives when handlers choose to have 
their pitted olives sized by diameter, after pitting. The 
committee believes that these guidelines for sizing whole 
pitted olives are sufficient and that no additional 
specifications relating to size are needed at this time. 
To provide for this change in whole pitted olive sizing 
requirements, paragraph (f) of  932.152 is revised to add 
authority for sizing by diameter as provided in the 
Standards. In addition, paragraph (b)(1) of  932.152 is 
revised by deleting the sentence which requires sizing prior 
to pitting. Also, paragraph (b)(2) is revised to reflect 
the elimination of the in-line inspection and sizing prior 
to pitting requirements. 
The outgoing regulations contain a table pertaining to 
size certification of limited size olives for limited use 
styles at  932.152(g)(1). In 1991, the committee 
recommended and the Secretary approved modifications in the 
sizes of limited use olives. While such modifications were 
reflected elsewhere in the regulations, a conforming change 
was not made in Table II of  932.152(g)(1). This rule 
corrects the table, bringing it into conformance with the 
rules as they were modified in 1991. 
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, olives 
imported into the United States are subject to comparable 
size requirements as established for domestically grown 
olives under the order. Those requirements are found in 
Olive Regulation 1 [7 CFR 944.401]. 
Under the import regulation, canned pitted ripe olives 
are subject to minimum size requirements in terms of a 
minimum diameter and a specific tolerance for undersized 
fruit. The undersize tolerances set forth in the import 
regulation are based upon those established for canned whole 
olives under the California olive marketing order. 
As previously explained, this interim final rule 
establishes size requirements for canned pitted olives under 
the order in terms of illustrations, approximate diameter 
ranges, and size variances which are set forth in the 
Standards. Thus, in accordance with section 8e of the Act, 
conforming changes are made in the minimum size requirements 
for imported canned pitted olives so that such requirements 
are applied in a manner similar to that under the order. 
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has 
determined that this rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. 
Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this 
interim final rule.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and 
determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, 
unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give 
preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, 
and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective

 because: (1) This rule relaxes requirements 
currently in effect; (2) this rule should be in effect as 
soon as possible because handlers are currently processing 
olives; (3) this rule was unanimously recommended by the 
committee at a public meeting; and (4) this rule provides a 
30-day comment period, and any comments received will be 
considered prior to finalization of this rule.

Outgoing regulations. 


(a) 

Inspection stations.

 Processed olives shall be 
sampled and graded only at an inspection station which shall 
be any olive processing plant having facilities for in-line 
inspection which are satisfactory to the Inspection Service 
and the committee, or at an olive processing plant which has 
an approved Quality Assurance Program in effect. 
(b) 

Inspection

_(1) 

General.

 Inspection of packaged 
olives for conformance with  932.52 shall be by a Quality 
Assurance Program approved by the Processed Products Branch 
(PPB), USDA; or by in-line inspection. A PPB approved 
Quality Assurance Program shall be pursuant to a Quality 
Assurance contract as referred to in  52.2. During in-line 
inspection, no handler shall perform the final processing 
operations which immediately precede the packaging of the 
olives unless an inspector is present when the olives are so 
processed. 
(2) 

Pitting operations.

 If olives are sized prior to 
pitting and such olives meet the size requirements for 
packaging as canned whole ripe olives but are held in 
containers prior to final processing, such olives shall be 
identified to the satisfaction of the Inspection Service and 
be held separate and apart from other olives until such time 
as they are submitted for inspection prior to being 
packaged. If olives are sized prior to pitting and such 
olives do not meet the size requirements for packaging as 
canned whole ripe olives but meet the applicable size 
requirements specified in  932.52 for halved, sliced, 
chopped, or minced styles of canned ripe olives, such olives 
shall be identified to the satisfaction of the Inspection 
Service and be held separate and apart from other olives 
until such time as they are submitted for inspection prior 
to being packaged.

Expenses and Assessment Rates for Specified Marketing Orders (Colorado Potatoes and Southeastern Potatoes)


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of two interim
final rules that authorized expenditures and established assessment rates under Marketing Orders 948 and 953 for
the 1994-95 fiscal period. Authorization of these budgets enables the Colorado Potato Administrative Committee,
Northern Colorado Office (Area III) and the Southeastern Potato Committee (Committees) to incur expenses that are
reasonable and necessary to administer the programs. Funds to administer these programs are derived from assessments
on handlers.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 97 and Order No. 948, both as amended (7 CFR part 948), regulating
the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Colorado; and Marketing Agreement No. 104 and Order No. 953, both as amended
(7 CFR part 953), regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Southeastern States (Virginia and North Carolina).
The marketing agreements and orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
(7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, Irish potatoes grown in Colorado and Virginia and North Carolina are subject to assessments. It is intended
that the assessment rates as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable Irish potatoes handled during the
1994-95 fiscal period, which began June 1, 1994, and ends May 31, 1995, for Southeastern potatoes and began July
1, 1994, and ends June 30, 1995, for Colorado potatoes. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS), has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
There are approximately 85 producers of Colorado Area III potatoes under the marketing order and approximately 15
handlers. Also, there are approximately 150 producers of Southeastern potatoes under the marketing order and approximately
60 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of the producers and handlers covered under these orders may
be classified as small entities.
The budgets of expenses for the 1994-95 fiscal period were prepared by the Committees, the agencies responsible
for local administration of their respective orders, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of
these Committees are producers and handlers of Colorado Area III and Virginia and North Carolina potatoes. They are
familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local areas and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets were formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly
affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input into these processes.
The recommended assessment rates were derived by dividing anticipated Committee expenses by expected respective
shipments of Colorado Area III and Virginia and North Carolina potatoes. Because these rates will be applied to actual
shipments of potatoes, the assessment rates must be established at levels that will provide sufficient income to
pay the Committees' expenses.
The Colorado Potato Administrative Committee, Northern Colorado Office (Area III) met on April 14, 1994, and unanimously
recommended a 1994-95 budget of $24,325, $7,474 more than the previous year. Increases in the Federal portion
of the administrative budget include $200 for Committee meetings, $450 for Committee mileage, $50 for insurance
and bond, $2,860 for the manager's salary, $620 for medical insurance, $1,750 for office equipment, $500 for office
supplies, $219 for payroll taxes, $200 for telephone, $250 for miscellaneous, $125 for manager's expense, and $250
for Federal meetings.
The major expense item is $11,500 for the manager's salary. The actual salary will be $10,781.50, based on nine months
full-time work and three months at three-quarter time. An additional $718.50 was budgeted to have available and will
only be spent if the workload necessitates full-time work.

<TEXT>
 

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.02 per hundredweight, the same as last season.
This rate, when applied to anticipated potato shipments of 1,476,750 hundredweight, will yield $29,535 in assessment
income, which is adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994-95 fiscal
period, estimated at $31,113, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses.

In Colorado, both a State and a Federal marketing order operate simultaneously. The State order authorizes promotion,
including paid advertising, which the Federal order does not. All expenses in this category are financed under the
State order. The jointly operated programs consume about equal administrative time and the two orders continue to
split administrative costs equally.

The Southeastern Potato Committee met April 20, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $11,000,
the same as last year. Major expense items include $6,800 for Committee staff salaries and $900 for travel expenses.

The Committee also recommended an assessment rate of $0.0075 per hundredweight, $0.0025 less than last season's
rate. When the Committee met, planting for the 1994-95 crop season had not been completed. However, the manager
estimated shipments would generate about $7,000 in assessment income. This, along with funds from the Committee's
$15,000 reserve, will be adequate to cover the expenses incurred. Funds remaining at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal
period should be about the maximum permitted by the order of approximately one fiscal period's expenses.

Interim final rules were published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 26, 1994, for 7 CFR part 948 (59 FR 27223) and 7 CFR part 953 (59 FR 27222). Those rules added  948.211 and  953.251
which authorized expenses, and established assessment rates for the Committees. Those rules provided that interested
persons could file comments through June 27, 1994. No comments were received.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rulemaking are reasonable and likely
to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.

It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994-95 fiscal periods for the programs began on June 1, 1994, for Southeastern potatoes and July
1, 1994, for Colorado Area III potatoes. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal periods
apply to all assessable potatoes handled during the fiscal periods. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions
which were recommended by the Committees at public meetings and published in the 

Federal Register

 as interim final rules.

Handling Regulation for Celery Grown in Florida 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action establishes the quantity of Florida celery which handlers may ship to fresh markets during the 1994-95
marketing season at 6,712,910 crates or 100 percent of producers' base quantities. The 1994-95 marketing season
covers the period August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This interim final rule is intended to lend stability to the
industry, and, thus, help provide consumers with an adequate supply of the product. As in past marketing seasons,
the limitation on the quantity of Florida celery handled for fresh shipment is not expected to restrict the quantity
of Florida celery actually produced or shipped to fresh markets, because production and shipments are anticipated
to be less than the marketable quantity. This action was unanimously recommended by the Florida Celery Committee
(Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 967 [7 CFR Part 967], both as amended, regulating
the handling of celery grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order is effective under the
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the
``Act.''

The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule establishes the quantity
of Florida celery (at 6,712,910 crates or 
100 percent of producers' base quantities) which handlers may ship to fresh markets during the 1994-95 marketing
season which covers the period August 1, 1994, through 
July 31, 1995. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately seven producers of celery in the production area and seven handlers of celery grown in Florida
subject to regulation under the celery marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small
Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural
service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of celery producers
and handlers may be classified as small entities. 
This rule is based upon a recommendation and information submitted by the Committee and upon other available information.
The Committee met on June 15, 1994, and unanimously recommended a marketable quantity of 6,712,910 crates of fresh
celery for the 1994-95 marketing season beginning August 1, 1994. Additionally, a uniform percentage of 100
percent was recommended which will allow each producer, registered pursuant to section 967.37(f) of the order, to
market 100 percent of such producer's base quantity. These recommendations were based on an appraisal of expected
1994-95 supply and demand. 
As required by section 967.37(d)(1) of the order, a reserve of 6 percent (402,775 crates) of the 1993-94 total
base quantities was made available to new producers and for increases for existing producers. The deadline for requesting
changes in base quantities was May 1, 1994. No applications for additional base quantities were received. 
The interim final rule will limit the quantity of Florida celery which handlers may purchase from producers and ship
to fresh markets during the 1994-95 marketing season to 6,712,910 crates. This marketable quantity is the same
as the 1993-94 marketable quantity, and is more than the average number of crates marketed fresh during the 
1987-88 through 1992-93 seasons. It is expected that such quantity will be more than actual shipments
for the 1994-95 season. Thus, the 6,712,910 crate marketable quantity is not expected to restrict the amount
of Florida celery which growers produce or the amount of celery which handlers ship. For these reasons, the interim
final rule should lend stability to the industry, and, thus, help provide consumers with an adequate supply of the
product. 
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available
information, is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impractical, unnecessary and contrary
to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists
for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) This action was recommended at a public meeting and all interested persons had an opportunity to express
their views and provide input; (2) it is desirable to have this action in place as soon as possible because celery planting
begins in July and the beginning of the 1994-95 crop year is August 1, 1994; and (3) this rule provides a 30-day
comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Reapportionment of Independent Handler Representation 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule which revised the administrative rules and regulations established under the Federal marketing order
for raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The interim final rule reapportioned the representation established
for independent and small cooperative marketing association handlers on the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee),
to provide more equitable representation. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee, which
is responsible for local administration of the order.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989], both as amended, regulating the handling
of raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This rule has been reviewed under Executive 
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have any retroactive effect. This action will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.


The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing
order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of producers
and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. 

 This rule finalizes an interim final rule which revised Section 989.126 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations
[7 CFR 989.102-989.176] and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee and other available information.


The interim final rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 26, 1994, [59 FR 27225], reapportioned the Committee representation established for independent and small
cooperative marketing association handlers on the Committee. The interim rule provided for broader independent
handler/small cooperative handler representation on the Committee to reflect the different handler segments in
the raisin industry. The change did not impose any additional regulatory, informational, or cost requirements on
handlers or producers. 

Section 989.26 of the order provides that the Committee shall consist of 47 members, of whom 35 shall represent producers,
10 shall represent handlers, 1 shall represent the cooperative bargaining association, and 1 shall be a public member.
The 10 handler positions are allocated between: (1) Cooperative marketing associations, each of which acquired
not less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year (referred to as major cooperative
handlers); and (2) independent handlers and small cooperative marketing associations; i.e., those who acquired
less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year. Currently, there is one cooperative
in group (1) engaged in handling raisins. That handler is allocated three positions on the Committee. Group (2) handlers
are allocated seven positions. The allocation of members between the two handler groups is based on the provisions
specified in paragraph (d) of  989.26. 

Section 989.126(b) of the Administrative Rules and Regulations had previously provided for independent and small
cooperative handler representation on the Committee as follows: 

(1) Two members selected from and representing the four handler(s) other than major cooperative handler(s) who acquired
the largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; 

(2) Two members selected from and representing the six handlers other than major cooperative marketing association
handler(s) who acquired the next largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year;
and

<TEXT>
 

(3) The remaining member(s) selected from and representing all other handlers, including small cooperative marketing
association handler(s) and all processors. 

For the purposes of this final rule, category (1) is referred to as the ``large-sized handler'' group, category (2)
is referred to as the ``medium-sized handler'' group, and category (3) is referred to as the ``all other handler''
group. The number of handlers in the ``all other handler'' group has decreased from 10 to 7 since the 1990-91 crop
year. In addition, during the 1992-93 crop year, the ``medium-sized handler'' group acquired more than four
times the tonnage acquired by the ``all other handler'' group. 

Based on this information, the Committee met on March 9, 1994, and unanimously recommended to move one handler position
from the ``all other handler'' group to the ``medium-sized handler'' group. 

The interim final rule amended  989.126(b) of the Administrative Rules and Regulations by changing the independent
and small cooperative handler representation on the Committee as follows: 

(1) Two members selected from and representing the four handler(s) other than major cooperative handler(s) who acquired
the largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; 

(2) Three members selected from and representing the six handlers other than major cooperative marketing association
handler(s) who acquired the next largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year;
and 

(3) The remaining member(s) selected from and representing all other handlers, including small cooperative marketing
association handler(s) and all processors. 

The previous and current independent handler/small cooperative handler representation are shown as follows: 






The shift in membership recognized the relative importance of the ``large-sized handler,'' ``medium-sized handler,''
and ``all other handler groups,'' and provides an opportunity for the ten largest independent/small cooperative
handlers to be represented on the Committee either as a member or as an alternate member. The ``all other handler''
group is eligible to nominate two members and two alternate members. 

The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended June 27, 1994. No comments were received. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation
and other available information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 26, 1994, [59 FR 27225], will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Dried Prunes Produced in California and Dried Prunes Imported Into the United States; Final Rule Establishing a Separate
Tolerance for Prunes Affected by Brown Rot 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule establishes a separate brown rot tolerance for dried prunes produced in California and for dried prunes
imported into the United States. This rule specifies a separate tolerance of 3 percent for brown rot affected prunes,
within the combined tolerance allowance of 5 percent. The separate tolerance should benefit producers, handlers,
and consumers, and foster continued growth of the market for dried prunes. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation
of the Prune Marketing Committee (Committee), which is responsible for local administration of the order. As provided
under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, a corresponding change is being made in the prune
import regulation. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 993 [7 CFR Part 993], both as amended, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order'', regulating the handling of dried prunes produced in California. The marketing agreement
and order are authorized under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674],
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 




This final rule, which also amends the prune import regulation (section 999.200), is also issued pursuant to 
section 8e of the Act. Section 8e provides that whenever certain specified commodities, including prunes, are regulated
under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality,
and maturity requirements as those in effect for the domestically produced commodity. Marketing order 
No. 993, as amended [7 CFR Part 993] prescribes grade and size requirements for dried prunes produced in California.




The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 


The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his/her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 



There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 


Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this final rule on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

Import regulations issued under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. Thus, they
also have small entity orientation, and impact both small and large business entities in a manner comparable to rules
issued under such marketing orders.

There are approximately 20 handlers of dried prunes produced in California subject to regulation under the marketing
order, and approximately 1,360 producers in the regulated area. In addition, at least two importers of dried prunes
are subject to import regulations and will be affected by this action. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of handlers
and producers of California dried prunes may be classified as small entities. The majority of the importers of dried
prunes may also be classified as small entities.

This rule revises  993.601 of Subpart_Grade Regulations and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee
and other available information.

Paragraphs (a) and (b) of  993.49 of the marketing order provide the Secretary the authority to modify the minimum
standards for natural condition prunes received from producers and dehydrators (inbound inspection). Likewise,
paragraphs (a) and (b) of  993.50 provide the Secretary authority for the modification of the minimum standards
for prunes that are shipped or otherwise disposed of by a handler (outbound inspection). Whenever a regulation is
established that increases grade requirements, it normally applies to both natural condition (unprocessed) prunes
and processed (cleaned or treated with water or steam) prunes. Minimum grade standards are specified under  993.97
and have been modified in the rules and regulations under   993.149 and 993.150.

Under current procedures for handling and scoring (inspecting) prunes, clusters of brown rot affected prunes are
removed from inbound samples during the initial grading process and are not scored against the lot. However, single
prunes affected with brown rot are often not removed during initial grading and are subsequently scored as defective
during inspection. For both incoming and outgoing prune inspections, the combined defect allowance, which includes
mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation and decay, cannot exceed 5 percent.

There has been a high incidence of brown rot infection in the 1992 and 1993 California prune crops. Brown rot is caused
by two closely related fungi in the blossoms and fruit of prunes and other stone fruits. Success of treatment varies,
making control of brown rot very difficult. Previously infected orchards are more susceptible to re-infection,
and, thus, a reoccurrence of brown rot in the 1994 prune crop is expected.

Harvested prunes affected by brown rot cannot be marketed as prunes and, thus, have no value to handlers, since even
blending them with good prunes for the manufacture of prune products, such as prune juice and concentrate, yields
an unacceptable flavor.

Because of the expected high incidence of prunes affected by brown rot in the 1994 crop, the Committee met on December
8, 1993, and unanimously recommended establishing a separate defect tolerance of 3 percent for brown rot to be included
in the current 5 percent combined defects tolerance for mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation and decay. Finally,
the Committee recommended that the new tolerance be applied to both inbound and outbound inspections. This rule will
have the effect of lowering the brown rot tolerance from the current maximum of 5 percent (assuming no other defects)
to a maximum of 3 percent.

The Committee believes the addition of specific brown rot tolerances will encourage growers to improve their cultural
practices to reduce the incidence of brown rot in their 1994 crops. In addition, notification of the new requirements
early in the growing season would provide growers with sufficient time to implement cultural practices that should
reduce the incidence of brown rot in their prunes. The California prune industry will benefit through increased sales,
which is expected to improve growers' returns. Handlers will benefit by paying for fewer prunes that have no value
and by lowering their sorting costs. Finally, this rule will result in a consistently higher quality product being
shipped, which will benefit consumers.

This tolerance also applies to imported prunes. Section 8e of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality
or maturity requirements are in effect for dried prunes under a domestic marketing order, imported dried prunes must
meet the same or comparable requirements. Because this final rule establishes an additional tolerance for dried
prunes under the domestic handling regulation, a corresponding change to the import prune regulation [7 CFR part
999.200] is also included in this rule.

The Committee recommended that this rule become effective by early July 1994, to ensure that implementation be in
place by the beginning of the 1994-95 crop year, which begins August 1, 1994.

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 18, 1994, [59 FR 25841]. Comments on the proposed rule were invited from interested persons until June 17, 1994.
No comments were received.

After consideration of all available information, it is found that the action, as hereinafter set forth, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the United States Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of
this final rule.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date
of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) This action was unanimously recommended by the Committee; (2) the 1994-95 crop year begins August
1, 1994, and this rule should be effective promptly to cover as many of the 1994-95 season prunes as possible;
and (3) the proposed rule provided a 30-day comment period and no comments were received.

Small Business Size Standards; Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for television receiving sets and compact disc players.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is establishing a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for television receiving
sets and compact disc players. The basis for a waiver for these classes of products is that there are no small business
manufacturers or processors available to supply them to the Federal Government. The effect of these waivers is to
allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract
set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for television receiving sets or compact disc
players.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Public Law 100-656, enacted on November 15, 1988, incorporated into the Small Business Act the previously existing
regulation that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or the SBA 8(a) Program must provide
the products of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer
or processor. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule. The SBA regulations which implement
this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.906(b) and 121.1106(b). Section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II), 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II),
provides for waiver of this requirement by SBA for any ``class of products'' for which there are no small business manufacturers
or processors available to participate in the Federal procurement market. To be considered available to participate
in the Federal procurement market on these classes of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted
a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal Government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines ``class of products'' based on two coding systems. The first is the Office of Management and Budget
Standard Industrial Classification Manual, and the second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal
Procurement Data System.


The SBA was originally asked to process 15 class waivers of these Nonmanufacturer Rule, and sources were found for
all but these remaining two classes: (1) Television receiving sets and (2) compact disc players.
Regarding television receiving sets, the SBA sought small business sources by contacting the General Services Administration's
Federal Supply Service in Fort Worth, Texas. The SBA also researched its Procurement Automated Source System (PASS)
and the Thomas Register. In addition, SBA published a notice seeking potential sources in the May 6, 1994, Commerce
Business Daily and an intent to grant a class waiver in the April 22, 1994, 

Federal Register

, 59 FR 19150. After a 15-day comment period, two comments were received received.
Both comments regarded the existence of a small business manufacturer of health care televisions. These televisions
are wall- or ceiling-mounted and are normally used in hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis facilities. Although
health care televisions may be purchased and used by individuals in their homes, these televisions are not normally
used in households for home entertainment. Two marketing firms for these televisions confirmed that these televisions
are not considered household items and are not marketed to individuals for home entertainment. After reviewing the
marketing information for health care televisions, it has become apparent that they are in a different category from
household television receiving sets.
Based on the absence of small business manufacturers, SBA is establishing a class waiver for television receiving
sets (SIC code 3651, PSC code 7730) pursuant to Section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv)(ii) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II).
The effect of this class waiver is to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic
manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for household
television receiving. This waiver will be in effect indefinitely, but is subject to review by SBA.
Regarding compact disc players, the SBA sought small business sources by contacting the General Services Administration's
Federal Supply Service in Fort Worth, Texas. The SBA also researched the PASS and the Thomas Register. In addition,
SBA published a notice seeking potential sources in the May 9, 1994, Commerce Business Daily and an intent to grant
a class waiver in the April 22, 1994, 

Federal Register

, 59 FR 19150. After a 15-day comment period, no comments were received. 



Based on the absence of small business manufacturers, SBA is establishing a class waiver for compact disc players
(SIC code 3651, PSC code 7730) pursuant to the statutory authority cited above. The effect of this class waiver is to
allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract
set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for compact disc players. This waiver will be
in effect indefinitely, but is subject to review by SBA.

Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for office copiers.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is establishing a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for office copiers.
The basis for a waiver for office copiers is that there are no small business manufacturers or processors available
to supply them to the Federal Government. The effect of this waiver is to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers
to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded
through the SBA 8(a) Program for office copiers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Public Law 100-656, enacted on November 15, 1988, incorporated into the Small Business Act the previously existing
regulation that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or the SBA 8(a) Program must provide
the products of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer
or processor. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule. The SBA regulations which implement
this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.906(b) and 121.1106(b). Section 8(a)(17)(B)(vi)(II) of the Small Business
Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II), provides for waiver of this requirement by SBA for any ``class of products''
for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal procurement
market. To be considered available to participate in the Federal procurement market on these classes of products,
a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from
the Federal Government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines ``class of products'' based on two coding systems.
The first is the Office of Management and Budget Standard Industrial Classification Manual, and the second is the
Product and Service Code established by the Federal Procurement Data System.



The SBA was originally asked to process a request for a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for copiers. After
discussions with the General Services Administration's Office of Scientific Equipment Commodity Center, this
was modified to be copiers/duplicating equipment. The SBA then searched the Procurement Automated Source System
(PASS) and Thomas Register and published a notice seeking potential sources in the Commerce Business Daily. In addition,
SBA published a notice of intent to grant a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule in the March 15, 1994, 

Federal Register

, 59 FR 11938 (1994). After a 15-day comment period, two comments were received. Both comments regarded the existence
of a small business manufacturer of duplicators.

The comment from a Federal agency informed SBA of the existence of a small business which manufactures office duplicators.
The second comment was from a small business manufacturer of spirit duplicators and stencil/mimeograph duplicators,
which they routinely provide to the Federal Government. Their duplicators use liquid ink and spirit fluid to produce
duplicates, and when compared with office copiers, their duplicators are slow and labor intensive. Due to their speed
and labor intensive nature, these duplicators tend to be marketed primarily to churches and schools, and are intended
for relatively low volume work. The firm's marketing representative informed SBA that these duplicators are not
in direct competition with office copiers.

After reviewing the marketing information for these duplicators, it became apparent that these products are in a
different category than office copiers. For these reasons, the class of products which is being waived from the Nonmanufacturer
Rule is more narrowly defined to include only office copiers. All types of duplicating equipment are excluded from
this class waiver.

Based on the above information, SBA is establishing a waiver for office copiers (SIC code 3579, PSC code 3610) pursuant
to Section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II). The effect of this class
waiver is to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal
contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for office copiers. This waiver will
be in effect indefinitely, but is subject to periodic review by the SBA.

<DOCTITLE>Small Business Size Standards; Termination of Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Termination of waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for two classes of metal products and the retention of waivers
for five classes of metal products.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The first purpose of this document is to announce that the Small Business Administration (SBA) is terminating the
waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for: (1) Bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum,
copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass; and (2) Structural shapes, angles, channels, tees and
zees, aluminum and high nickel alloy. The decision to terminate these waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule is based
on evidence provided to the SBA that there is a small business which manufactures items within these classes of products.
This small business is available to provide items within each class to the Federal government. Terminating these
waivers will require recipients of contracts set aside for small or 8(a) businesses to provide the products of domestic
small business manufacturers or processors where these classes of products are required.



The second purpose of this document is to announce that SBA is retaining class waivers for: (1) Bars and rods, high nickel
alloy; (2) plate sheet, strip and foil, stainless steel and high nickel alloy; (3) wire, nonelectrical, high nickel
alloy; (4) plate, sheet and strip, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum, copper-nickel, and copper; and (5)
sheet and plate aluminum products. The effect of retaining these class waivers is that small businesses which receive
either small business set-aside or SBA 8(a) Program contracts for these products awards may provide the products
of any domestic manufacturer or processor.

requirement that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or the SBA 8(a) Program must provide
the products of small business manufacturers or processors. The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found
at 13 CFR 121.906(b) and 121.1106(b).



Section 210 of Public Law 101-574 further amended the Small Business Act to allow for waivers for classes of products
for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors ``available to participate in the Federal procurement
market,'' 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II).

Decision to terminate two class waivers:

1. SBA announced its decision to grant a class waiver for bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper,
nickel-copper-aluminum, copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass in the 

Federal Register

 on May 15, 1991, 56 FR 22306. Recently, the Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) Defense Industrial Supply Center (DISC)
brought to SBA's attention the existence of a small business manufacturer for items within this class of products.
Based on this information, a notice of the Agency's intent to terminate this waiver and waivers for six other classes
of products was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 10, 1994, 59 FR 1360. The notice allowed thirty days for a comment period.

The comments received from the small businesses and DLA were similar to each other. They agreed that a small business
exists which manufactures items in this class of products. However, they believed they may not be able to supply all
of their potential procurement requirements with items manufactured by the small business.

According to the SBA's published regulations, 58 FR 48954 (1993), ``(u)pon receipt by the SBA of evidence that a small
business manufacturer or processor exists in the Federal market for a waived class of products, the waiver shall be
terminated by the Associate Administrator for (Government Contracting).'' Based on this regulation, the SBA is
required to terminate the class waiver for this class of products.

Therefore, the waiver previously granted for bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum,
copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass (Product and Service Code (PSC) 9530, Standard Industrial
Classification Code (SIC) 3356) is terminated, effective ninety days from the date of this notice. Small business
set-aside or SBA 8(a) Program contracts for this class of products may rely on this waiver where the solicitation is
dated before the ninetieth day after the date of the 

Federal Register

 publication of this termination.

2. SBA announced its decision to grant the waiver for structural shapes, angles, channels, tees and zees, aluminum
and high nickel alloy in the 

Federal Register

 on May 15, 1991, 56 FR 22306. The DISC brought to SBA's attention the existence of a small business manufacturer for
items within this class of products. Based on this information, a notice of the Agency's intent to terminate this waiver
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 10, 1994, 59 FR 1360. The notice allowed thirty days for a comment period.

The comments received from the small businesses and DLA were similar to each other. They agreed that a small business
exists which manufactures items in this class of products. However, they believed they may not be able to supply all
of their potential procurement requirements with items manufactured by the small business.

According to the SBA's published regulations, 58 FR 48954 (1993), ``(u)pon receipt by the SBA of evidence that a small
business manufacturer or processor exists in the Federal market for a waived class of products, the waiver shall be
terminated by the Associate Administrator for (Government Contracting).'' Based on this regulation, the SBA is
required to terminate the class waiver for this class of products.

Therefore, the waiver previously granted for structural shapes, angles, channels, tees and zees, aluminum and high
nickel alloy (PSC 9540, SIC 3354) is terminated, effective ninety days from the date of this notice. Small business
set-aside or SBA 8(a) Program contracts for this class of products may rely on this waiver where the solicitation is
dated before the ninetieth day after the date of the 

Federal Register

 publication of this termination.

Retention of five class waivers:

The second part of this announcement addresses the decision to retain waivers for five classes of products which were
proposed for termination in the 

Federal Register

 on January 10, 1994, 59 FR 1360. Those five classes are: (1) Bars and rods, high nickel alloy (PSC 9510, SIC 3312); (2)
Plate, sheet, strip and foil, stainless steel and high nickel alloy (PSC 9515, SIC 3312); (3) Wire, nonelectrical,
high nickel alloy (PSC 9525, SIC 3356); (4) Plate, sheet and strip, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum, copper-nickel,
and copper (PSC 9535, SIC 3353); and (5) Sheet and plate aluminum products (PSC 9535, SIC 3353).

The SBA originally announced its decision to grant class waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for these five classes
of products in the 

Federal Register

 on May 15, 1991, 56 FR 22306. While researching SBA's Procurement Automated Source System (PASS) on a related issue,
SBA became aware of the possible existence of small business manufacturers for items within each of these classes
of products. After the 

Federal Register

 announcement on January 10, 1994, of an intent to terminate these classes of products, the SBA received comments from
several small businesses and DLA regarding this matter. All parties urged that SBA not terminate waivers for these
five classes of products on the basis that doing so would adversely affect both the Federal procurement process for
these items and the existing suppliers for those products. Also, we learned that the production capabilities of the
small business manufacturers of these products is severely limited in quantity and product type. Based on these comments,
the SBA will retain the class waivers for these classes of products.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; correction.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

SBA is correcting the numbering of its final rule identifying a new size standard for the Surety Bond Guaranty Program,
which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28231).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 1, 1994, SBA promulgated a final rule amending the size standard in 13 CFR 121.802 for its Surety Bond Guaranty
Program (59 FR 28231). The amended regulatory text was designated a paragraph (a)(3) of  121.802. However,
in a previous amendment of  121.802, which contains size standards for SBA financial assistance, SBA had promulgated
a new size standard for Small Business Investment Company assistance by dividing the text of paragraph (a)(2) into
two separate paragraphs, paragraph (a)(2) for development company assistance and paragraph (a)(3) for SBIC assistance,
and redesignating paragraph (a)(3), containing the size standard for surety bond guaranty assistance, as paragraph
(a)(4). When promulgating its final rule amending the surety bond guaranty size standard, however, SBA inadvertently
identified the amended regulatory text as paragraph (a)(3).


This correction properly designates the amended regulatory text concerning surety bond guarantees as paragraph
(a)(4).


Correction of Publication


 121.80 

[Corrected]


In the second column on page 28234 of the June 1, 1994 

Federal Register, 

the amendatory instruction 

#

2 is amended by correcting the reference to ``paragraph (a)(3)'' to read ``paragraph (a)(4)'' and the amended regulatory
text incorrectly designated as paragraph (a)(3) is redesignated as paragraph (a)(4).

Airworthiness Directives; Aerospatiale Model ATR 42-300 and -320 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42-300 and -320 series airplanes. This 
action requires an inspection to verify that the cables supplying power to the aileron trim 
are adequately protected and to detect any damage to these cables. This amendment also 
requires installation of protective sleeves on unprotected cables, and replacement of 
damaged cables. This amendment is prompted by reports of a short circuit of these cables 
due to worn protective sleeves. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent 
short circuiting of the cables that supply power to the aileron trim, which could lead to 
loss of aileron trim control.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile 
(DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that 
an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42-300 and -320 series 
airplanes. The DGAC advises that the cables that supply power to the aileron trim 
short-circuited on an in-service airplane. Investigation revealed that the protective sleeve 
on these cables was worn. Short circuiting of the cables that supply power to the aileron 
trim, if not corrected, could result in loss of aileron trim control. 


Avions de Transport Regional has issued Service Bulletin ATR42-27-0070, dated 
December 20, 1993, which describes procedures for visually inspecting to verify that the 
protective sleeve on the cables that supply power to the aileron trim adequately protect the 
cables, and to detect damaged cables. This service bulletin also contains instructions for 
replacing damaged cables with cables that have been modified in accordance with Avions 
de Transport Regional Service Bulletin ATR42-27-0014, Revision 2, dated December 20, 
1993. This latter service bulletin describes procedures for installation of protective sleeves 
(Modification A0014) on cables that are not adequately protected. The DGAC classified 
these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94-004-054(B), dated
January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation 
in the United States under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation 
Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. 
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed 
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, 
reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for 
products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being 
issued to prevent loss of aileron trim control due to a short circuit in the cables that supply 
power to the aileron trim. This AD requires visually inspecting to verify that the cables 
that supply power to the aileron trim are adequately protected, and to detect damaged 
cables; replacing damaged cables with cables that have been previously modified; and 
installing protective sleeves on unprotected cables. The actions are required to be 
accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
This AD applies only to airplanes having manufacturer's serial numbers 003 
through 072. For airplanes having manufacturer's serial numbers 073 and subsequent, a 
glass fabric adhesive tape has been applied to the cables prior to delivery of the airplane; 
therefore, these airplanes are not subject to the unsafe condition addressed by this AD 
action. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is 
found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and 
that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES. 

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-99-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

SmithKline Beecham Animal Health, 1600 Paoli Pike, West Chester, PA 19380, has informed FDA that it has transferred
ownership of, and all rights and interests in, approved NADA 065-488 to Walco International, Inc., 15 West Putnam,
Porterville, CA 93257. In addition, Walco has not previously been listed in 21 CFR 510.600(c)(1) as a sponsor of an
approved NADA. That section is amended to add entries for the firm. Furthermore, in the 

Federal Register

 of October 8, 1991, FDA published a document to reflect a change of sponsor from Beecham Animal Health (Drug labeler
code 000029) to SmithKline Beecham Animal Health (Drug labeler code 053571). The current 21 CFR 522.1696a(b)(1)
and (b)(2) does not reflect that change. This document removes the entry for Beecham in 21 CFR 522.1696a(b) and adds
in its place the entry for Walco International, Inc., the new sponsor. Accordingly, the agency is amending the regulations
in 21 CFR 510.600(c)(1) and (c)(2) and 21 CFR 522.1696a(b)(1) and (b)(2) to reflect those changes.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations regarding the place for filing a notice of tax lien against personal property.
Sections 1015(s)(1) (A) and (B) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TAMRA), amended section 6323
of the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a state conforming to or reenacting a federal law establishing a national
filing system is not considered to have designated a second office for filing a notice of tax lien. TAMRA also amended
section 6323 to provide that the filing of a notice of federal tax lien is governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code
and is not subject to any other federal law that establishes a national filing system.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


These final regulations amend the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR part 301) under section 6323
of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The regulations reflect the amendment of section 6323 by sections 1015(s)(1)
(A) and (B) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-647, 102 Stat. 3573) (TAMRA).

The IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 on April 22, 1993, (58 FR 21550) providing proposed rules under section 6323 of the Code. No public comments were received
and accordingly, the final regulations are substantially identical to the proposed regulations. Certain minor
stylistic changes have been made. 


Explanation of Provisions 


Sections 1015(s)(1) (A) and (B) of TAMRA amended section 6323(f) of the Code by clarifying that a state's conformance
to or reenactment of a federal law establishing a national filing system for personal property does not constitute
a second office for filing in that state. The existing regulations provide that if a state has designated more than
one office for filing liens, the IRS must file the notice of tax lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States
district court. TAMRA also clarified that the filing of notices of liens by the IRS is to be governed solely by the Code
and is not subject to any other federal law establishing a national filing system.

TAMRA's amendments to the Code were in response to 

United States 

v. 

Air Florida, Inc.

, 56 B.R. 732 (S.D. Fla. 1985). In that case, the IRS filed its Notice of Federal Tax Lien with the clerk of the county circuit
court, but the court held that under section 6323(f)(1) the IRS was instead required to file its Notice of Federal Tax
Lien in the office of the clerk of the United States district court. The court found that the State of Florida had designated
not one, but two offices for the filing of Federal tax liens against personal property: The office of the clerk of the
circuit court of the county in which the personal property was located and, because the state had adopted the U.S. government's
national filing system for civil aircraft, the F.A.A.'s offices in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The final regulations
revise  301.6323(f)-1 by providing that state law that conforms to or reenacts a federal law establishing
a national filing system does not constitute a second office for filing; by providing that the filing of liens is not
subject to federal laws (other than the Code) establishing a national filing system for liens; and by adding two examples,
one of which resembles the fact pattern of the 

Air Florida

 case. 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business. 


Drafting Information 


The principal author of these proposed regulations is Robert A. Walker, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (General
Litigation), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations 




Accordingly, 26 CFR part 301 is amended as follows: 


Paragraph 1. 

 The authority citation for part 301 continues to read in part as follows: 





Authority:

 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *.

 



Par. 2. 

 Section 301.6323(f)-1 is amended as follows: 
1. Two sentences are added at the end of paragraph (a)(2). 
2. Paragraphs (c) and (d) are redesignated as paragraphs 
(d) and (e), respectively. 
3. A new paragraph (c) is added. 
4. Newly designated paragraph (e) is amended by adding 

Example 5

 and 

Example 6. 
5. The additions and revisions read as follows: 




 301.6323(f)-1

Place for filing notice; form. 


(a) * * * 
(2) * * *
A state law that conforms to or reenacts a federal law establishing a national filing system does not constitute a designation
by state law of an office for filing liens against personal property. Thus, if state law provides that a notice of lien
affecting personal property must be filed in the office of the county clerk for the county in which the taxpayer resides
and also adopts a federal law that requires a notice of lien to be filed in another location in order to attach to a specific
type of property, the state is considered to have designated only one office for the filing of the notice of lien, and
to protect its lien the Internal Revenue Service need only file its notice in the office of the county clerk for the county
in which the taxpayer resides.

(c) National filing system. 

 The filing of federal tax liens is to be governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to any other federal
law that may establish a national system for filing liens and encumbrances against a particular type of personal property.
Thus, for example, the Service is not subject to the requirements established by the Federal Aviation Agency for filing
liens against civil aircraft in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 


* * * * * 


(e) * * *





Example 5.

 The law of State F provides that notices of lien affecting personal property are to be filed with the clerk of the circuit
court in the county in which the personal property is located. State F has conformed state law to federal law to provide
that all instruments affecting title to an interest in any civil aircraft of the United States must be recorded in the
Office of the Federal Aviation Administrator (FAA) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On July 1, 1990, a tax lien arises against
ABC airline, which owns aircraft situated in State F. The Internal Revenue Service files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien
with the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the aircraft is located but does not file the notice with the
FAA in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Because the FAA system adopted by State F does not constitute a second place of filing
pursuant to section 6323(f), the federal tax lien is validly filed. 



Example 6.

 Assume the same facts as 

Example 5 

except that State F did not reenact or conform state law to the FAA requirements. The result is the same because the filing
of federal tax liens is governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code, and is not subject to any other national filing
system.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the Indiana permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the
Indiana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment consists of
revisions to Indiana's Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Statutes concerning an exemption for operations conducted
under IC 13-4.1 (Indiana SMCRA) from the need for a ``construction in a floodway'' permit issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), Division of Water. The amendment is intended to consolidate and streamline
Indiana's permit system by implementing statutory changes contained in the 1993 Senate Enrolled ACT (SEA) 179.

V. Director's Decision.

VI. Procedural Determinations.



I. Background on the Indiana Program



On July 29, 1982, the Indiana program was made effective by the conditional approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
Information pertinent to the general background on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the
disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Indiana program can be found
in the July 26, 1982 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 32107). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at
30 CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16.



II. Submission of the Amendment



By letter dated October 1, 1993 (Administrative Record Number IND-1325), the IDNR submitted a proposed amendment
to the Indiana program concerning statutes enacted by Indiana under SEA 179 from the 1993 Indiana Legislative Session.
SEA 179 contains numerous amendments to the Indiana statutes, but only those which pertain to the Indiana program
are discussed below.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the May 5, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 23176), and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The comment period closed on June 6, 1994. On May 26, 1994 (59 FR 27251), OSM
corrected a typographical error in the May 5, 1994, proposed rule announcement.

Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment to the Indiana program.


IC 13-4.1-4 Permit Approval or Denial


Indiana has amended subsection IC 13-4.1-4-3(a) concerning the findings required to be made by
the director of the IDNR prior to issuing a permit. New subdivision 3(a)(10) is added to provide as follows:
(10) if any part of the operation would take place in a floodway (as defined in IC 13-2-22-3), the operation
will not:
(A) result in unreasonably detrimental effects upon the fish, wildlife, or botanical resources;
(B) adversely affect the efficiency; or
(C) unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway.
In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana explained that the proposed language quoted above is being added to the
Indiana program as a consequence of an amendment to IC 13-2-22-13. New subdivision 13(e)(3) is added
to IC 13-2-22-13 to provide that operations conducted under IC 13-4.1 (Indiana SMCRA) are
exempted from the need for a ``construction in a floodway'' permit issued by the IDNR, Division of Water. Instead,
any activity in a floodway which is to be conducted as part of an operation regulated under IC 13-4.1 must be identified
in the permit application to the Division of Reclamation. A determination must then be made by the Division of Reclamation
that the environmental standards identified in the proposed language are met. This determination will then become
part of the ``Findings Document'' which accompanies each of the Division's final permit recommendations.
There is no direct Federal counterpart in SMCRA or the Federal regulations to the proposed amendment. As explained
by Indiana in its submittal of this amendment, the purpose of this legislative change is to consolidate and streamline
the permit system as well as strengthen the technical review of the floodway permit work. Indiana further explained
that any disturbance on a mine site is part of a much larger effort already being reviewed by the Division of Reclamation.
Further, Indiana asserts that this change allows for a more thorough evaluation of the work when taken in context with
the overall plan of operation.
The Director finds that the proposed amendments are not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations. None
of the existing Indiana program provisions are rendered less effective by the inclusion of the proposed provisions
in the Indiana program. On the contrary, all of the approved provisions of the Indiana program remain in full effect.
Further, the proposed provisions are not inconsistent with SMCRA sections 503 concerning State programs, and 505
concerning State laws. Therefore, the Director is approving the amendment.


IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments


Federal Agency Comments


Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and 3 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various interested
Federal agencies. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) commented on the amendment (Administrative Record Number
IND-1378). The FWS stated that if the review of impacts to ``fish, wildlife, and botanical resources'' continues
to be administered by the IDNR's Division of Fish and Wildlife, or other trained fish and wildlife biologists, the
FWS assumes that the level of protection of fish and wildlife resources would not be changed from the current situation.
As discussed above in the Director's Findings, Indiana explained in its submittal that the proposed amendment should
strengthen the technical review of the floodway permit work since the review will become part of a much larger effort
already being conducted by the Division of Reclamation. The change, Indiana asserts, will allow for a more thorough
evaluation of the construction on a floodway. In his review of this amendment, the Director has concluded that none
of the existing Indiana program provisions are rendered less effective by the inclusion of the proposed provisions
in the Indiana program.
The FWS further stated that the FWS does not anticipate any impacts to Federally endangered/threatened species as
a result of the proposed revision. The Director concurs.


Public Comments


The public comment period and opportunity to request a public hearing was announced in the May 5, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 23176). The comment period closed on June 6, 1994. No one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled
public hearing so no hearing was held. No public comments were received in response to this amendment.


Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940727-0-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards
promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and the EPA's concurrence
is not required.

Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative Record
No. IND-1221). EPA did not respond to OSM's request.



V. Director's Decision



Based on the findings above, the Director is approving Indiana's program amendment concerning construction in a
floodway as submitted by Indiana on October 1, 1993. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 914 codifying decisions
concerning the Indiana program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective
immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into
conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required
by SMCRA.



VI. Procedural Determinations



Executive Order 12866



This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is approving proposed Program Amendment Number 67 to the Ohio permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred
to as the Ohio program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment was initiated
by Ohio and is intended to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning
postmining land uses. Specifically, the amendment proposes to clearly identify postmining land use categories,
to clarify the comparison of premining and postmining land uses, to clarify that ``undeveloped land'' may be the designated
postmining land use only if the premining land use is undeveloped land, to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish
and wildlife habitat'' are distinct postmining land uses, and to eliminate redundant provisions more stringent
than the Federal regulations for notice and approval of alternative postmining land uses by other reviewing agencies
and for the design of postmining land use plans by an engineer.

I. Background on the Ohio Program.

II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment.

III. Director's Findings.

IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments.

V. Director's Decision.

VI. Procedural Determinations.


I. Background on the Ohio Program



On August 16, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Ohio program. Background information
on the Ohio program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
can be found in the August 10, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 34688). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at
30 CFR 935.11, 935.12, 935.15, and 935.16.



II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment



By letter dated May 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH-2017), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 67. In this amendment, Ohio proposed
to revise one rule at Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 1501:13-9-17 to make the Ohio program as effective
as corresponding Federal regulations concerning postmining land uses. OSM announced receipt of proposed Program
Amendment Number 67 in the May 26, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 27255), and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on June 27, 1994.



III. Director's Findings



Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment to the Ohio program. Revisions not specifically addressed below concern nonsubstantive
wording changes, or revised cross-references and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting
from this amendment.

1. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(C) (1) through (11), Postmining land use categories. 

Ohio is revising paragraphs (C) (1) through (11) to clarify the titles of the eleven approved postmining land use categories.
Since these are nonsubstantive changes, the Director finds that the revised State rules are no less effective than
their Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 701.5.

2. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(B)(1), Mining prior to April 10, 1972. 

Ohio is revising paragraph (B)(1) to clarify that the postmining land use for land that was mined pursuant to a license
issued prior to April 10, 1972, shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best use that can be achieved which is compatible
with surrounding areas and does not require the disturbance of areas previously unaffected by mining. The State's
proposed language is consistent with the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817/133(b). The Director,
therefore, finds that the revised State rule is no less effective than its Federal counterpart.

3. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(B)(2), Comparison of postmining and premining land uses. 

Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that, if the premining land use was changed within five
years of the beginning of mining, the postmining land use shall be compared to the historic use of the land as well as
its use immediately before mining. There are no Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 816/817.133. However, the State rule
at 1501:13-4-04(I)(1)(a) requires information on historical land use in permit applications if the
land use changed within five years before mining. This corresponds to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(1)
and 784.15(a)(1). Since the State rule at OAC 1501:13-9-17(B) states that ``[t]he premining uses of land
to which the postmining land uses are compared shall be those which the land previously supported * * *''
this would include historical land uses if the land use changed within five years before mining. Therefore, the Director
finds that the deletion of former paragraph (B)(2) will not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal
regulations.

4. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(B)(2), Undeveloped land use. 

Ohio is adding a new requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that land may be returned to the undeveloped postmining land use
category only if the land was categorized as undeveloped prior to mining. Ohio's proposed rule clarifies that undeveloped
land may be the designated postmining land use only if the premining land use is undeveloped land. The Director finds
that the proposed rule is not inconsistent with and is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.133(b)
and 30 CFR 701.5.

<PARENT> FR940727-0-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

5. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(C), Undeveloped land use

. Ohio is revising paragraph (C) to require that all proposed changes of land use, including changes from undeveloped
land to forestland or fish and wildlife habitat, shall be considered an alternative land use change subject to approval
by the Chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (the Chief). The Director finds
that Ohio's proposed rule is not inconsistent with and is not less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR
816/817.133 and the Federal definition of ``land use'' at 30 CFR 701.5. 

6. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(D)(8), Undeveloped land use

. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(8) that plans to change the postmining land use to undeveloped
land from some other land use category must treat the land as if the postmining land use were in the forestland/fish
and wildlife habitat category. The proposed deletion of this paragraph is consistent with revised paragraphs (B)(2)
and (C) which clarify that undeveloped land may be the designated postmining land use only if the premining land use
is undeveloped land. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed deletion of paragraph (D)(8) will not render
the Ohio rule less effective than the Federal regulations. 

7. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(C) (9) and (10), Forestland and Fish and Wildlife Habitat

. Ohio is revising paragraphs (C)(9) and (C)(10) to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish and wildlife habitat''
are distinct postmining land uses. The ``forest'' category includes land used for commercial or noncommercial production
of wood or wood products. The Director finds that the revised rules are no less effective than the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 816/817.133 and the corresponding Federal definitions at 30 CFR 701.5. 

8. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(D)(1), Agency review of postmining land uses

. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that requests for alternative postmining land use
must contain a written statement of views from the authorities having statutory responsibilities for land use policies
and plans. Ohio is also deleting the requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that the operator must obtain any required approval
of the final land use from local, State, or Federal land management agencies, including any necessary zoning or other
required changes. The counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.133(c) impose no similar requirements.
Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of these requirements will not render the Ohio program less effective
than the Federal regulations. 

9. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(D)(6), Agency review of postmining land uses

. Ohio is revising paragraph (D)(6) to clarify that, for approval by the Chief, proposed alternative postmining land
uses must identify measures to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on fish and wild not render the Ohio program less
effective than the Federal regulations. 

9. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(D)(6), Agency review of postmining land uses

. Ohio is revising paragraph (D)(6) to clarify that, for approval by the Chief, proposed alternative postmining land
uses must identify measures to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on fish and wildlife and on threatened or endangered
plants or animals or their critical habitats and must demonstrate that an opportunity to comment has been provided
in accordance with OAC section 1501:13-9-11 to appropriate State and Federal fish and wildlife management
agencies. There are no Federal counterparts at 30-CFR 816/817.133. Therefore, the Director finds that the
revisions do not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations. 

10. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(D)(9), Agency review of postmining land use

. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(9) that alternative postmining land use plans must demonstrate
that the operator has provided written notice of the proposed land use to appropriate State and Federal agencies with
instructions for those agencies to provide any comments on the proposed land use to the Chief. The Federal requirements
at 30 CFR 816/817.133 do not impose a similar requirement. Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of this
requirement will not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations. 

11. 

OAC 1501:13-9-17(D)(2), Design of postmining land use plans by an engineer

. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement at paragraph (D)(2) that postmining land use plans must be designed under
the general supervision of a registered engineer or other appropriate professional. There are no similar Federal
requirements at 30 CFR 816/817.133. The Director, therefore, finds that the deletion of paragraph (D)(2) will not
render the Ohio program less effective that the Federal regulations. 



IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments 


Public Comments 



The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing
was held. 



Federal Agency Comments 



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal
agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Ohio program. 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, stated that it does not recommend that any forestland
be grazed as indicated in paragraph (C)(3) of OAC 1501:13-9-17. The only change proposed by Ohio at paragraph
(C)(3) was to clarify the title of the approved postmining land use. Therefore, the Director will not address this
comment. 

No other comments were received.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)


Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect
to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

) or the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

). None of the revisions that Ohio proposed to make in this amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence.
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative
Record No. OH-1993). The EPA responded on June 20, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH-2030), that it reviewed
the proposed amendment but had no comments.


V. Director's Decision


Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed program amendment as submitted by Ohio on May 17, 1994.
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 935 codifying decisions concerning the Ohio program are being amended to implement
this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process
and to encourage States to conform their programs with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of
State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.


VI. Procedural Determinations


Executive Order No. 12866


This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Management
Planning and Review).


Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731 and 732 have been met.


National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements which require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding Federal
regulations.

Diethylene Glycol; Tolerance Exemption 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the current exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of diethylene glycol
by expanding its use as an inert ingredient, to read ``deactivator, adjuvant for formulations used before crop emerges
from the soil.'' Texaco Chemical Co. requested this regulation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24100), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that Texaco Chemical Co., P.O. Box 27707, Houston,
TX 77227-7707, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 2E4191 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant
to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(d)
by amending the current exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of diethylene glycol by expanding
its use as an inert ingredient, to read ``deactivator, adjuvant for formulations used before crop emerges from the
soil.'' 


Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the amended tolerance exemption will
protect the public health. Therefore, the amended tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Conflict of Interest



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission has adopted rules to implement the provisions of the Telecommunications Authorizations Act of 1992,
which created a new section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act that authorizes the Commission to accept unconditional
gifts, donations and bequests in furtherance of its functions. The Commission has ensured that its rules are consistent
with the directive in section 4(g)(3) to promulgate implementing regulations that ``include provisions to preclude
the acceptance of any gift, bequest or donation that would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict
of interest.'' These regulations will promote the performance of the Commission's regulatory functions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

1. This is a summary of the Report and Order (R&O) in GC Docket 93-153, adopted June 24, 1994 and released July
22, 1994. The full text of this document is available for inspection and copying Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 4:30
p.m. in the FCC Dockets Reference Room (Room 239), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554, and may be purchased from
the Commission's copy contractor International Transcription Services, Inc. (ITS, Inc.), 2100 M Street NW., Suite
140, Washington, DC 20037.



2. The purpose of this R&O is to implement the conflict of interest restrictions in section 4(g)(3) of the Communications
Act, which authorizes the Commission to accept unconditional gifts, donations and bequests. In order to develop
implementing regulations, the Commission looked for guidance to the policies of other agencies that have statutory
gift acceptance authority, the provisions of the new Office of Government Ethics (OGE) government-wide standards
of employee conduct, and General Services Administration (GSA) regulations implementing agency acceptance of
travel reimbursement. The Commission requested commenters to submit alternative proposals. None of the parties
who filed comments in this proceeding endorsed an absolute ban on the acceptance of gifts from Commission regulatees.
As discussed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), 58 FR 34405 (1994), and as also pointed out by commenters,
we continue to believe that imposing such an absolute ban would exclude a vast number of potential donors, and those
who may be the most likely donors of equipment or other services that would be useful to the Commission in achieving
more efficient performance of its regulatory functions. In addition, as discussed in our NPRM, gifts to agencies
do not necessarily involve the same type or degree of conflicts or appearance concerns as those of personal gifts made
to employees with decisionmaking responsibility_the focus of most traditional conflict of interest regulations,
such as the OGE government-wide standards of employee conduct. In the NPRM, we concluded that, in the context of agency
gift acceptance, more flexible approaches could be used. Commenters agreed with the conclusion reached in our NPRM
that less restrictive policies can be formulated which adequately address conflict of interest concerns. Accordingly,
the Commission has decided to reject an absolute ban on gifts from regulated entities and to construe section 4(g)(3)
in a flexible manner that will better achieve its statutory objective and promote the performance of the Commission's
regulatory functions.

3. Section 4(g)(3), unlike some agency gift acceptance statutes, expressly limits the Commission's gift acceptance
authority to gifts that are ``unconditional.'' This statutory restriction effectively precludes gifts that are
made contingent on official action. To guard against any potential that official action could be influenced by gifts,
we have determined that it is critical to ensure that the section 4(g)(3) prohibition on conditional gifts is carefully
and scrupulously observed. The regulations adopted in this Order contain certain structural safeguards and absolute
prohibitions designed to avoid both conflict of interest concerns and appearance concerns. In addition, the regulations
impose mandatory factors that authorized agency ethics officials must consider in determining whether conflicts
or appearance problems exist. Finally, the regulations contain public disclosure and reporting requirements that
are intended to minimize or eliminate appearance problems. We believe that these mechanisms work together effectively
to eliminate the conflicts of interest and appearance concerns. In order to insulate agency officials with programmatic
responsibilities, insofar as possible, from involvement in determinations regarding gift acceptance or discussions
with potential donors regarding gifts, we are requiring potential donors and Commission employees who receive gift
overtures to refer such matters to the Commission's designated agency ethics official. We also are imposing an absolute
bar on agency solicitation of gifts from regulated entities and others identified as prohibited sources under the
new OGE standards of conduct. We are requiring that all monetary gifts be made by check rather than in cash. Further,
because we think that conflicts of interest and appearance problems may be greatest when the gifts made to the agency
appear to enure more to the personal benefit of employees, we have decided that certain types of gifts should be prohibited
altogether, e.g., food and drink which would continue to be governed by the OGE standards of conduct or other independent
authority.

4. We have also decided not to accept under section 4(g)(3) gifts of travel expenses for attendance at meetings that
are governed by the regulations implementing 31 U.S.C. 1353, the government-wide travel reimbursement statute.
The GSA rules implementing section 1353 prohibit agencies from using general gift acceptance statutes to accept
travel reimbursement for attendance at meetings that are covered by that section. As we noted in the NPRM, however,
GSA's rules implementing 1353 do not govern the acceptance of travel and related expenses for attendance at, or participation
in, meetings or events that are required to carry out an agency's statutory or regulatory functions. We agree with
commenters that there are substantial public interest benefits to be gained by employees' attendance at, or participation
in, certain government sponsored meetings or events (such as international coordination meetings provided for
by treaty). Thus, to the extent that attendance at, or participation in, government sponsored meetings or events
are deemed outside the scope of 1353 coverage (because the meetings are required in order to carry out statutory or
regulatory functions) we will permit the acceptance of travel reimbursement for them under section 4(g)(3).

5. The Commission has established the imposition of mandatory factors that Commission officials must consider in
determining whether conflicts or appearance problems may exist. Where gifts are offered by a regulated entity, we
will require officials making conflict of interest determinations to evaluate at the outset the extent to which benefits
of the gift might accrue to individual employees. If the gift does benefit an individual employee, agency officials
shall consider whether that employee is responsible for matters affecting the potential donor that are currently
pending before the agency and the significance of the employee's role in such matters. Whether or not the proposed
gift benefits employees personally, we will consider: the nature and sensitivity of any matters pending at the Commission
affecting the regulated source and the timing of the gift; the market value of the gift; and the frequency of gifts made
by a particular donor. Finally, we have adopted public disclosure and reporting requirements that are intended to
minimize or eliminate appearance problems. The Commission will keep a detailed record of all gifts accepted from
prohibited sources and make the following information publicly available concerning gifts that are accepted: the
identity of the prohibited source; a description of the gift; market value of the gift; documentation concerning
the prohibited source's reason for the gift; a verification from the prohibited source that the gift is unconditional
(not contingent on any promise or expectation that the Commission's receipt of the gift will benefit the donor in any
regulatory matter); and the date the gift is accepted by the Commission. The Commission shall file a semi-annual report
to Congress listing the gift, donor, and value of all gifts accepted from any donor under section 4(g)(3) authority.



Conclusion



6. We believe that, as mandated by section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act, the regulations adopted here will preclude
real and apparent conflicts of interest when the Commission exercises its new gift acceptance authority. In order
to ensure the integrity of our process, we have, as discussed above, adopted numerous safeguards which will require
careful consideration of conflicts of interest issues by impartial agency ethics officials. Our rules will also
ensure that our actions implementing this authority are exposed to the fullest possible public and congressional
scrutiny.

Subpart R_Implementation of Section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act: Procedures Governing Acceptance of Unconditional
Gifts, Donations and Bequests


 1.3000


Purpose and scope.



The purpose of this subpart is to implement the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992 which amended the Communications
Act by creating section 4(g)(3), 47 U.S.C. 154(g)(3). The provisions of this subpart shall apply to gifts, donations
and bequests made to the Commission itself. Travel reimbursement for attendance at, or participation in, government-sponsored
meetings or events required to carry out the Commission's statutory or regulatory functions may also be accepted
under this subpart. The acceptance of gifts by Commission employees, most notably gifts of food, drink and entertainment,
is governed by the government-wide standards of employee conduct established at 5 CFR part 2635. Travel, subsistence
and related expenses for non-government-sponsored meetings or events will continue to be accepted pursuant to the
Government Employees Training Act, 41 U.S.C. 4111 or 31 U.S.C. 1353, and its General Services Administration's implementing
regulations, 41 CFR 304-1.8, as applicable.



 1.3001



Definitions.



For purposes of this subpart:

(a) The term 

agency 

means the Federal Communications Commission.
(b) The term 

gift 

means any unconditional gift, donation or bequest of real, personal and other property (including voluntary and
uncompensated services as authorized under 5 U.S.C. 3109).

(c) The terms 

agency ethics official, 



designated agency ethics official, 



employee, market value, person, 

and 

prohibited source, 

have the same meaning as found in 5 CFR 2635.102, 2635.203.



 1.3002



Structural rules and prohibitions.



(a) 

General prohibitions. 

An employee shall not:

(1) Directly or indirectly, solicit or coerce the offering of a gift, donation or bequest to the Commission from a regulated
entity or other prohibited source; or

(2) Accept gifts of cash pursuant to this subpart.

(b) 

Referral of offers to designated agency ethics official. 

Any person who seeks to offer any gift to the Commission under the provisions of this subpart shall make such offer to
the Commission's designated agency ethics official. In addition, any Commission employee who is contacted by a potential
donor or the representative thereof for the purpose of discussing the possibility of making a gift, donation or bequest
to the Commission shall immediately refer such person or persons to the Commission's designated agency ethics official.
The designated agency ethics official shall, in consultation with other agency ethics officials, make a determination
concerning whether acceptance of such offers would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of
interest. Agency ethics officials may also advise potential donors and their representatives of the types of equipment,
property or services that may be of use to the Commission and the procedures for effectuating gifts set forth in this
subpart. The Commission may, in its discretion, afford public notice before accepting any gift under authority of
this subpart.



 1.3003



Mandatory factors for evaluating conflicts of interest.



No gift shall be accepted under this subpart unless a determination is made that its acceptance would not create a conflict
of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. In making conflict of interest determinations, designated
agency ethics officials shall consider the following factors:

(a) Whether the benefits of the intended gift will accrue to an individual employee and, if so_

(1) Whether the employee is responsible for matters affecting the potential donor that are currently before the agency;
and

(2) The significance of the employee's role in any such matters;

(b) The nature and sensitivity of any matters pending at the Commission affecting the intended donor;

(c) The timing of the intended gift;

(d) The market value of the intended gift;
(e) The frequency of other gifts made by the same donor; and

(1) The identity of the prohibited source; 

(2) A description of the gift;

(3) The market value of the gift;

(4) Documentation concerning the prohibited source's reason for the gift as required in  1.3003(f);

(5) A signed statement of verification from the prohibited source that the gift is unconditional and is not contingent
on any promise or expectation that the Commission's receipt of the gift will benefit the proposed donor in any regulatory
matter; and

(6) The date the gift is accepted by the Commission.

(b) 

Reporting Requirements for all gifts.

Revision to NASA FAR Supplement Coverage on Set-Asides for Small Business


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NASA has revised the NASA FAR Supplement to address the action NASA centers must take when the Small Business Administration
(SBA) appeals a decision not to set aside a procurement for small businesses.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background


Current policy contained in NASA FAR Supplement  1819.505 (c), (d), and (e) addresses situations in which a
small business set-aside is not initiated or pursued. In NFS  1819.505(c), if the contracting officer disapproves
the Small Business Specialist's set-aside recommendation, the contracting officer shall promptly refer the case
to the SBA representative (if one is assigned and available) for review. In NFS  1819.505(d), cases involving
the non-initiation of a set-aside require referral to the SBA representative (if one is assigned and available) for
review. NFS  1819.505(e) addresses the situation when an SBA representative is not assigned or available,
and the contracting officer disagrees with the Small Business Specialist's recommendation on a small business set-aside,
or withdrawal or modification of a set-aside determination. The Small Business Specialist may make a written appeal
to the center procurement officer whose decision may overrule the Small Business Specialist's recommendation.
Upon later review of this action, SBA may disagree with the procurement officer's decision not to set aside a procurement
for small business and may appeal the decision. If SBA does pursue an appeal in the situations described in NFS  1819.505
(c), (d), or (e), the Office of Procurement at NASA Headquarters wants the NASA center to notify them in writing as soon
as SBA appeals the procurement officer's decision.



Availability of NASA FAR Supplement



The NASA FAR Supplement, of which this proposed coverage will become a part, is codified in 48 CFR chapter 18, and is
available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,

Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule clarifies who the responsible NASA contracting officer is when more than one contract is affected. This
action is necessary to assure compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, ensure that NASA coordinates
internally disallowance of costs and to make the NFS more understandable. The effect of this action will be better
coordination within NASA.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background



NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) 1842.801(a) requires the contracting officer to take action after receipt of a NASA Form
456, Notice of Contract Costs Suspended or Disapproved, or a DCAA Form 1, Notice of Costs Suspended and/or Disapproved
under Cost Reimbursement Contracts. However, when more than one contract is cited on the notice, the NFS does not specify
which contracting officer has responsibility for the action. NFS 1842.801 is changed to clarify that the contracting
officer with the most dollars affected is responsible for coordination with the other affected contracting officers,
including those of other federal agencies. The cross-reference at 1842.801(b) is also revised to identify the correct
cite. In addition, 1853.242-72 is revised to include the correct prescription cite. Other minor changes have
also been made for efficiency or clarification.


Impact


NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601

(3) Issue a new NASA Form 456 suspending the costs rather than disapproving them pending resolution of the issues.

(4) Have the contractor issue a new voucher removing the costs in question from its claim and return the NASA Form 456
to the auditor unsigned.

(5) Return the unsigned NASA Form 456 to the auditor with a detailed explanation of why the suspension or disapproval
is not being countersigned, and process the contractor's claim for payment. 

(b) When more than one NASA contract is affected by a notice, the NASA contracting officer with the largest amount of
contract dollars affected is responsible for coordination on the NASA Form 456 with the other affected contracting
officers, including those of other federal agencies, listed in the notice. 

(c) The NASA contracting officer, when in agreement with the NASA Form 456 initiated by the auditor, shall assign a
notice number and shall countersign the form. An original and three copies (which includes two acknowledgement copies,
one each for return to the contracting officer and the auditor) of the form shall be sent to the contractor by certified
mail, return receipt requested; one copy shall be attached to the Standard Form 1034 and each copy of the Standard Form
1034A (see 1842.7101(c)) on which the deduction for the suspension/disapproval is made, and one copy shall be sent
to the auditor. 

(d) The total amount suspended or disapproved, as shown on the NASA Form 456, shall be inserted in the Differences block
of the Standard Form 1034 and 1034A, citing the applicable NASA Form 456. 

(e)(1) If the amount of the deduction is more than the amount of the public voucher, the installment method of deduction
shall be applied to the current and subsequent public vouchers until the amount is fully liquidated. The deductions
on any voucher may not exceed the voucher amount to avoid processing of a voucher in a credit amount. Public voucher(s)
with zero amounts must be forwarded to the fiscal or financial management office for appropriate action. 

(2) If deductions are in excess of contractor claims, recovery may be made through a direct refund from the contractor,
in the form of a check payable to NASA, or by a set-off deduction from the voucher(s) submitted by the contractor under
any other contract, unless those contracts contain a ``no set-off'' provision. If a set-off is affected, the voucher(s)
from which the deduction is made should be annotated to identify the contract and appropriation affected and the applicable
NASA Form 456.

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; final 1994 specification of Pacific halibut bycatch allowances.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS implements regulations for several management measures to prevent certain Gulf of Alaska (GOA) trawl fisheries
from taking an unnecessarily large share of the GOA halibut bycatch limit; amend the directed fishing standards to
prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder, or groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing,
as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other, more valuable groundfish species that are closed to directed
fishing; change the opening date of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian
Islands management area (BSAI) from May 1 to January 1; and implement changes pertaining to the annual specification
and management of GOA halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. This action is necessary to reduce the likelihood
that one sector of the Alaska trawl fleet will preempt others for a share of the Pacific halibut bycatch limit established
for vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, and provide greater opportunity to harvest available groundfish under halibut
bycatch restrictions in both the GOA and BSAI fisheries. This action is intended to further the objectives of the fishery
management plans for the groundfish fisheries off Alaska.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the GOA and the BSAI are managed by the Secretary
of Commerce in accordance with the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish
Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the
U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675.
Existing regulations provide a framework process for the annual specification of GOA halibut PSC limits for trawl
and fixed gear fisheries and for apportioning these limits by season. Although these regulations limit the bycatch
of Pacific halibut in the GOA groundfish trawl fisheries, they have resulted in conflict among and preemption of groundfish
trawling operations in the GOA as different trawl fishery components compete for shares of the available halibut
PSC limit. This results in the attainment of the halibut bycatch cap before some groundfish Total Allowable Catch
(TAC) limits have been taken, causing a closure of trawling operations in the GOA, even though the full groundfish
harvest amount has not been taken in some fisheries.
This rule implements the following three measures to address the preemption of one trawl fishery sector by another.
1. Establish two GOA trawl fishery categories for the purpose of apportioning the GOA halibut bycatch limit already
established for the trawl gear fisheries ( 672.20 (f)). These two categories are the following: (1) The shallow-water
fishery complex (pollock, Pacific cod, Atka mackerel, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, and ``other species'');
and (2) the deep-water fishery complex (the deep-water flatfish, rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, sablefish, and
rockfish).
2. Revise the method for calculating retainable amounts of groundfish species under directed fishing standards
( 672.20(h) and  675.20(i)). Revised methods prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder,
or groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing, as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other,
more valuable groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing.
3. Adjust the opening date for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1 to January 1. As a
result of this season adjustment, directed fishing standards governing retainable amounts of flatfish species
at  675.20(h)(2) also are revised.
This final rule also implements editorial changes to regulatory language pertaining to the annual specification
and management of GOA halibut PSC limits. In addition, NMFS apportions the 1994 GOA halibut trawl PSC limit among fisheries
and seasons as set out below:

An emergency rule implementing these measures was published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6222), under section 305(c)
of the Magnuson Act. At its April 1994 meeting the Council voted to extend the emergency rule for another 90 days (59
FR 24965, May 13, 1994). A proposed rule to implement these measures was published in the Federal Register

 on May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23044). A complete description of, and justification for, the management measures, including
editorial changes to regulations addressing GOA halibut bycatch amounts, was discussed in the preamble to the proposed
rule. Additional information also is available in the EA/RIR (see 

ADDRESSES

).
Public comment on the proposed rule was invited through 
May 31, 1994. One letter of comments was received within the comment period and is summarized and responded to below
in the 

Response to Comments

 section.


Response to Comments




Comment 1: 

Splitting the halibut bycatch limit between the shallow-water fishery complex and the deep-water fishery complex
splits the limit between a well-observed fleet with 100-percent observer coverage (mainly in the deep-water fisheries)
and a poorly observed fleet with 30-percent observer coverage (mainly in the shallow-water fisheries). Because
the 30-percent boats have greater latitude to take an observer, the bycatch data collected for the shallow-water
fisheries would be biased and, therefore, less accurate than the data collected for the deep-water fisheries, thus
jeopardizing the management of the halibut bycatch limits. This action would degrade the scientific basis for halibut
bycatch management and is contrary to national standard 2.


Response: 

Consistent with national standard 2, NMFS continues to monitor the groundfish fishery using the best information
available. Opportunities do exist in the 30-percent observer coverage fleet for vessel operators to manipulate
observer coverage to reduce or increase coverage in different fisheries. However, NMFS has taken measures to increase
observer coverage in the groundfish fleet to improve the accuracy of catch monitoring. A recent amendment to the Observer
Plan (59 FR 22133, April 29, 1994) changed observer coverage requirements for vessels required to obtain 30-percent
observer coverage. The amendment to the Observer Plan limits the manipulation of observer coverage by requiring
vessels to carry an observer during at least 30 percent of their fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessels
participate for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish. These vessels are also required to have
an observer on board the vessel during one trip in each fishery, as defined in the Observer Plan amendment, in which
they participate. These measures should reduce the potential for manipulation of observer coverage and increase
the amount of observer data available for the management of the specific fisheries.


Comment 2: 

Processors are not required to report harvests such that NMFS can reasonably attribute shoreside catch to a given
target with its appropriate bycatch. Currently, one target species is assigned per week, even though vessels delivering
to a plant may have targeted several different species. This system cannot be used to monitor scientifically a separate
shallow-water fisheries halibut bycatch limit and is inconsistent with national standard 2.

<DOCNO> FR940727-0-00052 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-0-00024 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response

: For purposes of attributing halibut bycatch, NMFS assigns a target fishery based on maximum retained amounts (except
midwater pollock, for which pollock must comprise 95 percent or more of the total catch) and estimates halibut bycatch
for each unique combination of processor, gear type, and reporting area, on a weekly basis. Halibut bycatch is attributed
to one of the two fishery categories for which a trawl halibut bycatch allowance is made. Bycatch from the bottom pollock,
Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, or ``other species'' fisheries is attributed
to the shallow-water species complex. Bycatch from the sablefish, rockfish, deep-water flatfish, and arrowtooth
flounder fisheries is attributed to the deep-water species complex. NMFS does not have the ability to assign target
fisheries based on vessel hauls or individual vessel deliveries. Given this procedure, NMFS does monitor bycatch
consistent with the intent of the regulations and based on the best available scientific information. 



Comment 3

: The NMFS Alaska Fisheries Science Center should review this rule and concur that it will provide the best available
scientific data to monitor the halibut bycatch limit. 



Response

: Regulations that are drafted by the NMFS Alaska Regional Office are developed in consultation with the Alaska Fisheries
Science Center. 



Changes in the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule 



This final rule includes one editorial change in  672.20(f)(3)(i) to clarify an inconsistency with respect
to paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of the same section. Section (f)(1)(iv) provides the authority to establish a separate halibut
PSC allowance by regulatory area and district; however, 
 672.20(f)(3)(i) does not provide the authority for closures based on regulatory area or district once an allowance
is reached. Language has been added to paragraph  672.20(f)(3)(i) to indicate that, upon attainment of a bycatch
allowance for the entire Gulf of Alaska or the applicable regulatory area or district, a closure would be made. 

Upon reviewing the reasons for, and the comments on, this action, NMFS has determined that this rule is necessary for
fishery conservation and management. 



Classification 



The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this rule,
if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The reasons were
published in the preamble to the proposed rule (59 FR 24965, May 5, 1994). As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis
was not prepared. NMFS prepared an analysis of the economic impact on small entities as part of the EA/RIR. A copy of
the EA/RIR is available from NMFS (see 

ADDRESSES

). 

This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 

NMFS has determined that delaying the effectiveness of this final rule for the entire 30 days under the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(d), is contrary to the public interest in orderly conduct of the fisheries in the EEZ. This
rule supersedes the original emergency rule implementing these measures which expires August 9, 1994. The fishery
has been operating under the emergency rule with a benefit to the fishery. To avoid an interruption in the fishery as
it is currently being conducted under the emergency rule, NMFS is waiving a portion of the 30-day delayed effectiveness
period for this rule to correspond with the expiration of the emergency rule.

(f) 

Halibut PSC limits

. (1) 

Notification of proposed halibut PSC limits

. NMFS will publish annually in the 

Federal Register

 proposed and final halibut PSC limits and apportionments thereof authorized under this paragraph (f), in the notification
required under paragraph (c) of this section. Public comment will be accepted by NMFS on the proposed halibut PSC limits,
and apportionments thereof, for a period of 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. NMFS will consider comments received on proposed halibut limits and, after consultation with the Council, will
publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 specifying the final halibut PSC limits and apportionments thereof. 

(i) 

Trawl gear fisheries

. (A) After consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 specifying the proposed halibut PSC limit for vessels using trawl gear. The halibut PSC limit specified for vessels
using trawl gear may be further apportioned as bycatch allowances to the fishery categories listed in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B)
of this section, based on each category's proportional share of the anticipated halibut bycatch mortality during
a fishing year and the need to optimize the amount of total groundfish harvest under the halibut PSC limit. The sum of
all bycatch allowances will equal the halibut PSC limit established under this paragraph (f)(1)(i). 

(B) For purposes of apportioning the trawl halibut PSC limit among fisheries, the following fishery categories are
specified and defined in terms of round-weight equivalents of those groundfish species for which a TAC has been specified
under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section: 

(

1

) 

Shallow-water species fishery

. Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained aggregate catch of pollock,
Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, and ``other species'' that is greater than the
retained aggregate amount of other groundfish species or species group. 

(

2

) 

Deep-water species fishery

. Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of groundfish and is not
a shallow-water species fishery as defined under paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B)(

1

) of this section. 

(ii) 

Hook-and-line and pot gear fisheries

. After consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 specifying the proposed halibut PSC limits for the hook-and-line gear fisheries. The notification also may specify
a halibut PSC limit for the pot gear fisheries. The proposed halibut PSC limit for hook-and-line gear fisheries may
be further apportioned, as bycatch allowances, to the directed fishery for demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast
Outside District of the Eastern Regulatory Area and to all other hook-and-line gear fisheries. 

(iii) 

Seasonal apportionments

. (A) NMFS, after consultation with the Council, may apportion each halibut PSC limit or bycatch allowance specified
under this paragraph (f) on a seasonal basis. NMFS will base any seasonal apportionment of a halibut PSC limit or bycatch
allowance on the following types of information: 

(

1

) Seasonal distribution of halibut; 

(

2

) Seasonal distribution of target groundfish species relative to halibut distribution; 

(

3

) Expected halibut bycatch needs, on a seasonal basis, relative to changes in halibut biomass and expected catches
of target groundfish species; 

(

4

) Expected variations in bycatch rates throughout the fishing year; 

(

5

) Expected changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons; 

(

6

) Expected start of fishing effort; and 

(

7

) Economic effects of establishing seasonal halibut allocations on segments of the target groundfish industry.


(B) Unused seasonal apportionments of halibut PSC limits specified for trawl, hook-and-line, or pot gear will be
added to the respective seasonal apportionment for the next season during a current fishing year. 

(C) If a seasonal apportionment of a halibut PSC limit specified for trawl, hook-and-line, or pot gear is exceeded,
the amount by which the seasonal apportionment is exceeded will be deducted from the respective apportionment for
the next season during a current fishing year.

(iv) 

Apportionment among regulatory areas and districts. 

Each halibut PSC limit specified under this paragraph (f) also may be apportioned among the regulatory areas and districts
of the Gulf of Alaska. 
(2) NMFS, by notification in the 

Federal Register

, may change the halibut PSC limits during the year for which they were specified, based on new information of the types
set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. 
(3) 

Attainment of a halibut PSC limit or bycatch allowance. 

(i) Trawl gear fisheries. 

If, during the fishing year, the Regional Director determines that U.S. fishing vessels participating in either
of the trawl fishery categories listed in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of this section will catch the Pacific halibut bycatch
allowance, or apportionments thereof, specified for that fishery category under paragraph (f)(1) of this section,
NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 closing the entire Gulf of Alaska or the applicable regulatory area or district to directed fishing with trawl gear
for each species and/or species group that comprises that fishing category; provided, however, that when the halibut
bycatch allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for the shallow-water species fishery is reached,
fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear may continue, consistent with other provisions of this part.


(ii) 

Hook-and-line fisheries. 

(A) 

Groundfish other than demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District. 

If, during the year, the Regional Director determines that the catch of halibut by operators of vessels using hook-and-line
gear in groundfish fisheries other than the directed fishery for demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside
District will reach the halibut bycatch allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for hook-and-line
gear under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish, other than demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District,
by vessels using hook-and-line gear for the remainder of the season to which the halibut bycatch allowance or seasonal
apportionment thereof applies. 
(B) 

Demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District. 

If, during the year, the Regional Director determines that the catch of halibut by operators of vessels using hook-and-line
gear in the directed fishery for demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District will reach the halibut
bycatch allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for this fishery under paragraph (f)(1) of this
section, NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 prohibiting directed fishing for demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District by vessels using hook-and-line
gear for the remainder of the season to which the halibut bycatch allowance or seasonal apportionment thereof applies.



(iii) 

Pot gear fisheries. 

If, during the fishing year, the Regional Director determines that the catch of halibut by operators of vessels using
pot gear to participate in a directed fishery for groundfish will reach the halibut PSC limit, or seasonal apportionment
thereof, provided for under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, NMFS will publish notification in the 

Federal Register

 prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using pot gear for the remainder of the season to which the
halibut PSC limit or seasonal apportionment applies. 


(4) When the vessels to which a halibut PSC limit applies have caught an amount of halibut equal to that PSC, the Regional
Director may, by notification in the 

Federal Register

, allow some or all of those vessels to continue to fish for groundfish using nonpelagic trawl gear under specified
conditions, subject to the other provisions of this part. In authorizing and conditioning such continued fishing
with bottom-trawl gear, the Regional Director will take into account the following considerations, and issue relevant
findings: 
(i) The risk of biological harm to halibut stocks and of socio-economic harm to authorized halibut users posed by continued
bottom trawling by these vessels; 


(ii) The extent to which these vessels have avoided incidental halibut catches up to that point in the year; 


(iii) The confidence of the Regional Director in the accuracy of the estimates of incidental halibut catches by these
vessels up to that point in the year; 


(iv) Whether observer coverage of these vessels is sufficient to assure adherence to the prescribed conditions and
to alert the Regional Director to increases in their incidental halibut catches; and 

(v) The enforcement record of owners and operators of these vessels, and the confidence of the Regional Director that
adherence to the prescribed conditions can be assured in light of available enforcement resources. 




* * * * * 


(h) * * * 


(1) 

Calculations. 

(i) In making any determination concerning directed fishing under paragraph (g) of this section, the amount or percentage
of any species, species group, or any fish or fish products will be calculated in round-weight equivalents. 


(ii) Arrowtooth flounder, or any groundfish species for which directed fishing is closed, may not be used to calculate
retainable amounts of other groundfish species under paragraph (g) of this section.

and appearance of witnesses in criminal and civil court actions; procedures to follow when soldiers are summoned
for jury duty; and, procedures for cooperation with the Office of Special Counsel. This part does not apply to DA or
DOD proceedings such as courts-martial or administrative boards. 



Executive Order 12291 



This final rule has been classified as nonmajor. The effect of the this rule on the economy will be less than $100 million.




Regulatory Flexibility Act

Subpart B_Service of Process



 516.8 

General.



(a) Defined. Process is a legal document that compels a defendant in an action to appear in court or to comply with the
court's demands, for example, in a civil case a summons or subpoena, or in a criminal case, a warrant for arrest, indictment,
contempt order, subpoena, or summons. Service of process is the delivery of the document to a defendant to notify him
of a claim or charge against him.

(b) Policy. DA personnel will follow the guidance of this chapter when civil officials attempt to serve civil or criminal
process on individuals on Federal property.

(c) Procedures. Provost marshals shall ensure that installation law enforcement personnel are adequately trained
to respond to situations which arise with regard to service of civil and criminal process. SJAs or legal advisers shall
provide guidance to law enforcement personnel in these matters.



 516.9 

Service of criminal process within the United States.



(a) Surrender of personnel. Guidance for surrender of military personnel to civilian law enforcement officials
is in Chapter 7 of AR 630-10 and AR l90-9. Army officials will cooperate with civilian law enforcement authorities
who seek the surrender of a soldier in connection with criminal charges. Special rules apply when a bail bondsman or

 516.10 

Service of civil process within the United States.



(a) Policy. DA officials will not prevent or evade the service or process in legal actions brought against the United
States or against themselves in their official capacities. If acceptance of service of process would interfere with
the performance of military duties, Army officials may designate a representative to accept service. DA personnel
sued in their individual capacity should seek legal counsel concerning voluntary acceptance of process.

(b) Requests for witnesses or evidence in civil proceedings. See subpart H to this part.

(c) Process of Federal courts. Subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the commander, civil officials will
be permitted to serve Federal process. (See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4, 45).

(d) Process of state courts.

(1) In areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction that are not subject to the right to serve state process, the commander
or supervisor will determine whether the individual to be served wishes to accept service voluntarily. A JA or other
DA attorney will inform the individual of the legal effect of voluntary acceptance. If the individual does not desire
to accept service, the party requesting service will be notified that the nature of the exclusive Federal jurisdiction
precludes service by state authorities on the military installation.

(2) On Federal property where the right to serve process is reserved by or granted to the state, in areas of concurrent
jurisdiction, or where the United States has only a proprietary interest, Army officials asked to facilitate service
of process will initially proceed as provided in the preceding subparagraph. If the individual declines to accept
service, the requesting party will be allowed to serve the process in accordance with applicable state law, subject
to reasonable restrictions imposed by the commander.

(e) Process of foreign courts. A U.S. District Court may order service upon a person who resides in the judicial district
of any document issued in connection with a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal. (28 U.S.C. 1696). In
addition, the U.S. State Department has the power to receive a letter rogatory issued by a foreign or international
tribunal, to transmit it to a tribunal, officer or agency in the United States, and to return it after execution. (28
U.S.C. 1781). Absent a treaty or agreement to the contrary, these provisions will govern.

(f) Seizure of personal property. State and Federal courts issue orders (for example, writ of attachment) authorizing
a levy (seizure) of property to secure satisfaction of a judgment. DA personnel will comply with valid state or Federal
court orders commanding or authorizing the seizure of private property to the same extent that state or Federal process
is served.

 516.12

 Service of civil process outside the United States.



(a) Process of foreign courts. In foreign countries service of process issued by foreign courts will be made under
the law of the place of service, as modified by status of forces agreements, treaties or other agreements. In foreign
areas under exclusive U.S. jurisdiction, service of process issued by foreign courts will be made under the law specified
by appropriate U.S. authority.

(b) Process of Federal courts. Service of process on U.S. citizens or residents may be accomplished under the following
provisions: The Hague Convention, reprinted in 28 USCA Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, following Rule 4; Fed. R.
Civ. P. 4(i); 28 USC 1781 and 1783; and, the rules of the Federal court concerned. If a DA official receives a request
to serve Federal process on a person overseas, he will determine if the individual wishes to accept service voluntarily.
Individuals will be permitted to seek counsel. If the person will not accept service voluntarily, the party requesting
service will be notified and advised to follow procedures prescribed by the law of the foreign country concerned.

(c) Process of state courts. If a DA official receives a request to serve state court process on a person overseas, he
will determine if the individual wishes to accept service voluntarily. Individuals will be permitted to seek counsel.
If the person will not accept service voluntarily, the party requesting service will be notified and advised to follow
procedures prescribed by the law of the foreign country concerned. (See, for example, The Hague Convention, reprinted
in 28 USCA Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, following Rule 4).

(d) Suits against the United States. DA personnel served with foreign civil process will notify the appropriate SJA
or legal adviser, who will return the document to the issuing authority explaining the lack of authority to accept
service for the United States. Service on the United States must be made upon DOJ through established diplomatic channels.



 516.13 

Assistance in serving process overseas.



(a) Europe. For information and assistance concerning service of process of persons assigned to or accompanying
U.S. Forces in Europe, contact the Foreign Law Branch, International Law Division, Office of The Judge Advocate,

(c) Reports to HQDA. Reports required by this regulation will be made telephonically or mailed to the responsible
organization at DA. Appendix B to this part contains mailing addresses for these offices. Except in the situations
described below, reports required by this chapter will be made to Litigation Division:

(1) Actual or potential litigation (or administrative infringement claims) involving patents, copyrights, or
trademarks will be made to Intellectual Property Law Division.

(2) Reports of pending or prospective litigation involving taxation will be made to Contract Law Division.

(3) Communications, transportation, and utility services reports will be made to Regulatory Law Office.

possible. If downgrading or declassification is not feasible, the classified material should be separated from
the report and forwarded under separate cover.

(e) Other reporting requirements. Reports required by this chapter are in addition to and do not satisfy any other
reporting requirement, such as the following: notifying the FBI of offenses pursuant to AR 27-10; submitting
serious incident reports pursuant to AR 190-40; reporting procurement fraud or other irregularities per Defense
Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, section 209.406-3 (48 CFR 209.406-3); reporting the exercise
of criminal jurisdiction by foreign tribunals over U.S. personnel pursuant to AR 27-50; or, reporting bankruptcies
per AR 37-103.

(f) Reports control exemption. The reports required herein are exempt from reports control under AR 335-15,
paragraphs 3-3a(5) and 5-2e(4).



 516.16 

Individual and supervisory procedures upon commencement of legal proceedings.



(a) Individual procedures. DA personnel served with civil or criminal process concerning a proceeding in which the
United States has an interest ( 516.15) will immediately inform their supervisor and furnish copies of process
and pleadings. There is no requirement to notify supervisors of purely private litigation.

(b) Supervisory procedures. When supervisors learn that legal proceedings in which the United States has an interest
have commenced, the supervisor will forward a copy of all process and pleadings, along with other readily available
information, to the SJA or legal adviser. If no legal officer is available locally, the documents will be forwarded
to the SJA or legal adviser of the next higher headquarters.



 516.17 

SJA or legal adviser procedures.



(a) Immediate notice to HQDA. When an SJA or legal adviser learns of litigation in which the United States has an interest,
and it appears that HQDA is not aware of the action, the SJA or legal adviser will telephonically notify the responsible
HQDA office. (See  516.15(c)). Immediate notice is particularly important when litigation involves one of
the following: a lawsuit against an employee in his individual capacity; a motion for a temporary restraining order
or preliminary injunction; a habeas corpus proceeding; a judicial or administrative proceeding involving less
than 60 days to file an answer; and, actions with possible Congressional, Secretarial, or Army Staff interest. For
legal proceedings instituted in foreign tribunals, the SJA or legal adviser will also notify the major overseas commander
concerned and the appropriate U.S. Embassy or Legation. A telephonic report to HQDA should include the following:

(1) Title or style of the proceeding.

(2) Full names and addresses of the parties.

(3) Tribunal in which the action is filed, date filed, docket number, when and on whom service of process was made, and
date by which pleading or response is required.

(4) Nature of the action, amount claimed or relief sought.

(5) Reasons for immediate action.

(b) Transmission of process, pleadings, and related papers. Unless instructed otherwise by HQDA, the SJA or legal
adviser will FAX or mail HQDA a copy of all process, pleadings, and related papers. Use of express mail or overnight
delivery service is authorized.

(c) Notice to U.S. Attorney. If the legal proceeding is instituted in the United States, the SJA or legal adviser, unless
instructed otherwise by HQDA, will notify the appropriate U.S. Attorney and render assistance as required.



 516.18 

Litigation alleging individual liability.



See Subpart D for procedures to follow when DA personnel, as a result of performance of official duties, are either
sued in their individual capacities or face criminal charges.



 516.19 

Injunctive relief.



(a) General. Plaintiffs may attempt to force government action or restraint in important operational matters or
pending personnel actions through motions for temporary restraining orders (TRO) or preliminary injunctions (PI).
Because these actions can quickly impede military functions, immediate and decisive action must be taken.

(b) Notification to HQDA and U.S. Attorney. The SJA or legal adviser will immediately notify Litigation Division
or other appropriate office at HQDA when a motion for TRO or PI has been, or is about to be, filed. The SJA or legal adviser
will also notify the responsible U.S. Attorney.

<PARENT> FR940727-0-00025 </PARENT>
<TEXT>


(c) Actions by SJA or legal adviser. The SJA or legal adviser will assist the DOJ or DA attorney responsible for the litigation.
Installation attorneys or support personnel should begin accumulating relevant documentary evidence and identifying
witnesses. If requested, installation attorneys will prepare a legal memorandum concerning the motion, giving
particular attention to the following issues relevant to a court granting injunctive relief:

(1) Plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits.

(2) Whether plaintiff will be irreparably harmed if injunctive relief is not granted.

(3) Harm to defendant and other parties if injunctive relief is granted.

(4) The public interest.



 516.20 

Habeas Corpus.



(a) General. A soldier may file a writ of habeas corpus to challenge his continued custody (usually in a post court-martial
situation) or retention in the Army. As is the case with injunctive relief in the preceding paragraph, installation
SJAs and legal advisers must take immediate action.

(b) Notification to Litigation Division and U.S. Attorney. The SJA or legal adviser will notify Litigation Division
and the responsible U.S. Attorney's Office immediately upon learning that a petition for writ of habeas corpus has
been filed. All relevant documentary evidence supporting the challenged action should be assembled immediately.

(c) Procedures in habeas corpus. Upon the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the court will dismiss the
petition, issue the writ, or order the respondent to show cause why it should not be granted. If a writ or order to show
cause is issued, the SJA or legal adviser should be prepared to assist the responsible Litigation Division or DOJ attorney
in preparing a return and answer. If so directed, the SJA will also prepare a memorandum of points and authorities to
accompany the return and answer. The government's response should cover the following: whether the Army has custody
of petitioner; whether respondent and petitioner are within the judicial district; and, whether appellate or administrative
remedies have been exhausted.

(d) Writs or orders issued by state courts. No state court, after being judicially informed that a petitioner is in
custody under the authority of the United States, should interfere with that custody or require that petitioner be
brought before the state court. A deserter, apprehended by any civil officer having authority to apprehend offenders
under the laws of the United States or of any state, district, territory, or possession of the United States, is in custody
by authority of the United States. If a writ of habeas corpus is issued by a state court, the SJA or legal adviser will
seek guidance from Litigation Division.

(e) Foreign court orders. A foreign court should not inquire into the legality of restraint of a person held by U.S.
military authority. If a foreign court issues any process in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus, the SJA or legal adviser
will immediately report the matter to the appropriate U.S. forces commander and to Litigation Division.



 516.21 

Litigation against government contractors.



(a) General. A contract might require that the government reimburse a contractor (or subcontractor) for adverse
judgments or litigation expenses. Unless a contractor or subcontractor facing a lawsuit requests representation
by DOJ, the Army presumes the contractor will obtain private counsel to defend the case. If the contract so allows,
however, the contractor may request and HQDA may recommend that DOJ represent the contractor if it is in the best interests
of the United States.

(b) Actions by SJA or legal adviser. If a contractor or subcontractor faces litigation and the underlying contract
with the government requires reimbursement for adverse judgments or costs of the litigation, the SJA or legal adviser,
through the contracting officer, should determine if the contractor desires representation by DOJ. If so, the contractor
or authorized agent will sign a request for representation. (See Figure D-3, Appendix G, of this part.) The SJA
or legal adviser will determine whether, in his opinion, representation by DOJ should be granted. He will prepare
a memorandum to support his recommendation, especially concerning any issue regarding the government's obligation
to reimburse the contractor under the contract. The SJA or legal adviser will forward his memorandum, along with the
contractor's request, to Litigation Division.

(c) Actions by Litigation Division. The Chief, Litigation Division, will evaluate the submission and decide if it
is in the Army's best interest that the request be granted. He will prepare a memorandum supporting his decision and
send the packet to DOJ. The Chief's decision constitutes the final DA position on the matter. If DOJ grants the contractor's
request, the Chief, Litigation Division, will ensure that the contractor is notified through the SJA or legal adviser
and the contracting officer.

(d) Private Counsel. A contractor represented by DOJ may ask that private counsel assist the DOJ attorney in the litigation.
The DOJ attorney will remain in control of the litigation, and the fees for private counsel will not be reimbursable
except under unusual circumstances. The contractor must seek both DOJ and DA approval to employ private counsel when
DOJ representation has been granted. Even if DOJ and DA grant authority to employ private counsel, the contracting
officer will determine whether a contractor will be reimbursed under the contract for private counsel.

(e) Settlement. The contractor, unless the contract specifies otherwise, will ultimately decide whether to compromise
a suit. Reimbursement under the contract is determined by the contracting officer, with the advice of his attorney.



 516.22 

Miscellaneous reporting requirements.



SJAs or legal advisers will comply with the directives cited below concerning actual or prospective litigation involving
the following types of cases:

(a) Taxation.

(1) Contractor transactions. (FAR and DFARS, 48 CFR parts 29 and 229).

(2) Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) activities. (AR 60-20).

(3) Purchase or sale of alcoholic beverages. (AR 215-2).

(4) Nonappropriated fund and related activities. (AR 215-1).

(b) Tort and contract claims, insurance and litigation involving nonappropriated fund activities. (AR 215-1).

(c) Annexation of Army lands. (AR 405-25).

(d) Communications, transportation, and utility services administrative proceedings. Any contracting officer
or other Army official responsible for the acquisition of communications, transportation, utilities (gas, electric,
water and sewer), or military mail services, who becomes aware of any action or proceeding of interest to the Army,
will promptly refer the matter to the SJA or legal adviser, who will take the actions prescribed in  516.17 of
this part. Examples of actions requiring referral follow: new or amended rates, regulations, or conditions of service;
applications for authority to discontinue or initiate service; changes in electromagnetic patterns causing adverse
communications interference; or, zoning proposals affecting historic or aesthetic preservation. In addition,
the SJA or legal adviser will transmit the following to Regulatory Law Office:

(1) The names and addresses of any parties intervening and the substance of their positions.

(2) Names of government users affected by any change.

(3) Copy of any proposed rates, rules, or regulations.

(4) A recommendation whether the Army should intervene in the action or proceeding. If intervention is recommended,
provide a memorandum to support the recommendation.

(e) Legal proceedings overseas. Foreign communications, transportation, and utility service proceedings need
not be reported. In other legal proceedings instituted in a foreign country, the SJA or legal adviser will take the
actions prescribed in  516.17 of this part.

(f) Maritime claims. Admiralty and maritime claims within the purview of Chapter 8, AR 27-20, which have been
investigated and processed under AR 55-19 or other applicable regulations, will be referred to USARCS.

(g) Army and Air Force Exchange Service litigation. The SJA or legal adviser will send a copy of all documents relating
to litigation against AAFES to General Counsel, AAFES, P.O. Box 660202, Dallas, TX 75266-0202.

(h) Bankruptcy. Reports of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings shall be made in accordance with this regulation
and AR 37-103.



 516.23 

Litigation reports.



The SJA or legal adviser will prepare a litigation report when directed by HQDA. The report will contain the following
sections: Statement of Facts; Setoff or Counterclaim; Responses to Pleadings; Memorandum of Law; Witness List;
and, Exhibits.

(a) Statement of Facts. Include a complete statement of the facts upon which the action and any defense thereto are
based. Where possible, support facts by reference to documents or witness statements. Include details of previous
administrative actions, such as the filing and results of an administrative claim. If the action is predicated on
the Federal Tort Claims Act, include a description of the plaintiff's relationship to the United States, its instrumentalities,
or its contractors. Also include a statement whether an insurance company or other third party has an interest in the
plaintiff's claim by subrogation or otherwise and whether there are additional claims related to the same incident.

(b) Setoff or Counterclaim. Discuss whether setoff or counterclaim exists. If so, highlight the supportive facts.

(c) Responses to Pleadings. Prepare a draft answer or other appropriate response to the pleadings. (See Figure C-1,
to this part). Discuss whether allegations of fact are well-founded. Refer to evidence that refutes factual allegations.

(d) Memorandum of Law. Include a brief statement of the applicable law with citations to legal authority. Discussions
of local law, if applicable, should cover relevant issues such as measure of damages, scope of employment, effect
of contributory negligence, or limitations upon death and survival actions. Do not unduly delay submission of a litigation
report to prepare a comprehensive memorandum of law.

(e) Potential witness information. List each person having information relevant to the case and provide an office
address and telephone number. If there is no objection, provide the individual's social security account number,
home address, and telephone number. This is ``core information'' required by Executive Order No. 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform). Finally, summarize the information or potential testimony that each person listed could provide.

<TEXT>


(f) Exhibits. 
(l) Attach a copy of all relevant documents. This is ``core information'' required by Executive Order No. 12778 (Civil
Justice Reform). Unless otherwise directed by HQDA, each exhibit should be tabbed and internally paginated. References
to exhibits in the litigation report should be to page numbers of particular exhibits. 
(2) Copies of relevant reports of claims officers, investigating officers, boards or similar data should be attached,
although such reports will not obviate the requirement for preparation of a complete litigation report. 
(3) Prepare an index of tabs and exhibits. 
(4) Where a relevant document has been released pursuant to a FOIA request, provide a copy of the response, or otherwise
identify the requestor and the records released. 
(g) Distribution and number of copies. Unless HQDA directs otherwise, SJAs or legal advisers will mail (first class)
an original and one copy of the litigation report to the responsible HQDA office (See  516.15 of this part) and
one copy to the U.S. Attorney's Office handling the case. If possible, record the litigation report onto a magnetic
diskette, using either WordPerfect, Enable, or ACSII, and send it to Litigation Division. 


 516.24 

Preservation of evidence. 


Because documents needed for litigation or administrative proceedings are subject to routine destruction, the
SJA or legal adviser will ensure that all relevant documents are preserved. 


 516.25 

DA Form 4. 


(a) General. The DA Form 4 (See Figure C-2, Appendix G, of this part) is used to authenticate Army records or documents.
Documents attached to a properly prepared and sealed DA Form 4 are self-authenticating. (See Fed. R. Evid. 902). 
(b) Preparation at the installation level. A DA Form 4 need not be prepared until the trial attorney presenting the
government's case identifies documents maintained at the installation level which he will need at trial. Once documents
are identified, the custodian of the documents will execute his portion of the DA Form 4. (See Figure C-2, Appendix
G, of this part). The custodian certifies that the documents attached to the DA Form 4 are true copies of official documents.
Documents attached to each form should be generally identified; each document need not be mentioned specifically.
Only the upper portion of the form should be executed at the local level. 
(c) Actions at HQDA. Upon receipt of the DA Form 4 with documents attached thereto, HQDA will affix a ribbon and seal
and deliver it to the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. That office will place the
official Army seal on the packet. 


 516.26 

Unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury. 


(a) General. Under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. l746, whenever any matter is required or permitted to be established
or proven by a sworn statement, oath or affidavit, such matter may also be established or proven by an unsworn written
declaration under penalty of perjury. Because such declaration does not require a notary or other official to administer
oaths, individuals preparing statements for use in litigation should consider using this format. (See Figure C-3,
Appendix G, of this part). 
(b) When executed within the United States. Place the following at the end of the witness statement: 



I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. (28 U.S.C. 1746). 


Executed on 



(Date)    (Signature)



(c) When executed outside the United States. Place the following at the end of the witness statement: 
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct.
(28 U.S.C. 1746).

(Date)    (Signature) 


Subpart D_Individual Liability 


 516.27 

Scope. 


This subpart guidance when DA personnel, as a result of the performance of their official duties, are either sued in
their personal capacity, or are charged in a criminal proceeding. Examples of civil actions alleging individual
liability include the following: a medical malpractice lawsuit against health care providers; suits resulting
from motor vehicle accidents; constitutional torts; or, common law torts such as assault, libel, or intentional
infliction of emotional distress. Likewise, state or Federal criminal charges can arise from the performance of
official duties, including environmental crimes or motor vehicle accidents. 


 516.28 

Policy. 


(a) General. Commanders, supervisors, and SJAs or legal advisers will give highest priority to compliance with the
requirements of this chapter with regard to current or former DA personnel who face criminal charges or civil litigation
in their individual capacity as a result of performance of their official duties. 
(b) DOJ policy on representation. If in the best interest of the United States, upon request of the individual concerned,
and upon certification by his agency that he was acting within the scope of his employment, DOJ may represent present
and former DA personnel sued individually as a result of actions taken within the scope of their employment. Representation
can be declined for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to the following: the employee was not acting within
the scope of his office; there is a conflict of interest; or, actions were not taken in a good faith effort to conform
to law. 


 516.29 

Federal statutes and regulations. 


(a) Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). (28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671-2680). A waiver of sovereign immunity which, with
certain exceptions, makes the United States liable for tort claims in the same manner as a private individual.

(b) Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of l988 (FELRTCA or the Westfall Act, Pub. L. No.
100-694, 102 Stat. 4563 (1988) (codified at and amending 28 U.S.C. 2671, 2674, 2679). FELRTCA, by amending the
Federal Tort Claims Act, makes the FTCA the exclusive remedy for common law tort claims arising from actions taken
by Federal employees acting within the scope of employment. The law was passed to eliminate problems caused by 

Westfall 

v. 

Erwin, 

484 U.S. 292 (1988). 
(c) 10 U.S.C. 1089 (Defense of certain suits arising out of medical malpractice). This provision, commonly referred
to as the Gonzales Act, makes the FTCA the exclusive remedy for suits alleging medical malpractice against a military
health care provider. 
(d) 28 CFR 50.15 (Representation of Federal officials and employees by Department of Justice attorneys [. . .]
in civil, criminal, and congressional proceedings in which Federal employees are sued, subpoenaed, or charged in
their individual capacities). These DOJ regulations set out the policy and procedures for requesting representation
in individual liability cases. See also 28 CFR part 15 (Defense of Certain Suits Against Federal Employees, etc.).

(e) 28 CFR 50.16 (Representation of Federal employees by private counsel at Federal expense). 


 516.30 

Procedures for obtaining certification and DOJ representation. 


(a) SJA or legal adviser procedures. When an SJA or legal adviser learns of a criminal charge or of a lawsuit alleging
individual liability against DA personnel as a result of performance of official duties, he will take the following
actions: 
 (1) Immediately notify Litigation Division and the appropriate U.S. Attorney and FAX or express deliver copies of
process and pleadings to each office. Where time for response is limited, request that the U.S. Attorney either petition
the court for an extension of time, or provide temporary counsel and representation pending formal approval. 
(2) Investigate whether the employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment. Obtain, if possible,
statements from the defendant, supervisors, and witnesses. 
(3) Advise the individual defendant of the rights and conditions set out in 28 CFR 50.15, which include the following:

(i) His right to request representation by a DOJ attorney and, in appropriate cases, certification that he was acting
within the scope of employment. (See 28 U.S.C. 2679; 28 CFR 50.15). 
(ii) The right to request private counsel at government expense, subject to the availability of funds. (See 28 CFR
50.16). 
 (iii) That the United States is not obligated to pay or indemnify defendant for any judgment rendered against him in
his individual capacity. 
(4) If the defendant desires certification or DOJ representation, have him sign a request. (See Figure D-1,
Appendix G, of this part). Obtain a signed scope of employment statement from the defendant's supervisor. (Figure
D-2, Appendix G, of this part). 
(5) Prepare a report with, at a minimum, the following information: facts surrounding the incident for which defendant
is being sued and those relating to scope of employment; the SJA's or legal adviser's conclusions concerning scope
of employment; and, a recommendation whether certification by the Attorney General or representation by a DOJ attorney
should be granted. 
(6) In cases involving National Guard personnel, address also the following: whether defendant was acting in a state
(Title 32 U.S.C.) or Federal (Title 10 U.S.C.) capacity during relevant periods (include orders); if defendant was
acting under state authority, is it nevertheless in the interest of the United States to represent the individual;
any impact on policies or practices of DA, the National Guard Bureau, or DOD; whether the relief requested can be granted
only by a Federal officer or agency; and, whether Federal law or regulation required actions by state officials. 
(7) Send the report, request for representation, and scope of employment statements to Chief, Litigation Division.

(b) Chief, Litigation Division, procedures. The Chief, Litigation Division, will review the report and evidence
regarding representation and scope of employment and will determine whether certification and representation
are appropriate. He will send his recommendation to the appropriate U.S. Attorney or office within DOJ. The Chief,
Litigation Division, will notify the defendant of DOJ's decision. 


 516.31 

Private counsel at government expense. 


(a) General. DA personnel, sued in their individual capacity or facing criminal charges as a result of performance
of official duties, have no right to employ a private sector counsel at government expense or to expect reimbursement
for the same. For proceedings in the United States, a request for employment of counsel at government expense may be
approved by DOJ, contingent among other things upon availability of funds and a determination that employment of
private counsel at government expense is in the best interests of the United States. (See 28 CFR 50.16). Special rules
apply in overseas areas. (See paragraph (e) of this section). 
(b) Individual request procedures. The individual will prepare a request that private counsel be employed for him
at government expense. The request must also contain the following statement: ``I understand that the United States
is not required to employ private counsel on my behalf, and that I may be responsible for expenses incurred prior to
proper authorization by the Department of the Army or the Department of Justice.''

(c) Supervisory and legal adviser procedures. The request will be submitted through the individual's supervisors,
who will make a recommendation and forward the packet to the local SJA or legal adviser. The SJA or legal adviser will
prepare his own recommendation and forward the matter to Litigation Division. 
(d) Chief, Litigation Division, procedures. If the Chief, Litigation Division, determines that the request for
private counsel is meritorious, he will prepare an appropriate recommendation and forward the packet to Civil Division,
DOJ, for final approval. 
(e) Special actions in foreign countries. Employment of private counsel in foreign proceedings is governed by AR
27-50 (Status of Forces Policies, Procedures, and Information). Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1037, soldiers,
as well as employees or those accompanying the armed forces overseas, may be granted individual counsel in civil and
criminal proceedings, under the criteria of AR 27-50. 


 516.32 

Requests for indemnification. 


(a) Policy. An individual liable for a judgment rendered against him in his individual capacity has no right to reimbursement
from DA. DA will consider, however, a request for indemnification from DA personnel where conduct within the scope
of official duties has resulted in personal liability and indemnification is in the best interests of the United States.
Indemnification is strictly contingent upon an appropriation to pay the judgment, as well as availability of such
funds. 
(b) Individual request procedures. An individual against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered may request
indemnification. The request must include, at a minimum, the following: how the employee was acting within the scope
of his employment; whether the requestor has insurance or any other source of indemnification; and, how reimbursement
is in the best interests of the United States. The request must also contain the following statements: ``I understand
that acceptance of this request for indemnification for processing by DA does not constitute an acceptance of any
obligation to make such a payment. I also understand that payment is contingent on availability of funds and that it
will only be made if such is determined to be in the best interests of the United States.'' The individual should attach
a copy of relevant documents, for example, court's opinion, judgment, and other allied papers. 
(c) Supervisory and SJA procedures. The request for indemnification will be submitted through supervisory channels
to the local SJA or legal adviser. Each supervisor will make a recommendation on the propriety of reimbursement. 
(d) Chief, Litigation Division, procedures. Requests for indemnification will be forwarded to Chief, Litigation
Division. The Chief, Litigation Division, will examine the submission and, after consultation with DOJ or other
agencies, forward the packet with his recommendation to the Army General Counsel. The General Counsel will obtain
a final decision by the Secretary of the Army or his designee on the matter. There is no administrative appeal of the
Secretary's (or his designee's) decision. 


Subpart E_Legal Proceedings Initiated by the United States Medical Care and Property Claims 


 516.33 

General. 


(a) Authorities. 
(1) Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 2651). The act provides for the recovery of medical care expenses
incurred because of a tortfeasor's actions. 
(2) Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711). The act provides for the collection of claims for money or property
arising from the activities of Federal agencies. 
(3) Third-party Collection Program (10 U.S.C. 1095). The statute provides for collection of reasonable costs of
health-care services, provided in facilities of the uniformed services to covered beneficiaries, from private
insurers or third-party payers. In accordance with DOD Instruction 6010.15, ``Third Party Collection (TPC) Program,''
7 March 1991, the authority to settle or waive a DOD claim under the act is delegated to TJAG or to his designee. 
(4) Executive Order No. 12778, (56 FR 55195; 3 CFR, 1991 Comp. p. 359), Civil Justice Reform. This order establishes
several requirements on Federal agencies involved in litigation or contemplating filing an action on behalf of the
United States. 
(5) AR 27-20, Claims. Chapter l4 (Affirmative Claims) contains comprehensive guidance for Recovery Judge
Advocates (RJAs) in the administrative determination, assertion, collection, settlement, and waiver of claims
in favor of the U.S. for property damage and for medical care claims. 
(b) Duties and Procedures. In accordance with Chapter 14, AR 27-20, Commander, USARCS, has supervisory responsibility
over the administrative processing of property and medical care claims by RJAs. The Commander, U.S. Army Health Services
Command (HSC), has supervisory responsibility over the Third Party Collection Program (TPCP). The HSC TPCP Implementation
Plan effects DOD Instruction 6010.15 and establishes procedures for processing TPC claims. Litigation Division,
in conjunction with DOJ and U.S. Attorneys, is responsible for pursuing, through litigation, claims not resolved
administratively. DOJ is ultimately responsible for initiating litigation for the United States. (28 U.S.C. 515).

(c) Assertion of claims on behalf of the United States by private attorneys. The Army incurs potentially recoverable
expenses when it provides medical care to soldiers or dependents injured by tortfeasors (for example, a soldier is
hospitalized after an automobile accident). When injured personnel employ a private attorney to sue the tortfeasor,
it may be in the Government's best interests to enter into an agreement with the private attorney to include the Army's
medical care claim. 
(d) Statute of limitations. There is a three year statute of limitations for actions in favor of the U.S. for money damages
founded upon tort. (28 U.S.C. 2415(b)). Limitations periods can vary, however, depending upon the theory of liability
and the jurisdiction involved. RJAs must be alert to the applicable period of limitations. A case referred for litigation
should arrive at Litigation Division at least 6 months before the expiration of the limitations period. 
(e) Reporting of recoveries. Amounts recovered through litigation will be reported to USARCS by Tort Branch, Litigation
Division, or, where referred directly to a U.S. Attorney or the Nationwide Central Intake Facility (NCIF), by the
responsible RJA.

 516.34 

Referral of medical care and property claims for 
litigation. 


(a) Criteria for referral. The RJA will forward the claims file and a litigation report (See  516.35 of this part)
through USARCS to Litigation Division when the claim has not been resolved administratively and any of the following
conditions exist: 
(1) The claim exceeds $5,000; 
(2) It involves collection from the injured party or his attorney; 
(3) The claim raises an important question of policy; or, 
(4) There is potential for a significant precedent. 
(b) Alternative methods. When none of the conditions cited in the preceding subparagraph are present, the RJA may
refer the claim directly to the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the prospective defendant resides. Similar
property claims may be referred through USARCS to DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility (NCIF) rather than directly
to the U.S. Attorney. Notice of all such referrals shall be provided through USARCS to Tort Branch, Litigation Division.
The RJA should be ready to provide support to the U.S. Attorney if requested. 
(c) Closing Files. A file referred directly to the U.S. Attorney will be closed if the U.S. Attorney determines further
action is unwarranted. If the RJA disagrees, the file should be forwarded with the RJA's recommendation through USARCS
to Litigation Division. 


 516.35 

Preparation of claims for litigation. 


(a) General. In preparing a referral for litigation the RJA will ensure the file contains at least the following: 
(1) A litigation report (See  516.23 of this part) that demonstrates a factual basis for the claim and a theory
of recovery under applicable state law. (See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11) 
(2) Copies of all medical records and bills reflecting the reasonable value of the medical care furnished to the injured
party, including DA Form 2631-R (Medical Care-Third Party Liability Notification), and DA Form 3154 (MSA Invoice
and Receipt). These documents should be authenticated as necessary on a DA Form 4. 
(3) Copies of all documents necessary to establish the value of lost or damaged property. 
(b) Transmittal letter. The letter of transmittal referring the claim for litigation should briefly summarize the
facts giving rise to the claim and the collection actions previously taken by the Army and the injured party. 


Assertion of Other Claims 


 516.36 

Referral to Litigation Division. 


(a) General. The majority of cases filed on behalf of the United States will fall under this subpart E. All other civil
cases which cannot be resolved administratively or by direct referral to DOJ will be forwarded through channels to
Litigation Division with a litigation report. (See  516.23 of this part). 
(b) Government contractors. It may be in the Government's best interest to authorize a Government contractor, whose
contract provides for the reimbursement of necessary legal expenses, to employ private counsel to initiate legal
proceedings against a third party. To obtain authorization to employ private counsel in such instances the contractor
should follow the procedures in  516.21(c) of this part. 


 516.37 

Proceedings to repossess Government real property or quarters or to collect delinquent rent. 


(a) General. U.S. Attorneys are authorized to accept a Federal agency's request for the following purposes: to initiate
an action to recover possession of real property from tenants, trespassers, and others; to enjoin trespasses on Federal
property; and, to collect delinquent rentals or damages for use and occupancy of real property for amounts less than
$200,000. 
(b) Procedures. When eviction or an action to collect delinquent rent is necessary, the SJA or legal adviser will notify
General Litigation Branch, Litigation Division, of the situation. If approved by Litigation Division, the SJA or
legal adviser may ask the U.S. Attorney to file suit. A copy of the complaint will be sent to Litigation Division. DOJ
can take action to evict the occupants for violation of the terms of occupancy and collect delinquent rent or other
charges. Once the matter has been referred to the U.S. Attorney, payments for rent should be sent to the U.S. Attorney.
(See AR 210-50, chap 2.) 


Subpart F_Environmental Litigation 


 516.38 

Scope. 


This subpart contains guidance, policies, and procedures applicable to all environmental and natural resources
civil litigation and administrative proceedings involving missions and functions of DA, its major and subordinate
commands, all installations presently or previously managed by DA, and all other sites or issues in which DA has a substantial
interest. In this chapter, ``litigation'' includes civil administrative proceedings. 


 516.39 

Duties and procedures. 


(a) Water rights. Environmental Law Division will conduct direct liaison with DOJ and will represent DA in State and
Federal litigation relating to availability and allocation of surface and ground water and the establishment and
protection of water rights for Army military installations and activities. This will include litigation in State
general adjudications of water rights under the McCarran Amendment, 43 U.S.C. 666, for Army military installations
and activities. Such litigation relating solely to COE civil works projects or activities will be handled by attorneys
under the technical supervision of the Chief Counsel, COE. With respect to any general adjudication which could affect
the civil works or real property functions of COE, The Judge Advocate General, acting through the Chief, Environmental
Law Division, and Chief Counsel, COE, will jointly determine which office should maintain primary direct liaison
with DOJ and will scope and execute appropriate coordination with each other and with the General Counsel with respect
to that litigation.

of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. 
(d) Enforcement. Environmental Law Division will conduct direct liaison with DOJ and represent DA in all civil litigation
involving citizen or State enforcement of applicable State, Federal and local requirements respecting the control
or abatement of pollution and involving the management of hazardous wastes, with respect to the missions and functions
of, and Federal facilities owned or controlled by, DA, except for civil works facilities. 
(e) Environmental response. 
(1) Except as provided in (a)(2) of this section. Environmental Law Division will conduct direct liaison with DOJ

(2) The Chief Counsel, COE, will conduct direct liaison with DOJ and represent DA in all civil litigation seeking declaratory
or injunctive relief or involving claims of Army liability for the costs of response at civil works facilities, at
former defense sites or at other sites where the Army is a potentially responsible party due to the response actions
of the COE or its contractors. 
(f) Fish and Wildlife, and Plants. Environmental Law Division will conduct direct liaison with DOJ and represent
DA in civil litigation involving citizen or State enforcement of applicable State, Federal, and local laws governing
conservation of plant, fish, and wildlife resources at Federal facilities owned or controlled by DA, except that

(4) The Chief Counsel, COE, and Chief, Environmental Law Division, will confer and jointly determine which office
will conduct direct liaison with DOJ and represent DA in civil litigation involving all other claims of toxic tort
liability. 


Subpart G_Release of Information and Appearance of Witnesses Scope 


 516.40 

General. 


(a) Introduction. This subpart implements DOD Directive 5405.2 (See Appendix C to this part and 32 CFR part 97). It
governs the release of official information and the appearance of present and former DA personnel as witnesses in
response to requests for interviews, notices of depositions, subpoenas, and other requests or orders related to
judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Requests for records, if not in the nature of legal process, should be processed
under AR 25-55 (The Department of the Army Freedom of Information Act Program) or AR 340-21 (The Army Privacy
Program). This subpart pertains to any request for witnesses, documents, or information for all types of litigation,
including requests by private litigants, requests by State or U.S. attorneys, requests by foreign officials or tribunals,
subpoenas for records or testimony, notices of depositions, interview requests, civil cases, criminal proceedings,
private litigation, or litigation in which the United States has an interest. 
(b) Definitions. (See Appendix F to this part). 


 516.41 

Policy. 


(a) General Rule. Except as authorized by this subpart, present or former DA personnel will not disclose official
information (See Appendix F_Glossary) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or requests. 
(b) Exception. Present or former DA personnel may disclose official information if they obtain the written approval
of the appropriate SJA, legal adviser, or Litigation Division. 
(c) Referral to deciding official. If present or former DA personnel receive a subpoena, court order, request for
attendance at a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, or request for an interview related to actual or potential
litigation, and it appears the subpoena, order, or request seeks disclosures described in a above, the individual
should immediately advise the appropriate SJA or legal adviser. If the SJA or legal adviser cannot informally satisfy
the subpoena, order, or request in accordance with   516.43 through 516.50 of this subpart, he should
consult with Litigation Division.

<TEXT>


(d) Requesters' responsibilities. Individuals seeking official information must submit, at least 14 days before
the desired date of production, a specific written request setting forth the nature and relevance of the official
information sought. (Requesters can be referred to this Subpart G). Subject to  516.47(a), present and former
DA personnel may only produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify concerning those matters specified in
writing and properly approved by the SJA, legal adviser, or Litigation Division. (See United States ex. rel. Touhy
v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)). 
(e) Litigation in which the United States has an interest. If a subpoena, order, or request relates to litigation in
which the United States has an interest and for which litigation responsibility has not been delegated, the SJA or
legal adviser will coordinate with Litigation Division under  516.42. 
(f) Motions to stay or quash subpoenas. A subpoena should never be ignored, and an SJA or legal adviser should seek assistance
from Litigation Division or the U.S. Attorney's office whenever necessary. If a response to a subpoena or order is
required before a release determination can be made or before Litigation Division or the U.S. Attorney can be contacted,
the SJA or legal adviser will do the following: 
(1) Furnish the court or tribunal a copy of this regulation (32 CFR part 516, Subpart G) and applicable case law (See
United States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)); 
(2) Inform the court or tribunal that the requesting individual has not complied with this Chapter, as set out in 32
CFR 97 & 516, or that the subpoena or order is being reviewed; 
(3) Seek to stay the subpoena or order pending the requestor's compliance with this chapter or final determination
by Litigation Division; and, 
(4) If the court or other tribunal declines to quash or stay the subpoena or order, inform Litigation Division immediately
so a decision can be made whether to challenge the subpoena or order. If Litigation Division decides not to challenge
the subpoena or order, the affected personnel will comply with the subpoena or order. If Litigation Division decides
to challenge the subpoena or order, it will direct the affected personnel to respectfully decline to comply with the
subpoena or order. (See United States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)). 
(g) Classified or sensitive information. Only Litigation Division may authorize the release of official information
or appearance of DA personnel as witnesses in litigation involving terrorism, espionage, nuclear weapons, or intelligence
sources and methods. 
(h) Requests for Inspector General records or testimony. IG records, and information obtained through performance
of IG duties, are official information under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Army. (See AR 20-l,
Chapter 3.) IG records frequently contain sensitive official information that may be classified or obtained under
guarantees of confidentiality. When justification exists, DA attorneys will seek court protection from disclosure
of IG records and information. No DA personnel will release IG records or disclose information obtained through performance
of IG duties without the approval of The Secretary of the Army, The Inspector General, TIG Legal Advisor, or Chief,
Litigation Division. When IG personnel receive a subpoena, court order, request for attendance at a judicial or quasi-judicial
proceeding, or a request for an interview which the IG reasonably believes is related to actual or potential litigation
concerning IG records or related information, they should immediately notify the Inspector General Legal Adviser
or the Chief, Litigation Division. IG personnel will follow the guidance of this subpart concerning actions to be
taken regarding disclosure and testimony. 


 516.42 

Reference to HQDA. 


(a) General. If the SJA or legal adviser is unable to resolve the matter, it will be referred for approval or action by
Litigation Division under this chapter, by the most expeditious means, to General Litigation Branch, Litigation
Division, with the following exceptions: 
(1) Those involving a case assigned to another branch of Litigation Division will be submitted to that branch (Appendix
B to this part). 
(2) Those involving affirmative litigation (for example, medical care recovery or Army property damage or loss cases)
under subpart E will be submitted to Tort Branch. 
(3) Those involving patents, copyrights, privately developed technical information, or trademarks will be submitted
to Intellectual Property Law Division. 
(4) Those involving taxation will be submitted to Contract Law Division.

(5) Those involving communication, transportation, or utility service proceedings will be submitted to the Regulatory
Law Office. 
(6) Those involving environmental matters will be submitted to the Environmental Law Division. 
(7) Those involving contract appeals cases before the ASBCA will be submitted to the Contract Appeals Division. 
(8) Those involving procurement fraud, including Qui Tam cases, will be submitted to the Procurement Fraud Division.

(b) Information to be submitted. When referring matters pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the following
data should be provided: 
(1) Parties (named or prospective) to the proceeding, their attorneys, and case number, where appropriate. 
(2) Party making the request (if a subpoena, indicate moving party) and his attorney. 
(3) Name of tribunal in which the proceeding is pending. 
(4) Nature of the proceeding. 
(5) Date of receipt of request or date and place of service of subpoena. 
(6) Name, grade, position, and organization of person receiving request or served with subpoena. 
(7) Date, time, and place designated in request or subpoena for production of information or appearance of witness.

(8) Nature of information sought or document requested, and place where document is maintained. 
(9) A copy of each document requested. Contact the appropriate office at HQDA if this would be burdensome and unnecessary
to a decision whether to release, redact, or withhold a particular document. 
(10) Name of requested witness, expected testimony, requested appearance time and date, and whether witness is reasonably
available. 
(11) Analysis of the problem with recommendations. 


Release of Records in Connection With Litigation 


 516.43 

Release of Army and other agency records. 


(a) Preservation of originals. To preserve the integrity of DA records, DA personnel will submit properly authenticated
copies rather than originals of documents or records for use in legal proceedings, unless directed otherwise by Litigation
Division. (See 28 U.S.C. 1733.) 
(b) Authentication of copies. Copies of DA records approved for release can be authenticated for introduction in
evidence by use of DA Form 4. (See  516.25 for instructions.) 
(1) Records maintained in U.S. Army Engineer Districts and Divisions will be forwarded to HQDA(CECC-K), WASH
DC 20314-1000. 
(2) All other records will be forwarded to the appropriate office at HQDA (See  516.42). 
(c) Fees and charges. AR 37-60 prescribes the schedule of fees and charges for searching, copying, and certifying
Army records for release in response to litigation-related requests. 
(d) Release of records of other agencies. Normally an individual requesting records originating in agencies outside
DA (that is, FBI reports, local police reports, civilian hospital records) that are also included in Army records
should be advised to direct his inquiry to the originating agency. 


 516.44 

Determination of release authorization. 


(a) Policy. DA policy is to make official information reasonably available for use in Federal and state courts and
by other governmental bodies unless the information is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public
disclosure. 
(b) Releasability factors. In deciding whether to authorize release of official information, the deciding official
should consider the following: 
(1) Has the requester complied with DA policy governing the release of official documents in  516.41(d) of this
part. 
(2) Is the request unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules? 
(3) Is the disclosure appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the matter in which the request arose? 
(4) Would the disclosure violate a statute, executive order, regulation, or directive? 
(5) Is the disclosure appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege? 
(6) Would the disclosure reveal information properly classified pursuant to the DOD Information Security Program
under AR 380-5, unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to 32 CFR  250, or other
matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure? 
(7) Would disclosure interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal
the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or confidential commercial
or financial information, or, otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances? 
(8) Would the disclosure violate any person's expectation of confidentiality or privacy? 


 516.45 

Records determined to be releasable. 


If the deciding official, after considering the factors set forth in  536.44, determines that all or part of
requested official records are releasable, copies of the records should be furnished to the requester. 


 516.46 

Records determined not to be releasable. 


(a) General. If the deciding official, after considering the factors in  516.44, determines that all or part
of requested official records should not be released, he will promptly communicate directly with the attorney or
individual who caused the issuance of the subpoena, order, or request and seek to resolve the matter informally. If
the subpoena or order is invalid, he should explain the basis of the invalidity. The deciding official should also
explain why the records requested are privileged from release. The deciding official should attempt to obtain the
agreement of the requester to withdraw the subpoena, order, or request or to modify the subpoena, order, or request
so that it pertains only to records which may be released. (See Figure G-1, Appendix G, of this part.) 
(b) Information protected by the Privacy Act.

<TEXT>


(1) A subpoena duces tecum or other legal process signed by an attorney or clerk of court for records protected by the
Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, does not justify the release of the protected records. The deciding official should explain
to the requester that the Privacy Act precludes disclosure of records in a system of records without the written consent
of the subject of the records or ``pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.'' (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11)).
An ``order of the court'' for the purpose of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11) is an order or writ requiring the production
of the records, signed by a judge or magistrate. 
(2) Unclassified records otherwise privileged from release under 5 U.S.C. 552a may be released to the court under
either of the following conditions: 
(i) The subpoena is accompanied by an order signed by a judge or magistrate, or such order is separately served, that
orders the person to whom the records pertain to release the specific records, or that orders copies of the records
be delivered to the clerk of court, and indicates that the court has determined the materiality of the records and the
nonavailability of a claim of privilege. 
(ii) The clerk of the court is empowered by local statute or practice to receive the records under seal subject to request
that they be withheld from the parties until the court determines whether the records are material to the issues and
until any question of privilege is resolved. 
(iii) Subpoenas for alcohol abuse or drug abuse treatment records must be processed under 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3 and 290ee-3,
and Public Health Service regulations published at 42 CFR 2.1_2.67. 
(iv) Upon request, SJAs and legal advisers may furnish to the attorney for the injured party or the tortfeasor's attorney
or insurance company a copy of the narrative summary of medical care that relates to a claim under Subpart E of this part.
If additional medical records are requested, only those that directly pertain to the pending action will be furnished.
If furnishing copies of medical records would prejudice the cause of action, the matter will be reported to Litigation
Division. 
(c) Referral to Litigation Division. If the SJA or legal adviser is not able to resolve a request for Army records informally,
he should contact Litigation Division. 
(1) Litigation Division may respond to subpoenas or orders for records privileged from release by informing the local
U.S. Attorney about the subpoena and requesting that office file a motion to quash the subpoena or a motion for a protective
order. The records privileged from release should be retained by the custodian pending the court's ruling upon the
government's motion. 
(2) When a motion to quash or for a protective order is not filed, or the motion is unsuccessful, and the appropriate
DA official has determined that no further efforts will be made to protect the records, copies of the records (authenticated
if necessary) will be submitted to the court (or to the clerk of court) in response to the subpoena or order. 
(d) Classified and privileged materials. Requests from DOJ, U.S. Attorneys, or attorneys for other governmental
entities for records which are classified or otherwise privileged from release will be referred to Litigation Division.
(See  516.41(g). 


DA Personnel as Witnesses in Private Litigation 


 516.47 

Response to subpoenas, orders, or requests for witnesses. 


(a) Policy. The involvement of present or former DA personnel in private litigation is solely a personal matter between
the witness and the requesting party, unless one or more of the following conditions apply: 
(1) The testimony involves official information. (See Appendix F_Glossary to this part). 
(2) The witness is to testify as an expert. 
(3) The absence of the witness from duty will seriously interfere with the accomplishment of a military mission. 
(b) Former DA personnel. Former DA personnel may freely respond to requests for interviews and subpoenas except in
instances involving official information (paragraph (a)(1) of this section) or concerning expert testimony prohibited
by  516.49. In those instances, the subject of the request or subpoena should take the action specified in   516.41(c)
and 516.42.

(c) Present DA personnel. Present DA personnel will refer all requests for interviews and subpoenas for testimony
in private litigation through their supervisor to the appropriate SJA or legal adviser.

(d) Discretion to testify. Any individual not wishing to grant an interview or to testify concerning private litigation
may seek the advice of an Army attorney concerning the consequences, if any, of refusal. Any individual not authorized
to consult with Army counsel should consult with private counsel, at no expense to the government.



 516.48 

Official information.



(a) In instances involving  516.47(a)(1), the matter will be referred to the SJA or legal adviser serving the
organization of the individual whose testimony is requested, or to HQDA pursuant to  516.47(a). The deciding
official will determine whether to release the information sought under the principles established in  516.44.
If funding by the United States is requested, see  516.55(d).

(b) If the deciding official determines that the information may be released, the individual will be permitted to
be interviewed, deposed, or to appear as a witness in court provided such interview or appearance is consistent with
the requirements of   516.49 and 516.50. (See, for example, Figure G-2, Appendix G, to this part).
A JA or DA civilian attorney should be present during any interview or testimony to act as legal representative of the
Army. If a question seeks information not previously authorized for release, the legal representative will advise
the witness not to answer. If necessary to avoid release of the information, the legal representative will advise
the witness to terminate the interview or deposition, or in the case of testimony in court, advise the judge that DOD
directives and Army regulations preclude the witness from answering without HQDA approval. Every effort should
be made, however, to substitute releasable information and to continue the interview or testimony.



 516.49 

Expert witnesses.



(a) General rule. Present DA personnel will not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony
either in private litigation or in litigation in which the United States has an interest for a party other than the United
States. Former DA personnel will not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning
official information, subjects, or activities either in private litigation or in litigation in which the United
States has an interest for a party other than the United States. (See Figure G-3, Appendix G of this part). An SJA
or legal adviser is authorized to deny a request for expert testimony, which decision may be appealed to Litigation
Division.

(b) Exception to the general prohibition. If a requester can show exceptional need or unique circumstances, and the
anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the interests of the United States, Litigation Division may grant special
written authorization for present or former DA personnel to testify as expert or opinion witnesses at no expense to
the United States. In no event may present or former DA personnel furnish expert or opinion testimony in a case in which
the United States has an interest for a party whose interests are adverse to the interests of the United States.

(c) Exception for AMEDD personnel. Members of the Army medical department or other qualified specialists may testify
in private litigation with the following limitations (See Figure G-4, Appendix G, of this part):

(1) The litigation involves patients they have treated, investigations they have made, laboratory tests they have
conducted, or other actions taken in the regular course of their duties.

(2) They limit their testimony to factual matters such as the following: their observations of the patient or other
operative facts; the treatment prescribed or corrective action taken; course of recovery or steps required for repair
of damage suffered; and, contemplated future treatment.

(3) Their testimony may not extend to expert or opinion testimony, to hypothetical questions, or to a prognosis.

(d) Court-ordered expert or opinion testimony. If a court or other appropriate authority orders expert or opinion
testimony, the witness will immediately notify Litigation Division. If Litigation Division determines it will
not challenge the subpoena or order, the witness will comply with the subpoena or order. If directed by Litigation
Division, however, the witness will respectfully decline to comply with the subpoena or order. (See 

United States ex. rel. Touhy 

v. 

Ragen, 

340 U.S. 462 (1951)).

(e) Expert witness fees. All fees tendered to present DA personnel as an expert or opinion witness, to the extent they
exceed actual travel, meals, and lodging expenses of the witness, will be remitted to the Treasurer of the United States.



 516.50 

Interference with mission.



If the absence of a witness from duty will seriously interfere with the accomplishment of a military mission, the SJA
or legal adviser will advise the requesting party and attempt to make alternative arrangements. If these efforts
fail, the SJA or legal adviser will refer the matter to Litigation Division.



Litigation in Which the United States Has an Interest



 516.51 

Response to subpoenas, orders, or requests for witnesses.



(a) Referral to a deciding official. Requests, subpoenas, or orders for official information, interviews or testimony
of present or former DA personnel in litigation or potential litigation in which the United States has an interest,
including requests from DOJ, will be resolved by the SJA or legal adviser pursuant to the principles of this subpart.
Litigation Division will be consulted on issues that cannot be resolved by the SJA or legal adviser.

(b) Reassignment of witnesses. When requested by the U.S. Attorney, the SJA or legal adviser will ensure that no witnesses
are reassigned from the judicial district without advising the DOJ attorney. If a witness is vital to the government's
case and trial is imminent, the SJA or legal adviser should make informal arrangements to retain the witness in the
command until trial. If this is not feasible, or if a satisfactory arrangement cannot be reached with the DOJ attorney,
the SJA or legal adviser should notify Litigation Division.



 516.52 

Expert witnesses.



Requests for present or former DA personnel as expert or opinion witnesses from DOJ or other attorneys representing
the United States will be referred to Litigation Division unless the request involves a matter that has been delegated
by Litigation Division to an SJA or legal adviser. In no event, may present or former DA personnel furnish expert or
opinion testimony in a case in which the United States has an interest for a party whose interests are adverse to the
interests of the United States.



 516.53 

News media and other inquiries.



News media inquiries regarding litigation or potential litigation will be referred to the appropriate public affairs
office. DA personnel will not comment on any matter presently or potentially in litigation without proper clearance.
Local public affairs officers will refer press inquiries to HQDA (SAPA), WASH DC 20310-1500, with appropriate
recommendations for review and approval by the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs. All releases of information
regarding actual or potential litigation will be coordinated with Litigation Division prior to release.

 516.54 

Witnesses for the United States.



(a) Status of witness. A military member authorized to appear as a witness for the United States, including those authorized
to appear under  516.55(d), will be placed on temporary duty. If USAR or NG personnel are requested as witnesses
for the United States, and if their testimony arises from their active duty service, they should be placed on active
duty to testify. The status of a civilian employee will be determined under Federal Personnel Manual 630, subchapter
10. DA personnel who appear as necessary witnesses for a party asserting the government's claim for medical care expenses
are witnesses for the United States.

(b) Travel arrangements. Travel arrangements for witnesses for the United States normally are made by DOJ through
Litigation Division for other than local travel. Litigation Division will issue instructions for this travel, including
fund citation, to the appropriate commander. A U.S. Attorney, or an attorney asserting the government's medical
care claim under Subpart E, may make arrangements for local travel through the SJA or legal adviser for attendance
of a witness who is stationed at an installation within the same judicial district, or not more than 100 miles from the
place where testifying. Other requests, including those under  516.55(d), will be referred to Litigation
Division. The instructions from Litigation Division, or the request from the U.S. Attorney or the attorney asserting
the government's claim, will serve as a basis for the issuance of appropriate travel orders by the local commander.

(c) Travel and per diem expenses. The witness' commander or supervisor should ensure the witness has sufficient funds
to defray expenses. The SJA or legal adviser will provide assistance.

(1) Where local travel is performed at the request of a U.S. Attorney and the testimony does not involve information
acquired in the performance of duties, transportation arrangements and any per diem expenses are the responsibility
of the U.S. Attorney.

(2) An attorney asserting the government's medical care or property claim may be required to advance local travel
expense money to the witness requested and to include these in recoverable costs where the government's claim is not
large enough to justify expenditures of government travel funds.

(3) Other local travel and per diem expense for cases involving Army activities or claims are proper expenses of the
command issuing the orders.

(4) Litigation Division will furnish travel expense and per diem funds for other than local travel and will receive
reimbursement from DOJ or other government agencies as appropriate.



 516.55

 Witnesses for a state or private litigant.



(a) Status of witness. If authorized to appear as a witness for a state or private litigant, and the testimony to be given
relates to information obtained in the performance of official duties, a military member will attend in a permissive
TDY status. If authorized to appear as a witness, but the testimony does not relate to information obtained in the performance
of official duties, a military member may be granted a pass or permissive TDY under AR 630-5, or be required to
take ordinary leave. The status of a civilian employee will be determined under 5 CFR Chapter I.

(b) Travel arrangements. The requesting party or state agency will make all travel arrangements for attendance of
DA personnel authorized to appear as witnesses for a state or private litigant. The local commander may issue appropriate
orders when necessary.

(c) Travel expenses. The United States may not pay travel, meals, and lodging expenses of the witness, other than normal
allowances for subsistence pursuant to the DOD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual. These expenses
are solely a matter between the witness and the party seeking his appearance. Witnesses ordinarily should be advised
to require advance payment of such expenses. Military personnel authorized to appear in a pass or permissive TDY status
are not entitled to receive witness attendance fees, but may accept travel, meals, and lodging expense money from
the requesting litigant. All witness fees tendered the military member, to the extent they exceed such actual expenses
of the member, will be remitted to the Treasurer of the United States. A civilian employee authorized to appear in his
or her official capacity will accept the authorized witness fees, in addition to the allowance for travel and subsistence,
and make disposition of the witness fees as instructed by his or her personnel office.

<TEXT>


(d) Funding by the United States. Requests for DA personnel to appear at government expense as witnesses in state or
local proceedings for a party other than the United States, including cases involving domestic violence or child
abuse, will be referred to Litigation Division. Litigation Division may authorize travel and per diem expenses under
 516.54 when the case is one in which the United States has a significant interest.



 516.56 

Witnesses before foreign tribunals.



(a) Referral to the SJA. Requests or subpoenas from a foreign government or tribunal for present DA personnel stationed
or employed within that country to be interviewed or to appear as witnesses will be forwarded to the SJA of the command
exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the unit to which the individual is assigned, attached, or employed.
The SJA will determine the following:

(1) Whether a consideration listed in  516.47(a)(1) through (a)(3) applies.

(2) Whether the information requested is releasable under the principles established in  516.43 through  516.46.

(3) Whether the approval of the American Embassy should be obtained because the person is attached to the Embassy staff
or a question of diplomatic immunity may be involved.

(b) United States has an interest in the litigation. If the SJA determines that the United States has an interest in
the litigation, the commander may authorize the interview or order the individual's attendance in a temporary duty
status. The United States will be deemed to have an interest in the litigation if it is bound by treaty or other international
agreement to ensure the attendance of such personnel.

(c) United States has no interest in the litigation. If the SJA determines that the United States does not have an interest
in the litigation, the commander may authorize the interview or the appearance of the witness under the principles
established in  516.47 through  516.50.

(d) Witnesses located outside the requester's country. If the requested witness is stationed in a country other than
the requester's, the matter will be referred to Litigation Division.



Subpart H_Remedies in Procurement Fraud and Corruption



 516.57 

Purpose



This subpart delineates the policies, procedures, and responsibilities for reporting and resolving allegations
of procurement fraud or irregularities (PFI) within DA. It implements DOD Directive 7050.5. (See Appendix D to this
part.)



 516.58 

Policies



(a) Procurement fraud and irregularities will be promptly and thoroughly addressed whenever encountered. Reports
will be initiated in a timely manner and will be supplemented as appropriate.

(b) Investigations will be monitored to see that interim corrective action is taken and that final action is taken
as expeditiously as possible.

(c) This regulation establishes the Procurement Fraud Division (PFD), U.S. Army Legal Services Agency, as the single
centralized organization within the Army to coordinate and monitor criminal, civil, contractual, and administrative
remedies in significant cases of fraud or corruption relating to Army procurement.

(d) The key elements of the Army's procurement fraud program follow: centralized policy making and program direction;
fraud remedies coordination; decentralized responsibility for operational matters, such as reporting and remedial
action; continuous case monitorship by PFD from the initial report until final disposition; and, command-wide fraud
awareness training.

(e) Remedies for PFI will be pursued in a timely manner and properly coordinated with other agencies. Every effort
will be made to support criminal investigation and prosecution of fraudulent activity.

(f) A specific remedies plan will be formulated for each significant case of fraud or corruption involving procurement.

(g) Coordination on the status and disposition of cases will be maintained between PFD, OTJAG, PFI Coordinators at
MACOMs, and Procurement Fraud Advisers at subordinate commands. Coordination of procurement and personnel actions
will be accomplished with investigative agencies as required by those agencies.

(h) Training which relates to fraud and corruption in the procurement process is a significant element of this program.



 516.59 

Duties and procedures.



(a) TJAG has overall responsibility for the coordination of remedies in procurement fraud and corruption within
the Army. This responsibility has been delegated to PFD. Functions of PFD will include the following:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940727-0-00077 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-0-00025 </PARENT>
<TEXT>


(1) Serving as the single centralized organization in the Army to monitor the status of, and ensure the coordination
of, criminal, civil, contractual, and administrative remedies for each significant case of fraud or corruption.

(2) Receiving reports of procurement fraud and corruption from any source including, but not limited to the following:
DOD criminal investigative organizations; audit agencies; contracting officers; inspectors general of the executive
branch; correspondence from the public; and, commanders. This provision does not repeal any other reporting requirement
but establishes PFD as a recipient of PFI information at the earliest possible time.

(3) Establishing a monitoring system within OTJAG for all cases of fraud and corruption that relate to Army procurement.

(4) Discussing regularly with the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) or the assigned DOD criminal
investigative organization the current status of significant fraud or corruption cases and their coordination
with prosecutive authorities.

(5) Ensuring that all criminal, civil, contractual, and administrative remedies are considered in each significant
fraud or corruption case and that timely and applicable remedies are undertaken by commanders, contracting officers,
and suspension and debarment authorities. For example, consideration of suspension or debarment of a contractor
or individual should normally be initiated within 30 days of indictment or conviction.

(6) Coordinating, as appropriate, with other DOD components affected by a significant fraud or corruption case being
monitored by the Army.

(7) Developing, with the responsible DOD investigative organization, Procurement Fraud Coordinators and Advisers,
and other involved agencies, a specific comprehensive remedies plan for each significant fraud or corruption case.

(8) Coordinating remedies with DOJ. In the case of ongoing criminal investigations, coordinate remedies through,
or with the prior knowledge of, the DOD criminal investigative organization responsible for the case.

(9) In significant fraud or corruption cases, identifying and documenting any known adverse impact on a DOD mission,
and including the information in any remedies plan.

(10) Providing the appropriate DOD criminal investigative organization with information concerning final remedies
as a result of an investigation by that organization.

(11) Receiving notifications from criminal investigative agencies concerning substituted, defective, and counterfeit
hardware in which a serious hazard to health, safety or operational readiness is indicated; ensuring that appropriate
safety, procurement and program officials are informed in accordance with enclosure 3 of DOD Directive 7050.5. PFD
will specifically ensure that contract reviews (DD 350 reports) and adverse impact statements (See  516.64(c)(2)
are prepared, and that such information is used to determine if further inquiry is warranted to prevent reoccurrence
and to detect other possible fraud. Impact statements will not be released to prosecutive agencies until reviewed
by PFD. When appropriate, PFD will coordinate with other DOD agencies to establish a lead agency for victim impact
statements in multi-DOD agency cases.

(b) The Commanding General, USACIDC, will take the following actions:

(1) Notify PFD of any investigations involving fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.

(2) Notify other DOD component criminal investigative organizations when investigations involving fraud or corruption
affect that component. This includes evidence of fraud by a contractor, subcontractor, or employee of either, on
current or past contracts with, or affecting, that component.

(3) Notify the Defense Investigative Service of any investigations that develop evidence which affects DOD cleared
industrial facilities or personnel.

(4) Determine the effect on any ongoing investigations or prosecutions of any criminal, civil, contractual, or administrative
actions being considered by a centralized organization and advise of any adverse impact.

(5) Promptly provide commanders, contracting officers, Procurement Fraud Advisers, and suspension and debarment
authorities, when needed to allow consideration of applicable remedies, any court records, documents, or other
evidence of fraud or corruption from ongoing or completed criminal investigations. In cases of indictment or conviction
of a contractor or individual, the information will be provided in time for initiation, if appropriate, of suspension
or debarment action within 30 days of the indictment or conviction.

(6) Provide prosecutive authorities and centralized organizations with timely information on the adverse impact
on a DOD mission of fraud or corruption that relates to DOD procurement activities. This information will be obtained
from individuals such as the head of the contracting agency, appropriate commanders, and staff agencies. Some examples
of adverse impact on a DOD mission are endangerment of personnel or property, monetary loss, compromise of the procurement
process, or reduction or loss of mission readiness.

(7) Discuss regularly with Procurement Fraud Advisers the status of significant investigations of fraud or corruption
and their coordination with prosecutive authorities and provide documents and reports resulting from the investigations.

(c) Commanders of service schools conducting procurement or procurement-related training (such as The Judge Advocate
General's School, the U.S. Military Police School, and the U.S. Army Logistics Management Center) will ensure the
following:

(1) All procurement and procurement-related training includes a period of instruction on fraud and corruption in
the procurement process. The length of the period of instruction will be appropriate to the duration and nature of
the training.

(2) Training materials are developed to support that training.

<TEXT>


(3) Training materials developed will be sent to MACOM PFI Coordinators.

(d) MACOM commanders and heads of contracting activities will ensure the following:

(1) Substantial indications of fraud or corruption relating to Army contracts or Army administered contracts are
reported promptly to the supporting USACIDC element and the Procurement Fraud Division.

(2) Information provided includes reports by contracting officers under DFARS 209.406-3.



 516.60 

Procurement fraud and irregularities programs at MACOMs.



(a) Command counsel and SJAs at MACOMs will develop a program and appoint an attorney as PFI Coordinator for their command.
Chief counsel and SJAs at commands with procurement advisory responsibility will appoint an attorney as a Procurement
Fraud Adviser (PFA) to manage the PFI program at their installations as well.

(b) Provision may be made for activities not having sufficient attorney assets to obtain assistance from nearby installations
that have a PFA.

(c) Reports and recommendations will be transmitted through command channels to the PFI coordinator for the affected
MACOM.

(d) Command counsel, chief counsel, and SJAs will exercise supervisory authority to ensure effective operation
of the fraud program and coordination of remedies within their organizations.

(e) The MACOM PFI Coordinator will have overall responsibility for the design and implementation of the MACOM's procurement
fraud program.

(f) PFAs and PFI Coordinators will coordinate with the appropriate local CID or Defense Criminal Investigative Service
(DCIS) activity to assure the prompt notification and coordination of all Procurement Fraud cases.



 516.61 

Reporting requirements.



(a) Typical fraud indicators during the procurement cycle are listed in Figure D-1, Appendix G, to this part.
The mere presence of one or more of these indicators does not, by itself, require reporting under paragraph b of this
section. Reports should be submitted if there is a reasonable suspicion of procurement fraud or irregularity or the
procuring agency refers the matter for investigation.

(b) ``Procurement Flash Reports'' will be transmitted by FAX directly to PFD whenever a PFI Coordinator or PFA receives
notice of a PFI involving the Army. To facilitate filing, a separate sheet should be used for each case reported. These
reports will provide a succinct summary of the following available information:

(1) Name and address of contractor.

(2) Known subsidiaries of parent firms.

(3) Contracts involved in potential fraud.

(4) Nature of potential fraud.

(5) Summary of pertinent facts.

(6) Possible damages.

(7) Investigative agencies involved.

(8) Local PFAs (name and phone numbers).

Any of the above categories that cannot be completed will be annotated as ``unknown at present.''

(c) When a report is required by DFARS or is requested by PFD, the provisions of DFARS 209.406-3 (48 CFR 209.406-3)
will be followed. That paragraph provides the basic content and format for PFI reports.

(d) All personnel will cooperate to ensure that investigations and prosecutions of procurement fraud are completed
in a timely and thorough manner. Requests for assistance from federal prosecutors should be processed through the
local PFA whenever possible. Requests for federal investigators will be processed through the supporting USACIDC
and the PFA will be notified. When the conduct of criminal investigations and prosecutions conflict with the progress
of procurements, reasonable deference will be given to criminal investigators and prosecutors whenever possible.
Any serious conflict that cannot be resolved at a local level will be immediately reported to the PFI Coordinator or
PFD for action.

(e) PFI Coordinators and PFAs may request access to information obtained during criminal investigations that is
not protected by Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) and use this information to assist them in taking appropriate administrative,
contractual, and civil remedies. Requests for this information should be made directly to the appropriate federal
investigative agency. The investigative organization may withhold requested information if release would compromise
an investigation. Difficulties in obtaining information which cannot be resolved locally will be referred to PFD
for appropriate action.

(f) USACIDC will notify, in writing, local PFAs as well as PFD within 30 days, of initiation of a significant investigation
of fraud or corruption related to Army procurement activities. Such notification will include the following:

(1) Case title.

(2) USACIDC Report of Investigation number.

(3) Responsible investigative agency or agencies.

(4) Office of primary responsibility.

(5) Date opened.

(6) Summary of facts.

(7) Suspected offense.

(g) The transmission of the information in f above may be delayed if the Commanding General, USACIDC, or the head of
another DOD criminal investigation organization determines the transmission would compromise the success of any
case or its prosecution. The prosecutive authorities dealing with the case will be consulted, when appropriate,
in making such determinations.

(h) USACIDC will obtain the following information at the earliest possible point in an investigation of fraud or corruption
that relates to DOD procurement activities, whenever possible without reliance on grand jury subpoenas:

(1) The individuals suspected to be responsible.

(2) The suspected firm's organizational structure.

(3) The firm's financial and contract history.

(4) The firm's organizational documents and records.

(5) Statements of witnesses.

(6) Monetary loss to the government.

(7) Other relevant information.

This information will be provided to PFD or other cognizant DOD centralized organization.

(i) PFD will provide written notification to the Defense Investigative Service of all suspension or debarment actions
taken by the Army.



 516.62 

PFD and HQ USACIDC coordination.



PFD and HQ USACIDC will coordinate as follows:

(a) Discuss the status of significant procurement fraud or corruption investigations being conducted by USACIDC
and possible remedies. These discussions should take place on a regular basis.

(b) Discuss the coordination of possible criminal, civil, contractual, or administrative remedies with prosecutive
authorities.

(c) PFD will maintain liaison with other DOD centralized organizations and will coordinate remedies with those centralized
organizations affected by a significant investigation of fraud or corruption that relates to DOD procurement activities.

(d) Ascertain the effect on any ongoing investigation of the initiation of civil, contractual, or administrative
remedies as follows:

 (1) PFD will maintain liaison with USACIDC and other DOD criminal investigative organizations in order to determine
the advisability of initiating any civil, contractual, or administrative actions.

 (2) USACIDC will advise PFD of any adverse effect on an investigation or prosecution by the initiation of civil, contractual,
or administrative actions.



 516.63 

Coordination with DOJ.



(a) PFD will establish and maintain liaison with DOJ and the Defense Procurement Fraud Unit on significant fraud and
corruption cases to accomplish the following:

 (1) Monitor criminal prosecutions.

 (2) Initiate litigation for civil recovery.

 (3) Coordinate administrative or contractual actions while criminal or civil proceedings are pending.

 (4) Coordinate settlement agreements or proposed settlements of criminal, civil, and administrative actions.

 (5) Respond to DOJ requests for information and assistance.

(b) In cases where there is an ongoing criminal investigation, coordination with DOJ by any member of the Army normally
will be accomplished by or through USACIDC or the cognizant DOD criminal investigative organization, or with the
investigative organization's advance knowledge. This does not apply to the routine exchange of information between
government attorneys in the course of civil litigation or the routine referral of cases to DOJ for civil recovery.

(c) Initial contact by any attorney associated with the U.S. Army with a U.S. Attorney's office or DOJ, whether initiated
by the Army attorney or not, will be reported to PFD. Activity after the initial contact will only be reported to PFD
when the Army attorney feels there has been a significant event in the case. If the Army attorney is not a PFI Coordinator
or a PFA, the matter should be referred to one of these two attorneys as soon as possible. Routine exchanges between
Army attorneys and U.S. Attorney's offices or DOJ do not need to be brought to the attention of PFD.



 516.64 

Comprehensive remedies plan.



(a) A specific, comprehensive remedies plan will be developed in each significant investigation involving fraud
or corruption that relates to Army procurement activities. When possible, these plans should be forwarded with the
DFARS 209.406-3 reports. In no case, however, should the report be delayed an appreciable time pending completion
of the plan. The format for a remedies plan is at Figure H-2, Appendix G, to this part.

(b) The plan will be developed initially by the PFA with the participation of the appropriate criminal investigators
and other relevant personnel such as the contracting officer. In significant cases the PFA should also coordinate
a remedies plan early with PFD. Defective product/product substitution remedies plans must comply with the requirements
of Appendix D to this part.

(c) A comprehensive remedies plan will include at a minimum the following information and considerations:



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940727-0-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-0-00025 </PARENT>
<TEXT>


(1) Summary of allegations and investigative results.

(2) Statement of any adverse impact on a DOD mission. DOD investigative organizations, commanders, or procurement
officials will also provide this information to prosecutive authorities to enhance prosecution of offenses or to
prepare a victim impact statement pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(2).

(3) The impact upon combat readiness and safety.

(4) Consideration of each criminal, civil, contractual, and administrative remedy available, and documentation
of those remedies, either planned, in progress, or completed.

(5) Restrictions on the pursuit of any remedies such as grand jury information or possible compromise of the investigation.

(d) When remedies plans are received by PFD they will be coordinated with the headquarters of the appropriate DOD criminal
investigative organization involved.

(e) Testing necessary to support the investigation and remedies plan should comply with Figure H-3, Appendix
G, to this part.



 516.65 

Litigation reports in civil recovery cases.



(a) All substantiated PFI cases will be evaluated by PFAs to determine whether it is appropriate to recommend civil
recovery proceedings.

(b) Recovery should be considered under both statutory and common law theories, including but not limited to the following:

(1) False Claims Act, 31 USC 3729.

(2) Anti-Kickback Act, 41 USC 51.

(3) Sherman Act, 15 USC 1-7.

(4) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 USC 1961-1968.

(5) Common law fraud.

(6) Unjust enrichment.

(7) Constructive trust.

(8) Cases where contracts have been procured in violation of the conflict of interest statute, 18 USC 218. See 

K&R Engineering Co.

 v. 

United States,

 616 F.2d 469 (Ct. Cl., 1980).

(c) When civil recovery appears possible, PFD should be consulted to determine if a litigation report is necessary.
If requested by PFD, the report should summarize the available evidence and applicable theories of recovery and be
prepared under  516.23 of this part. To avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, recovery reports may include
and make liberal references to other reports previously prepared on a given case such as the DFARS 209.406-3
(48 CFR 209.406-3) report.

(d) The MACOM PFI coordinator and PFA will monitor all civil fraud recovery efforts throughout the command and will
provide training and technical assistance as required. Status reports of all civil fraud recovery efforts will be
provided through channels as required by PFD.



 516.66 

Administrative and contractual actions.



(a) The following remedial options should be considered in response to confirmed fraudulent activity:

(1) Contractual.

(i) Termination of contract for default.

(ii) Nonaward of contract based upon a finding of contractor nonresponsibility. (If this appears to be a valid option,
a DFARS 209.406-3 (48 CFR 209.406-3) report must be prepared where contractor nonresponsibility is based
on lack of integrity).

(iii) Rescission of contract.

(b) In cases which are pending review or action by DOJ, PFAs should coordinate with the DOJ attorney handling the case
prior to initiating any contractual or administrative remedy. In the case of ongoing criminal investigations, this
coordination will be accomplished through the appropriate DOD criminal investigation organization.



 516.67 

Overseas cases of fraud or corruption.



(a) Commanders of overseas major commands will establish procedures, similar to this regulation and consistent
with the DFARS, and regulations and directives of their respective unified commands, for reporting and coordination
of available remedies in overseas procurement fraud and corruption cases involving foreign firms and individuals.
Overseas major commands will also maintain liaison with PFD and provide periodic reports of remedies coordination
results.

(b) Overseas suspension and debarment actions are governed by DFARS 209.403 (48 CFR 209.403). The names of all firms
and individuals suspended or debarred will be expeditiously forwarded to PFD for inclusion on the List of Parties
Excluded From Federal Procurement or NonProcurement Programs.

(c) Overseas cases of fraud or corruption related to the procurement process that involve U.S. firms or U.S. citizens
may be referred to PFD for coordination of remedies under this regulation.



 516.68 

Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (PFCRA).



(a) PFCRA was enacted on 21 October 1986 (Public Law 99-509) and implemented by DOD on 30 August 1988 (DOD Directive
5505.5). (See Appendix E to this part.)

(b) PFCRA expands the capability of the government to deter and recover losses from false, fictitious or fraudulent
claims and statements. It is also applicable to program fraud and provides an administrative remedy in addition to
those otherwise available to the Army in procurement fraud or pay and entitlements fraud cases.

(c) As part of the Army implementation, the Secretary of the Army's duties and responsibilities under PFCRA as Authority
Head are delegated to the Army General Counsel. The Chief, Intellectual Property Law Division, is the Army's Reviewing
Official within the meaning of PFCRA. Army implementation also requires DA to follow the policies and procedures
prescribed in enclosure 2 of DOD Directive 5505.5. (See Appendix E to this part.)

(d) The DOD Inspector General (IG) is the Investigating Official within DOD. The duties of this position will be performed
by the Assistant IG For Investigations. This individual is vested with the authority to investigate all allegations
of liability under PFCRA. That authority includes the power to task subordinate investigative agencies to review
and report on allegations that are subject to PFCRA. If the Investigative Official concludes that an action under
PFCRA is warranted in an Army case, the official will submit a report containing the findings and conclusions of such
investigation through PFD to the Army Reviewing Official.

(e) Pursuant to DOD IG guidance, USACIDC will forward appropriate cases that appear to qualify for resolution under
PFCRA to the Investigating Official in a timely manner. Additionally, USACIDC will forward current information
regarding the status of remedies pending or concluded. USACIDC may obtain remedies information by coordinating
with PFD and the cognizant command.

(f) In pay and entitlement or transportation operation fraud cases, USACIDC will coordinate with the Office of the
Secretary of the Army, Financial Management, Review and Oversight Directorate (SAFM-RO), to determine the
status of any pending or proposed action under the Debt Collection Act. This information, in addition to information
obtained under  517.68(e), will be forwarded with appropriate cases to the Investigating Official.

(g) In those cases where the Investigating Official has submitted a report to the Army Reviewing Official for action
under PFCRA, PFD will, at the direction of the Reviewing Official, prepare all legal memoranda as necessary to transmit
the Reviewing Official's intention to issue a complaint. As part of this responsibility PFD will do the following:
coordinate with the affected command or agency to ensure that all appropriate remedies have been considered; evaluate
the overall potential benefits to the Army; and, ensure that action under PFCRA is not duplicative of other remedies
already taken. In order to fully supplement the Reviewing Official's file, PFD may request a litigation report.

(h) PFD will coordinate all cases involving transportation operations emanating from Military Traffic Management
Command (MTMC) activity, under the military transportation exception to the FAR, and all cases involving pay and
entitlements fraud with SAFM-RO, for comments and recommendations. These matters will be forwarded with the
case file to the Reviewing Official.

(i) If the Attorney General approves the issuance of a complaint, PFD, at the direction of the Army Reviewing Official,
shall prepare the complaint and all necessary memoranda as required. PFD shall also designate attorneys to represent
the Authority in hearings under PFCRA.

<DOCNO> FR940727-0-00082 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-0-00025 </PARENT>
<TEXT>


(2) Management officials will take vigorous corrective action when prohibited personnel practices occur. Disciplinary
measures under AR 690-700, Chapter 751, may be initiated after consultation and coordination with appropriate
civilian personnel office and labor counselor.

(b) DA activities will cooperate with OSC in the following ways:

(1) Promoting merit system principles in civilian employment programs within DA.

(2) Investigating and reporting allegations of improper or illegal conduct forwarded to the activity by HQDA.

(3) Facilitating orderly investigations by the OSC of alleged prohibited personnel practices and other matters
assigned for investigation to the OSC, such as violations of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, the Freedom
of Information Act, or the Hatch Act.



 516.71 

Duties.



(a) DA General Counsel. The DA General Counsel is responsible for the following:

(1) Provide overall guidance on all issues concerning cooperation with OSC, including the investigation of alleged
prohibited personnel practices and allegations of improper or illegal conduct.

(2) Review for adequacy and legal sufficiency each OSC report of investigation that must be personally reviewed by
the Secretary of the Army.

(3) Ensure compliance with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 by obtaining a suitable investigation of allegations
of improper or illegal conduct received from OSC. This includes compliance with time limits for reporting results
of the investigation and personal review of the report by the Secretary of the Army when required.

(4) Forward to the DOD Inspector General (DODIG) copies of each allegation of improper or illegal conduct referred
to DA by OSC.

(5) Delegate to The Judge Advocate General the authority to act on behalf of the DA General Counsel in all OSC investigations
of prohibited personnel practices.

(6) Act upon requests for counsel from ``accused'' or ``suspected'' employees.

(b) Chief, Labor and Employment Law Office. The Chief, Labor and Employment Law Office, OTJAG (DAJA-LE) is responsible
for the following:

(1) Act for TJAG as the Senior Management Official in cooperating with OSC. As Senior Management Official, the Chief,
DAJA-LE, through TJAG, will be responsible to the DA General Counsel for administration of the policies and
procedures contained in this chapter.

investigation. As DA attorney-of-record, the Chief, DAJA-LE, will file necessary pleadings and make necessary
appearances before the MSPB to represent DA interests.

(5) Monitor ongoing OSC investigations within DA.

(6) Ensure that appropriate DA personnel are fully apprised of their rights, duties and the nature and basis for an
OSC investigation.

(7) Review and prepare recommendations to the General Counsel concerning any OSC recommended corrective action
referred to DA. Such review and recommendations will address whether disciplinary action should be taken against
DA civilian employees or military members, and whether the information warrants referral to appropriate authorities
for corrective and disciplinary action.

(8) Seek OSC approval of DA proposed disciplinary action against an employee for an alleged prohibited personnel
practice or other misconduct which is the subject of or related to any OSC investigation.

(9) Review and prepare recommendations for DA General Counsel concerning requests for counsel, to include identifying
available DA attorneys to act as individual representatives. Upon approval of DA General Counsel, appoint DA civilian
and military attorneys, to include attorneys from the U.S. Army Materiel Command and the Corps of Engineers, to represent
individual military members or employees.

<TEXT>


(10) Determine, to the extent practicable, whether an investigation is being or has been conducted which duplicates,
in whole or in part, a proposed or incomplete OSC investigation, and convey that information to the OSC whenever it
might avoid redundant investigative efforts.

(11) Provide guidance and assistance to activity Labor Counselors in fulfilling their duties as Liaison Officers.

(9) Keep the Chief, DAJA-LE, informed of the status of the OSC investigation.

(l0) Act as agency representative before the MSPB in actions initiated by employees (individual right of action appeals).



 516.72 

Procedures.



(a) Witnesses and counsel for consultation.

(1) DA military and civilian managers, supervisors, and employees who are requested by OSC for an interview will be
made available in accordance with arrangements the Labor Counselor will establish. Requests for the testimony of
IGs will be coordinated with the Inspector General Legal Office, SAIG-ZXL, DSN 227-9734 or Commercial
(703) 697-9734.

(2) The Labor Counselor will ensure that witnesses are aware of their obligation to answer OSC questions, their potential
to be considered ``suspects'' in OSC investigations, and their right to the assistance of counsel during interviews
with OSC representatives. If the requested witness is not an ``accused'' or ``suspected'' individual and the witness
asks for assistance of counsel, a DA attorney will be made available for the limited purpose of consultation regarding
the witness' rights and obligations. An attorney-client relationship will not be established. (See Appendix F to
this part).

(3) The Labor Counselor will arrange for individual counsel for consultation from local assets. If local assets are
not sufficient, assistance may be requested from other DOD activities in the area or from HQDA, DAJA-LE. DA attorneys
tasked to consult with one or more witnesses individually will not be tasked to represent the DA activity concerned.

(4) The Labor Counselor, as the legal representative of the activity, is precluded from assisting or representing
individual witnesses during OSC interviews.

(b) ``Accused'' or ``suspected'' DA personnel and counsel for representation.

(1) If the OSC identifies a DA civilian employee or a military member as an ``accused'' or ``suspected'' individual,
or if the Labor Counselor concludes that an individual is a ``suspect,'' the Labor Counselor will inform the individual.
The Labor Counselor also will advise the individual of the availability of counsel for representation upon approval
by DA General Counsel. (See Glossary, Counsel for Representation).

(2) If the ``suspected'' individual desires legal representation by DA, the individual must request counsel by submitting
a written request through DAJA-LE to DA General Counsel. (See Figure I-1, Appendix G, to this part).

(3) During the investigation but prior to DA General Counsel approval of the request for counsel, an ``accused'' or
``suspected'' individual will be provided the assistance of counsel for consultation in the same manner as any other
OSC requested witness. ``Accused'' or ``suspected'' individuals who do not request counsel for representation
will be provided counsel for consultation in the same manner as any other OSC requested witness.

<TEXT>


(4) If the DA General Counsel approves the request for counsel, the Chief, DAJA-LE, will appoint a DA attorney to represent
the individual. This appointment may be made telephonically but will be confirmed in writing. The Chief, DAJA-LE,
will make appropriate coordination with MACOM SJAs and command counsel to confirm availability of the attorney.

(5) An attorney appointed by DA may represent a civilian employee in any proceeding initiated by OSC before the MSPB.
However, counsel provided by DA may not represent the employee in any proceeding initiated by DA, in any appeal from
a final decision by the MSPB, or in any collateral proceeding before any forum other than the MSPB. 
(6) OSC may not bring a disciplinary action before the MSPB against a military member. Accordingly, DA counsel will
not be required to represent the military member in any MSPB disciplinary proceeding. However, counsel may represent
the member during the OSC investigation with the understanding that the evidence obtained by OSC may be referred to
the member's command for possible disciplinary action under the UCMJ or appropriate regulations. If DA initiates
action against the military member for misconduct disclosed in the OSC investigation, the member will obtain counsel
as provided under the UCMJ or relevant regulations. 
(c) Records. 
(1) OSC requests for records must be in writing. The Labor Counselor will assist OSC representatives in identifying
the custodian of specific records sought during the inquiry. 
(2) Generally, requested records should be furnished to OSC representatives if such records would be released under
AR 25-55 or AR 340-21 to other government agencies in the normal course of official business. Records constituting
attorney work product should not be released without approval of the Chief, DAJA-LE. IG records will not be released
without the approval of the Inspector General. (AR 20-1). The Labor Counselor should seek guidance from the
Chief, DAJA-LE, if there is any doubt concerning the release of records. 
(3) If, after completion of the OSC investigation, the OSC files a complaint against DA or a DA employee, release of
records and other information will be accomplished pursuant to MSPB rules of discovery (5 CFR part 1201, subpart B).

(d) Funding. The command, activity, or installation within which the allegations of misconduct arose will provide
funding for travel, per diem and other necessary expenses related to the OSC investigation. These expenses may include
appropriate funding for witnesses, counsel for consultation and DA General Counsel approved counsel for representation.



 516.73 

Assistance from HQDA. 


Labor Counselors may seek guidance on questions arising from implementation of this chapter by calling the Chief,
DAJA-LE, DSN 225-9476/9481 or Commercial (703) 695-9476/9481.

soldiers on active duty who are summoned to serve on state and local juries. 
(b) This subpart does not apply to Army National Guard soldiers in an annual training or full-time AGR (Active Guard
Reserve) status under Title 32, U.S. Code. Soldiers in a Title 32 status must refer to their respective state law for
relief from state or local jury duty. 


 516.75 

Policy. 


(a) Active duty soldiers should fulfill their civic responsibility by serving on state and local juries, so long as
it does not interfere with military duties. 
(b) The following active duty soldiers are exempt from complying with summons to serve on state and local juries: 
(1) General officers. 
(2) Commanders. 
(3) Active duty soldiers stationed outside the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American
Samoa, and the Virgin Islands. 
(4) Active duty soldiers in a training status. 
(5) Active duty soldiers assigned to forces engaged in operations.

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940727-0-00085 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-0-00025 </PARENT>
<TEXT>


(2) It would adversely affect the readiness of a summoned soldier's unit, command, or activity. 


 516.76 

Exemption determination authority. 


(a) The commander exercising special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA) over a unit has the authority to
determine whether a soldier of that unit, who has been served with a summons, is exempt from serving on a state or local
jury unless that authority has been limited or withheld in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. This
authority may not be delegated to a subordinate commander who does not exercise SPCMCA. 
(b) A commander superior to the SPCMCA, who also exercises SPCMCA or general court-martial convening authority (GCMCA)
over a unit, may limit or withhold the exemption determination authority of subordinate commanders. 
(c) A GCMCA, who orders a unit or soldier assigned to one command to be attached or detailed to another command for disciplinary
purposes (for example, ``for administration'' or ``for administration of military justice''), may reserve exemption
determination authority to the commander exercising SPCMCA in the chain of command to which the unit or soldier is
assigned rather than the chain of command to which the unit or soldier is attached or detailed. 


 516.77 

Procedures for exemption. 


(a) Active duty soldiers served with a summons to serve on a state or local jury will promptly advise their commander
and provide copies of pertinent documents. 
(b) Unit commanders will evaluate the summons considering both the individual soldier's duties and the unit mission.
Coordination with the servicing judge advocate or legal adviser and with the appropriate state or local official
may be necessary to determine any impact on the soldier's duties or on unit readiness. 
(1) If the soldier is not exempt under  516.75 (b) or (c), the commander will process the soldier for permissive
TDY in accordance with AR 630-5, Leaves and Passes. 
(2) If the soldier is exempt under  516.75 (b) or (c), the commander will forward the summons and any related documentation,
with recommendations, through the chain of command to the commander with exemption determination authority over
the soldier concerned. 
(c) The commander with exemption determination authority over the soldier concerned will determine whether the
soldier is exempt. His determination is final. 
(d) The exemption determination authority will notify responsible state or local officials whenever a soldier summoned
for jury duty is exempt. The notification will cite 10 U.S.C. 982 as authority. 


 516.78 

Status, fees, and expenses. 


(a) Soldiers who are required to comply with summons to serve on state or local juries will be placed on permissive TDY
under the provisions of AR 630-5. 
(b) Jury fees accruing to soldiers for complying with the summons to serve on state and local juries must be turned over
to the appropriate finance office for deposit into the U.S. Treasury. Commands will establish procedures with local
authorities and their servicing finance and accounting activity to ensure that such jury fees are so deposited. Soldiers,
however, may keep any reimbursement from state or local authority for expenses incurred in the performance of jury
duty, including transportation, meals, and parking.

for the United States Armed Forces; and other specific individuals hired through contractual agreements by or on
behalf of the Department of Defense. 
3. Litigation. All pretrial, trial, and post-trial stages of all existing or reasonably anticipated judicial or
administrative actions, hearings, investigations, or similar proceedings before civilian courts, commissions,
boards (including the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals), or other tribunals, foreign and domestic. This
term includes responses to discovery requests, depositions, and other pretrial proceedings, as well as responses
to formal or informal requests by attorneys or others in situations involving litigation. 
4. Official Information. All information of any kind, however stored, that is in the custody and control of the Department
of Defense, relates to information in the custody and control of the Department, or was acquired by DoD personnel as
part of their official duties or because of their official status within the Department while such personnel were
employed by or on behalf of the Department or on active duty with the United States Armed Forces. 


D. Policy 


It is DoD policy that official information should generally be made reasonably available for use in Federal and state
courts and by other governmental bodies unless the information is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected
from public disclosure. 


E. Responsibilities 


l. The General Counsel, Department of Defense (GC, DoD), shall provide general policy and procedural guidance by
the issuance of supplemental instructions or specific orders concerning the release of official DoD information
in litigation and the testimony of DoD personnel as witnesses during litigation. 
2. The Heads of DoD Components shall issue appropriate regulations to implement this Directive and to identify official
information that is involved in litigation. 


F. Procedures 


1. Authority to Act 


 a. In response to a litigation request or demand for official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel as witnesses,
the General Counsels of DoD, Navy, and the Defense Agencies; the Judge Advocates General of the Military Departments;
and the Chief Legal Advisors to the JCS and the Unified and Specified Commands, with regard to their respective Components,
are authorized_after consulting and coordinating with the appropriate Department of Justice litigation attorneys,
as required_to determine whether official information originated by the Component may be released in litigation;
whether DoD personnel assigned to or affiliated with the Component may be interviewed, contacted, or used as witnesses
concerning official DoD information or as expert witnesses; and what, if any, conditions will be imposed upon such
release, interview, contact, or testimony. Delegation of this authority, to include the authority to invoke appropriate
claims of privilege before any tribunal, is permitted. 
b. In the event that a DoD Component receives a litigation request or demand for official information originated by
another Component, the receiving Component shall forward the appropriate portions of the request or demand to the
originating Component for action in accordance with this Directive. The receiving Component shall also notify the
requestor, court, or other authority of its transfer of the request or demand. 
c. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs F.1.a. and b., the GC, DoD, in litigation involving terrorism, espionage,
nuclear weapons, intelligence means or sources, or otherwise as deemed necessary, may notify Components that GC,
DoD, will assume primary responsibility for coordinating all litigation requests and demands for official DoD information
or the testimony of DoD personnel, or both; consulting with the Department of Justice, as required; and taking final
action on such requests and demands.

2. Factors to Consider
 


In deciding whether to authorize the release of official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel concerning
official information (hereinafter referred to as ``the disclosure'') pursuant to paragraph F.1., DoD officials
should consider the following types of factors: 
a. Whether the request or demand is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules;

b. Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the
case or matter in which the request or demand arose; 
c. Whether the disclosure would violate a statute, executive order, regulation, or directive; 
d. Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is appropriate or necessary under the relevant substantive
law concerning privilege; 
e. Whether the disclosure, except when in camera and necessary to assert a claim of privilege, would reveal information
properly classified pursuant to the DoD Information Security Program under DoD 5200.1-R (reference (d)),
unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.25 (reference (e)), or
other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure; and

f. Whether disclosure would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights,
reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or similarly confidential
commercial or financial information, or otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances. 


3. Decisions on Litigation Requests and Demands 


a. Subject to paragraph F.3.e., DoD personnel shall not, in response to a litigation request or demand, produce, disclose,
release, comment upon, or testify concerning any official DoD information without the prior written approval of
the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. Oral approval may be granted, but a record of such approval
shall be made and retained in accordance with the applicable implementing regulations. 
b. If official DoD information is sought, through testimony or otherwise, by a litigation request or demand, the individual
seeking such release or testimony must set forth, in writing and with as much specificity as possible, the nature and
relevance of the official information sought. Subject to paragraph F.3.e., DoD personnel may only produce, disclose,
release, comment upon, or testify concerning those matters that were specified in writing and properly approved
by the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462
(1951). 
c. Whenever a litigation request or demand is made upon DoD personnel for official DoD information or for testimony
concerning such information, the personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall immediately notify the
DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. for the Component to which the individual contacted is or, for former personnel,
was last assigned. In appropriate cases, the responsible DoD official shall thereupon notify the Department of Justice
of the request or demands. After due consultation and coordination with the Department of Justice, as required, the
DoD official shall determine whether the individual is required to comply with the request or demand and shall notify
the requestor or the court or other authority of the determination reached. 
d. If, after DoD personnel have received a litigation request or demand and have in turn notified the appropriate DoD
official in accordance with paragraph F.3.c., a response to the request or demand is required before instructions
from the responsible official are received, the responsible official designated in paragraph F.1. shall furnish
the requestor or the court or other authority with a copy of this Directive and applicable implementing regulations,
inform the requestor or the court or other authority that the request or demand is being reviewed, and seek a stay of
the request or demand pending a final determination by the Component concerned. 
e. If a court of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate authority declines to stay the effect of the request or
demand in response to action taken pursuant to paragraph F.3.d., or if such court or other authority orders that the
request or demand must be complied with notwithstanding the final decision of the appropriate DoD official, the DoD
personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall notify the responsible DoD official of such ruling or order.
If the DoD official determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's ruling or order will be sought,
the affected DoD personnel shall comply with the request, demand, or order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official,
however, the affected DoD personnel shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex rel.


Touhy 

v. 

Ragen, 

340 U.S. 462 (1951). 


4. Fees
 


Consistent with the guidelines in DoD Instruction 7230.7 (reference (f)), the appropriate officials designated
in paragraph F.1. are authorized to charge reasonable fees, as established by regulation and to the extent not prohibited
by law, to parties seeking, by request or demand, official DoD information not otherwise available under the DoD Freedom
of Information Act Program (reference (g)). Such fees, in amounts calculated to reimburse the Government for the
expense of providing such information, may include the costs of time expended by DoD employees to process and respond
to the request or demand; attorney time for reviewing the request or demand and any information located in response
thereto and for related legal work in connection with the request or demand; and expenses generated by materials and
equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. See Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders,
437 U.S. 340 (1978). 


5. Expert or Opinion Testimony 


DoD personnel shall not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning official
DoD information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United States or a party represented by the Department
of Justice. Upon a showing by the requestor of exceptional need or unique circumstances and that the anticipated testimony
will not be adverse to the interests of the Department of Defense or the United States, the appropriate DoD official
designated in paragraph F.1. may, in writing, grant special authorization for DoD personnel to appear and testify
at no expense to the United States. If, despite the final determination of the responsible DoD official, a court of
competent jurisdiction, or other appropriate authority, orders the appearance and expert or opinion testimony
of DoD personnel, the personnel shall notify the responsible DoD official of such order. If the DoD official determines
that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's order will be sought, the affected DoD personnel shall comply
with the order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official, however, the affected DoD personnel shall respectfully
decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951). 


G. Effective Date and Implementation 


This Directive is effective immediately. Forward two copies of implementing documents to the General Counsel, DoD,
within 120 days.

(e) DoD 4105.61-M, ``Procurement Coding Manual'' (Volume I), October 1988, authorized by DoD Instruction
4105.61 May 4, 1973 


A. Reissuance and Purpose 


This Directive reissues reference (a) to update policies, procedures, and responsibilities for the coordination
of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies stemming from investigation of fraud or corruption
related to procurement activities. More effective and timely communication of information developed during such
investigations will enable the Department of Defense to take the most appropriate of the available measures. 


B. Applicability 


This Directive applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); the Inspector General, Department of Defense
(IG, DoD); the Military Departments; the Defense Agencies; and the DoD Field Activities (hereafter referred to collectively
as ``DoD Components''). 


C. Definitions 


1. 

DoD Criminal Investigative Organizations. 

Refers to the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command; the Naval Investigative Service Command; the U.S. Air Force
Office of Special Investigations; and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Office of the IG, DoD (OIG, DoD).

2. 

Significant. 

Refers to all fraud cases involving an alleged loss of $100,000, or more; all corruption cases related to procurement
that involved bribery, gratuities, or conflicts of interest; and any investigation into defective products or product
substitution in which a SERIOUS HAZARD to health, safety, or operational readiness is indicated, regardless of loss
value. 


D. Policy 


It is DoD policy that: 
1. Each of the DoD Components shall monitor, from its inception, all significant investigations of fraud or corruption
related to procurement activities affecting its organizations, for the purpose of ensuring that all possible criminal,
civil, administrative, and contractual remedies in such cases are identified to cognizant procurement and command
officials and that appropriate remedies are pursued expeditiously. This process shall include appropriate coordination
with all other affected DoD Components. 
2. All investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities shall be reviewed to determine and
implement the appropriate contractual and administrative actions that are necessary to recover funds lost through
fraud or corruption and to ensure the integrity of DoD programs and operations. 
3. Appropriate civil, contractual, and administrative actions, including those set forth in enclosure 1, shall
be taken expeditiously. During an investigation and before prosecution or litigation, and when based in whole or
in part on evidence developed during an investigation, such actions shall be taken with the advance knowledge of the
responsible DoD criminal investigative organization and, when necessary, the appropriate legal counsel in the
Department of Defense and the Department of Justice (DoJ). When appropriate, such actions shall be taken before final
resolution of the criminal or civil case. 


E. Responsibilities 


1. The 

Heads of DoD Components 

shall: 
a. Establish a centralized organization (hereafter referred to as ``the centralized organization'') to monitor
and ensure the coordination of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies for each significant
investigation of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities affecting the DoD Component. 
b. Establish procedures requiring the centralized organization to discuss regularly with the assigned DoD criminal
investigative organization(s) such issues as the current status of significant investigations and their coordination
with prosecutive authorities. 
c. Establish procedures requiring that all coordination involving the DoJ, during the pendency of a criminal investigation,
is accomplished by or with the advance knowledge of the appropriate DoD criminal investigative organization(s).

d. Establish procedures to ensure appropriate coordination of actions between the centralized organizations of
any DoD Components affected by a significant investigation of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.

e. Establish procedures to ensure that all proper and effective civil, administrative, and contractual remedies
available to the Department of Defense are, when found applicable and appropriate, considered and undertaken promptly
by the necessary DoD officials (e.g., commanders, programs officials, and contracting officers). This includes
initiation of any suspension and debarment action within 30 days of an indictment or conviction. The centralized
organization shall ensure that all proposed actions are coordinated with appropriate investigative organization.

f. Establish procedures to ensure that a specific comprehensive remedies plan is developed for each significant
investigation involving fraud or corruption related to procurement activities. These procedures shall include
the participation of the appropriate DoD criminal investigative organization in the development of the plan. 

g. Establish procedures to ensure that in those significant investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement
activities when adverse impact on a DoD mission can be determined, such adverse impact is identified and documented
by the centralized organization. This information is to be used by the centralized organization of the DoD Component
concerned in development of the remedies plan required in paragraph E.1.f., above, and shall be furnished to prosecutors
as stated in paragraph E.2.e., below. The information shall also be used by the centralized organizations in development
and preparation of ``Victim Impact Statements'' for use in sentencing proceedings, as provided for P.L. 97-291
(reference (b)). Some examples of adverse impact on a DoD mission are as follows: 

(1) Endangerment of personnel or property. 

(2) Monetary loss. 

(3) Denigration of program or personnel integrity. 

(4) Compromise of the procurement process. 

(5) Reduction or loss of mission readiness. 

h. Ensure training materials are developed on fraud and corruption in the procurement process, and that all procurement
and procurement-related training includes a period of such instruction appropriate to the duration and nature of
the training. 

i. Establish procedures enabling the centralized organization to ensure that safety and readiness issues are examined
and appropriately dealt with for all cases in which a notice is required under paragraph E.2.i., below. The minimum
procedures to be followed by the centralized organization are in enclosure 3. 

j. Ensure that appropriate command, procurement, and investigative organizations are provided sufficient information
to determine if further inquiry is warranted on their part to prevent reoccurrence and detect other possible fraud
within their activity. 

2. The 

Secretaries of the Military Departments 

and the 

Inspector General, Department of Defense (IG, DoD),

 or their designees, shall establish procedures that ensure that their respective criminal investigative organizations
will: 

a. Notify, in writing, the centralized organization for the affected DoD Component of the start of all significant
investigations involving fraud or corruption that are related to procurement activities. Initial notification
shall include the following elements: 

(1) Case title. 

(2) Case control number. 

(3) Investigative agency and office of primary responsibility. 

(4) Date opened. 

(5) Predication. 

(6) Suspected offense(s). 

b. Notify expeditiously the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) of any investigations that develop evidence that
would impact on DoD-cleared industrial facilities or personnel. 

c. Discuss regularly with the centralized organization such issues as the current status of significant investigations
and their coordination with prosecutive authorities. If the DoD criminal investigative organization has prepared
any documents summarizing the current status of the investigation, such documents shall be provided to the centralized
organization. Completed reports of significant investigations also should be provided to the centralized organization.


d. Provide to the appropriate procurement officials, commanders, and suspension and debarment authorities, when
needed to allow consideration of applicable remedies, any court records, documents, or other evidence of fraud or
corruption related to procurement activities. Such information shall be provided in a timely manner to enable the
suspension and debarment authority to initiate suspension and debarment action within 30 days of an indictment or
conviction. 

e. Provide expeditiously to prosecutive authorities the information regarding any adverse impact on a DoD mission,
that is gathered under paragraph E.1.g., above, for the purpose of enhancing the prosecutability of a case. Such information
also should be used in preparing a victim impact statement for use in sentencing proceedings as provided for in Public
Law 97-291.

f. Gather, at the earliest practical point in the investigation, without reliance on grand jury subpoenas whenever
possible, relevant information concerning responsible individuals, the organizational structure, finances,
and contract history of DoD contractors under investigation for fraud or corruption related to procurement activities,
to facilitate the criminal investigation as well as any civil, administrative, or contractual actions or remedies
that may be taken. Some available sources of such information are listed in enclosure 2. 

g. Provide timely notice to other cognizant DoD criminal investigative organizations of evidence of fraud by a contractor,
subcontractor, or employees of either, on current or past contracts with, or affecting, other DoD Components. 

h. Ascertain the impact upon any ongoing investigation or prosecution of civil, contractual, and administrative
actions being considered and advise the appropriate centralized organization of any adverse impact. 

i. Obtain a DD 350 report in every investigation into defective products or product substitution in which a SERIOUS
HAZARD to health, safety, or operational readiness is indicated. Timely notification shall be made to the centralized
organization of each DoD Component that is identified as having contract actions with the subject of the investigation.


j. Obtain a DD 350 report in all significant fraud investigations, as defined in subsection C.2. above, whether or
not the case involved defective products or product substitution. Timely notification shall be made to the centralized
organization of each DoD Component that is identified as having contract actions with the subject of the investigation.


3. The 

Inspector General, Department of Defense

 (IG, DoD), shall: 

a. Develop training materials relating to fraud and corruption in procurement related activities which shall be
utilized in all procurement related training in conjunction with training materials developed by the DoD Components.
(See paragraph E.1.h., above.) 

b. Establish procedures for providing to the DoD criminal investigative organizations, through the Office of the
Assistant Inspector General for Auditing (OAIG-AUD), reports of data contained in the Individual Procurement
Action Report (DD Form 350) System. 



F. Procedures 



Transmissions of information by DoD criminal investigative organizations required by subsection E.2., above,
shall be made as expeditiously as possible, consistent with efforts not to compromise any ongoing criminal investigation.
The transmission of the information may be delayed when, in the judgment of the head of the DoD criminal investigative
organization, failure to delay would compromise the success of any investigation or prosecution. The prosecutive
authorities dealing with the investigation shall be consulted, when appropriate, in making such determinations.




G. Effective Date and Implementation 



This Directive is effective immediately. Forward two copies of implementing documents to the Inspector General,
Department of Defense, within 120 days.

Figure G-1. Sample ``Touhy'' Compliance Letter



Department of the Army, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Fort Smith, North Dakota 84165, 15 April 1993



Mr. T. Hudson Taylor,



Attorney At Law, 105 Hay Street, Whynot, ND 84167



Dear Mr. Taylor: We have learned that you subpoenaed Captain Roberta Selby to testify at a deposition in the case Kramer

 v. 

Kramer,

 currently filed in state court, and that you directed her to bring her legal assistance file concerning her client,
SSG Kramer.

Under 32 CFR   97.6(c), 516.35, and 516.40, the Army must authorize the appearance of its personnel or
the production of official documents in private litigation. In this case, the Army cannot authorize Captain Selby
to appear or produce the requested file absent the following:

You must request in writing her appearance and the production of the file in accordance with Department of Defense
directives, 32 CFR  97.6(c), and Army regulations, 32 CFR   516-34_516.40. The request must
include the nature of the proceeding, 32 CFR  516.34(b), and the nature and relevance of the official information
sought. 

Id.

  516.35(d). We cannot act on your request until we receive the required information. 

See, for example, United States ex rel. Touhy

 v. 

Ragen,

 340 U.S. 462 (1951); 

Boron Oil Co.

 v. 

Downie,

 873 F.2d 67 (4th Cir. 1989); 

United States

 v. 

Bizzard,

 674 F.2d 1382 (11th Cir. 1982); 

United States

 v. 

Marino,

 658 F.2d 1120 (6th Cir. 1981); 

United States

 v. 

Allen,

 554 F.2d 398 (10th Cir. 1977).

To overcome Federal statutory restrictions on the disclosure of the requested file imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.
 552a, you must provide either a written release authorization signed by the individual to whom the file pertains
(that is, SSG Kramer) or a court ordered release signed by a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction. A subpoena signed
by a clerk of court, notary, or other official is insufficient. 

See, for example, Doe

 v. 

DiGenova,

 779 F.2d 74 (DC Cir. 1985).

In this case, because of the attorney-client relationship between Captain Selby and SSG Kramer, you must produce
a written waiver of the attorney-client privilege from SSG Kramer. Because the privilege may protect both documents
and testimony, Captain Selby may not divulge such information without SSG Kramer's consent. 

See, for example,

 Rule of Professional Conduct for Army Lawyers 1.6(a).

In addition to the above requirements, Captain Selby's supervisor must approve her absence from duty. 

See

 32 CFR  516.43. In this regard, we suggest you take the deposition at Fort Smith. In any event, however, you or
your client must pay all travel expenses, as this is purely private litigation and witness' appearance must be at no
expense to the United States. 

See id.

  516.48(c).

Finally, if Captain Selby does appear as a witness, she may only give factual testimony. She may not testify as an opinion
or expert witness. This limitation is based on Department of Defense and Army policy that generally prohibits Government
employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private litigation. 

See id.

   97.6(e), 516.42.

Our sole concern in this matter is to protect the interests of the United States Army; the Army will not block access
to witnesses or documents to which you are lawfully entitled. So that the Army can adequately protect its interests
in this matter, I request that you respond to this letter by 27 April 1993. If you have any questions, please call CPT
Taylor at 919-882-4500.

Department of the Army, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Fort Smith, North Dakota 84165, 15 April 1993 



Mr. T. Hudson Taylor, 


Attorney At Law, l05 Hay Street, Whynot, ND 84167 


Dear Mr. Taylor: This letter responds to your request to interview and depose Captain Buzz Sawyer as a witness in Morgan


v. 

Jones.

 Subject to the following conditions, your request is approved. 
This grant of authority is limited to factual testimony only. Captain Sawyer may not testify as an expert witness.
This limitation is based on Army policy prohibiting Government employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private
litigation. 

See

 32 CFR  516.42. Captain Sawyer may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise
protected from public disclosure. 
The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the prospective witness. This authorization
is also subject to the approval of the witness' supervisors to be absent during the period involved. Finally, because
this is private litigation, the witness' participation must be at no expense to the United States. 

See

 32 CFR  516.48. 
If you have any questions, please call CPT Taylor at 919-882-4500.

Figure G-3. Sample Expert Witness Denial Letter 


Department of the Army, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Fort Smith, North Dakota 84165, 15 April 1993 



Mr. T. Hudson Taylor, 


Attorney At Law, l05 Hay Street, Whynot, ND 84167 


Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request for Mr. Charles Montrose to appear as an expert witness in private litigation:
Smithers 

v. 

ABC Video.

 For the following reasons, the request is denied. 
Army Regulation 27-40 forbids Army personnel from providing expert testimony in private litigation, with
or without compensation, except under the most extraordinary circumstances. See 32 CFR   97.6(e), 516.42.
Several reasons support the exercise of strict control over such witness appearances. 
The Army policy is one of strict impartiality in litigation in which the Army is not a named party, a real party in interest,
or in which the Army does not have a significant interest. When a witness with an official connection with the Army testifies,
a natural tendency exists to assume that the testimony represents the official view of the Army, despite express disclaimers
to the contrary. 
The Army is also interested in preventing the unnecessary loss of the services of its personnel in connection with
matters unrelated to their official responsibilities. If Army personnel testify as expert witnesses in private
litigation, their official duties are invariably disrupted, often at the expense of the Army's mission and the Federal
taxpayer. 
Finally, the Army is concerned about the potential for conflict of interest inherent in the unrestricted appearance
of its personnel as expert witnesses on behalf of parties other than the United States. Even the appearance of such
conflicts of interest seriously undermines the public trust and confidence in the integrity of our Government. 
This case does not present the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify the requested witness' expert testimony.
You have demonstrated no exceptional need or unique circumstances that would warrant (his or her) appearance. The
expert testimony desired can be secured from non-Army sources. Consequently, we are unable to grant you an exception
to the Army's policy. 
If you have any questions, please call me or CPT Taylor at 919-882-4500.

Figure G-4. Sample of Doctor Approval Letter 


Department of the Army, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Fort Smith, North Dakota 84165, 15 April 1993 



Mr. T. Hudson Taylor, 


Attorney At Law, 105 Hay Street, Whynot, ND 84167 


Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request to depose Dr. (MAJ) J. McDonald, Fort Smith Medical Treatment Facility.
Pursuant to 32 CFR   516.33-516.49, you may depose him subject to the following conditions: 
He may testify as to his treatment of his patient, Sergeant Rock, as to related laboratory tests he may have conducted,
or other actions he took in the regular course of his duties. 
He must limit his testimony to factual matters such as his observations of the patient or other operative facts, the
treatment prescribed or corrective action taken, course of recovery or steps required for treatment of injuries
suffered, or contemplated future treatment. 
His testimony may not extend to hypothetical questions or to a prognosis. He may not testify as an ``expert.'' This
limitation is based on Department of Defense and Army policy prohibiting present or former military personnel and
Army civilian employees from providing opinion or expert testimony concerning official information, subjects,
or activities in private litigation. See

 32 CFR   97.6(e), 516.42. 
The witnesses may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from
public disclosure. To protect the Army's interests, CPT Taylor or another Army attorney will be present during the
depositions. 
To overcome restrictions imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.  552a, Dr. McDonald may not discuss matters derived
from the patient's medical records absent the patient's written consent or a court order signed by a judge. A subpoena
issued by someone other than a judge or magistrate is insufficient.

v. 

DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74 (D.C. Cir. 1985); Stiles 

v. 

Atlanta Gas Light Co.

, 453 F. Supp. 798 (N.D. Ga. 1978). 
The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the witness, subject to the approval
of his supervisors to be absent during the period involved. 
Finally, because this is private litigation, the witnesses' participation must be at no expense to the United States.

Figure H-3. Guide for Testing Defective Items Under Criminal or Civil Investigation 



Testing Defective Items Under Criminal or Civil Investigation 



1. Under no circumstances is testing to proceed unless the command has committed sufficient funding to cover the entire
cost of the projected testing. 

2. No testing will be initiated unless there has been a written request for the testing to the appropriate Procurement
Fraud Advisor from a criminal investigator or Assistant United States Attorney or Department of Justice Attorney
(AUSA is used in these procedures to indicate either an AUSA or Department of Justice attorney). If they have not already
done so, criminal investigators should be requested to coordinate their testing requests with the AUSA overseeing
the investigation. 

3. Barring extraordinary circumstances, only one test will be conducted to support the criminal and civil recovery
efforts of a procurement fraud/irregularity matter. Early coordination with the Civil Division of Department of
Justice or the local United States Attorneys Office is necessary to ensure that testing funds are not wasted. 

4. The request for testing should include a clear, concise statement of the purpose of the testing to include a statement
of the allegations made and the contact number(s) involved. 

Any test plan which requires destructive testing must be approved by the AUSA. 

5. No testing will be initiated unless a test plan has been developed which states the following:




a. the contract number(s) involved 

b. the National Stock Number (NSN) of the item to be tested 

c. the purpose of the testing 

d. the alleged defect or the contractual requirement violated 

e. the CID report of investigation (ROI) number or the DCIS case number 

f. cost of the test (a cost proposal should be an attachment to the test plan) 

g. where the test will be conducted 

h. how the test will be conducted 

i. the name and telephone number of the test team leader 

j. the names of all test team members 

k. the approximate dates of the testing 

l. the date that completion of the test is required 

m. a clear statement of the desired product (that is test report, raw data, analysis of results, evaluation of test
results) 

n. the PRON to fund the testing 

o. a retention plan.





6. The test plan shall be coordinated with the concurrence received in advance from the appropriate personnel in the
Procurement Directorate, Product Assurance and Test Directorate, the Procurement Fraud Advisor, and the investigator/AUSA
requesting the test. No testing will be initiated until the criminal investigator/AUSA who requested the testing
has approved the test plan. 

7. If the items tested are to be retained as evidence, the criminal investigator should arrange for retention of the
evidence. While the Command will support evidence retention, this is primarily the responsibility of the criminal
investigators. Agents should be advised that putting items in Code L or similar non-use status is insufficient to
protect it from being released to the field. A decision not to retain the tested items as evidence must have the approval
of the AUSA. 

8. All items to be tested should be from a statistically valid random sample. The sample should conform with the inspection
requirements of the contract or be in conformance with a random sample specifically developed for the instant test
plan. It is recommended that a statistician be consulted to determine the feasibility of a random sample specifically
created to support the test plan. 

9. Results of testing should be available to Command and DA personnel for appropriate contractual and administrative
remedies. Any request for testing results that indicates that dissemination of the testing results will be limited
by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is to be forwarded through the MACOM or AMC Procurement Fraud
Coordinator to DA Procurement Fraud Division prior to the initiation of any testing. 

10. Resolution of problems associated with testing requests should be conducted at the local level. In AMC the authority
to refuse a testing request resides with the Office of Command Counsel. Any disputes which cannot be resolved at the
local level will be forwarded to the AMC or MACOM Procurement Fraud Coordinator for resolution. This includes disputes
regarding funding or any time sensitive issues. 

11. Second requests for testing of the same item due to a change in the investigative plan require coordination by the
PFA with the investigator and

 AUSA overseeing the investigation to determine the deficiencies in the earlier test. Disputes which cannot be resolved
between the AUSA, PFA, and investigator regarding testing are to be forwarded simultaneously to the MACOM Procurement
Fraud Coordinator and PFD for resolution. The procedures established in paragraphs 5 and 6 apply for second requests
for testing with the additional requirement that the Assistant United States Attorney must be requested to approve
the test plan.

Figure I-1. Guide for Seeking Legal Advice and Representation 
Before Office of Special Counsel 



Guide for Seeking Legal Advice and Representation Before Office of Special Counsel 

1. Overview 



a. DA employees or military members asked to provide information (testimonial or documentary) to OSC may obtain legal
advice through the Labor Counselor from DA attorneys concerning their rights and obligations. This includes assistance
at any interviews with OSC investigators. However, an attorney-client relationship will not be established unless
the employee or military member_

(1) Is suspected or accused by the OSC of committing a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act;
and

(2) Has been assigned counsel by the DA General Counsel.

b. Any military member or employee who reasonably believes that he or she is suspected or has been accused by OSC of committing
a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act may obtain legal representation from DA. The counsel
assigned will be from another DOD component whenever a DA attorney is likely to face a conflict between the attorney's
ethical obligation to the client and DA, or when the suspected or accused individual has requested representation
from another DOD component. Outside legal counsel may be retained by DA on behalf of the member or employee under unusual
circumstances and only with the personal approval of the DOD General Counsel.

c. The DA General Counsel will determine whether a conflict is likely to occur if a DA attorney is assigned to represent
a military member or civilian. If the DA General Counsel determines a conflict may occur, or if the suspected or accused
employee has requested representation from another DOD component, the DA General Counsel will seek the assistance
of another General Counsel in obtaining representation outside DA.

2. Requests for Representation

a. To obtain legal representation, military members or civilian employees must_

(1) Submit a written request for legal representation through the Labor and Employment Law Office, Office of the Judge
Advocate General, Department of the Army, to DA General Counsel, explaining the circumstances that justify legal
representation. Copies of all process and pleadings served should accompany the request.

(2) Indicate whether private counsel, at personal expense, has been retained.

(3) Obtain written certification from their supervisor that_

(a) They were acting within the scope of official duties; and 

(b) DA has not initiated any adverse or disciplinary action against them for the conduct being investigated by the
OSC.

b. Requests for DA legal representation must be approved by the DA General Counsel.

c. The conditions of legal representation must be explained and accepted in writing by the member or employee.



3. Limitations on Representation



a. DA will not provide legal representation with respect to a DA initiated disciplinary action against a civilian
employee for committing or participating in a prohibited personnel practice or for engaging in illegal or improper
conduct. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the participation or conduct is also the basis for the disciplinary
action proposed by the OSC.

b. In certain situations, counsel provided by DA may be limited to representing the individual only with respect to
some of the pending matters, if other specific matters of concern to the OSC or MSPB do not satisfy the requirements
contained in this regulation.



4. Attorney-Client Relationship



a. An attorney-client relationship will be established and continued between the suspected or accused individual
and assigned DA counsel.

b. In representing a DA employee or military member, the DA attorney designated as counsel will act as a vigorous advocate
of the individual's legal interests before the OSC or MSPB. The attorney's professional responsibility to DA will
be satisfied by fulfilling this responsibility to the employee or military member. Legal representation may be terminated
only with the approval of the DA General Counsel and normally only on the basis of information not available at the time
the attorney was assigned.

c. The attorney-client relationship may be terminated if the assigned DA counsel determines, with the approval of
the DA General Counsel, that_

(1) The military member or civilian employee was acting outside the scope of his or her official duties when engaging
in the conduct that is the basis for the OSC investigation or charge; and

(2) Termination is not in violation of the rules of professional conduct applicable to the assigned counsel.

d. The DA attorney designated as counsel may request relief from the duties of representation or counseling without
being required to furnish explanatory information that might compromise confidential communications between
the client and the attorney. 



5. Funding



This regulation authorizes cognizant DA officials to approve requests from military members or civilian employees
for travel, per diem, witness appearances, or other departmental support necessary to ensure effective legal representation
by the designated counsel.



6. Status



A military member's or civilian employee's participation in OSC investigations, MSPB hearings, and other related
proceedings will be considered official departmental business for time and attendance requirements and similar
purposes.



7. Advice to Witnesses



The following advice to military members and civilian employees questioned during the course of an OSC investigation
may be appropriate in response to these frequent inquiries:

a. A witness may decline to provide a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer in favor of a more qualified answer when this is necessary
to ensure accuracy in responding to an OSC interviewer's question.

b. Requests for clarification of both questions and answers are appropriate to avoid misinterpretation.

c. Means to ensure verifications of an interview by OSC investigators are appropriate, whether or not the military
member or civilian employee is accompanied by counsel. Tape recorders may only be used for this purpose when_

(1) The recorder is used in full view.

(2) All attendees are informed.

(3) The OSC investigator agrees to record the proceeding. 

d. Any errors that appear in a written summary of an interview prepared by the investigator should be corrected before
the member or employee signs the statement. The military member or civilian employee is not required to sign any written
summary that is not completely accurate. A military member or civilian employee may receive a copy of the summary as
a condition of signing.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, Labor. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Labor is issuing these regulations pursuant to the requirements of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-110 (Revised), which provides standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity
among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals,
and other non-profit organizations. This rule also applies to the Department of Labor's grants to commercial organizations,
foreign governments, organizations under the jurisdiction of foreign governments and international organizations.



OMB issued Circular A-110 in 1976 and, except for a minor revision in February 1987, the Circular remained unchanged
until revised in 1993. To update the Circular, OMB established an interagency task force to review the Circular. The
task force solicited suggestions for changes to the Circular from university groups, non-profit organizations
and other interested parties and compared for consistency the provisions of similar provisions applied to State
and local governments. The revised Circular and these regulations reflect the results of these efforts.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


OMB published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 39018) on August 27, 1992, requesting comments on proposed revisions to OMB Circular A-110. Interested
parties were invited to submit comments. OMB received over 200 comments from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations,
professional organizations and others. All comments were considered in developing this final revision. 
On November 29, 1993, at 58 FR 62992, OMB published a notice containing its final revision to Circular A-110.
In that publication, OMB presented a summary of the major comments, grouped by subject, and a response to each comment.
Other changes were made to increase clarity and readability. 
Omitted from part 95 are requirements which DOL must meet pursuant to the Circular. Those requirements deal with the
relationship between DOL and OMB and are not necessary to this rulemaking. OMB Circular A-110 gives Federal
agencies the discretion to make these regulations applicable to grants and agreements awarded to commercial organizations,
foreign governments, organizations under the jurisdiction of foreign governments, and international organizations.
The Department of Labor has chosen to do so. As permitted by OMB Circular A-110, the Department has made a few changes
to the language of the Circular to fit the particular circumstances of the DOL programs. The Department has added a
definition of ``commercial organizations'' and revised the definition of ``program income'' for clarification
purposes. The Department also has revised the language in  95.25(e)(2), dealing with extensions, for editorial
purposes. The Department has deleted the words ``at least'' from  95.22(e)(2) to enhance administrative efficiency
by limiting invoicing to once a month. Other minor editorial, technical, and clarifying changes are made as well.



B. Publication in Final 


The Department of Labor has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that good cause exists for waiving public
comment on this procedural amendment to the regulation because such comment is unnecessary, impracticable, and
contrary to the public interest. This finding is made because all executive agencies are required to follow OMB directives
with respect to grants or assistance of property. See 41 U.S.C.  405 (The Office of Federal Procurement Policy
Act). 


C. Dates 


The Department has determined that good cause exists for waiving the customary requirement for delay in the effective
date of a final rule for 30 days following its publication. Therefore, this rule shall be effective July 27, 1994. See
5 U.S.C. 553. 



D. Procedural Matters 


This rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. Since this
rule was not preceded by a proposed rule, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2). Further,
the Department of Labor certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, because it does not affect the amount of funds provided in the covered programs, but, rather, modifies
and updates administrative and procedural requirements. The recordkeeping requirements in this rule have been
approved by the Office of Management and Budget, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.

). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, Approval Number 1225-0017.

Purpose. 


This part establishes uniform administrative requirements for Federal grants and agreements awarded to institutions
of higher education, hospitals, other non-profit organizations, commercial organizations, foreign governments,
organizations under the jurisdiction of foreign governments, and international organizations. DOL shall not impose
additional or inconsistent requirements, except as provided in   95.4 and 95.14 or unless specifically
required by Federal statute or executive order. Non-profit and commercial organizations that implement Federal
programs for the States are also subject to State requirements. 


 95.2 

Definitions. 


(a) 

Accrued expenditures

 means the charges incurred by the recipient during a given period requiring the provision of funds for: 
(1) Goods and other tangible property received; 
(2) Services performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients, and other payees; and, 
(3) Other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance is required. 

(b) 

Accrued income

 means the sum of: 

(1) Earnings during a given period from

except to the extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with the deviations provision in  95.4.




 95.4 

Deviations. 



The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may grant exceptions for classes of grants or recipients subject to the requirements
of this part when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in the interest of maximum grant-wide uniformity,
exceptions from the requirements of this part shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. DOL may apply more
restrictive requirements to a class of recipients when approved by OMB. DOL may apply less restrictive requirements
when awarding small awards, except for those requirements which are statutory. Exceptions on a case-by-case basis
may also be made by DOL. 



 95.5 

Subawards. 



Unless sections of this part specifically exclude subrecipients from coverage, the provisions of this part shall
be applied to subrecipients performing work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher education,
hospitals, other non-profit organizations, commercial organizations, foreign governments, organizations under

Subpart B_Pre-Award Requirements 



 95.10 

Purpose. 



Sections 95.11 through 95.17 prescribe forms and instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying
for Federal awards.

 95.11 

Pre-award policies. 


Public Notice and Priority Setting. Federal awarding agencies shall notify the public of its intended funding priorities
for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute. 


 95.12 

Forms for applying for Federal assistance. 


(a) Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and instructions prescribed by DOL. 
(b) The applicant shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF-424 (Application for Federal Assistance)
indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and
address of the SPOC for a particular State can be obtained from DOL or the 

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. 

The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State
for review. 


 95.13 

Debarment and suspension. 


Recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.'s 12549
and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension'' codified by DOL at 29 CFR part 98. This common rule restricts subawards and
contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation
in Federal assistance programs or activities. 


 95.14 

Special award conditions. 


If an applicant or recipient:
(a) Has a history of poor performance, 
(b) Is not financially stable, 
(c) Has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this part, 
(d) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or (e) Is not otherwise responsible,

 

DOL may impose additional requirements as needed, provided that such applicant or recipient is notified in writing
as to: The nature of the additional requirements, the reason why the additional requirements are being imposed, the
nature of the corrective action needed, the time allowed for completing the corrective actions, and the method for
requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed. Any special conditions shall be promptly removed
once the conditions that prompted them have been corrected. 


 95.15 

Metric system of measurement. 


The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205), declares that
the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency
to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. DOL shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage
in Federal Government Programs.'' 


 95.16 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.


Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94-580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State
agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with Section
6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products
containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
(40 CFR parts 247-254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit
organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement
programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines. 


 95.17 

Certifications and representations. 


Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, DOL requires recipients to submit certifications and representations
required by statute, executive order, or regulation on an annual basis only, if the recipients have ongoing and continuing
relationships with the agency. Annual certifications and representations shall be signed by responsible officials
with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the pertinent requirements.

Sections 95.21 through 95.28 prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making payments
and rules for: Satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for program income, budget revision
approvals, making audits, determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability. 


 95.21 

Standards for financial management systems. 


(a) Recipients shall relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical.

(b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following: 
(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program
in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in  95.52. Though DOL requires reporting on an accrual
basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required
to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis
of an analysis of the documentation on hand.

(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income and interest. 
(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately
safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes. 
(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should
be related to performance and unit cost data. 
(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs.'' 
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award. 
(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation. 
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, DOL, at its
discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient
are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 
(d) DOL may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the
Federal Government's interest. 
(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 


 95.22 

Payment. 


(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of
State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR part 205. 
(b) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain: 
(1) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient,
and 
(2) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in  95.21.



Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the
actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share
of any allowable indirect costs. 


(c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by DOL to
the recipient. 
(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer. 
(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205. 
(3) Recipients are authorized to submit requests for advances monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.

(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,''
or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to
the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special DOL instructions
for electronic funds transfer. 
(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. DOL
may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished
through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the
project. 
(1) When the reimbursement method is used, DOL shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless
the billing is improper. 
(2) Recipients are authorized to submit requests for reimbursement monthly when electronic funds transfers are
not used. 

(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and DOL has determined that reimbursement is not feasible
because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, DOL may provide cash on a working capital advance basis.
Under this procedure, DOL shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial
period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, DOL shall reimburse the recipient for its
actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling
or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.


(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned
on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. 
(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, DOL shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at
any time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply. 

(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements. 
(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129,
``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, DOL may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient
that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected
or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. 
(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are
as follows: 
(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, DOL shall not require separate depository
accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds
provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure
of funds.

(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. 
(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members). 
(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k)(1),
(k)(2), or (k)(3) of this section apply. 
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year. 
(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances. 
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources. 




In keeping with Electronic Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR Part 206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment
Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients who do not have this
capability should use a check. 


(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient
for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest.
If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written
approval from DOL, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA. 
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. DOL shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms. 

(1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. The SF-270 is the standard form for all nonconstruction
programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. DOL, however, has the option
of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement
for Construction Programs.'' 
(2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The SF-271 is the
standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, DOL may 

substitute

 the SF-270 when DOL determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs. 



 95.23 

Cost sharing or matching. 


(a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing
or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria: 
(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940727-0-00122 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Are not included as contributions for any other Federally-assisted project or program. 
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives. 
(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles. 
(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used
for cost sharing or matching. 
(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by DOL. 
(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable. 
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with prior written approval
of the grant officer. 
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If DOL authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition
projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of the
value determined under paragraph (c)(1) or paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the
time of donation. 
(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the grant officer may approve
the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of
donation to the project. 
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid. 
(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop
and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be
reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. 
(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title
passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section
apply. 
(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total
value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. 
(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the grant officer has approved the charges.

(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications: 
(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient. 

(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition
at the time of donation. 
(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality. 
(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value. 
(5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third
parties: 
(i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient
for its own employees.

be documented. 


 95.24

Program income. 



(a) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained
by the recipient and added to funds committed to the project by DOL and recipient, and used to further eligible project
or program objectives. 

(b) Recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of
the project period. 
(c) Costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income,
provided these costs have not been charged to the award. 
(d) Proceeds from the sale of property are not program income and shall be handled in accordance with the requirements
of the Property Standards (See   95.30 through 95.37). 

(e) Unless DOL's regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation
to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material,
patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and Trademark
Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award. 



 95.25 

Revision of budget and program plans. 


(a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It may
include either the Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon DOL's requirements.
It shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate. 
(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget
and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section. 
(c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior written approvals from the grant officer for one
or more of the following program or budget changes: 
(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring
prior written approval). 
(2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award document. 
(3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25-percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved
project director or principal investigator. 
(4) The need for additional Federal funding.

for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 74, Appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to
Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 48 CFR part 31, ``Contract Cost Principles
and Procedures,'' as applicable. 
(7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.

(8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting
out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment or general
support services. 
(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by
OMB. 
(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, the grant officer may waive cost-related
and administrative prior written approvals required by this part and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122. Such
waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following: 
(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior written approval
of the grant officer. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the grant officer is under no
obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than
anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). 
(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following
conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the grant officer in writing with the supporting
reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. This one-time
extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. The one-time extension may not
be initiated if:

(i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension. 
(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds. 
(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project. 
(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods. 
(4) For awards that support research, unless the grant officer provides otherwise in the award or in DOL's regulations,
the prior written approval requirements described in paragraph (e) are automatically waived (i.e., recipients
need not obtain such prior written approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) applies.

(f) DOL may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and
activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such
transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by DOL. DOL shall not permit
a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent
with the original intent of the appropriation. 
(g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j), do not require
prior approval. 
(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from the grant officer for
budget revisions whenever paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(2) or (h)(3) of this section apply. 
(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program. 
(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project. 
(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed
consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in  95.27. 
(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by
OMB. 
(j) When DOL makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, DOL may require
the recipient to request prior written approval before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of
work supported. 
(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, recipients shall notify the grant officer in writing promptly
whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period
by more than $5,000 or five percent of the award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an
application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award. 
(l) When requesting written approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in
the application. 
(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the grant officer shall review
the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under
consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the grant officer shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when
the recipient may expect the decision. 


 95.26 

Non-Federal audits. 


(a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations shall
be subject to the audit requirements contained in OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education
and Other Non-Profit Institutions'' and applicable provisions of DOL regulations at 29 CFR part 96. 
(b) Recipients and subrecipients that are State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements
contained in the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7) and DOL's regulations implementing OMB Circular A-128,

of DOL. See 29 CFR part 96. 
(d) Commercial organizations shall be subject to the audit requirements specified by the DOL awarding agency or the
prime recipient as incorporated into the award document. See 29 CFR part 96. 


 95.27 

Allowable costs. 


For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of
costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus,
allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined
in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.''
The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions
of OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred
by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, ``Cost
Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance
with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and
Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations
and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with
the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31. 


 95.28 

Period of availability of funds. 


Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations
incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by DOL. 


Property Standards 


 95.30 

Purpose of property standards. 


Sections 95.31 through 95.37 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished
by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Recipients are required
to observe these standards under awards and no additional requirements shall be imposed, unless specifically required
by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes
the provisions of   95.31 through 95.37. 


 95.31 

Insurance coverage. 


Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired
with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless
required by the terms and conditions of the award. 


 95.32 

Real property. 


DOL shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in
whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain
the following: 
(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of DOL. 
(b) The recipient shall obtain prior written approval from the grant officer for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored
projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project.
Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that
have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by DOL. 
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from the grant officer. The grant officer shall issue one or more of the following
disposition instructions: 
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940727-0-00126 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by DOL and pay DOL for that percentage
of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting
actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized
or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the
extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage
of the current fair market value of the property. 


 95.33 

Federally-owned and exempt property. 


(a) Federally-owned property. 
(1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually
an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to DOL. Upon completion of the award or when the
property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to DOL for further Federal agency utilization.

 (2) If DOL has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration,
unless DOL has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided
by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit
organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National
Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by DOL. 
(b) Exempt property. 
When statutory authority exists, DOL has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient
without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions DOL considers appropriate. Such property
is ``exempt property.'' Should DOL not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest
in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government. 


 95.34 

Equipment. 


(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section. 
(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside
organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment. 
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the grant officer. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the
equipment in connection with its other federally, sponsored activities, in the following order of priority: 
(1) Activities sponsored by the DOL agency which funded the original project, then 
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. 
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by the DOL agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to
projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government,
use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the grant officer.
User charges shall be treated as program income. 
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the written approval of
the grant officer. 
(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following: 
(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information: 
(i) A description of the equipment. 
(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification
number. 
(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number. 
(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government. 
(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.

(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment
(not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government). 
(vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported. 
(viii) Unit acquisition cost. 
(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current
fair market value where a recipient compensates DOL for its share. 
(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership. 
(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment. 
(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the grant officer. 
(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition. 
(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established
which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient
may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original DOL agency. The amount of
compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project
or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient
shall request disposition instructions from DOL. The DOL agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used
to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within the DOL agency, the availability of the equipment
shall be reported to the General Services Administration by DOL to determine whether a requirement for the equipment
exists in other Federal agencies. DOL shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after
the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern. 
(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's
request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse DOL an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds
the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall
be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for
the recipient's selling and handling expenses. 
(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal
Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost
of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping
or interim storage costs incurred. 
(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the
awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition. 
(4) The DOL agency reserves the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the
Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject
to the following standards: 
(i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.

(ii) The DOL agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory.
The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If DOL fails
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of
this section, as appropriate. 
(iii) When DOL exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned
equipment.

(a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual
inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project
or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall
retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate
the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.

(b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations
for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal
statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.



 95.36


Intangible property.



(a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was
purchased, under an award. DOL reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish,
or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.

(b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide
regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations
and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''

(c) DOL has the right to:

(1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award.

(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.

(d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition
in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient
shall not encumber the property without written approval of the grant officer. When no longer needed for the originally
authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of  95.34(g).



 95.37 

Property trust relationship.



Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds
shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property
was acquired or improved. Grant officers may require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of record
to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition
conditions apply to the property.



Procurement Standards



 95.40 

Purpose of procurement standards.



Sections 95.41 through 95.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or
requirements shall be imposed by DOL upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive
order or approved by OMB.



 95.41 

Recipient responsibilities.



The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to DOL, regarding the settlement
and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support
of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local
authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

 95.42 

Codes of conduct. 


The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient. 


 95.43 

Competition. 


All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer
is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered.
Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid
or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest
to do so. 



 95.44 

Procurement procedures. 


(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum,
that paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section apply. 
(1) Recipients shall avoid purchasing unnecessary items. 
(2) Where appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the
most economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government. 
(3) Solicitations for goods and services shall provide for all of the following: 
(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance
required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards. 
(iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items
are included in the solicitation.

(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in
the metric system of measurement. 
(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient. 
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal: 
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable. 
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. 
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually. 
(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration,
the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency, and DOL's Office of Small Business and Minority
Affairs in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.

(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used. 
(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources.
In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.'s
12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' See 29 CFR part 98. 
(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available to DOL, pre-award and procurement documents, such as request for
proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply:

(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part.

(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently $25,000)
and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation. 
(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.

(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement. 
(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold.

Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement
action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted,
market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element
of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability. 


 95.46 

Procurement records. 


Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following
at a minimum: (a) basis for contractor selection, (b) justification for lack of competition when competitive bids
or offers are not obtained, and (c) basis for award cost or price. 


 95.47 

Contract administration. 


A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions
and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall
evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions
and specifications of the contract. 


 95.48 

Contract provisions. 


The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions
in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts: 
(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate. 
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. 
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, DOL may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient,
provided DOL has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination
has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows. 
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified. 
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.

(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 
(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, DOL, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor
which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

(e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement
provisions of Appendix A to this part, as applicable. 


Reports and Records 


 95.50 

Purpose of reports and records. 


Sections 95.51 through 95.53 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial
and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements.



 95.51 

Monitoring and reporting program performance. 


(a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function or activity
supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements
as delineated in  95.26.

<PARENT> FR940727-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) DOL shall prescribe the frequency with which performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph
(f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently
than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports
shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. DOL may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple-year
awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration
or termination of the award. 
(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.

(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the
following: 
(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. 
(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high
unit costs. 
(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. 
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify DOL of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially
impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken
or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
(g) DOL may make site visits, as needed. 
(h) DOL shall comply with clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from recipients.

 

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget, Approval Number 1225-0017) 


 95.52 

Financial reporting. 


(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information
from recipients: 
(1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report. 
 (i) Recipients shall use the SF-269, SF-269A, or other OMB-approved forms to report the status of funds
for all nonconstruction projects or programs. DOL may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF-269
or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash
Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF-269 or
SF-269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances. 
 (ii) DOL shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or an accrual basis. If DOL requires accrual information
and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not convert
its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of
the documentation on hand. 
 (iii) DOL shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.

(iv) Recipients shall submit to DOL the SF-269, SF-269A, or other OMB-approved forms (an original and
no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual
reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by DOL
upon request of the recipient. 
(2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions. 


(i) When funds are advanced to recipients, the recipient shall submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation
sheet, SF-272a. DOL shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement
information for each agreement with the recipients. 
(ii) DOL may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report. 
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, DOL may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount
of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions
taken to reduce the excess balances. 
(iv) Recipients shall submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF-272 15 calendar days following
the end of each quarter. The DOL agency may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling
$1 million or more per year. 
(v) DOL may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons: 
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through
other forms contained in this section; 
(B) If, in DOL's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances;
or, 
(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. 
(b) When DOL needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed. 
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, DOL shall issue instructions
to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports. 
(2) When DOL determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in  95.21, additional
pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time
as the system is brought up to standard. DOL, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements
of 5 CFR part 1320. 
(3) DOL may shade out any line item on any report if not necessary. 
(4) DOL may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts
or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.

of reporting. 



(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget, Approval Number 1225-0017) 


 95.53 

Retention and access requirements for records. 


(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. DOL
shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients. 
(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that
are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as
authorized by DOL. The only exceptions are the following: 
(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken. 
(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by DOL, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the
recipient. 
(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc., as specified in paragraph (g) of this section. 
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by DOL. 
(d) DOL shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records
possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, DOL may make arrangements
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use. 
(e) The Federal grantor awarding agency, the Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or
any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents,
papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts,
transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's
personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph
are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 
(f) Unless required by statute, DOL shall not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when DOL can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential
and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C.  552) if the
records had belonged to DOL. 
(g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply
to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals,
cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is
chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates). 
(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to DOL or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the
proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period
for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission. 
(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to DOL or the subrecipient is not required
to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention
period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year
(or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

Termination and Enforcement 


 95.60 

Purpose of termination and enforcement. 


Sections 95.61 and 95.62 set forth uniform suspension, termination and enforcement procedures. 



 95.61 

Termination. 



(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraphs (a) (1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section apply.

(1) By grant officers, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award. 
(2) By grant officers, with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination
conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. 
(3) By the recipient upon sending to the grant officer written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination,
the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the grant officer
determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the grant will not accomplish
the purposes for which the grant was made, the grant officer may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs
(a) (1) or (2) of this section. 

(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in  95.71(a), including
those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall
be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate. 


 95.62 

Enforcement. 


(a) 

Remedies for noncompliance. 

If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute,
regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, DOL may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions
outlined in  95.14, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances: 
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement
action by DOL. 
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity
or action not in compliance. 
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award. 
(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program. 
(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available. 
(b) 

Hearings and appeals. 

In taking an enforcement action, DOL shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative
proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

(c) 

Effects of suspension and termination. 

Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless DOL expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently.
Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are
allowable if paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply. 
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable. 
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period
in which the termination takes effect. 
(d) 

Relationship to debarment and suspension. 

The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient
from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.'s 12549 and 12689 and DOL's implementing regulations.
See  95.13 and 29 CFR part 98. 


Subpart D_After-the-Award Requirements 


 95.70 

Purpose. 


Sections 95.71 through 95.73 contain closeout procedures and other procedures for subsequent disallowances and
adjustments. 


 95.71 

Closeout procedures. 


(a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all financial, performance,
and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. DOL may approve extensions when requested by
the recipient. 
(b) Unless DOL authorizes an extension, a recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not
later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion as specified in the terms and conditions
of the award or in agency implementing instructions. 

(c) DOL shall make prompt payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed out.

(d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that DOL has advanced or paid and that is not
authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A-129 governs unreturned
amounts that become delinquent debts. 
(e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, DOL shall make a settlement for any upward or downward
adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received. 
(f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from the
Federal Government in accordance with   95.31 through 95.37. 
(g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, DOL retains the right to recover
an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final
audit.

(5) Records retention as required in  95.53. 
(b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with
the consent of DOL and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in  95.73(a),
including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing responsibilities
of the recipient, as appropriate. 


 95.73 

Collection of amounts due. 


(a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled
under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable
period after the demand for payment, DOL may reduce the debt by paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section.

(1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements. 
(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient. 
(3) Taking other action permitted by statute. 
(b) Except as otherwise provided by law, DOL shall charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR Chapter

to the tier above that it will not and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or organization for influencing
or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of Congress,
or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered
by 31 U.S.C.  1352. Each tier shall also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection
with obtaining any Federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the recipient. See 29 CFR part
98. 

8. 

Debarment and Suspension (E.O.'s 12549 and 12689)

System Administration Act of 1966 and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) concerning
the administration of cabins on Alaska refuges. These regulations are being revised to ensure proper and uniform
management of all cabins on national wildlife refuges in Alaska. In addition, a technical amendment is made to eliminate
reference to sections regarding general provisions which have been removed earlier.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Sections 1303 and 1315 of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 3193 and 3203) allow the Secretary of the Interior to permit cabins on refuges
in Alaska under certain conditions. Section 304 of ANILCA reemphasizes the authority of the Secretary to prescribe
such regulations as necessary to ensure the compatibility of uses with refuge purposes. 

The original cabin policy for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) was developed in 1981 and revised in 1984.
This policy was the basis for regulations printed in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 50. In September 1987, the
Service, believing revisions of the existing cabin policy and regulations were needed, published a Draft Cabin Management
Policy for Cabins on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. The purpose of the cabin policy is to provide uniform guidance
to both the public and refuge managers on human use and occupancy of cabins located on refuges in Alaska. The policy
further serves to define under what conditions use and occupancy of a cabin may be compatible with the purposes for
which the refuge was established. 

Comments and suggestions on the draft policy were solicited during a 60-day public review period. The Service made
extensive revisions in response to the comments. Because of the number and nature of revisions made, the Service published
a revised draft of the policy in December 1988 to give the public another opportunity to comment before the policy was
made final. 

The revised draft was completely reorganized. It better described the objectives of the policy and set forth the guidelines
needed to comply with ANILCA and the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. The comment period
for the revised draft was also 60 days. The final cabin policy was issued in August, 1989. 

The next step in the process was to publish proposed rules to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the
rulemaking process and solicit public comment. A proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 25, 1991 (56 FR 19074). The proposed rule had a 60 day public comment period and public hearings were held in
Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska.

Both the proposed and the final rules contain significantly more guidance relating to cabin management than existing
regulations. However, only minor changes are made in permit application procedures. The existing requirement that
individuals apply for nontransferable renewable five year special use permits is retained. However, this final
rule requires two additional items (date of construction or acquisition of the cabin and the dimensions of the cabin
and related structures) to be submitted in the application. In addition to the increased application requirements,
the rule has additional requirements of permittees such as getting permission from the refuge manager before major
modification or rehabilitation is conducted on existing cabins. 


Summary of Public Comments 


Four persons presented oral comments at the public hearings and the Service received an additional eight letters
providing written comments from the public. A number of changes were made in the final rule from the proposed rule after
consideration of all public comments received. 
Some comments requested changes that were 

not 

made, however, and the Service first addresses these comments as noted below.


(a) Exemptions for Certain Types of Facilities 




Comment: 

The regulations should exempt facilities such as headquarters sites, visitor centers, and state facilities used
to support fish and wildlife related management. 


Response: 

It is the Service's position that cabins used by the State for support of fish and wildlife related management are administrative
cabins and should not be exempted from the regulations. Visitor centers and headquarters sites do not need to be exempted
since they are not within the scope of the cabin regulations. 



(b) Access 




Comment: 

The final cabin regulations should address rights of access. 


Response: 

The Service does not believe it is necessary to repeat such language in the cabin regulations since the intent of ANILCA
Section 1110(a) regarding access is already articulated in 50 CFR 36.12 and 43 CFR Part 36. 


(c) Definition of Family and Immediate Family 




Comment: 

The definition of ``family'' should be broadened and the definition of ``immediate family'' should be deleted. 


Response: 

The definitions, as proposed, fully meet the intent of ANILCA Section 1303(c)(1) regarding permit renewal for the
life of claimants and immediate family. The definition of ``immediate family'' was broadened by deleting ``legal''
from the term ``legal spouse.'' 


(d) Public Use of Seasonally Permitted Cabins 




Comment: 

The definition of ``public use cabin'' should be revised to allow seasonally permitted cabins to also be used as public
use cabins during the other parts of the year. 


Response: 

The Service does not have the authority to allow use of ``existing'' cabins which are privately owned. Although ``new''
cabins are government property, the permittees usually have a considerable amount of private property in and around
the cabin. The Service does not believe it is reasonable to make the permittees' private belongings accessible to
the public or require the permittees to seasonally remove all of their property. 


(e) Permits for New Cabins Generally Only for Subsistence Purposes 



Comment: 

The language ``In general, new cabin permits will be given only to local residents to pursue a legitimate subsistence
activity[.]'' should be deleted. 



Response: 

This statement meets the intent of ANILCA and the Service believes it is appropriate to include in the regulations.



(f) Construction and Use of Cabins in Wilderness Areas 




Comment: 

The language which only allows new cabins to be constructed in wilderness areas that are built specifically for the
administration of the area, for public safety, or for trapping where trapping has been a traditional and customary
use should be deleted. 


Response: 

The language as proposed meets the intent of the Wilderness Act, as well as ANILCA, and is appropriate to include in
the regulations. 


(g) Guests in Cabins 




Comment: 

There was some objection to the requirement that guests occupying a cabin during the absence of the permittee are required
to obtain a letter of authorization from the permittee. 


Response: 

Unauthorized use and vandalism of permitted cabins has been a problem in the past. The Service believes this is a reasonable
requirement to reduce the problem. 


(h) Recreational Use 




Comment: 

One commenter recommended revising the language ``No special use permit will be issued for the construction of a cabin
for private recreational use or for the private recreational use of an existing cabin'' in order to comply with a recent
court case. 


Response: 

The language as proposed does comply with the decision of the court. The case simply made it clear that permittees and
their guests have the right to recreate while occupying cabins for which permits were issued for purposes other than
recreation.

<TEXT>
 

(i) Nontransferable Permits 




Comment:

 It was recommended that permits for existing cabins be transferable to another person at the election or death of the
original permittee. 


Response:

 Nontransferability is a condition of all Service special use permits, regardless of the use being authorized. The
requirement is consistent with ANILCA and is appropriate to be included in the regulations. 


(j) Compatibility Criteria 




Comment:

 The criteria for determining cabin compatibility should be included in the regulations. 


Response:

 Compatibility determinations are site specific and relate directly to the specific purposes for which each refuge
was established. The 16 refuges established/redesignated by ANILCA have different purposes. 


(k) Relationship of Proposed Regulations With Policy 




Comment:

 The intent, clarifications, and directions in the Service's cabin policy should be included in the regulations or
be adopted by reference. 


Response:

 The Service's cabin policy was widely distributed to the public and is available by request to all interested parties.
Some of the information in the policy is of a subjective nature which is not appropriate for regulations. All elements
of the Service's cabin policy that were determined to be appropriate as regulatory language were included in the regulations.



(l) Environmental Protection Requirements 




Comment:

 Language should be included that recognizes there are other Federal and State regulations governing environmental
compliance with activities associated with cabins (e.g., disposal of sewage and solid waste, drinking water, fuel
storage, etc.). 


Response:

 Standard conditions of all special use permits issued by the Service require the permittees to follow other applicable
State and Federal regulations. Therefore, the inclusion of regulatory language referencing other applicable regulations
is not necessary. 


(m) Late Application for Existing Cabins 




Comment:

 The requirement that claimants who fail to meet application deadlines for ``existing'' cabins (within one year from
the date these regulations are published) will only be allowed to apply for ``new'' cabins, no matter when the cabin
was built or first used should be deleted. 


Response:

 The regulations provide a one year application period following the effective date of the regulations. The Service
believes that the deadline is reasonable since regulations requiring the permits have been in place since 1981 and
considerable time and effort has been expended in notifying cabin occupants. 


(n) Other Related Structures 




Comment:

 The definition of ``other related structures'' should be revised to clarify that the term only includes those structures
in the vicinity and directly related to the operation of a cabin. The commenter also requested clarification that
temporary facilities may also occur under other regulations unrelated to the cabin regulations. 


Response:

 The Service believes that the context of the definition makes it clear that the other related structures only include
those associated with cabins. A statement that temporary facilities may be authorized under other regulations is
irrelevant to the cabin regulations. 
We appreciate these comments; however, as noted, the Service did not make substantive changes to reflect such requests
for revisions for the reasons stated above. 

The following is a section by section analysis of all substantive changes that the Service made in the final rule. 


Analysis of Changes Made to the Proposed Rule 


Section 36.33(a) Definitions 


A definition for 

commercial cabin

 was included in this section for clarification purposes. The definition of 

immediate family

 was revised in response to two public comments. The definition of 

guest

 was revised in response to one public comment. A definition for the term 

private recreational use

 was included in this section in response to one public comment. The definition of 

trespass cabin

 was deleted, in response to one comment which pointed out that the term was not used in the regulations other than as
a definition. 


Section 36.33(b) All cabins. 


A clarification was made that the regulations only apply on public lands within refuges and do not apply to temporary
facilities in response to one comment. Descriptions of the terms ``adequate notice'' for unclaimed cabins and ``administrative
process'' for permit revocation were included in response to one comment. 


Section 36.33(c) Existing cabins. 


A provision was included in paragraph (1) regarding the privileges and rights of existing cabin users in response
to one comment. The period for applications for permits for existing cabins which are not currently under a valid permit
was revised from 90 days to one year following the effective date of these regulations. This was done in response to
two comments. Vandalism was included in paragraph (5) as a cause to reconstruct existing cabins in response to one
comment.

Section 36.33(d) New cabins. 


The sentence, ``The activity must be traditional and customary for the applicant and the area, and the need for a cabin
must be clearly proven.'' was deleted from the language of paragraph 1 in response to two public comments. 


Section 36.33(e) Commercial cabins. 


Clients were added to the list of persons that can occupy commercial cabins in response to one comment. 



Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities 


The impact of these regulations on subsistence uses has been evaluated as required by Section 810 of ANILCA. Subsistence
use and access are expected to differ little from existing use. The regulations are consistent with the purposes and
intent of Section 810 and will result in no significant restrictions on subsistence activities. 

Properly regulated and managed cabin use is consistent with the purposes for which the various refuges in Alaska were
established. 


National Environmental Policy Act Compliance 


The promulgation of these cabin management regulations would generally maintain the status quo existing under the
current rules. Additionally, changes in environmental effects would be negligible. Therefore the implementation
of regulations relative to cabin management on refuges in Alaska is determined to be a categorical exclusion as detailed
in the Department of Interior Manual (516 DM 6, Appendix 1). An Environmental Action Memorandum documenting this
decision was signed on June 7, 1990. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 


The collections of information contained in Section 36.33 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget
for approval as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 

and assigned clearance number 1018-0077. 


Economic Effects 


This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. A review under
the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) has been done to determine whether the rulemaking would have a significant effect on a substantial number of small
entities, which include businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. This rulemaking would have
no significant effect on such entities as, in most cases, this merely continues pre-existing uses of public lands.



Technical Amendment 


Section 36.3 

Information Collection

 refers to  36.21(f) with respect to receiving a benefit. This section has previously been removed; therefore,
this rulemaking will revise Section 36.3 to remove all reference to that section. 


Primary Author 


Daryle Lons, Refuges and Wildlife, Alaska Regional Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Anchorage, Alaska, is
the primary author of this rulemaking document.

(a) 

Definitions.

 As used in this section, the term:

(1) 

Administrative cabin

 shall mean any cabin only used by refuge or other authorized personnel for the administration of the refuge.

(2) 

Cabin

 shall mean a small, usually single-story, three or more sided structure that is permanently and completely enclosed
with a roof and walls. The roof and walls are not fabric, cannot be easily disassembled, and are not removed seasonally.

(3) 

Commercial cabin

 shall mean any cabin which is used in association with a commercial operation including but not limited to commercial
fishing activities and recreational guiding services.

(4) 

Existing cabin

 shall mean any cabin situated on Federal lands before December 2, 1980. A cabin legally situated on lands that subsequently
become refuge will also be considered an ``existing'' cabin providing the applicant meets the appropriate application
deadlines.

(5) 

Family

 shall include the spouse (including what is known as a common-law relationship), children by birth or adoption, and
other blood relatives within the second degree of kindred.

(6) 

Guest

(8) 

New cabin

 shall mean any permitted cabin constructed on refuge lands after December 2, 1980. This may also include a cabin whose
claimant failed to meet the application deadline for existing cabins but is otherwise a permitted cabin.

(9) 

Other related structures

 shall mean those structures or devices essential to the activities for which the cabin special use permit is issued.
This includes but is not limited to outdoor toilets, food caches, storage sheds, and fish drying racks.

(10) 

Private recreational use

 shall mean a use associated with leisure activities, not including bona fide subsistence uses or authorized commercial
uses.

(11) 

Public use cabin

 shall mean a cabin owned and administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service and available for use by the public.

(b) 

All cabins.

 The regulations in this paragraph (b) shall apply to all cabins, claimants, occupants, and guests. The regulations
in this paragraph (b) do not apply to temporary facilities: any structure or man-made improvement which can readily
be completely dismantled and removed from the site when the period of authorized use is terminated.

(1) A special use permit is required to construct, use and/or occupy a cabin on Fish and Wildlife Service lands within
the refuge. The permit may also authorize the use of related structures and other necessary appurtenances.

(2) After adequate public notice has been given, unclaimed cabins become the property of the Federal Government.
Adequate public notice shall include: Posting notices of trespass on unclaimed cabins; publication of notices of
trespass in Anchorage and Fairbanks newspapers and in at least one local newspaper if available; and posting notices
of trespass at appropriate community post offices. A Government-owned cabin may be used for refuge administration,
used for emergency purposes by the public, permitted to another applicant, designated a public use cabin, or destroyed.
Disposal of excess cabins and structures will be according to regulations pursuant to Title 41, Chapter 114 of the
Code of Federal Regulations.

(3) Willful noncompliance with the conditions and stipulations of a special use permit shall be considered grounds
to invoke the administrative process leading to notice and hearing, and possible revocation of the permit. The refuge
manager will attempt to resolve problems of noncompliance with the permittee as soon as possible after the situation
becomes known. If this effort fails, the refuge manager shall provide written notice to the permittee within 30 days
of that date, informing the permittee of noncompliance, giving specific instructions for compliance and providing
appropriate time for the permittee to comply.

(4) No special use permit will be issued for the construction of a cabin for private recreational use or for the private
recreational use of an existing cabin.

(5) Guests are allowed to occupy a cabin only during the activity period identified on the special use permit. Guests
occupying a cabin during the absence of the permittee shall obtain a letter of authorization from the permittee. The
guest must have a copy of the letter in his/her possession. In commercial cabins, the permittee or another person listed
on the permit must be present when the cabin is occupied by guests or clients.

(6) A person whose permit application (new or renewal) for a cabin has been denied or whose cabin permit has been revoked
by the refuge manager may appeal to the Regional Director as described in  36.41(b).

(c) 

Existing cabins.

 In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (c) shall apply to all existing cabins,
claimants, occupants, and guests.

(1) Where a valid cabin permit or lease was in effect on December 2, 1980, or at the time the land was subsequently added
to the refuge, the refuge manager shall provide for the continuation of the permit or lease under the same conditions.
The new permit shall be nontransferable and renewable every five years unless the continuation would directly threaten
or significantly impair the purposes for which the refuge was established. The cabin and related structures are the
personal property of the claimant and can be removed by him/her upon non-renewal or revocation. The owner of a cabin
may sell his/her interest in the cabin to another person; however, the new owner does not automatically qualify for
a permit and must apply for a new one.

(2) To obtain a special use permit for a cabin that was not under permit or lease before December 2, 1980, or at the time
the land was subsequently added to the refuge, a claimant should submit to the refuge manager an application that includes
the following:

(i) Reasonable proof of possessory interest or right to occupy the cabin as shown by affidavit, bill of sale, or other
document.

(ii) Date of construction or acquisition.

(iii) A sketch or photograph that accurately depicts the cabin and related structures.

(iv) The dimensions of the cabin and related structures.

(v) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the geographic location of the cabin and related structures.

(vi) The claimant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal property from the cabin and related structures within
one year from receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice.

(vii) The claimant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal interest in the real property on which the cabin and related
structures are located.

(viii) A list of family members residing with the claimant in the cabin being applied for. It need only include those
immediate family members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and occupancy upon the original claimant's
death (this is not applicable to cabins used for commercial purposes).

(3) Applications for permits for existing cabins, which are not currently under valid permits, will only be accepted
for a period of one year following the effective date of these regulations. However, cabins that were legally located
on lands that subsequently become refuge will also be considered ``existing'' cabins. The owners will have two years
following the date the lands become refuge to apply for a permit. Following those dates, all applications for cabins
will be for ``new'' cabins only, no matter when the cabin was built or first used. If ownership is not established within
three years after the land becomes refuge, the cabin may be considered abandoned, and it will become Federal property
in accordance with Federal regulations.

(4) The occupancy of a noncommercial cabin is limited to the permittee and his/her family, bona fide partners, and
guests.

(5) Major modification or rehabilitation of an existing cabin must be approved by the refuge manager before construction
begins. The modifications will be done by the permittee or designated agent and will remain the property of the permittee.
Major additions (e.g., larger than the original cabin) may fall under the ownership provisions for new cabins. Although
cabins destroyed by accidents, vandalism or natural causes may be reconstructed, they must be approved by the refuge
manager before construction and must meet the construction guidelines for new cabins, even though remaining the
property of the claimant.

(d) 

New cabins.

 In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (d) shall apply to all new cabins, claimants,
occupants, and guests.

(1) A nontransferable, five year special use permit shall only be issued upon a determination that the proposed construction,
use and maintenance of the cabin is compatible with refuge purposes and that the cabin use is either directly related
to refuge administration or is needed for continuation of an ongoing activity or use otherwise allowed within the
refuge where the applicant lacks a reasonable off-refuge site. In addition, these activities must have historically
been supported by the construction and use of cabins in the geographic area. In general, new cabin permits will be given
only to local residents to pursue a legitimate subsistence activity. In determining whether to permit the construction,
use, and occupancy of cabins or other structures, the refuge manager shall be guided by factors such as other public
uses, public health and safety, environmental and resource protection, research activities, protection of historic
or scientific values, subsistence uses, endangered or threatened species conservation and other management considerations
necessary to ensure that the activities authorized pursuant to a permit are compatible with the purposes for which
the refuge was established.

(2) To obtain a special use permit for a new cabin, an applicant should submit to the refuge manager an application that
includes the following:

(i) A sketch that accurately depicts the proposed cabin and related structures.

(ii) The dimensions of the proposed cabin and related structures.

(iii) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the geographic location of the proposed cabin and related
structures.

(iv) The applicant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal property from the cabin and related structures within
one year from receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice.

(v) The applicant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal interest in the cabin and related structures or in the
real property on which the cabin and related structures are located.

(vi) A list of family members residing with the applicant in the cabin being applied for. It need only include those
immediate family members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and occupancy upon the original claimant's
death.

(3) The permitting instrument shall be a nontransferable renewable five year special use permit. It shall be renewed
every five years (upon request) until the death of the original claimant's last immediate family member unless the
special use permit has been revoked or the cabin has been abandoned.

(4) No new cabins will be constructed in designated wilderness areas unless they are built specifically for the administration
of the area, for public safety, or for trapping where trapping has been a traditional and customary use.

(5) New trapping cabins in wilderness will be available for public use to ensure public health and safety.

(6) The occupancy of a noncommercial cabin is limited to the permittee, and his/her family, bona fide partners, and
guests.

(e) 

Commercial cabins. 

In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (e) shall apply to all commercial cabins,
permittees, clients, guests, and occupants.

(1) A special use permit is required for all cabins used for commercial purposes. Refuge managers may also issue special
use permits that authorize additional commercial use of an existing cabin used for guiding, etc. The use of a new cabin
shall be limited to the type of use specified in the original permit. The refuge manager may permit the use of an existing
cabin on non-wilderness refuge lands for the exercise of valid commercial fishing rights. Such a permit may be denied
if, after conducting a public hearing in the affected locality, it is found that the use is inconsistent with refuge
purposes and is a significant expansion of commercial fishing activities within the unit beyond 1979 levels.

(2) When the commercial fishing or guiding rights associated with a permittee's existing cabin are acquired by a new
party, the privilege of using the cabin cannot be sold and the new party does not necessarily qualify for a cabin permit.
He/she must apply for a permit and meet the criteria described in this paragraph (e) before issuance of a special use
permit by the refuge manager. He/she may not occupy the cabin before issuance of a permit.

(3) No new commercial cabins will be permitted in wilderness areas.

(4) Commercial cabins may be occupied only by persons legitimately involved in the commercial enterprise, assistants,
employees, their families, guests and clients and only during the time that the authorized activity is occurring.
The names of those individuals, excluding guests and clients, will be listed on the permit. The permittee or another
individual listed on the permit must be present when the cabin is occupied.

(5) Special use permits for commercial cabins may be renewed annually in conjunction with the special use permit renewal
for the commercial activity itself. The cabin permit may be issued for periods of up to five years and is a separate permit
from one issued for the commercial activity.

(f) 

Administrative and government-owned public use cabins. 

In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (f) apply to all administrative and
government-owned cabins.

(1) The refuge manager can designate those cabins not under permit as administrative cabins to be used for official
government business. Administrative cabins may be used by the public during life-threatening emergencies. On a
case-by-case basis, they may also be designated as public use cabins when not needed for government purposes. In such
cases, the refuge manager must inform the public and post dates or seasons when the cabins are available.

(2) The refuge manager may designate government-owned cabins as public use cabins. They are only intended for short-term
public recreational use and occupancy. The refuge manager may develop an allocation system for managing public use
cabins for short-term recreational use. No existing public use cabins shall be removed or new public use cabins constructed
within wilderness areas designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 or subsequently
designated wilderness areas until the Secretary of the Interior notifies the House Committee on Interior and Insular
Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

 Interim rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule sets forth the requirements and procedures for awarding Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
funds to Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages. 




Following issuance of a proposed rule on June 21, 1991, the Department issued an interim rule on April 7, 1992, regarding
the criteria for awarding CDBG funding to Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages. The Department has decided to
issue another interim rule to address the comments received on the April 7, 1992 interim rule and to allow the public
to see how the rule works in conjunction with the latest Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA). This interim rule will
enable Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages to meet with representatives of the HUD Office of Native American
Programs (ONAP) field offices to make suggestions for modification of the regulation before it is issued in final
form.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Paperwork Reduction Act 




The information collection requirements contained in this interim rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB control number 2506-0043.





Background 




The authority for the CDBG program for Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages was previously with the Office of
Community Planning and Development; therefore, all previous issuances refer to it under 24 CFR part 571. However,
that authority was transferred recently to the Office of Public and Indian Housing. Therefore, this interim rule
is placed in 24 CFR part 953, and part 571 is removed. 


Section 105 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-235) (``Reform
Act''), as amended by the National Affordable Housing Act (``NAHA''), amended Title I of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1974 (``1974 Act''), by transferring the authority for making grants to Indian Tribes from the
section 107 discretionary fund to the allocation and distribution of funds provisions of Section 106 of the 1974 Act.
Under section 106, as so amended, one percent of the title I appropriation, excluding the amounts appropriated for
use under section 107, is allocated for grants to Indian Tribes. The allocated amount is to be distributed to Indian
Tribes/Villages on a competitive basis in accordance with selection criteria ``contained in a regulation promulgated
by the Secretary after notice and public comment.'' The Department issued the proposed rule on June 21, 1991, at 56
FR 28666, to comply with the requirement for publication for comment. The Department issued an interim rule, April
7, 1992, at 57 FR 11832, to give the public an additional opportunity to comment on the interim rule after it has been
in effect for one round of competition. This revised interim rule is issued to address the comments and will allow the
public to see how the interim rule works in conjunction with the latest NOFA. 



Section 102 of the Reform Act requires the Secretary to publish in the 

Federal Register

 a NOFA regarding funding that is available. In addition to announcing the availability of funds, the NOFA will further
define application procedures and selection criteria.

Section 953.602 describes applicable relocation and real property acquisition policies, including those implementing
the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). Under the government-wide
URA rule at 49 CFR Part 24, any person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organizations, or farm) displaced
on or after April 2, 1989 as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation or demolition for a project assisted under
this part is entitled to URA relocation assistance. The acquisition of real property for a project assisted under
this part is also subject to the URA. The URA policies are described in HUD Handbook 1378, Tenant Assistance, Relocation
and Real Property Acquisition. 


Public Comments 




The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received 18 individual comments from 9 sources on the interim
rule published on April 7, 1992. HUD received 6 letters from tribes, and 3 from regional and private organizations.
General comments are discussed below and are followed by specific comments. The specific comments and the Department's
responses are discussed under ``Specific Comments,'' according to the section where they appear in the interim regulation.





General Comments 



Numerous comments were received requesting more tribal involvement in the development of the final rule and NOFA.
Also questioned was the need for a national NOFA since the program had operated with a regional competition in the past.



The passage of two statutes, NAHA and the Reform Act, created the need for a national NOFA and revised rule. These statutes
changed the Indian Community Development Block (ICDBG) program selection process. The NAHA required the Secretary
of HUD to promulgate a regulation containing selection criteria used to award funds in competitive programs. The
Reform Act restricts the disclosure of information about HUD programs and discretionary funds. The current interim
ICDBG rule contained changes reflecting the NAHA and Reform Act requirements. As a result of the written comments
received and the consultation sessions held relative to this interim rule, a second interim rule is being published
to continue the process of refining and developing a final rule. HUD is committed to involving the public in this process
to the extent practicable. In order to publish a fair and coherent NOFA, HUD Headquarters consulted extensively with
HUD ONAP field offices throughout the NOFA's development. Since the ONAP field offices are in frequent contact with
the tribes/villages within their jurisdiction, they were able to provide Headquarters with information on how various
NOFA provisions would be received by ICDBG applicants. Following the publication of the NOFA and regulation and after
the selection process has been completed, HUD field staff will hold public meetings to get suggestions on how to improve
the NOFA. 



To facilitate the Department's ability to more readily respond to the consultation process, changes to the rating
criteria have been made in this Interim Rule. Sections 953.303, 953.304, and 953.305 have been modified to permit
a wider range of changes to the rating criteria in the NOFA without changing the regulation. The separate rating criteria
has been eliminated for Public Services activities at  953.306. Eligible Public Service activities must still
meet the submission criteria set out in this part. 



Specific Comments 




Section 953.4 Definitions 






Comment: 

One comment was received concerning the requirement that the applicant must, when reporting income levels to HUD,
include and identify the distribution of tribal or village income to families, households or individuals in the definition
of low and moderate income beneficiary. The commenter pointed out the existence of a Federal statute that might preclude
the use of portions of such payments from being considered income when determining eligibility for federal or federally
assisted programs. 




Response: 

It is recognized that such exclusions may exist and the statutory mandates will be followed where appropriate. Their
existence would not necessarily indicate the need for additional language identifying the exclusions. These claimed
exclusions would be identified by the applicant when reporting income to HUD when complying with this section of the
interim rule. 




Section 953.5 Eligible Applicants 





Comment: 

One comment was received noting that Indians residing in urban areas and metropolitan cities and not on reservations
do not receive adequate service or funding from IHS and no service from BIA. The commenter suggested that if HUD recognized
these groups it would be beneficial in gaining acceptance with other agencies such as IHS and BIA. 




Response: 

The Department does not have legislative authority to provide Federal recognition to Indian Tribes or Alaskan Native
Villages, but deals with those tribes and villages recognized by the Treasury Department and the Bureau of Indian
Affairs as stipulated in this section. The Indian groups residing in urban areas and metropolitan cities and not on
reservations can receive, to the extent such persons are otherwise eligible as low income persons, benefits under
the regular CDBG programs serving the area where they reside.

<PARENT> FR940727-0-00028 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The commenter also indicated the desire to establish an entitlement program for the Indians. This proposal has been
considered but cannot be adopted without amendments to existing legislation. For these reasons there are no changes
proposed in this section of the interim rule. 



Section 953.6 Technical Assistance 





Comment: 

Four commenters requested that HUD give the field offices latitude in providing more technical assistance on responding
to the NOFA and the submission requirements than presently permitted. Several felt that the tribes/villages are
penalized for not having the sophistication needed to prepare successful applications. One commenter felt that
the lack of technical assistance resulted in some tribes/villages not submitting applications for activities they
felt were most appropriate to address their needs because of the uncertainty of their eligibility or rating. The majority
of the commenters felt that expanded technical assistance was necessary for the tribes/villages to successfully
compete in the program. 



Response: 

The technical assistance provisions of the Reform Act limit the direct assistance that may be provided by the Department.
New regulations providing in-depth guidance have been issued by the Department and are expected to more clearly define
the technical assistance role of the Field staff. Technical Assistance during the application process will be provided
to the greatest extent allowed by the Reform Act. 



Section 953.100 Grant Ceilings 





Comment: 

One commenter felt that the method of setting grant ceilings was not equitable because the established limits in their
area would permit a tribe one fourth their size to apply for the same amount of grant funds as they could. The commenter
proposed a revision to the method currently utilized by the field office that would increase the grant amounts they
could apply for each funding cycle. 



Response: 

Paragraph (b)(1) of this section gives the Assistant Secretary final authority to determine grant ceilings for each
field office. Field offices recommend the ceilings for their jurisdiction. The reason for this process is to ensure
that grant ceilings are appropriate on a national level. The Department has determined that the present procedure
for establishing grant ceilings is the most appropriate method of establishing these limits and proposes no changes
to this section. 



Section 953.101 Regional Allocation of Funds 





Comment: 

Paragraph (c) of this section states that population data will be used to allocate funds. Commenters asked which data
sources HUD would use to count native populations. 



Response: 

HUD will use Census data. HUD recognizes that Census data on Indian and Alaskan native populations may be incomplete
or inaccurate. However, these are the only data that are consistently available, and they are reasonably representative
when aggregated by region. HUD encourages tribes and villages to use their own survey or other locally collected data
in their project applications, after consulting with the ONAP on appropriate data collection methods, if they believe
these to be more reliable. 



Section 953.102 Recaptures 





Comment: 

One commenter suggested that in cases where recaptured funds became available and are offered to a standby applicant
to fund a previously rated and ranked activity, the applicant should be funded on the new cost estimate and not the amount
applied for initially. 



Response: 

In all cases where recaptured funds are reallocated to fund a standby application, the Department must insure the
criteria contained in the governing NOFA are met. If the amounts available are not sufficient to fund the application
as proposed, the next highest ranked application would be considered for funding. 



Section 953.300 Application Requirements 





Comment: 

A comment was received that recommended that an applicant be allowed to submit its application with an unlimited number
of projects but restrict the number approved to the grant limits established in the NOFA. 



Response: 

This recommendation was considered but not included in the revisions to the interim rule. The current application
process is intended to promote a competition where all applicants have an equal chance for funding and not one that
depends upon an applicant's ability to produce large numbers of projects that could be included in their application.
The present application process leaves the decisions on the type of project to be submitted with the applicant and
does not pass it on to HUD. 



Comment: 

One commenter also expressed a concern about what they perceived as a short amount of time to submit applications after
publication of the NOFA. 



Response: 

The regulation gives applicants 

at least 

30 days to submit their applications to the field office. This minimum level was established so that it is clear that
under any circumstance an applicant would have at least this amount of time to prepare an application. The NOFA will
establish the time in which the applicants have to prepare and submit their applications. The application submission
deadline will continue to be established by Headquarters, since the NOFA is issued on a national basis. 

In an effort to streamline this regulation, portions of  953.300, Application requirements, will be moved
to the NOFA. Since this information is directly related to the competitive process set out in the NOFA, it is felt that
it will be more accessible to potential applicants in this location. 



Section 953.301 Screening and Review of Applications 





Comment: 

One comment was received indicating that the 14-day cure period was inadequate and should be increased to 20 days from
date of receipt of the field office request. 



Response: 

This process allows applicants to submit only that information requested by the field office to help clarify the application.
HUD's regulations at 24 CFR 4.105(b)(3) allow authorized employees, during the selection process, to contact applicants
to seek clarification of the terms of an applicant's submission. HUD policy requires each NOFA to include a cure period
for technical deficiencies of at least 14 calendar days. Any deficiency that can be cured (e.g., the submission of
a missing certification) cannot affect the rating of the application in either a positive or negative way and should
by its nature be readily correctable within the present 14 day period. 

Portions of  953.301, Screening and review of applications, have been moved from this Interim Rule and will
be placed in the NOFA. This change will provide for more flexibility in meeting the needs of the program as it continues
to evolve and makes the requirements readily available to the applicant.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940727-0-00149 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-0-00028 </PARENT>

Comment: 

One commenter suggested that a waiver of the threshold requirement regarding performance deficiencies described
at 
 953.302(a)(2)(ii)(A) be permitted. 



Response: 

The subject provision appears to contain sufficient flexibility as written. Section 953.7 sets forth the conditions
where a waiver of this interim rule would be permissible. A specific waiver provision for threshold requirements
in the interim rule does not seem warranted. 



Section 953.303 Housing Rating Category 





Comment: 

The first paragraph of this section states that the applicant shall provide assistance only to tenants/homeowners
whose payments are current, or who are current in a repayment agreement with HUD. One commenter noted the difficulty
in obtaining current payment information. 



Response: 

 The Department expects the applicant to obtain the most recent payment information it can from the Indian Housing
Authority (IHA). Note that the field office may grant exceptions to this requirement on a case-by-case basis. 



Section 953.304 Community Facilities 





Comment: 

Two commenters proposed that the regulations include museums, ecomuseums, cultural centers and archeological
sites as appropriate, eligible community facilities. 



Response: 

 These are eligible activities under the current regulations. 



Comment: 

One commenter requested a reconsideration of the portions of this section that relate to the definition of ``neediest
segment of the population'' in the rating factors for community buildings. This rating factor required that more
than 80% of the beneficiaries be very low income to receive the maximum points. Fifty-one to 79.9 percent of the beneficiaries
must be very low income to receive moderate points. 



Response: 

 This section of the regulation has been revised to remove this definition of ``neediest segment of the population''.




Section 953.305 Economic Development Rating Category 





Comment: 

One commenter suggested that the regulation is unfair in providing special opportunities for federally assisted
housing residents. 



Response: 

 While this specific language has been removed from the regulation, it in no way diminishes HUD commitment to empower
the poor residing in federally assisted housing. This factor remains in the NOFA to encourage applicants to provide
opportunities for residents of federally assisted housing to improve their economic situation while possibly improving
their units. 



Comment: 

Two commenters stated that HUD should specifically allow tribes to apply for offices and other buildings that are
not eligible as community facilities as economic development activities. While this activity would not appear to
be prohibited by the regulations, there is not sufficient information provided to make a determination of eligibility.




Response: 

 Because of the wide range of activities that are potentially eligible under this program, it is not possible to list
them all in this interim rule. The ONAP field office should be provided with specific information so that a determination
can be made.

Section 953.307 Funding Process 





Comment: 

One commenter questioned the need to re-submit the data listed at  953.307(b)(1) if the data had been submitted
in the application and was still valid. 



Response: 

Language has been added to make the pre-award process optional if HUD has determined that no additional data is needed
or that current data does not need updating. 



Comment: 

Section 953.307(b)(2) of the current regulation gives successful applicants at least 30 days to provide supporting
documentation at the request of the field office, prior to execution of the grant agreement. One commenter suggested
expanding the 30-day period because of the difficulty of preparing and submitting such information to make the application
more competitive within the 30-day time period. 



Response: 

Since the data requested would not be intended to improve the competitive position of the application, but rather
to support the previously provided information, it was determined that increasing the 30 days would not be appropriate.




Other Changes Made By This Interim Rule 



Subpart E_Imminent Threat Grants 



Section 953.403, Availability of Funds, has been revised to allow the Office of Native American Programs to retain
up to five percent of the funds made available by this part at the national level. The NOFA will specify the amount of
Imminent Threat funds to be retained during each funding cycle. This change is intended to insure the availability
of imminent threat funding throughout the fiscal year. 



Section 953.505 Program Income 



The program income language in  570.504, previously incorporated by reference, has been reproduced in  953.505
of these regulations. This will hopefully make the ICDBG Regulation more user friendly by placing all program income
requirements in one location. 



Section 953.606 Conflict of Interest 



Section 953.606 (e) has been modified to provide for a public disclosure of the nature of the assistance to be provided
and the basis of the selection of persons to be assisted for housing rehabilitation or new housing. Evidence of the
disclosure must be submitted with the application. 



Other Matters
 


Justification for Interim Rule 



The Department has decided to issue another interim rule to address the comments received on the April 7, 1992 interim
rule and to allow the public to see how the rule works in conjunction with the latest Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA).
This interim rule will enable Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages to meet with representatives of the HUD Office
of Native American Programs (ONAP) field offices to make suggestions for modification of the regulation before it
is issued in final form. 

The Department has adopted a policy of setting a date for expiration of an interim rule unless a final rule is published
before that date. This ``sunset'' provision appears in  953.1 of the interim rule and provides that the rule
will expire on a date 18 months from the date of publication. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office
of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. 



Regulatory Flexibility 



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this interim rule
before publication and by approving it certifies that this interim rule does not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The interim rule establishes criteria for funding eligible recipients
among Indian Tribes/Villages and has no impact on small entities. 



Semiannual Agenda 



This interim rule was listed as Item No. 1690 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April
25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20470) pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism,

 has determined that the policies contained in this interim rule would not have substantial direct effects on States
or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the interim rule is not subject
to review under the Order. While the interim rule has some direct effects on States and political subdivisions, those
effects are limited to direct implementation of instructions contained in statutes governing the grant program.
Given the lack of discretion in the Department to refrain from implementing these statutory instructions, further
analysis of federalism concerns would serve no useful purpose. 



Executive Order 12606, The Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family,

 has determined that this interim rule would not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance,
and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 



The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.223.

Subpart A_General Provisions 


 953.1 

Applicability and scope. 



The policies and procedures described in this part apply only to grants to eligible Indian Tribes and Alaskan native
villages under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program for Indian Tribes and Alaskan native villages.




Expiration of interim rule. 

This interim rule will expire on April 1, 1996. 



 953.2 

Program objectives. 



The primary objective of the Indian CDBG (ICDBG) Program and of the community development program of each grantee
covered under this Act is the development of viable Indian and Alaskan native communities, including decent housing,
a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low- and moderate-income.
The Federal assistance provided in this part is not to be used to reduce substantially the amount of local financial
support for community development activities below the level of such support prior to the availability of this assistance.




 953.3 

Nature of program. 



The ICDBG Program is competitive in nature. Therefore, selection of eligible applicants for funds will reflect consideration
of the relative adequacy of applications in addressing locally determined need. Applicants for funding must have
the administrative capacity to undertake the community development activities proposed, including the systems
of internal control necessary to administer these activities effectively without fraud, waste, or mismanagement.




 953.4

(b) To inform eligible applicants of changes in the program. 



 953.7 

Waivers. 



The Secretary may waive any requirement of this part not required by law whenever it is determined that undue hardship
will result from applying the requirement, and where application of the requirement would adversely affect the purposes
of the Act. 



Subpart B_Allocation of Funds 



 953.100 

General. 



(a) 

Types of grants

. Two types of grants are available under the Indian CDBG Program. 

(1) 

Single purpose grants 

provide funds for one or more single purpose projects consisting of an activity or set of activities designed to meet
a specific community development need. This type of grant is awarded through competition with other single purpose
projects. 

(2) 

Imminent threat grants

 alleviate an imminent threat to public health or safety that requires immediate resolution. This type of grant is
awarded only after a field office determines that such conditions exist and if funds are available for such grants.


(b) 

Size of grants

_(1) 

Ceilings

. Each field office may recommend grant ceilings for single purpose grant applications. Field offices have the option
of recommending different ceilings for different size tribes/villages (e.g. tribes 5,000+ will have one ceiling
and tribes with less than 5,000 will have a smaller ceiling.) Single purpose grant ceilings for each field office shall
be established in the NOFA. 

(2) 

Individual grant amounts

. In determining appropriate grant amounts to be awarded, the field office may take into account the size of the applicant,
the level of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity, the number of persons
to be served, the amount of funds required to achieve project objectives and the administrative capacity of the applicant
to complete the activities in a timely manner. 



 953.101 

Field Office allocation of funds. 



(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, funds will be allocated to the field offices responsible for
the program on the following basis: 

(1) Each field office will be allocated $1,000,000 as a base amount, to which will be added a formula share of the balance
of the Indian CDBG Program funds, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 

(2) The amount remaining after the base amount is allocated will be allocated to each field office based on the most
recent data available from reliable sources referable to the same point or period in time, as follows: 

(i) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each field office's share of the total eligible Indian
population; 

(ii) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each field office's share of the total extent of poverty
among the eligible Indian population; and 

(iii) Twenty percent (20%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each field office's share of the total extent of
overcrowded housing among the eligible Indian population. 

(b) If funds are set aside by statute for a specific purpose in any fiscal year, the formula in paragraph (a) of this section
will apply unless otherwise specified in the law, or unless it is determined that the formula is inappropriate to accomplish
the purpose, in which case the Secretary may establish other criteria to determine an allocation formula for distributing
funds to the field offices. 

(c) Data used for the allocation of funds will be based upon the Indian population of those Tribes and villages that
are determined to be eligible ninety (90) days before the beginning of each fiscal year. 



 953.102 

Recaptures. 



(a) After the rating and ranking process is completed, use of funds that the field office obtains from recapture of
obligated funds from grantees that fail to meet statutory or regulatory requirements, or return of unneeded funds,
will be determined by the Assistant Secretary on a case-by-case basis. The funds may be used to fund the highest ranking
unfunded project, an imminent threat, or other uses as determined by the Assistant Secretary. 

(b) Undistributed funds (funds that are unobligated at the conclusion of the rating and ranking process) will be treated
the same as recaptured funds. 

(c) Recaptured and undistributed funds will remain with the field office that they came from unless the Assistant
Secretary determines there is an overriding reason to redistribute the funds outside of the field office's jurisdiction.




Subpart C_Eligible Activities 



 953.200 

General. 



The eligibility requirements of part 570, subpart C of this title_Eligible Activities_apply to grants under this
part, except for those provisions which are specifically stated as applying only to the Entitlement Cities or Small
Cities_HUD administered programs, and with the modifications stated in this subpart. 



 953.201 

Primary and national objectives. 



(a) Not less than 70 percent of the funds of each single purpose grant must be used for activities that benefit low- and
moderate-income persons under the criteria set forth in  570.208(a) of this title. In determining the percentage
of funds used for such activities, the provisions of  570.200(a)(3)(i), (iv), and (v) of this title shall apply.
The requirements of this paragraph (a) do not apply to imminent threat grants funded under Subpart E of this part. 

(b) In addition to the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, each activity must meet one of the national objectives
pursuant to the criteria set forth in  570.208 of this title. 



 953.202 

Nonprofit organizations. 



Tribal-based nonprofit organizations replace neighborhood-based nonprofit organizations under  570.204(c)(1)
of this title. A Tribal-based nonprofit organization is an association or corporation duly organized to promote
and undertake community development activities on a not-for-profit basis within an identified service area.

(a) For purposes of this part, technical assistance costs associated with developing the capacity to undertake a
specific funded program activity are not considered administrative costs. Therefore, these costs are not included
in the twenty percent limitation on planning and administration stated in part 570, subpart C of this title. 

(b) Technical assistance costs cannot exceed ten percent of the total grant award. As used in this part, ``technical
assistance'' means the transfer of skills and knowledge in planning, developing, and administering the CDBG program
to eligible Indian CDBG recipients who need them in order to undertake a specific funded program activity. 



Subpart D_Single Purpose Grant Application and Selection Process 



 953.300 

Application requirements. 



(a) 

Application information

. Headquarters shall publish a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) in the 

Federal Register

 not less than 30 days before the deadline(s) for application submission. The NOFA will provide information relating
to the date and time for application submission, the form and content requirements of the application, specific information
regarding the rating and ranking criteria to be utilized, and any other information pertinent to the application
process. 

(b) 

Costs incurred by applicant

. Notwithstanding any provision in Part 570 of this title, HUD will not reimburse or recognize any costs incurred before
submission of the single purpose grant application to HUD. 

(c) HUD will not normally reimburse or recognize costs incurred before HUD approval of the application for funding.
However, under unusual circumstances, the field office may consider and approve written requests to recognize and
reimburse costs incurred after submission of the application where failure to do so would impose undue hardship on
the applicant. Such authorization will be made only before the costs are incurred and where the requirements for reimbursement
have been met in accordance with 24 CFR 58.22 and with the understanding that HUD has no obligation whatsoever to approve
the application or to reimburse the applicant should the application be disapproved. 



 953.301 

Screening and review of applications. 



Each Field Office will screen and review applications for single purpose grants in accordance with the requirements
specified in the annual NOFA.

(B) Reserved. 

(ii) If in the judgment of the field office, available data indicate that the proposed project(s) costs are unreasonable,
is inappropriate for the intended use, or is not usable generally within two years, the field office shall determine
that the applicant has not met this threshold requirement, and shall reject such project(s) from further consideration.


(2) 

Capacity and performance

. The applicant has the capacity to undertake the proposed program. Additionally, applicants that previously have
participated in the Indian CDBG Program must have performed adequately or, in cases of previously documented deficient
performance, the applicant must have taken appropriate corrective action to improve its performance. 

(i) 

Capacity

. The applicant possesses, or will acquire, the managerial, technical, or administrative staff necessary to carry
out the proposed projects. If the field office determines that the applicant does not have or cannot obtain the capacity
to undertake the project(s), such project(s) will be rejected from further consideration. 

(ii) 

Performance

_(A) 

Community development

. Performance determinations are made through the field office's normal monitoring process. Applicants that have
been advised in writing of negative findings on previous grants, for which a schedule of corrective actions has been
established, will not be considered for funding if they are behind schedule as of the deadline date for filing applications.


(B) 

Housing assistance

. The applicant must not have been found taking actions to impede the provision or operation of assisted housing for
the low- and moderate-income members of the Tribe or Village. If inadequate performance is found, and the applicant
has been notified in writing, they may be rejected from further consideration. Performance determinations are made
through the field office's normal monitoring process. 

(C) 

Audits

. An applicant that has an outstanding ICDBG obligation to HUD that is in arrears, or one that has not agreed to a repayment
schedule, will be disqualified from the current and subsequent competitions until the obligations are current.
An applicant whose response to an audit finding is overdue or unsatisfactory will be disqualified from the current
and subsequent competitions until the applicant has taken final action necessary to close the audit finding(s).
The field office administrator may provide exceptions to this disqualification requirement in cases where the applicant
has made a good faith effort to clear non-monetary audit findings. In no instance, however, shall an exception be provided
when funds are due HUD, unless a satisfactory arrangement for repayment of the debt has been made, and payments are
current.

 953.503 

Indian preference requirements.


(a) 

Applicability. 

HUD has determined that grants under this part are subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education
Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e(b)), which requires that, to the greatest extent feasible:
(1) Preference and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and
(2) Preference in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned
economic enterprises.
(b) 

Definitions. 

Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises include both of the following:
(1) Any economic enterprise as defined in section 3(e) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-262); that
is, ``any Indian-owned commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of
profit provided that such Indian ownership and control shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise'';
and
(2) Any ``Tribal organizations'' as defined in section 4(c) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance
Act (Pub. L. 93-638); that is, ``the recognized governing body of any Indian Tribe; any legally established
organization of Indians which is controlled, sanctioned or chartered by such governing body or which is democratically
elected by the adult members of the Indian community to be served by such organizations and which includes the maximum
participation of Indians in all phases of its activities.''
(c) 

Preference in administration of grant. 

To the greatest extent feasible, preference and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the
administration of grants awarded under this part shall be given to Indians and Alaskan natives.
(d) 

Preference in contracting. 

To the greatest extent feasible, grantees shall give preference in the award of contracts for projects funded under
this part to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.
(1) Each grantee shall:
(i) Advertise for bids or proposals limited to qualified Indian organizations and Indian-owned enterprises; or
(ii) Use a two-stage preference procedure, as follows:
(A) 

Stage 1. 

Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid
announcement limited to Indian-owned firms.
(B) 

Stage 2. 

If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals
limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or
(iii) Develop, subject to HUD field office one-time approval, the grantee's own method of providing preference.
(2) If the grantee selects a method of providing preference that results in fewer than two responsible qualified organizations
or enterprises submitting a statement of intent, a bid or a proposal to perform the contract at a reasonable cost, then
the grantee shall:
(i) Re-bid the contract, using any of the methods described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
(ii) Re-bid the contract without limiting the advertisement for bids or proposals to Indian organizations and Indian-owned
economic enterprises; or
(iii) If one approvable bid is received, request field office review and approval of the proposed contract and related
procurement documents, in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36, in order to award the contract to the single bidder.
(3) Procurements that are within the dollar limitations established for small purchases under 24 CFR 85.36 need not
follow the formal bid procedures of paragraph (d) of this section, since these procurements are governed by the small
purchase procedures of 24 CFR 85.36. However, a grantee's small purchase procurement shall, to the greatest extent
feasible, provide Indian preference in the award of contracts.
(4) All preferences shall be publicly announced in the advertisement and bidding solicitation and the bidding documents.
(5) A grantee, at its discretion, may require information of prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian
organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises; however, this information need not be submitted to HUD. Grantees
may require prospective contractors to include the following information prior to submitting a bid or proposal,
or at the time of submission:
(i) Evidence showing fully the extent of Indian ownership, control, and interest;
(ii) Evidence of structure, management and financing affecting the Indian character of the enterprise, including
major subcontracts and purchase agreements; materials or equipment supply arrangements; and management salary
or profit-sharing arrangements; and evidence showing the effect of these on the extent of Indian ownership and interest;
and
(iii) Evidence sufficient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the grantee that the prospective contractor has
the technical, administrative, and financial capability to perform contract work of the size and type involved.
(6) The grantee shall incorporate the following clause (referred to as the Section 7(b) clause) in each contract awarded
in connection with a project funded under this part:
(i) The work to be performed under this contract is on a project subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination
and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e(b)) (Indian Act). Section 7(b) requires that to the greatest extent
feasible:
(A) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and
(B) Preferences in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned
economic enterprises.
(ii) The parties to this contract shall comply with the provisions of Section 7(b) of the Indian Act.

the award of any subcontracts to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and preferences and
opportunities for training and employment to Indians and Alaskan natives. 
(iv) The contractor shall include this Section 7(b) clause in every subcontract in connection with the project, and
shall, at the direction of the grantee, take appropriate action pursuant to the subcontract upon a finding by the grantee
or HUD that the subcontractor has violated the Section 7(b) clause of the Indian Act. 
(e) 

Additional Indian preference requirements. 

A grantee may, with prior HUD approval, provide for additional Indian preference requirements as conditions for
the award of, or in the terms of, any contract in connection with a project funded under this part. The additional Indian
preference requirements shall be consistent with the objectives of the Section 7(b) clause of the Indian Act and shall
not result in a significantly higher cost or greater risk of non-performance or longer period of performance. The
additional Indian preference requirements permitted by this part do not include the imposition of geographic preferences
or restrictions to the procurement process. 


 953.504 

Grant closeout procedure. 


Within 90 days of the date that HUD determines the grant has met the criteria for closeout, the grantee shall submit
to HUD a completed Financial Status Report (SF-269). In addition, the requirements of  570.509 of this
title, Grant closeout procedures, apply to the ICDBG program where applicable. 




(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB Control No. 2506-0043.) 


 953.505 

Program Income. 


(a) Disposition of program income received by recipients. 


(1) Program income received before grant closeout may be retained by the recipient if the income is treated as additional
CDBG funds subject to all applicable requirements governing the use of CDBG funds. 
(2) If the recipient chooses to retain program income, that income shall affect withdrawals of grant funds from the
U.S. Treasury as follows: 
(i) Program income in the form of repayments to, or interest earned on, a revolving fund shall be substantially disbursed
from the fund before additional cash withdrawals are made from the U.S. Treasury for the same activity. (This rule
does not prevent a lump sum disbursement to finance the rehabilitation of privately owned properties as provided
for in  570.513 of this title.) 
(ii) Substantially all other program income shall be disbursed for eligible activities before additional cash withdrawals
are made from the U.S. Treasury. 
(3) Program income on hand at the time of closeout shall continue to be subject to the eligibility requirements in subpart
C of this part and all other applicable provisions of this part until it is expended. 
(4) Unless otherwise provided in any grant closeout agreement, and subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)
of this section, income received after closeout shall not be governed by the provisions of this part, except that,
if at the time of closeout the recipient has another ongoing CDBG grant received directly from HUD, funds received
after closeout shall be treated as program income of the ongoing grant program. 
(5) If the recipient does not have another ongoing grant received directly from HUD at the time of closeout, income
received after closeout from the disposition of real property or from loans outstanding at the time of closeout shall
not be governed by the provisions of this part, except that such income shall be used for activities that meet one of
the national objectives in 24 CFR 570.208 and the eligibility requirements described in section 105 of the Act. 
(b) All other program income received after closeout will not be governed by the provisions of this part.

(iv) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 
(c) 

Relocation assistance for displaced persons. 

A displaced person (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels
described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition
Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA)(42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.

(d) 

Optional relocation assistance. 

Under section 105(a)(11) of the Act, the grantee may provide relocation payments and other relocation assistance
to persons displaced by a project that is not subject to paragraph (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide
relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraph (c) of this section at levels in excess of
those required. For assistance that is not required by State or tribal law, the grantee shall adopt a written policy
available to the public that describes the relocation assistance that it has elected to furnish and provides for equal
relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons. 
(e) 

Acquisition of real property. 

The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. Whenever the grantee
does not have the authority to acquire the real property through condemnation, it shall: 
(1) Before discussing the purchase price, inform the owner: 
(i) Of the amount it believes to be the fair market value of the property. Such amount shall be based upon one or more appraisals
prepared by a qualified appraiser. However, this provision does not prevent the grantee from accepting a donation
or purchasing the real property at less than its fair market value. 
(ii) That it will be unable to acquire the property if negotiations fail to result in an amicable agreement. 
(2) Request HUD approval of the proposed acquisition price before executing a firm commitment to purchase the property.
The grantee shall include with its request a copy of the appraisal(s) and, when applicable, a justification for any
proposed acquisition payment that exceeds the fair market value of the property. HUD will promptly review the proposal
and inform the grantee of it's approval or disapproval. 
(f) 

Appeals. 

A person who disagrees with the grantee's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a ``displaced
person,'' or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that
determination with the grantee. A person who is dissatisfied with the grantee's determination on his or her appeal
may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office. 
(g) 

Responsibility of grantee. 

(1) The grantee shall certify that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements
of this section, (

i.e.,

 provide assurance of compliance as required by 49 CFR part 24). The grantee shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding
any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with these provisions. 
(2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent
as other project costs. However, such assistance may also be paid for with funds available to the grantee from any other
source. 
(3) The grantee shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section. 
(h) 

Displaced person. 

(1) For purposes of this section, the term ``displaced person'' means any person (family, individual, business,
nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property,
permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under this
part. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from real
property that is made: 
(i) After notice by the grantee or property owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after
the date of the submission of an application for financial assistance by the grantee to HUD that is later approved for
the project. 
(ii) Before the date of the submission of the application requesting assistance, if either HUD or the grantee determines
that the displacement directly resulted from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.

(iii) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs: 
(A) The tenant moves after execution of the agreement between the grantee and HUD and the move occurs before the tenant
is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary
dwelling in the same building/complex upon completion of the project under reasonable terms and conditions. Such
reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed
the greater of 
(

1

) the tenant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or 
(

2

) 30 percent of gross household income; or 
(B) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either 
(

1

) the tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary
relocation or 
(

2

) other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or 
(C) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement
for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are
not reasonable. 
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced
person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

<TEXT>
 

(i) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application for financial assistance to HUD, and,
before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on
the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the
person would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of
the project; 
(ii) The person is not displaced, as defined under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2). 
(iii) The grantee determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition
for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination. 
(3) A grantee may ask HUD, at any time, to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this
section. 
(i) 

Initiation of negotiations.

 For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person
displaced as a direct result of rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term ``initiation of negotiations''
means the execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation or demolition. 
(ii) Reserved. 


 953.603 

Labor standards. 


In accordance with the authority under section 107(e)(2) of the Act, the Secretary waives the provisions of section
110 of the Act (Labor Standards) with respect to this part, including the requirement that laborers and mechanics
employed by the contractor or subcontractor in the performance of construction work financed in whole or in part with
assistance received under this part be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on similar construction
in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act.


 953.604

application for funds under this part, the applicant shall follow traditional means of resident involvement which,
at the least, include the following: 
(1) Furnishing residents with information concerning the amounts of funds available for proposed community development
and housing activities and the range of activities that may be undertaken. 
(2) Holding one or more meetings to obtain the views of residents on community development and housing needs. Meetings
shall be scheduled in ways and at times that will allow participation by residents.

development block grant. 
(b) Prior to submission of the application to HUD, the applicant shall certify by an official Tribal resolution that
it has met the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, and 
(1) considered any comments and views expressed by residents and, if it deems it appropriate, modified the application
accordingly, and 
(2) made the modified application available to residents. 
(c) No part of the requirement under paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to restrict the responsibility
and authority of the applicant for the development of the application and the execution of the grant. Accordingly,
the citizen participation requirements of this section do not include concurrence by any person or group in making
final determinations on the contents of the application. 


 953.605 

Environment. 


In order to assure that the policies of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other provisions of Federal
law which further the purposes of that act (as specified in 24 CFR 58.5) are most effectively implemented in connection
with the expenditure of block grant funds, the recipient shall comply with the Environment Review Procedures for
the Community Development Block Grant Program (24 CFR Part 58). Upon completion of the environmental review, the
recipient shall submit a certification and request for release of funds for particular projects in accordance with
24 CFR part 58.

and other private entities under eligible activities that authorize such assistance (e.g., rehabilitation, preservation,
and other improvements of private properties or facilities under  570.202 of this title; or grants, loans,
and other assistance to businesses, individuals, and other private entities under  570.203 or  570.204
of this title). 
(b) 

Conflicts prohibited.

 Except for the use of ICDBG funds to pay salaries and other related administrative or personnel costs, the general
rule is that no persons described in paragraph (c) of this section who exercise or have exercised any functions or responsibilities
with respect to ICDBG activities assisted under this part or who are in a position to participate in a decision-making
process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a personal or financial interest or
benefit from an ICDBG assisted activity, or have an interest in any contract, subcontract or agreement with respect
thereto, or the proceeds thereunder, either for themselves or those with whom they have family or business ties, during
their tenure or for one year thereafter. 
(c) 

Persons covered.

 The conflict of interest provisions of paragraph (b) of this section apply to any person who is an employee, agent,
consultant, officer, or elected or appointed official of the recipient, or of any designated public agencies, or

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940727-0-00162 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-0-00028 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) A disclosure of the nature of the possible conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure
of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and 
(ii) An opinion of the recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate Tribal
laws on conflict of interest, or applicable State laws. 
(2) 

Factors to be considered for exceptions:

 In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has satisfactorily met the requirements
of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, HUD shall consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable:

(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or essential expert knowledge to the program or
project which would otherwise not be available; 
(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation; 
(iii) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or from the decision-making
process, with reference to the specific assisted activity in question; 
(iv) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph
(b) of this section; 
(v) Whether undue hardship will result, either to the recipient or to the person affected, when weighed against the
public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; 
(vi) Any ot
