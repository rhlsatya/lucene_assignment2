Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication XXX



1994 May 23



Announcing the Standard for Cryptographic Service Calls



Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.




1. Name of Standard. Cryptographic Service Calls (FIPS PUB XXX).

2. Category of Standard. Computer Security, Cryptography.

3. Explanation. This standard specifies a set of generic cryptographic service calls, or applications program interface
(API), for application programs to interface with a cryptographic module for requesting cryptographic functions.
The service calls specify the interface for common cryptographic functions such as message encryption and decryption,
message authentication, digital signature generation and verification, key management, and user authentication.
Cryptographic algorithms that are supported include both secret-key based and public-key based algorithms. In
this standard, the terms 

cryptographic service calls

 and 

cryptographic APIs

 can be used interchangeably.

4. Approving Authority. Secretary of Commerce.

5. Maintenance Agency. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (Computer Systems
Laboratory).

6. Cross Index.




a. FIPS PUB 46-2, Data Encryption Standard.

b. FIPS PUB 74, Guidelines for Implementing and Using the NBS Data Encryption Standard.

c. FIPS PUB 81, DES Modes of Operation.

d. FIPS PUB 113, Computer Data Authentication.

e. FIPS PUB 171, Key Management Using ANSI X9.17.

f. FIPS PUB 180, Secure Hash Standard.

g. FIPS PUB XXX, Digital Signature Standard.

h. FIPS PUB 185, Escrowed Encryption Standard.

i. Special Publication 800-2, Public Key Cryptography.

j. Federal Information Resources Management Regulations (FIRMR) subpart 201.20.303, Standards, and subpart 201.39.1002,
Federal Standards.




Other NIST publications may be applicable to the implementation and use of this standard. A list (NIST Publications
List 91) of currently available computer security publications, including ordering information, can be obtained
from NIST.




7. Objectives. A standard cryptographic interface will facilitate interoperability among different cryptographic
implementations. Specifically, a standard set of cryptographic service calls provides the following advantages:




a. Application programmers will need to learn only one set of cryptographic service calls for multiple cryptographic
applications.

b. Cryptographic modules from different vendors, which conform to this interface standard, may be interfaced to
a given application without requiring modification to the application program.

c. Contracts for additional cryptographic modules would not have to be sole sourced because multiple vendors would
offer the standard service calls.

d. Vendors could build cryptographic modules which would interface to a wide variety of applications.




8. Applicability. This standard is applicable to all Federal departments and agencies that use cryptographic-based
security systems for the protection of unclassified information that is not subject to Section 2315 of Title 10, U.S.
Code, or Section 3502(2) of Title 44, U.S. Code. The standard shall be used by all Federal departments and agencies
in designing, acquiring and implementing cryptographic services where a cryptographic interface is to be provided.
Not all of the service calls specified in this standard need to be used in its entirety by an application. The specific
service calls that shall be used depend on the security requirements for the particular application and environment
in which the system is to be utilized. Private and commercial organizations are encouraged to adopt and use this standard
in order to facilitate interoperability among different cryptographic products.

9. Applications. The standard may be used in any application which uses cryptography to provide any of the following
cryptographic functions: message encryption/decryption, message authentication, digital signature generation
and verification, and key management. Not all the service calls specified in this standard need to be used by an application.
An application can make use of additional service calls not available in this standard.

10. Specifications. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) XXX, 

Cryptographic Service Calls.

11. Implementations. Though this document specifies a standard interface for requesting cryptographic functions,
the standard, however, does not mandate a specific implementation of these cryptographic functions other than what
are explicitly specified in the document. The cryptographic functions may in fact be implemented in software, firmware,
hardware, or any combination thereof. However, there may be other standards that are applicable to the implementation
of specific cryptographic functions. For specific requirements, the individual standard shall be referred to.
Conformance to this standard requires that the cryptographic service calls used by an application provide exactly
the same name and letter case for the service calls and their parameters as specified in the standard. In the rare case
where the standard naming and specification of the service calls and parameters may violate certain rules of a particular
programming language in use, the exception should be noted and the selected naming and case specification should
match the standard as much as possible.

12. Export Control. Certain cryptographic devices and technical data regarding them are deemed to be defense articles
(i.e., inherently military in character) and are subject to Federal government export controls as specified in Title
22, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 120-128. Some exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard
and technical data regarding them must comply with these Federal regulations and be licensed by the U.S. Department
of State. Other exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard and technical data regarding them fall
under the licensing authority of the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Department
of Commerce is responsible for licensing cryptographic devices used for authentication, access control, proprietary
software, automatic teller machines (ATMs), and certain devices used in other equipment and software. For advice
concerning which agency has licensing authority for a particular cryptographic device, please contact the respective
agencies.

13. Implementation Schedule. This standard becomes effective six months after publication of a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of its approval by the Secretary of Commerce.

14. Qualifications. While this standard specifies a standard interface for application programs to request cryptographic
functions from a cryptographic module, conformance to this standard does not assure that a particular cryptographic
module or implementation is secure. Security requirements for a cryptographic module are addressed in FIPS 140-1.
The responsible authority in each agency or department shall assure that the overall system provides an acceptable
level of security.

Financial Assistance for Research and Development Projects to Provide Information for the Full and Wise Use and Enhancement
of Fishery Resources in the Gulf of Mexico and off the U.S. South Atlantic Coastal States (MARFIN)


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Subject to the availability of funds, NMFS issues this notice describing funding to assist persons in carrying out
research and development projects that optimize the use of U.S. Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (North Carolina
to Florida) fisheries involving the U.S. fishing industry (recreational and commercial), including fishery biology,
resource assessment, socio-economic assessment, management and conservation, selected harvesting methods,
and fish handling and processing. NMFS issues this notice describing the conditions under which applications will
be accepted and how NMFS will determine which applications will be selected for funding. Areas of this Marine Fisheries
Initiative (MARFIN) emphasis for FY 1995 were formulated from recommendations received from non-Federal scientific
and technical experts, and NMFS research and operations officials.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Authority.


The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) is authorized under 15 U.S.C. 713c-3(d) to enter into cooperative agreements
for research and development addressed to all aspects of U.S. fisheries. 


II. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). 


This program is described in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under program number 11.433, Marine Fisheries
Initiative.


III. Program Description.


MARFIN is a competitive Federal grant program that promotes and endorses programs that seek to optimize economic
and social benefits from marine fishery resources through cooperative efforts that involve the best research and
management talents to accomplish priority activities. Preference is given to selecting and funding applications
for project grants that provide an opportunity for cooperative NMFS/applicant efforts and for multiple cooperating
applicants/NMFS efforts with up to 3-year time horizons. Projects funded under MARFIN are focused into cooperative
efforts that provide clear answers for fishery needs covered by the NMFS Strategic Plan, available from the Southeast
Regional Office (see 

ADDRESSES

), particularly those goals relating to rebuilding overfished marine fisheries, maintaining currently productive
fisheries, and integrating conservation of protected species and fisheries management.
Applications from multiple cooperating applicants that address conservation and management needs over a wide range
of a fishery or fishery organism are encouraged. Emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest
probability of recovering, maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors
affecting recruitment success; and/or generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries.
Projects will be evaluated as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through both short-term and long-term
research efforts, with consideration of the magnitude of the eventual economic or social benefits that may be realized.
Short-term projects that may yield more immediate benefits, and projects yielding longer-term benefits will receive
equal consideration.


IV. Funding Availability.


This solicitation announces that funding of approximately $1.25 million may be available in FY 1995 pending Congressional
appropriation. MARFIN financial assistance started in FY 1986, and for FY 1986 through FY 1994, awards totaled about
$15.5 million for financial assistance to conduct research for fishery resources in the Gulf of Mexico and off the
South Atlantic states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. There is no guarantee that sufficient
funds will be available to make awards for all approved projects.
Project proposals accepted for funding for a project period over 1 year that include multiple project components
or severable tasks to be funded each budget period will not compete for funding in subsequent budget periods within
the approved project period. However, funding for subsequent project components is contingent upon the availability
of funds from Congress and satisfactory performance, and will be at the sole discretion of the agency. Publication
of this notice does not obligate NMFS to award any specific cooperative agreement or to obligate all or any parts of
the available funds.


V. Matching Requirements.


Applications must reflect the total budget necessary to accomplish the project, including contributions and/or
donations. Cost-sharing is not required for the MARFIN program. However, cost-sharing is encouraged, and in case
of a tie in considering proposals for funding, cost-sharing may affect the final decision. The appropriateness of
all cost-sharing will be determined on the basis of guidance provided in applicable Federal cost principles. If an
applicant chooses to cost-share, and if that application is selected for funding, the applicant will be bound by the
percentage of the cost share reflected in the cooperative agreement award.
The non-Federal share may include funds received from private sources or from state or local governments, or the value
of in-kind contributions by the applicant or third parties. Federal funds may not be used to meet the non-Federal share
of matching funds, except as provided by Federal statute. In-kind contributions may be in the form of, but are not limited
to, personal services rendered in carrying out functions related to the project, and use of real or personal property
owned by others (for which consideration is not required) in carrying out the projects.
The total cost of a project begins on the effective date of a cooperative agreement between the applicant and the NOAA
Grants Officer and ends on the date specified in the award. Accordingly, time expended and costs incurred in either
the development of a project or the financial assistance application, or in any subsequent discussions or negotiations
prior to the award, are neither reimbursable nor recognizable as part of the recipient's cost share.


VI. Type of Funding Instrument.


The cooperative agreement has been determined to be the appropriate funding instrument. NMFS is substantially involved
in developing program research priorities, conducting cooperative activities with recipients, and evaluating
the performance of recipients for effectiveness in meeting national and regional goals for fishery research in the
southeastern United States.


VII. Eligibility Criteria.


1. Applications for cooperative agreements for MARFIN projects may be made, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this notice, by:
a. Any individual who is a citizen or national of the United States;
b. Any corporation, partnership, or other entity, non-profit or otherwise, if such entity is a citizen of the United
States within the meaning of section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended (46 app. U.S.C. 802).
c. Colleges and universities, and game and fish departments of the several states.
2. NOAA employees, including full-time, part-time, and intermittent personnel (or their immediate families),
and NOAA offices or centers are not eligible to submit an application under this solicitation, or aid in the preparation
of an application during the 60-day solicitation period, except to provide information about the MARFIN program
and the priorities and procedures included in this solicitation. However, NOAA employees are permitted to provide
information about ongoing and planned NOAA programs and activities that may have implication for an application.
Potential applicants are encouraged to contact Ms. Ellie Roche at the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see 

ADDRESSES

) for information on NOAA programs. Documents available from that office that may be useful to the applicant include:
a. A Cooperative Reef Fish Research Program for the Gulf of Mexico.
b. A Cooperative Bycatch Research Plan for the Southeast Region.
c. Strategic Plan of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
d. National Status of Stocks Report.
e. Various fishery management plans and plan amendments produced by the Councils and the Commissions.
f. Report of a Workshop on Grouper Reproduction, November 1993.


VIII. Award Period.


The award period for the project may be made for more than one year consisting of one, two, or three budget periods which
correspond to the funding for the proposed project components. The award period will depend upon the duration of funding
requested by the applicant in the Application for Federal Assistance, the decision of the NMFS selecting official
on the amount of funding, the results of post-selection negotiations between the applicant and NOAA officials, and
preaward review of the application by NOAA and Department of Commerce (DOC) officials. Normally, each project budget
period may be no more than 18 months in duration. NOAA policy limits the total duration of a project to about 3 years.



IX. Indirect Costs.


The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in an application under this program must not exceed the indirect
cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award,
or 25 percent of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less. Institutions
with indirect cost rates above 25 percent may use the amount above the 25-percent level as part of the non-Federal
share. A copy of the current, approved, negotiated Indirect Cost Agreement with the Federal government must be included
with the application.


X. Profit or Fees.


Profit or management fees paid to for-profit or commercial organization grantees are allowable at the discretion
of NOAA. However, they shall not exceed 7 percent of the total estimated direct costs. There must be no profit or fees
to the recipient in any overhead charge. Payment of fees or profit is based on successful completion of project objectives.


XI. Application Forms and Kit.


Before submitting an application under this program, applicants should contact the NMFS Southeast Regional Office
for a copy of this solicitation's MARFIN Application Package (see 

ADDRESSES

).
Applications for project funding under this program must be complete and be in accordance with instructions in the
MARFIN Application Package. They must identify the principal participants and include copies of any agreements
describing the specific tasks to be performed by participants. Project applications should give a clear presentation
of the proposed work, the methods for carrying out the project, its relevance to managing and enhancing the use of Gulf
of Mexico and/or South Atlantic fishery resources, and cost estimates as they relate to specific aspects of the project.
Budgets must include a detailed breakdown, by category of expenditures, with appropriate justification for both
the Federal and non-Federal shares. Applicants should not assume prior knowledge on the part of NMFS as to the relative
merits of the project described in the application. Applications are not to be bound in any manner and should be one-sided.
All incomplete applications will be returned to the applicant. Three copies (one original and two copies) of each
application are required, and should be submitted to the NMFS Southeast Regional Office, Cooperative Programs Division
(see 

ADDRESSES

).


XII. Project Funding Priorities.


A. Proposals for FY 1995 should exhibit familiarity with related work that is completed or ongoing. Where appropriate,
proposals should be multidisciplinary. Coordinated efforts involving multiple institutions or persons are encouraged.
The areas of special emphasis are listed below, but proposals in other areas will be considered on a funds-available
basis.
In addition to referencing specific area(s) of special interest as listed below, proposals should state whether
the research will apply to the Gulf of Mexico only, the South Atlantic only, or to both areas. Successful applicants
may be required to collect and manage data in accordance with standardized procedures and formats approved by NMFS,
and to participate with NMFS in specific cooperative activities that will be determined by consultations between
NMFS and successful applicants before project grants are awarded. Recipients of financial assistance for projects
with multiple project periods must include funding in their applications for travel expenses for the principal investigator
to participate in one annual project review and evaluation meeting in St. Petersburg, FL. All recipients of financial
assistance under this program shall include funding in their applications for the principal investigator to participate
in an annual MARFIN Conference at the completion of the project.
Research needs identified in fishery management plans (FMPs) and amendments prepared by the Gulf and South Atlantic
Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and the Gulf and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commissions (Commissions)
are included. For availability of these documents, contact the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see 

ADDRESSES

). Areas of special emphasis for FY 1995 include:
1. 

Shrimp Trawler Bycatch

.
Studies are needed to contribute to the regional shrimp trawler bycatch program being conducted by NMFS in cooperation
with state fishery management agencies, commercial and recreational fishing organizations and interests, environmental
organizations, universities, Councils, and Commissions. Specific guidance and research requirements are contained
in the Regional Bycatch Plan prepared through the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation. In particular,
the studies should address:
a. Data collection and analyses to expand and update current bycatch estimates temporally and spatially from offshore,
nearshore, and inshore waters, emphasizing areas of greatest shrimping impact. Sampling effort should include
estimates of numbers, weight, and age structure of the associated bycatch complex.
b. Assessments of the status and condition of fish stocks significantly impacted by shrimp trawler bycatch, with
emphasis given to overfished species under the jurisdiction of the Councils.
c. Identification, development, and evaluation of gear, non- gear and tactical fishing options to reduce bycatch.
d. Improved methods for communicating with and improving technology and information transfer to the shrimp industry.
e. Social and economic impacts of management options to reduce shrimp fishery bycatch. 
2. 

Highly Migratory Pelagic Fisheries

.
a. 

Longline Fisheries, Including Bycatch

.
A number of pelagic longline fisheries exist in the Gulf and South Atlantic, targeting highly migratory species such
as tunas, some sharks, and swordfish. These fisheries have evolved rapidly over the last decade, with increases in
fishing effort and changes in fishing gear and tactics. These changes need to be characterized and their effects quantified.
High priority areas include:
(1) Characterization of specific longline fisheries, including targeted species, stock identification, catch-per-unit-effort
of bycatch, and biological parameters (e.g., sex ratios and reproductive state) by gear type, area and season.
(2) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fisheries.
(3) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize bycatch of undersized and unwanted species,
including sea turtles and marine mammals.
(4) Assessment of the impact of longline bycatch on related fisheries, including biological, social, and economic
factors and effects. 
(5) Dependence of vessels and persons engaged in pelagic longlining on other fisheries. Particular emphasis should
be placed on the extent to which the capital and/or labor engages in other fisheries at particular times of the year
and reasons for this switching behavior.
b. 

Sharks

.
A Secretarial FMP for sharks has been developed that identifies a number of research needs, including:
(1) Characterization of the commercial and recreational fisheries from historical and current databases. Emphasis
should be on species composition, bycatch, stock identification, size, sex ratios and catch-per-unit-effort by
season, area, and gear type.
(2) Collection and analysis of basic biological data on movements, habitats, growth rates, mortality rates, age
structure and reproduction parameters. These data are of particular importance for blacktip and sandbar sharks.
Information on the relationship of sandbar sharks to water depth and determination of the southern boundary of its
range are specifically needed.
(3) Determination of baseline cost and returns for commercial fisheries that land sharks, and estimation of demand
curves for shark products and recreational shark fisheries. 
(4) Development of species profiles and stock assessments for sharks taken in significant quantities by commercial
and recreational fishers, and as bycatch in other fisheries. Assessments can be species-specific or for species
groups, following those identified in the Atlantic Sharks FMP.
(5) Identification of coastal sharks, using laboratory methodologies.
(6) Development of a more precise and accurate estimate of the recreational shark fishery. Proposals in this area
must demonstrate a knowledge of the Marine Recreational Fishery Statistical Survey (MRFSS), and should indicate
a willingness to participate directly in the MRFSS through add-on surveys or enhancement of current surveys.
(7) Development of fishery-independent abundance indices.
3. 

Reef Fish

.
A number of species within the reef fish complex are showing signs of being overfished, either by directed efforts
or as bycatch in other fisheries. The ecology of reef fish makes them vulnerable to overfishing because they tend to
concentrate over specific types of habitats with patchy distribution. This behavior pattern can make traditional
fishery statistics misleading. Priority research areas include:
a. Collection of basic biological data for species in commercially and recreationally important fisheries.
(1) Age and growth of reef fish.
(a) Description of age and growth patterns (especially red snapper, gray triggerfish and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico
and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic).
(b) Development of annual age-length keys for vermilion snapper in the northern Gulf and west coast central Florida,
and for red grouper in the Gulf, along with new growth models for red grouper that include possible density-dependent
effects, as well as environmental effects.
(2) Reproduction studies of reef fish.
(a) Maturity schedules and fecundity of commercially and recreationally important reef fish (especially gray triggerfish
and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico).
(b) Detailed histological studies of red snapper to characterize the actual reproductive contribution of females,
by age.
(c) Identification and characterization of spawning aggregations by species, areas, and seasons. Information
is especially needed on changes in sex ratios for gag grouper caused by fishing on spawning aggregations.
(d) Reproductive studies covering extensive geographic distributions along the southeastern U.S. coast (North
Carolina through the Florida Keys). Samples should be obtained from recreational (private and headboats) and commercial
vessels.
(e) Reproductive biology of gag, red grouper and other grouper species. Of particular importance are evaluation
of sperm limitation, determination of the proximal causes of sex change (whether behavioral or developmental),
determination of the annual periodicity of sex-change induction and age-specific spawning frequency, and other
research identified in the recommendations of the workshop on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November
1993.
(3) Recruitment of reef fish.
(a) Source of recruitment in Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic waters (especially amberjack and vermilion snapper),
and possible Caribbean source for Florida Keys snapper and grouper.
(b) Annual estimation of the absolute or relative recruitment of juvenile gag to the seagrass beds off the west coast
of Florida and to similar estuarine nursery habitats along the South Atlantic Bight; development of an index of juvenile
gag recruitment for the South Atlantic based on historical databases and/or field studies.
(c) Evaluation of the contribution of live-bottom habitat to reef fish recruitment 
(4) Stock structure of reef fish.
(a) Movement and migration patterns of commercially and recreationally valuable reef fish species (especially
gag and greater amberjack in the South Atlantic).
(b) Techniques to allow field separation of lesser amberjack, almaco jack, and banded rudderfish from greater amberjack
to facilitate accurate reporting of catch.
(c) Stock structure of gag and wreckfish in the South Atlantic, and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic.
(d) Use of parasitological surveys in species such as wreckfish and white grunt to determine stock structure.
b. Behavioral studies of reef fish.
(1) Description of the behavior of age-0 and age-1 red snapper.
(2) Effects of fishing on reproductive behavior, in formation of aggregations and disruption of existing aggregations.
c. Population assessment of reef fish.
(1) Effect of reproductive mode and sex change (protogynous hermaphroditism) on population size and characteristics,
with reference to sizes of fish exploited in the fisheries and the significance to proper management.
(2) Design of sampling routines to provide a production-style aging program representative of the reef fish fishery.
Effective dock-side sampling programs, especially for groupers, are needed over a wide geographic range to collect
information on reproductive state, size, age, and sex. These research needs are discussed in the report of the workshop
on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November 1993.
(3) Source and quantification of natural and human-induced mortalities. 
(4) Determination of the habitat and limiting factors for important reef fish resources (such as snappers in the Gulf
of Mexico). Information is also needed on the importance of human-created and natural channels for controlling stock
sizes and growth rates of snappers and groupers.
(5) Description of habitat and fish populations in the deep reef community and the prey distributions supporting
the community.
(6) Evaluation of the effect of misidentifying gag as black grouper on landing statistics and stock assessments.
(7) Development of statistically valid indices of abundance for important reef fish species in the South Atlantic
and Gulf of Mexico (especially red grouper), including spatial and temporal variations in size distribution.
(8) Assessment of tag performance on reef fish species, mainly snappers and groupers. Characteristics examined
should include shedding rate, effects on growth and survival, and effects of these characteristics on estimations
of vital population parameters.
(9) Stock assessments to establish the status of major recreational and commercial species. Innovative methods
are needed for stock assessments of aggregate species, including the effect of fishing on genetic structure and the
incorporation of sex change for protogynous hermaphrodites into stock assessment models.
(10) Fishery-independent assessments of spawning aggregations of gag, scamp, yellowedge and other groupers, using
hydroacoustic and underwater video technology.
d. Management of reef fish.
(1) Research in direct support of management, including catch-and-release mortalities by gear and depth, the value
of limiting longlines to specific water depths (e.g., outside the 50-fathom (91.4-m) curve), and modifications
(gear, techniques) to minimize bycatch.
(2) Evaluation of the use of reef fish marine reserves as an alternative or supplement to current fishery management
measures and practices, especially in the South Atlantic. Of particular interest is Oculina Banks off the Atlantic
Coast of Florida.
(3) Characterization and evaluation of the social and economic behavior of commercial and recreational fishermen,
and how these characteristics change in response to management measures.
(4) Characterization and quantification of the biological, economic, and social impacts of the longline fishery
for reef fish along the west coast of Florida. This should include the following:
(a) Catch-per-unit-effort of target and bycatch species, and biological parameters (e.g., size, sex, and reproductive
state) by gear type, area, and season.
(b) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fishery.
(c) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize the bycatch of undersized and unwanted species,
including sea turtles and marine mammals.
(d) Assessment of the impact of longline bycatch on related fisheries.
4. 

Coastal Herrings

.
Preliminary studies indicate that substantial stocks of coastal herrings occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most
of the available data are generated from fishery-independent surveys conducted by NMFS and state fishery management
agencies. Because of the size of these stocks, their importance as prey, and in some instances as predator species,
their potential for development as commercial and recreational fisheries must be understood. General research
needs include:
a. Collection, collation, and analysis of available fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data from state
and Federal surveys, with emphasis on species and size composition, seasonal distribution patterns, biomass, bycatch,
and environmental relationships. Emphasis should be given to species such as Spanish sardine that are important
as prey to gamefish.
b. Description and quantification of predator-prey relationships between coastal herring species and carnivores
such as mackerels, tunas, swordfish, billfish, sharks, bluefish, and others in high demand by commercial and recreational
fisheries.
c. Design of innovative economic and social management approaches for the purse seine menhaden fishery, including,
but not limited to, limited entry.
5. 

Coastal Migratory Pelagic Fisheries

.
The commercial and recreational demand for migratory coastal pelagics has led to overfishing for certain species,
including king and Spanish mackerel. Additionally, some are transboundary with Mexico and other countries and ultimately
will demand international management attention. Current high priorities include:
a. Recruitment indices for king and Spanish mackerel, cobia, dolphin, and bluefish, primarily from fishery-independent
data sources.
b. Assessment and management models for coastal pelagic resources that are dominated by single year classes, such
as Spanish mackerel, dolphin, and bluefish.
c. Fishery-independent methods of assessing stock abundance of king and Spanish mackerel. 
d. Improved catch statistics for all species in Mexican waters, with special emphasis on king mackerel; needed especially
is length-frequency, life history and genetic information.
e. Information on populations of coastal pelagics overwintering off North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia,
especially population size, age and movement patterns.
f. Basic biostatistical information on cobia and dolphin to develop age-length keys and maturation schedules for
stock assessments.
g. Impact of bag limits on total catch and landings of king and Spanish mackerel.
h. Demand and supply functions for recreational and commercial fisheries for king mackerel in the South Atlantic
and Gulf of Mexico. Emphasis should be on changes in marginal values of producer and consumer surpluses, since the
studies would be used in allocation frameworks where total values are not necessarily required.
6. 

Groundfish and Estuarine Fishes


Substantial stocks of groundfish and estuarine species occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most of the database
for assessments comes from studies conducted by NMFS and state fishery management agencies. Because of the historic
and current size of these fish stocks, their importance as predator and prey species, and their current or potential
use as commercial and recreational fisheries, more information on their biology and conservation is needed. General
research needs are:
a. Red drum.
(1) Effects of sportfishing on red drum populations in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic. A specific need in the
South Atlantic is increased sampling of nighttime fishing for red drum on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
(2) Size and age-structure of the offshore adult red drum stock in the Gulf of Mexico.
(3) Immigration and escapement of red drum from state waters into the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Gulf of Mexico
and the South Atlantic.
(4) Life history parameters and stock structure for the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Research should include
migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and comparisons of the inshore
and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries. Specific research needs for Atlantic red
drum are fecundity estimates, as a function of length and weight, and improved coastwide coverage for age-length
keys.
(5) Catch-and-release mortality rates from inshore and nearshore waters, and fishing mortality rates in state territorial
waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
b. Life history and stock structure for weakfish, menhaden, spot and croaker in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic.
Research should include migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and
comparisons of the inshore and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries.
c. Improved catch and effort statistics from recreational and commercial fisheries, including size and age structure
of the catch, to develop production models.
d. Quantification and qualification of the bycatch in finfish trawl fisheries, such as the flounder and fly-net fisheries
in the South Atlantic.
e. Determination of catch-and-release mortality rates for spotted seatrout from inshore and nearshore waters.
7. 

Crabs and Lobsters

.
a. Monitoring of fecundity and sex/size frequencies for examination of spawning potential in relation to overfishing
criteria for stone crab and spiny lobster.
b. Development of recruitment indices, and population assessment and management models for stone crab and spiny
lobster.
c. Determination of the relationship between the reproductive cycle characteristics of spiny lobster in Florida
and the Caribbean.
8. 

Sea Turtle Conservation.


The conservation of endangered and threatened sea turtles in the Southeast Region continues to be a high priority.
Specific needs include:
a. Distribution, abundance and size composition of sea turtles in inshore waters, especially where these turtles
may be affected by inshore fisheries.
b. Turtle excluder device (TED) modifications or designs to exclude adult leatherback sea turtles. The area of special
concern is off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.
c. TED designs and modifications for use in small inshore shrimp trawls. Especially needed is research on shrimp retention
and on the effectiveness of TEDs operating in areas with debris. 
d. Sea turtle incidental catch in fisheries other than the shrimp fishery.
e. Evaluation of the utility of turtle stranding data as an indication of fishery-caused mortality.
9. 

General

. 
There are many areas of research that need to be addressed for improved understanding and management of fishery resources.
These include methods for data collection, management, analysis, and for better conservation. Examples of high
priority research needs include:
a. Design and critical analysis of a data collection system that may involve permits, logbooks, trip interviews,
dealer reporting or other innovative methods. The system design should be applicable across the entire range of species
that may be pursued throughout the Gulf and South Atlantic, and should address economic, biological and social data
needs.
b. Assessment of the changes in recreational and commercial values that have resulted from past management practices
for red drum, shrimp, mackerels and reef fish.
c. Development of improved methods and procedures for technology transfer, and education of constituency groups
on fishery management and conservation programs. Of special importance are programs concerned with controlled
access and introduction of conservation gear.
d. Compilation of baseline socio-demographic data for describing the social and cultural framework of managed fisheries.
B. Priority in program emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest probability of recovering,
maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors affecting recruitment
success; and generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries. Projects will be evaluated
as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through short- and long-term research efforts, with consideration
given to the magnitude of the eventual economic benefits that may be realized.
C. Further information on current Federal programs that address the above-listed priorities may be obtained from
the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see 

ADDRESSES

).


XIII. Evaluation Criteria.

XIV. Selection Procedures.


All applications will be ranked by a NMFS scientific panel into two groups: (a) Recommended, and (b) Not Recommended.
Proposals ranked as Not Recommended will not be given further consideration for selection and funding. All rankings
will be presented to a panel of non-NOAA fishery experts, who will individually consider the significance of the problem
addressed in each project proposal, the technical evaluation, and need for funding. These panel members will provide
individual recommendations to NMFS on each proposal classified as Recommended or Not Recommended.
The non-NOAA panel members' individual comments, recommendations and evaluations, and recommendations of the
NMFS scientific panel and NMFS Southeast Program Officer will be considered by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS
(Regional Director). The Regional Director, in consultation with the NOAA Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,
will: (a) Determine which projects do not substantially duplicate other projects that are currently funded by NOAA
or are approved for funding by other Federal offices, and recommend the projects to be funded. The exact amount of funds
awarded, the final scope of activities, the project duration, and specific NMFS cooperative involvement with the
activities of each project will be determined in pre-award negotiations between the applicant, the NOAA Grants Office,
and the NMFS Program Staff. Projects must not be initiated by recipients until a signed award is received from the NOAA
Grants Office. For project periods of more than 1 year, funds for subsequent budget periods may be provided if initial
project tasks are satisfactorily completed and after NMFS has received MARFIN funds for subsequent periods.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation) is announcing that it is soliciting cash donations
and donations of goods and services from private sector companies, foundations, and individuals in order to leverage
federally appropriated resources in carrying out its national service program.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Corporation is a new government corporation that encompasses the work and staff of two previously existing federal
agencies, the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans
of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service. This service will address the nation's education, public
safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation
will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide education opportunity
for those who make a substantial commitment to service.




The Corporation will fund a new national service initiative called AmeriCorps that includes a wide variety of programs
operated by grantees, the National Civilian Community Corps, and the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program.
The Corporation will also support service-learning initiatives for elementary and secondary schools and institutions
of higher education called Learn and Serve America, and operate the senior volunteers programs previously supported
by ACTION. Some of the national service programs will be operating this summer, and most of the others will be operational
by this fall.

Purusant to the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 (the Act), the Corporation may ``solicit, accept,
hold, administer, use, and dispose of, in furtherance of [the purposes of national service], donations of any money,
or property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, received by gift, devise, bequest, or otherwise.''
42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A). Such donations ``shall be considered to be a gift, devise, or bequest to, or for the use
of, the United States,'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(B), and therefore may be allowable as a charitable tax deduction
under the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 170. The Corporation may also ``solicit and accept the voluntary services
of individuals'' to assist the Corporation in carrying out the national service program. 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A).

The Corporation is striving to build innovative public/private partnerships that support national and community
service programs throughout the country. The Corporation's primary goal is to foster strategic linkages between
private sector companies, foundations, government agencies, and community service organizations, in order to
multiply their combined abilities to address shared community problems. To this end, the Corporation seeks to leverage
its federally appropriated resources with donations of goods and services form private sector companies, foundations,
and individuals. Such goods and services include, but are not limited to, the following:




_apparel;
_footwear;
_food and beverages;
_communication equipment and services;
_print and broadcast media services;
_transportation equipment and services;
_computer equipment and services;
_gardening and building supplies;
_office equipment and supplies;
_books and other printed material;
_printing and duplication services;
_facilities for training and special events;
_audiovisual equipment and services;
_sporting equipment;
_arts and crafts supplies;
_marketing, public relations, and advertising services;
_financial, accounting, and legal services;
_any other goods and services that will further the mission and goals of the Corporation.



The Corporation is also interested in receiving cash donations.

The Chief Executive Officer (the CEO) of the Corporation, or his or her designee, has the authority to solicit donations

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Financial Assistance Award in Response to an Unsolicited Financial Assistance Application; 36-94G010024.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its
intention to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District for the implementation
of utility, grid-connected photovoltaic systems.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

DOE has evaluated, in accordance with the DOE Federal Assistance Regulations, 10 CFR 600.14, the unsolicited proposal
entitled ``Sustained Utility Implementation of Photovoltaics'' and recommends that the unsolicited proposal
be accepted for support without further competition in accordance with  600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations.



This award involves cost sharing on the hardware, installation and evaluation of utility, grid-connected photovoltaic
systems for residential, commercial/utility sized (substation), and building-integrated applications. Sacramento
Municipal Utility Districts' (SMUD) ``sustained orderly development'' effort to advance the commercialization
of grid-connected photovoltaics plans to install about 900 kW of grid-connected PV systems. This will include about
100 residential ``PV Pioneer'' systems, several systems of the commercial/utility size, and building-integrated
applications such as PV integrated as architectural building components and demand-side management applications.

The phase I activities include procurement activities, including issuance of the RFP, bids, proposal evaluations,
negotiations and SMUD board approval. Phase II activities include the installation, monitoring and evaluation
of PV systems.

This project represents a unique opportunity to evaluate large-scale, distributed, utility grid-connected PV
applications; implement a substantial hardware procurement; and support the commercialization of grid-connected
photovoltaics. SMUD has a high probability of achieving the project objectives based on past projects, a ``large''
service area for the implementation of grid-connected applications and community commitment to the adoption of
PV technology. SMUD's resources and commitment to extending the utility PV collaborative process and promoting
cooperative ventures to accelerate the commercialization of utility PV applications should provide a basis for
the successful implementation.

The program cost is estimated to be $10,800,000 total, with the DOE share being $1,600,000 or 14.8%. The proposed DOE
funding for FY 94 is $500,000 and for FY 95 is $1,100,000.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Consent Order with Murphy Oil Corporation, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and Murphy Exploration & Production
Company</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Economic Regulatory Administration, DOE.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed consent order and opportunity for public comment.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) announces 
a proposed Consent Order between the Department of Energy (DOE) and Murphy Oil Corporation, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and
Murphy Exploration & Production Company (Murphy). The agreement proposes to resolve matters relating to Murphy's
compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations for the period January 1, 1973 through January
28, 1981. If this Consent Order is approved, Murphy will pay $10,700,000.00 to DOE. To distribute these monies, DOE's
Office of Hearings and Appeals will be petitioned to implement Special Refund Procedures pursuant to 10 CFR Part 205,
Subpart V, in which proceedings any persons who claim to have suffered injury from the alleged overcharges would have
the opportunity to submit claims for payment. 



Pursuant to 10 CFR  205.199J, ERA will receive written comments on the proposed Consent Order and will consider
all comments received from the public in determining whether to accept the settlement and issue a final Order, renegotiate
the agreement and issue a modified agreement as a final Order, or reject the settlement. DOE's final decision will
be published in the 

Federal Register

, along with an analysis of significant written comments in response to this notice, as well as any other considerations
that were relevant to the final decision.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Murphy is a petroleum refiner and a producer subject to the audit jurisdiction of ERA to determine compliance with
the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. During the period covered by the proposed Consent Order,
January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981, Murphy engaged in, among other things, the production, sale and refining
of crude oil. On February 9, 1987, Murphy and DOE entered into a Consent Order (hereinafter the 1987 Consent Order)
that settled, with certain specific exceptions, all claims and disputes against Murphy by DOE for the period January
1, 1973 through January 28, 1981. The 1987 Consent Order specifically excepted, among other things, issues or claims
then pending or arising out of first sales of crude oil produced and sold from properties operated by Murphy. 



As a result of DOE's investigation of Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations
during the period covered by the proposed Consent Order, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December
15, 1986. On June 17, 1992, DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) modified the PRO and issued it as a Remedial Order
(RO) to Murphy. 

Murphy Oil Corp

., 22 DOE   83,005 (1992). The RO finds Murphy liable to make restitution of $13,366,664.60, plus interest to
the date of restitution, for violations of the regulations applicable to first sales of domestic crude oil (10 CFR
  212.72-212.74), the regulations exempting from the price rules the sale of crude oil produced
from ``stripper well'' properties (10 CFR   210.32 and 212.54), and the normal business practices rule
(10 CFR  210.62(c)) in connection with Murphy's first sales of crude oil during the period September 1973 through
December 1979. With interest, Murphy's current liability under the RO would total $67.6 million through June 1994.
Murphy appealed that RO to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). 

The RO also remands for further proceedings claims against Murphy pertaining to Murphy's operation of properties
for which the PRO found violations during the year 1979, as well as certain crude oil properties not included within
ERA's investigation of Murphy or within the PRO. 

On January 24, 1994, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a decision and proposed order (D&PO) that modified
the RO and directed recalculation of the amount of restitution. 

Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co., et al.

, 66 FERC  63,002 (1994). The D&PO is now pending before the Commission in Docket No. RO92-5-000.
With interest, Murphy's current liability under the D&PO (including ERA's estimate of Murphy's liability for
previously unaudited properties and unaudited time periods (yet to be adjudicated by OHA or FERC)) totals approximately
$5.2 million. 

ERA has preliminarily agreed to the proposed $10,700,000 settlement as resolution of Murphy's liability for DOE
regulatory violations for the period covered by the proposed Consent Order. ERA has made this tentative determination
after an assessment of the risks of the current matters in litigation. Among other things, ERA has considered the risk
pertaining to the following issues that Murphy has raised in its defense: whether Murphy properly applied the definition
of ``property'' to certain of its offshore and onshore producing premises in the period September 1973 through August
1976; whether the largest of Murphy's offshore producing premises qualified as multiple DOE ``properties'' under
DOE Rulings 1977-1 and 1977-2; whether Murphy charged prices in excess of the appropriate ceiling prices
for crude oil produced from offshore and onshore properties that it operated; whether Murphy should be liable for
100% of the overcharges associated with sales of crude oil that had been taken ``in kind'' from Murphy-operated properties
and sold by working interest owners; and whether Murphy should be liable for 100% of the overcharges associated with
certain sales of crude oil from Murphy-operated properties as to which the federal government received a royalty
interest. ERA has also considered the time and expense that would be required for the government to litigate every
issue fully. Based on these factors, ERA has tentatively concluded that the resolution of its claims against Murphy
for $10,700,000 is an appropriate settlement and in the public interest. Except as specifically excluded, all pending
and potential civil and administrative disputes, claims and causes of action, whether or not heretofore asserted,
between the DOE and Murphy relating to Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations
are resolved and extinguished by this Consent Order. Murphy and DOE mutually release each other from the claims arising
under the subject matter covered by the proposed Consent Order. 

Under the terms of the proposed Consent Order, Murphy is required to pay the sum of $10,700,000 within thirty (30) days
of the effective date of the Consent Order and shall maintain records as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with
the terms of this Consent Order. 

If the settlement is not made final by the one hundred fiftieth (150th) day following execution, Murphy may withdraw
from the proposed agreement. 


Submission of Written Comments:



The proposed Consent Order cannot be made effective until the conclusion of the public review process, of which this
Notice is a part. 

All comments received by the thirtieth (30th) day following publication of this Notice in the 

Federal Register

 will be considered before determining whether to adopt the proposed Consent Order as a final Order. Any modifications
of the proposed Consent Order which significantly alter its terms or impact will be published for additional comments.
If, after considering the comments it has received, ERA determines to issue the proposed Consent Order as a final Order,
the proposed Order will be made final and effective by publication of a Notice in the 

Federal Register

.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to Use Imidacloprid; Solicitation of Public Comment </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Arizona Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to
as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide imidacloprid (CAS 105827-78-9) to treat up to 55,000 acres
of head and leaf lettuce, 8,500 acres of broccoli, 6,100 acres of cauliflower, and 3,500 acres of cabbage to control
the sweet potato, or silverleaf whitefly (

Bemesia tabaci = argentifolii

). 
The Applicant proposes the first food use of an active ingredient; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA
is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a state agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for the use of imidacloprid on head and leaf lettuce, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower to control the
sweet potato, or silverleaf whitefly (SLW). Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of
this request. 



The Applicant states that a new strain, or possibly a new species, of whitefly, often referred to as the strain B of sweet
potato whitefly, or silverleaf whitefly (SLW), was initially found in Arizona in 1988. Since that time, it has steadily
spread to new host plants and grown in population size each summer and fall. The SLW causes damage by feeding, and also
through the production of honeydew, which encourages growth of sooty mold and other fungi. When SLWs become numerous
as they did in many areas of the state in the past several years, their direct feeding lowers the yield. The SLW has also
been implicated as a vector of virus. The Applicant claims that adequate control of the SLW is not being achieved with
currently registered products and alternative cultural practices. Along with this request, the Applicant has also
requested a specific exemption for use of a different chemical, bifenthrin, on the named crops, for control of the
same pest. The Applicant justifies requests for two chemicals, by stating that the imidacloprid would be applied
once at planting, as a soil treatment; since imidacloprid is a systemic, it would be taken up by the seedling as it germinates,
and protect the emerging seedling. The Applicant states that bifenthrin can only be applied as a foliar spray, which
is of little value during the early establishment phase of seedling development, as there is limited leaf area at that
time. Thus the Applicant proposed that use of bifenthrin be allowed later in the crop season, as a foliar treatment.
The Applicant indicates that imidacloprid would not be of use as both a soil treatment and a foliar spray, because its
mode of action is such that resistance development is a concern. The Registrant of imidacloprid will not support the
use of this chemical further into the growing season for this reason. The Applicant indicates that without adequate
control of the SLW in the named crops, significant economic losses will be suffered.

The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 5 oz. (dry) active ingredient (20 fluid oz. of product)
per acre with a maximum of one application per crop season on a total of 73,100 acres of the above-listed crops. For each
of the crops named, it is possible to produce two crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore, the acreage
could potentially receive two applications of imidacloprid per calendar year. However, the Applicant proposes
to limit the maximum amount which could be applied per calendar year to 0.5 lb. a.i. (32 fl. oz. product) per acre. Therefore,
use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 36,550 lbs. of active ingredient, or 18,275
gal. of product. This is the second time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on the named crops.
The Applicant received specific exemptions last year (1993) for imidacloprid on broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage,
and head and leaf lettuce, and for bifenthrin on broccoli, cauliflower, and head lettuce. In 1992, the Applicant was
granted specific exemptions for the use of bifenthrin for SLW control in broccoli, cauliflower, and head lettuce.

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require publication of a notice of receipt in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing the first food use of an active ingredient.
Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the
address above.

The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemptions requested by the Arizona Department of Agriculture.

<DOCTITLE>Statement of Policy for Termiticide Labeling Revision; Availability for Comment</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is soliciting comments on a proposed policy for revising soil applied and most other termiticide labeling, except
fumigant type termiticides such as sulfuryl fluoride and nitrogen. That policy has been developed in a draft pesticide
regulation (PR) notice, ``Termiticide Labeling,'' which is available upon request. Interested parties may request
a copy of the Agency's proposed policy as set forth in the address section of this notice.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Because of the highly specialized nature of termiticides, a number of issues evolved over the years with regard to
products' labeling: (1) limitations on distribution, sale, or use; (2) precautionary statements; (3) environmental
hazards statements; (4) storage and disposal statements; (5) use directions; (6) the longevity of termiticide treatments;
and (7) application at less-than-labeled rates. In 1988, representatives from the termiticide manufacturing and
user industry, State pesticide regulatory officials, and EPA representatives met voluntarily under the auspices
of the Association of American Pesticide Control Officials (AAPCO) and the State FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation
Group (SFIREG) to identify specific issues to be addressed. The identified issues were set forth in AAPCO/SFIREG's
1989 Termiticide Labeling Report and were endorsed by the Association of Structural Pest Control Regulatory Officials
(ASPCRO).


EPA has reviewed the AAPCO/SFIREG 1989 Termiticide Labeling Report and has developed a draft PR Notice setting forth
proposed policy regarding termiticide lableing and longevity of termiticide treatments. This 

Federal Register

 notice announces the availability of the draft PR Notice and solicits comment on the proposed policy. If, after reviewing
any comments, EPA determines that changes to the Policy are warranted, the Agency will revise the Draft PR Notice prior
to release.

<DOCTITLE>Cadre; Establishment of a Temporary Tolerance </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has established a temporary tolerance for residues of the herbicide cadre in or the raw agricultural commodity
peanut hulls or meat at 0.1 part per million (ppm). 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 American Cyanamid Co., Agricultural Research Division, P.O. Box 400, Princeton, NJ 08543-0400, has requested
in pesticide petition (PP) 3G4203 the establishment of a temporary tolerance for residues of the herbicide cadre
Ammonium salt of (

#

)-2-[4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-5-oxo-1

H

-imidazol-2-yl]-5-methyl-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid in or on the raw agricultural commodity peanut hulls or meat
at 0.1 part per million (ppm). This temporary tolerance will permit the marketing of the above raw agricultural commodity
when treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental use permit 241-EUP-125, which is being issued
under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95-396, 92 Stat.
819; 7 U.S.C. 136). 


The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that establishment
of the temporary tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerance has been established
on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions:

1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 
2. American Cyanamid Co., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing
on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 

This tolerance expires May 31, 1996. Residues not in excess of this amount remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodity
after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of,
and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerance. This tolerance may
be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide
indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. 
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces EPA's receipt of a notification of intent to conduct small-scale testing of four genetically
altered strains of 

Bacillus thuringiensis

 from the Ciba-Geigy Corporation. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing pursuant to the EPA's Statement of Policy entitled
``Microbial Products Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances
Control Act,'' published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313), has been received by Ciba-Geigy Corporation of Greensboro, North Carolina. The purpose
of the proposed testing is to determine the biological activity of the 

Bacillus thuringiensis strains

 CGB203, CGB208, CGB209, and CGB210 against diamondback moth, fall armyworm, beet armyworm, and tomato fruitworm
on cole crops and tomatoes over a 2-year period. These strains have had various 

Bacillus thuringiensis

 cry genes inserted into them via a 

B. thuringiensis - E. coli

 shuttle vector containing a 

B. thuringiensis

 origin of replication and ampicillin and erythromycin resistance markers. One of these strains also had a cry gene
introduced via conjugal transfer between two strains of 

B. thuringiensis

. The testing will take place in Florida on less than 1 acre per strain per year. Plants in the test sites will be plowed
into the soil at the termination of the testing. 


Following review of the Ciba-Geigy Corporation application and any comments received in response to this Notice,
EPA will decide whether or not an Experimental Use Permit is required.

Appendix I



Agreement to Hold Separate


This Agreement to Hold Separate (``Agreement'') is by and between Healthtrust, Inc._The Hospital Company (``respondent''
or ``Healthtrust''), a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the
State of Delaware, with its principal place of business at 4525 Harding Road, Nashville, Tennessee 37205; and the
Federal Trade Commission (``Commission''), an independent agency of the United States Government, established
under the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, 15 U.S.C. 41, 

et seq.
Whereas

, on or about December 3, 1993, respondent entered into an agreement with Holy Cross Health System Corporation (``Holy
Cross''), an Indiana corporation, whereby respondent will acquire from Holy Cross certain Holy Cross assets in Utah
(hereinafter the ``Acquisition''); and


Whereas

, the Commission is now investigating the Acquisition to determine if it would violate any of the statutes enforced
by the Commission; and



Whereas

, if the Commission accepts the attached Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Consent Order''), which would require
the divestiture of certain assets listed in Schedule A of the Consent Order (``Schedule A Assets''), including Holy
Cross Hospital (``HCH'') in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Commission must place the Consent Order on the public record
for a period of at least sixty (60) days and may subsequently withdraw such acceptance pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules' and


Whereas

, the Commission is concerned that if an understanding is not reached, preserving the 

status quo ante

 of the Schedule A Assets during the period prior to the final acceptance and issuance of the Consent Order by the Commission
(after the 60-day public comment period), divestiture resulting from any proceeding challenging the legality of
the Acquisition might not be possible, or might be less than an effective remedy; and


Whereas

, the Commission is concerned that if the Acquisition is consummated, it will be necessary to preserve the Commission's
ability to require the divestiture of the Schedule A Assets as described in Paragraph II of the Consent Order and the
Commission's right to have HCH continue as a viable independent acute care hospital; and


Whereas

, the purpose of this Agreement and the Consent Order is to:
(i) preserve HCH as a viable independent acute care hospital pending its divestiture, and
(ii) remedy any anticompetitive effects of the Acquisition;


Whereas

, respondent's entering into this Agreement shall in no way be construed as an admission by respondent that the Acquisition
is illegal; and


Whereas

, respondent understands that no act or transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed immune or exempt
from the provisions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act by reason of anything contained in this
Agreement.


Now, therefore,

 the parties agree, upon understanding that the Commission has not yet determined whether the Acquisition will be
challenged, and in consideration of the Commission's agreement that, unless the Commission determines to reject
the Consent Order, it will not seek further relief from respondent with respect to the Acquisition, except that the
Commission may exercise any and all rights to enforce this Agreement and the Consent Order to which it is annexed and
made a part thereof, and in the event the required divestiture is not accomplished, to appoint a trustee to seek divestiture
of the Schedule A Assets pursuant to the Consent Order, as follows:
1. Respondent agrees to execute the Agreement Containing Consent Order and be bound by the attached Consent Order.

2. Respondent agrees that from the date this Agreement is accepted until the earliest of the dates listed in subparagraphs
2.a-2.b, it will comply with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Agreement:

a. three (3) business days after the Commission withdraws its acceptance of the Consent Order pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules; or

b. the day after the divestiture required by the Consent Order has been completed.

3. Respondent will hold the Schedule A Assets as they are presently constituted separate and apart on the following
terms and conditions:

a. The Schedule A Assets, as they are presently constituted, shall be held separate and apart and shall be operated
independently of respondent (meaning here and hereinafter, Healthtrust excluding the Schedule A Assets) except
to the extent that respondent must exercise direction and control over the Schedule A Assets to assure compliance
with this Agreement or the Consent Order, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

b. Prior to, or simultaneously with its acquisition of the Holy Cross assets in Utah, respondent shall organize a distinct
and separate legal entity, either a corporation, limited liability company, general or limited partnership (``New
Company'') and adopt constituent documents for the New Company that are not inconsistent with other provisions of
this Agreement or the Consent Order. Respondent shall transfer all ownership and control of all Schedule A Assets
to the New Company.

c. The board of directors of the New Company, or, in the event respondent organizes an entity other than a corporation,
the governing body of the entity (``New Company Board'') shall have five members. Respondent may elect the members
of the New Company Board; provided, however, that the New Company Board shall include no more than two members who are
a director, officer, employee, or agent of respondent (``the respondent's New Company Board member(s)''). The New
Company Board shall include a chairman who is independent of respondent and is competent to assure the continued viability
and competitiveness of the Schedule A Assets. Meetings of the New Company Board during the term of this Agreement shall
be stenographically transcribed and the transcripts retained for two (2) years after the termination of this Agreement.

d. Respondent shall not exercise direction or control over, or influence directly or indirectly, the Schedule A Assets,
the independent Chairman of the Board of the New Company, the New Board, or the New Company or any of its operations or
businesses; provided, however, that respondent may exercise only such direction and control over the New Company
as is necessary to assure compliance with this Agreement or the Consent Order.

e. Respondent shall maintain the viability and competitiveness and the marketability of the Schedule A Assets and
shall not sell, transfer, encumber (other than in the normal course of business), or otherwise impair their viability
and competitiveness or their marketability.

f. Except for the respondent's New Company Board members, respondent shall not permit any director, officer, employee,
or agent of respondent to also be a director, officer, or employee of the New Company.

g. The New Company shall be staffed with sufficient employees to maintain the viability and competitiveness of the
Schedule A Assets, which employees shall be selected from Holy Cross's existing employee base and may also be hired
from sources other than Holy Cross.

h. With the exception of the respondent's New Company Board Members, respondent shall not change the composition
of the New Company Board unless the independent chairman consents. The independent chairman shall have power to remove
members of the New Company Board for cause. Respondent shall not change the composition of the management of the New
Company except that the New Company Board shall have the power to remove management employees for cause.

i. If the independent chairman ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute chairman shall be appointed in
the same manner as provided in Paragraph 3.c. of this Agreement.

j. Except as required by law, and except to the extent that necessary information is exchanged in the course of evaluating
the Acquisition, defending investigations or defending or prosecuting litigation, or negotiating agreements
to divest assets, or complying with this Agreement or the Consent Order, respondent shall not receive or have access
to, or use or continue to use, any material confidential information not in the public domain about the New Company
or the activities of the New Company Board. Nor shall the New Company or the New Company Board receive or have access
to, or use or continue to use, any material confidential information not in the public domain about respondent and
relating to respondent's acute care hospitals in Utah. Respondent may receive on a regular basis aggregate financial
information relating to the New Company necessary and essential to allow respondent to prepare United States consolidated
financial reports, tax returns and personnel reports. Any such information that is obtained pursuant to this subparagraph
shall be used only for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. (``Material confidential information,'' as used
herein, means competitively sensitive or proprietary information not independently known to respondent from sources
other than the New Company, and includes but is not limited to customer lists, price lists, marketing methods, patents,
technologies, processes, or other trade secrets.)

k. Except as permitted by this Agreement, the respondent's New Company Board members shall not in their capacity as
New Company Board members, receive material confidential information and shall not disclose any such information
received under this Agreement to respondent or use it to obtain any advantage for respondent. The respondent's New
Company Board members shall enter a confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of material confidential
information. The respondent's New Company Board members shall participate in matters that come before the New Company
Board only for the limited purposes of considering a capital investment or other transaction exceeding $250,000,
approving any proposed budget and operating plans, and carrying out respondent's responsibilities under this Agreement
and the Consent Order. Except as permitted by this Agreement, the respondent's New Company Board members shall not
participate in any matter, or attempt to influence the votes of the other members of the New Company Board with respect
to matters, that would involve a conflict of interest if respondent and the New Company were separate and independent
entities.

l. If necessary to assure compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the Consent Agreement, or the Consent Order,
respondent may, but is not required to, assign an individual to the New Company for the purpose of overseeing such compliance
(``on-site person''). The on-site person shall have access to all officers and employees of the New Company and such
records of the New Company as he deems necessary and reasonable to assure compliance. Such individual shall enter
into a confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of material confidential information.

m. Any material transaction of the New Company that is out of the ordinary course of business must be approved by a majority
vote of the New Company Board; provided that the New Company shall engage in no transaction, material or otherwise,
that is precluded by this Agreement.

n. All earnings and profits of the New Company shall be retained separately in the New Company. If necessary, respondent
shall provide the New Company with sufficient working capital to operate at its current rate of operation, and to carry
out any capital improvement plans for the New Company which have already been approved.

o. During the period commencing on the date this Agreement is effective and terminating on the earlier of (i) six months
after the date the Consent Order becomes final, or (ii) the date contemplated by subparagraph 2.a (the ``Initial Divestiture
Period''), respondent shall make available for use by the New Company funds sufficient to perform all necessary routine
maintenance to, and replacements of, the Schedule A Assets (``normal repair and replacement''). After termination
of the Initial Divestiture Period and until the earlier of the date contemplated by either subparagraph 2.a or 2.b,
respondent shall make available for use by the New Company each year an amount not less than that required for normal
repair and replacement, plus $1,000,000 for capital improvements to the Schedule A Assets, unless a smaller amount
is requested or required by the New Company, in its sole discretion, for capital expenditures. Provided, however,
that in any event, respondent shall provide the New Company with such funds as are necessary to maintain the viability
and competitiveness and marketability of the Schedule A Assets.

4. Should the Federal Trade Commission seek in any proceeding to compel respondent to divest any of the Schedule A Assets,
as provided in the Consent Order, or to seek any other injunctive or equitable relief for any failure to comply with
the Consent Order or this Agreement, or in any way relating to the Acquisition, as defined in the draft complaint, respondent
shall not raise any objection based upon the expiration of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act waiting period or the fact that the Commission has permitted the Acquisition. Respondent also waives all rights
to contest the validity of this Agreement.

5. To the extent that this Agreement requires respondent to take, or prohibits respondent from taking, certain actions
that otherwise may be required or prohibited by contract, respondent shall abide by the terms of this Agreement or
the Consent Order and shall not assert as a defense such contract requirements in a civil penalty action brought by
the Commission to enforce the terms of this Agreement or Consent Order.

6. For the purpose of determining or securing compliance with this Agreement, subject to any legally recognized privilege,
and upon written request with reasonable notice to respondent made to its principal office, respondent shall permit
any duly authorized representative or representatives of the Commission:

accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of respondent
relating to compliance with this Agreement;

b. Upon five (5) days' notice to respondent, and without restraint or interference from respondent, to interview
officers or employees of respondent, who may have counsel present, regarding any such matters.

7. This Agreement shall not be binding until approved by the Commission.




Analysis of Proposed Consent Order Aid Public Comment




The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, a proposed consent order from Healthtrust
Inc._The Hospital Company (``Healthtrust''). The agreement would settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission
that Healthtrust's proposed acquisition of three hospitals from Holy Cross Health System Corporation (``Holy Cross'')
would have violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, if it had been carried
out.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or issue and serve the agreement's proposed order.

Both Healthtrust and Holy Cross own and operate acute care hospitals in various states, including acute care hospitals
in the Salt Lake City area, encompassing Salt Lake County and southern Davis County; and the Salt Lake City_Ogden Metropolitan
Statistical Area, an area encompassing three contiguous counties in northern Utah: Weber County, Davis County,
and Salt Lake County (``Three-County Area''). The complaint accompanying the proposed consent order concerns the
proposed acquisition's impact upon competition for acute care hospital services in the Salt Lake City area and the
Three-County Area. According to the complaint, Healthtrust owns and operates Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful (in
southern Davis County) and Pioneer Valley Hospital in West Valley City (in Salt Lake County). Holy Cross owns and operates
St. Benedict's Hospital in Ogden (in Weber County), and two acute care hospitals in Salt Lake County, Holy Cross Hospital
in Salt Lake City, and Holy-Cross-Jordan Valley Hospital in West Jordan.

The consent order, if finally accepted by the Commission, would settle charges that the acquisition may substantially
lessen competition in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area. The complaint alleges that Healthtrust and
Holy Cross are competitors in those markets. The hospital markets in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area,
according to the complaint, were already highly concentrated, and entry by new competitors would be difficult. The
complaint alleges that the Commission has reason to believe that the acquisition would have anticompetitive effects
in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area hospital markets, in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, unless an effective remedy eliminates such anticompetitive effects.

The order accepted for public comment contains provisions requiring the divestiture by Healthtrust of the Holy Cross
Hospital and related assets, including interests in five clinics, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The purpose of the divestiture
is to ensure the continuation of Holy Cross Hospital as an ongoing, viable acute care hospital independent of Healthtrust,
and to remedy the lessening of competition in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area hospital markets resulting
from the acquisition.

The proposed order requires Healthtrust to obtain the approval of the Commission for the divestiture of Holy Cross
Hospital. Under the terms of the order, the required divestiture must be completed within six months of the date the
order becomes final. If the required divestiture were not completed within the six-month period, Healthtrust would
consent to the appointment of a trustee, who would have twelve additional months to effect the divestiture. The hold
separate agreement executed as part of the consent order requires Healthtrust, until the completion of the divestiture
or as otherwise specified, to hold separate and preserve all of the assets and businesses of Holy Cross Hospital.

The proposed order provides that approval by the Commission of the divestiture shall be conditioned upon the agreement
by the acquirer that, for ten years from the date of the divestiture, it will not sell, without the prior approval of
the Commission, Holy Cross Hospital to another person operating (or in the process of acquiring) any other acute care
hospital in the Three-County Area.

The order would prohibit Healthtrust from acquiring any acute care hospital in the Three-County Area without the
prior approval of the Federal Trade Commission. It would also prohibit Healthtrust from transferring, without prior
Commission approval, any acute care hospital it operates in the Three-County Area to another person operating (or
in the process of acquiring) an acute care hospital in the area. These provisions, in combination, would give the Commission
authority to prohibit any substantial combination of the acute care hospital operations of Healthtrust with those
of any other acute care hospital in the Three-County Area, unless Healthtrust convinced the Commission that a particular
transaction would not endanger competition in the Salt Lake City area or the Three-County Area. The provisions would
not apply to acquisitions or sales where the value of the transferred assets is $1 million or less, and the provisions
would expire ten years after the order becomes final.

For ten years, the order would prohibit Healthtrust from transferring all or any substantial part of any hospital
in the Three-County Area to another party without first filing with the Commission an agreement by the transferee
to be bound by the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the proposed order, to assist the Commission in
its determination whether to make the order final. This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation
of the agreement and order or to modify their terms in any way.

The agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by Healthtrust that its proposed
acquisition would have violated the law, as alleged in the Commission's complaint.

Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Dennis A. Yao



In HealthTrust/Holy Cross, File No. 941 0020



I voted against acceptance of the proposed consent agreement in this matter, as well as against a previous motion to
seek a preliminary injunction to enjoin HealthTrust from acquiring three Holy Cross hospitals in the Salt Lake City,
Utah, area. The three hospitals to be acquired were: Jordan Valley, a 50-bed hospital located in the Salt Lake City
metropolitan area; St. Benedict's, a 239-bed tertiary level hospital
 located approximately 34 miles north of Salt Lake City in Ogden; and a 200-bed tertiary facility located in downtown
Salt Lake City. In analyzing the original proposed transaction, I concluded that the merger of these two hospital
systems would generate significant net efficiencies that would outweigh any potential anticompetitive effects
of the merger in the Salt Lake City Metropolitan area and throughout the Wasatch Front. Specifically, the Holy Cross
hospitals offered HealthTrust the opportunity to expand its geographic coverage by including hospitals located
throughout the Wasatch Front, and broaden the services it provided by including a downtown Salt Lake City tertiary
care facility.





The proposed consent allows HealthTrust to acquire two of the Holy Cross hospitals, Jordan Valley and St. Benedict's,
while requiring divestiture of the downtown Holy Cross hospital. Allowing HealthTrust to acquire the two Holy Cross
hospitals will give HealthTrust better geographic coverage across the Wasatch Front. However, requiring the divestiture
of the downtown Holy Cross facility means that the newly formed hospital network will not include a tertiary care facility
in the Salt Lake City Metropolitan area.

It was argued in this case (as it has been argued in several recent hospital mergers) that the merging hospital systems
can achieve network and operational efficiencies through acquisition that are not possible through alternative
arrangements such as contracting or joint venturing. Parties have sought to show that contracting and joint venturing
is inefficient as an alternative to outright merger, among other reasons, because of the need to deter ``gaming''
on patient referrals as each hospital attempts to shift costly patients to other hospitals. This argument seems plausible
in this industry because of contracting problems involved in establishing ``capitation'' regimes.

In this particular case, it was argued that purchasing a downtown Salt Lake City tertiary care facility was essential
to achieve network efficiencies and that contracting or joint venturing was an inferior alternative. I find this
argument persuasive.
 Therefore, because I believe that the bulk of the network and operational efficiencies that are possible from this
merger will be lost if the downtown facility is divested, and because I believe that the potential anticompetitive
effects that may have resulted from allowing HealthTrust to acquire the downtown facility are outweighed by those
efficiencies, I have dissented from the issuance of this consent.

Agreement Containing Consent Order To Cease and Desist



The Federal Trade Commission, having initiated an investigation of certain acts and practices of L&S Research
Corporation, a corporation, and Scott Chinery, individually and as an officer of said corporation, and it now appearing
that L&S Research Corporation, a corporation, and Scott Chinery, individually and as an officer of said corporation,
hereinafter sometimes referred to as proposed respondents, are willing to enter into an agreement containing an
Order to cease and desist from the use of the acts and practices being investigated,

It is hereby agreed by and between L&S Research Corporation, by its authorized officer, and Scott Chinery, individually
and as an officer of said corporation that,

1. (a) Proposed respondent L&S Research Corporation is a corporation organized, existing, and doing business
under and by virtue of the laws of the State of New Jersey, with its office and principal place of business located at
450 Oberlin Ave., S., in the City of Lakewood, State of New Jersey.

(b) Proposed respondent Scott Chinery is an officer of said corporation. He formulates, directs, and controls the
policies, acts, and practices of said corporation, and his principal place of business is located at the above stated
address.

2. Proposed respondents admit all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft complaint here attached.

3. Proposed respondents waive:

(a) any further procedural steps;

(b) the requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of facts or conclusion of law;

(c) all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the Order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and

(d) all claims under the Equal Access to Justice Act. 

4. This Agreement shall not become part of the public record in the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this Agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of the Agreement and so notify the proposed
respondents, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.

5. This Agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the proposed respondents
of facts, other than jurisdictional facts, or of violations of law as alleged in the draft complaint here attached,
or that proposed respondents have engaged in any other unlawful conduct.

6. This Agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of  2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may,
without further notice to the proposed respondents, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance
with the draft of complaint here attached and its decision concerning the following Order to cease and desist in disposition

time provided by statute for other orders. The Order shall become final upon service. Delivery to the U.S. Postal Service
of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to Order to proposed respondents' addresses as stated in this
agreement shall constitute service. Proposed respondents waive any right they may have to any other manner of service.
The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the Order, and no agreement, understanding, representation,
or interpretation not contained in the Order or the Agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the Order.

7. Proposed respondents have read the proposed complaint and Order contemplated hereby. They understand that once
the Order has been issued, they will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing they have fully complied
with the Order. Proposed respondents further understand that they may be liable for civil penalties in the amount
provided by law for each violation of the Order after it becomes final.

8. If it is accepted by the Commission, this Agreement constitutes a full settlement between the Commission and proposed
respondents as to the activities alleged in the complaint to have constituted violations of the Federal Trade Commission
Act and which occurred prior to the date of entry of the Order. As to those activities alleged in the complaint, and which
occurred prior to the date of entry of the Order, the Commission hereby releases the proposed respondents from all
other further liability to the Commission.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from respondents L&S Research
Corporation and Scott Chinery.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.



Body Building Products



The Commission's complaint charges that the respondents deceptively advertised Cybergenics Total Body Building
System and Cybergenics for Hard Gainers, two body building products. According to the complaint, the respondents'
advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that either or both body building products:
(1) cause users to lose more body fat and gain more muscle than non-users; (2) cause users to lose body fat and gain muscle
more rapidly than non-users; (3) cause users to gain more muscle than users of other body building products; (4) have
been demonstrated by scientific research to cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (5) work for all people;
and (6) are new and unique.



Weight Loss Products



The Commission's complaint also charges that the respondents deceptively advertised there weight loss products,
Cybergenics CyberTrim, Cybergenics Mega-Fat Burner, and Cybergenics QuickTrim. According to the complaint, the
respondents' advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that one or more of the wright loss
products: (1) cause users to lose body fat and weight more rapidly than non-users; (2) cause users to lose weight and
lose or burn more body fat than non-users; (3) cause users to lose more body fat and weight than users of all other weight
loss products; (4) cause users to lose weight more rapidly than the users of all other weight loss products; (5) are
superior to other appetite suppressants; (6) suppress hunger and the biochemical message stimulated by the catabolism
of fat; (7) cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (8) contain an ingredient, chromium picolinate, that has
been clinically proven to reduce fat and lower cholesterol; (9) are new and unique; (10) cause users to maintain weight
loss longer than non-users; (11) cause maturing women to lose more weight than non-users of the product; (12) are easy
to use; and (13) have been demonstrated by scientific evidence to cause users to lose more fat and weight, and to gain
more muscle, than non-users.



Use of Testimonials



The Commission's complaint also charges that statements and depictions, including ``before'' and ``after'' pictures,
in the respondents' advertisements for their body building and weight loss products, represent that the testimonials
from consumers who use the advertised product reflect the typical or ordinary experience of members of the public
who use the products. According to the complaint, the respondents did not have a reasonable basis for this representation.

In addition, the complaint alleges that the use of a picture of a man in an advertisement for Cybergenics Total Body
Building System ``before'' and ``after'' he used the product for six months is false and misleading. The man pictured
in the advertisement, according to the complaint, was a champion body builder prior to the time when the ``before''
picture was taken and, therefore, is not typical of users of the product, and his results as shown in the ``after'' picture
are not typical of the experience of ordinary members of the public who use the product.

Proposed Order



Part I of the proposed order prohibits representations that the product component of either of the body building products
named in the complaint, or any substantially similar product:

(1) causes users to achieve greater or more rapid loss of fat or gain of muscle than non-users of the product; or 

(2) works for all users.

Part II of the proposed order prohibits representations that the product component of any of the three weight loss
products named in the complaint, or any substantially similar product:

(1) causes users to maintain weight loss longer than non-users; or

(2) causes maturing women to lose more weight than non-users.

Part III prohibits respondents from representing that scientific evidence establishes that the product component
of any of the body building and weight loss products named in the complaint causes users to lose more fat or weight, or
gains more muscle, than non-users.

Part IV requires the respondents to cease from making a number of representations about any product or program unless
they have substantiation consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence. The claims that are prohibited
unless substantiated are as follows:

(1) that any product or program causes or assists users to lose fat or weight or to maintain weight loss, or suppresses
hunger or appetite;

(2) that any product or program causes or assists in muscle gain or development;

(3) that any product or program works for all users;

(4) that chromium picolinate in any product or used in conjunction with any program builds muscle, reduces fat, or
lowers cholesterol; and 

(5) that any product or program intended for body building, weight loss, or fat loss is more effective than other products
or programs intended for similar purposes.

Part V of the proposed order requires respondents to have substantiation, which when appropriate must consist of
competent and reliable scientific evidence, for believing that endorsements, including ``before'' and ``after''
pictures, represent the typical or ordinary experience of users of any product or program. However, the respondents
may use any endorsement if they disclose clearly and prominently in close proximity to the endorsement what the generally
expected performance would be in the depicted circumstances, or that consumers should not expect to achieve results
similar to those of the endorser.

Part VI prohibits the respondents from misrepresenting that any product or program is new or unique, or that any product
or program intended for weight loss is easy to use if achieving the advertised results requires a special diet or exercise.

Part VII requires the respondents to cease misrepresenting the contents, validity, or results of any study in connection
with the marketing or any product or program.

Part VIII requires the respondents to pay $1,450,000 to the United States Treasury and provides that none of this amount
is deemed to be a fine, penalty, or punitive assessment.

The remaining provisions are standard record keeping and reporting provisions designed to ensure that the respondents
remain in compliance with the other provisions of the order.

Concurring Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga in L&S Research Corporation, File No. 912-3004



The Commission has strong evidence supporting the central allegations in this complaint, and I have voted to accept
the consent agreement for public comment. In my view, however, the complaint should not allege that the maintenance
claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing women weight loss claim for QuickTrim were false. I am inclined to believe
that the claims are false but I would prefer to have some corroborating evidence of falsity before finding reason to
believe that Section 5 of the FTC Act has been violated. Because the available information shows only that there is
no evidence that these claims are true, it seems to me more appropriate to allege that they are unsubstantiated.

In addition, the QuickTrim weight loss allegations seem inconsistent in light of the evidence. The complaint alleges
that the weight loss claim for maturing women users of QuickTrim is false but alleges that the same claim for all users
of QuickTrim is unsubstantiated. Yet we have no evidence indicating that the weight loss claims are any more likely
to be false for maturing women than for users generally.

I therefore do not support the complaint to the extent that the maintenance claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing
women weight loss claim for QuickTrim are alleged to be false, not unsubstantiated.

drugstore chain to divest, within one year of the order, to a Commission approved acquirer, all assets related to the
retail sale of prescription drugs in either the respondent's store or in the acquired Hook-SupeRx (HSI) retail store
in each of three geographic areas, and to complete the divestiture within one year. If not complete in that period of
time, the order would require the respondent to consent to the appointment of a trustee to divest the assets. In addition,
the proposed consent agreement would require the respondent to obtain prior Commission approval, for ten years,
before acquiring any similar business interest in any of the three specified towns.

Agreement Containing Consent Order



The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') having initiated an investigation of the proposed acquisition of
all of the voting stock of Hook SupeRx, Inc. (``HSI''), by Revco D.S., Inc. (``Revco''), and it is now appearing that
Revco, hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``Proposed Respondent,'' is willing to enter into an agreement containing
an order (``Agreement'') to divest certain assets, and to cease and desist from making certain acquisitions, and
providing for certain other relief:
It is hereby agreed by and between Proposed Respondent, by its duty authorized officers and attorneys, and counsel
for the Commission that: 
1. Proposed Respondent Revco is a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by the virtue of the
laws of the State of Delaware with its office and principal place of business located at 1925 Enterprise Parkway, Twinsburg,
Ohio 44087. 
2. Proposed Respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached.
3. Proposed Respondent waives:
a. any further procedural steps;
b. the requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;

c. all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and 
d. any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
4. This Agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this Agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the Proposed
Respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding. 
5. This Agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by Proposed Respondent that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the draft
complaint, other than the jurisdictional facts, are true. 
6. This Agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission
may, without further notice to the Proposed Respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance
with the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following Order to divest and to cease and
desist in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public with respect thereto. When so entered, the
Order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner and within the
same time provided by statute for other orders. The Order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the United States
Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to Order to Proposed Respondent's address as
stated in this Agreement shall constitute service. Proposed Respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner
of services. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the Order, and no agreement, understanding, representation,
or interpretation not contained in the Order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the Order.

7. Proposed Respondent has read the proposed Complaint and Order contemplated hereby. Proposed Respondent understands
that once the Order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully
complied with the Order. Proposed Respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the
amount provided by law for each violation of the Order after it becomes final.

II





It is further ordered

 That: 

A. Respondent shall divest, absolutely and in good faith, within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes
final, the Assets To Be Divested.

B. Respondent shall divest the Assets To Be Divested only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive the prior approval
of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose of the divestiture
of the Assets To Be Divested is to ensure the continued use of the Assets To Be Divested as ongoing viable pharmacies
engaged in the same businesses in which the Assets To Be Divested are presently employed and to remedy the lessening
of competition resulting from the acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint.

C. Pending divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested, Respondent shall take such actions as are necessary to maintain
the competitiveness, viability and marketability of the Assets To Be Divested and to prevent the destruction, removal,
wasting, deterioration, or impairment of any Assets To Be Divested except for ordinary wear and tear.

D. If a divestiture includes a lease of physical space, and if pursuant to that lease Respondent through default of
the lease or otherwise regains possession of the space, Respondent must notify the Commission of such repossession
within thirty (30) days and must redivest such assets or interest pursuant to Paragraph II of this Order within six
(6) months of such repossession. If Respondent has not redivested such assets or interest pursuant to Paragraph II
of this Order within six (6) months of such repossession, the provisions of Paragraph III shall apply to these assets.



III





It is further ordered

 That:

A. If Respondent has not divested, absolutely and in good faith and with the Commission's prior approval, the Assets
To Be Divested within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes final, the Commission may appoint a trustee
to divest the Assets To Be Divested. In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to
 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.  45(l), or any other statute enforced by the Commission,
Respondent shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a
decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from
seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to  5(l)
of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by Respondent
to comply with this Order.

B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. of this Order, Respondent shall
consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities:

1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Respondent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If Respondent
has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten
(10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to Respondent of the identity of any proposed trustee, Respondent
shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee.

2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest
the Assets To Be Divested.

3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, Respondent shall execute a trust agreement that, subject
to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the
trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestiture required by this Order.

4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in
Paragraph III.B.3 to accomplish the divestiture, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission.
If, however, at the end of the twelve-month period the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that
divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time, the divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or
in the case of a court-appointed trustee by the court.
5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities related to the
Assets To Be Divested, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may reasonably request. Respondent shall
develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the trustee.
Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any
delays in divestiture caused by Respondent shall extend the time for divestiture under this Paragraph in an amount
equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed trustee, by the court.
6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract
that is submitted to the Commission subject to Respondent's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no
minimum price. The divestiture shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer or acquirers as set out in Paragraph II
of this Order. 

Provided, however, 

if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquirer, and if the Commission determines to approve more
than one such acquirer, the trustee shall divest to the acquirer or acquirers selected by Respondent from among those
approved by the Commission.
7. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of Respondent, on such reasonable
and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have authority to employ,
at the cost and expense of Respondent, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business
brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are reasonably necessary to carry out the trustee's
duties and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses
incurred. After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account
of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Respondent
and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part
on a commission arrangement contingent on the trustee's divesting the Assets To Be Divested.

8. Respondent shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, and Respondent shall either
defend against such claims or pay the trustee's expenses, including all reasonable fees of counsel and other expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense of any such claim, whether or not resulting in any liability,
except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses result from misfeasance, gross
negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee.
9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner
as provided in Paragraph III.A. of this Order.
10. The Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, the court, may on its own initiative or at the request
of the trustee issue such additional orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the divestiture
required by this Order.
11. The trustee shall have no obligation or authority to operate or maintain the Assets To Be Divested.
12. The trustee shall report in writing to Respondent and to the Commission every sixty (60) days concerning the trustee's
efforts to accomplish divestiture.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment


The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent
Order from Revco D.S., Inc. (``Revco'') under which Revco would divest pharmacy assets in three (3) geographic locations
where it faces limited competition. Revco operates the Revco chain of drug stores.
The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.
On March 31, 1994 Revco and Hook-SupeRx, Inc. (``HSI'') executed an Agreement and Plan or Merger providing for the
acquisition by Revco of all of the voting securities of HSI. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition,
if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  18, and Section
5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  45, in the market for the sale of prescription drugs in retail stores in
the following towns: Covington, Virginia; Marion, Virginia; and Radford, Virginia (hereinafter ``relevant geographic
area''). The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by maintaining the current number of competitors
in the relevant geographic areas where Revco and HSI are direct competitors and where they face limited competition.
The proposed Consent Order provides that within one (1) year of the Order becoming final, Revco shall divest all assets
related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in Revco or HSI retail stores in the relevant geographic areas. The
divestiture of the Revco or HSI pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas shall be made only to an acquirer
or acquirers that receive prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of
the Commission. The assets shall be divested to an eligible acquirer or acquirers that will operate a pharmacy business
in the relevant geographic areas. Eligible acquirers in each relevant geographic area include, but are not limited
to: owners of retail stores that currently do not operate a pharmacy in that relevant geographic area; persons previously
employed by Revco or HSI; or persons who will open a new retail store. In the event that Revco has not divested the Revco
or HSI pharmacy assets in the relevant areas in one (1) year, the proposed Consent Order provides that Revco shall consent
to the appointment by the Commission of a trustee to divest the pharmacy assets.
Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Revco is also required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance
with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and
every sixty (60) days thereafter until Revco has completely divested its interest in assets related to the retail
sale of prescription drugs in the relevant geographic areas. The proposed Order will also prohibit Revco, for a period
of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Federal Trade Commission approval, any stock in any concern engaged in
the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas or any assets used for the business
of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas.
One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Revco will be required to
provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Revco
to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) day prior to any change in the structure of Revco resulting in the emergence
of a successor.
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

ACTION:

 Request for comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Center for Environmental Health, CDC, is recommending 

minimum standards

 for prehospital and hospital emergency medical services' readiness in communities near the eight locations where
the U.S. stockpile of lethal chemical weapons is stored.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 CDC Recommendations for Civilian Communities Near Chemical Weapons Depots: Guidelines for Medical Preparedness.



I. Executive Summary



In 1985, Congress mandated that unitary chemical warfare agents be destroyed in such a manner as to provide maximum
protection for the environment, the public, and personnel involved in destroying the agents. The National Center
for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was delegated review and oversight
responsibility for any Department of the Army (DA) plans to dispose of or transport chemical weapons (Public Law 91-121
and 91-441, Armed Forces Appropriation Authorization of 1970 and 1971).

As part of its ongoing efforts to improve medical preparedness within the medical sector of civilian communities
surrounding chemical agent depots, CDC has developed the following medical preparedness and response guidelines.
These guidelines represent 

minimum standards

 of medical preparedness for civilian communities that might be exposed to chemical warfare agents during the incineration
or storage process. These guidelines were developed in cooperation with a panel of recognized experts in the fields
of emergency medicine, disaster preparedness, nursing, chemical warfare preparedness, and the prehospital emergency
medical system.



II. Background



In 1985, Congress mandated that unitary chemical warfare agents be destroyed in such a manner as to provide maximum
protection for the environment, the public, and the personnel involved in destroying the agents. This mandate was
further defined in the Department of Defense (DOD) Authorization Act of 1986, Public Law 99-145. Consistent
with its desire to promote the most environmentally safe method of destroying chemical agents, the National Research
Council determined that incineration is the best method for disposing of the weapons(1). In 1988, The Authorization
Act was amended to permit DA to set up a prototype incineration facility on Johnston Island in the Pacific in order to
verify the safety of such an operation. To date, more than 700,000 pounds of chemical agent have been safely incinerated
there.

NCEH, CDC, was delegated the responsibility of reviewing and overseeing any DA plans to dispose of or transport chemical
weapons (Public Law 91-121 and 91-441, Armed Forces Appropriation Authorization of 1970 and 1971). In
addition, an interagency agreement between CDC and DA requires CDC to provide technical assistance to the DA in protecting
the public health in nearby communities during the destruction of unitary chemical agents and weapon systems.

Currently, large quantities of chemical warfare agents are stored in eight facilities in the continental United
States. These chemical stockpiles consist primarily of nerve agents, mustard agents, or a combination of both. In
Tooele, Utah, construction of the chemical agent incinerator is now complete, and destruction of the weapons and
chemicals in this depot is scheduled to begin in Spring of 1995. To improve the ability of local health care personnel
to handle emergencies related to a chemical agent release, CDC has presented medical preparedness courses to civilian
medical personnel on sites adjacent to the eight chemical weapons depots on 13 occasions. Emergency physicians,
nurses, internists, surgeons, hospital administrators, and prehospital emergency medical responders have attended
these courses.

As part of its ongoing efforts to improve medical readiness in civilian communities surrounding chemical agent depots,
CDC developed medical preparedness and response guidelines. These guidelines represent 

minimum standards

 for medical preparedness in civilian communities that might be inadvertently exposed to chemical warfare agents
during the incineration or storage process. These guidelines were developed in cooperation with a working group
of recognized experts in the fields of emergency medicine, disaster preparedness, nursing, chemical stockpile
emergency preparedness, and prehospital emergency medical systems. These guidelines do not supersede current
medical and public health practices and requirements (e.g., precautions for handling bodily fluids).

The following recommendations for civilian community response to the release of a chemical agent are divided into
prehospital and hospital. The recommendations are designed to ensure high quality medical preparedness for chemical
agent emergencies. Appendix A is a summary of important questions to ask when evaluating medical preparedness in
the civilian prehospital and hospital environments. The prehospital environment encompasses all areas outside
both the installation boundaries and the hospital grounds. People potentially affected in the prehospital environment
include the general public, and first responders. First responders include police, sheriff's, and fire department
personnel, hazardous materials response teams, and medical response teams (including emergency medical technicians,
paramedics, and any other medically-trained personnel responding to the site of injury with the ambulance teams).
The hospital environment includes primarily the emergency department but encompasses outside areas which might
be used for triage and decontamination and other hospital departments which might support the hospital's response.



III. Recommendations for Prehospital Medical Preparedness



 Integrate all local medical emergency response plans related to the release of a chemical agent into the overall
State or local disaster response plan.

 Provide protective equipment for all members of the local medical response team.

 Train members of the local medical response team in these measures:




_Prevention of secondary contamination from chemically exposed patients.

_Decontamination procedures.

_Evaluation of the medical needs of chemically exposed patients.

_Treatment of large groups of patients.

_Transportation of victims to a medical facility.



1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)



Chemical protective clothing and respiratory protection enable responders to care for patients exposed to chemicals
while protecting themselves from secondary contamination.

 Ensure that such equipment protects the skin, eyes, and respiratory tracts of the emergency responders.

 Use DA battledress overgarments (BDOs) and portable air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) with an organic vapor
cartridge to protect civilians from chemical warfare agents. BDOs can be used for up to 24 hours in an agent-contaminated
environment at levels of up to 10 grams of agent per square meter of surface area. Notwithstanding this recommendation,
however, civilian emergency responders should use the equipment with which they are most familiar, providing that
the equipment used is at least as protective as the above CDC recommendations.

 Train personnel required to use personal protective equipment when responding to chemical agent-related
emergencies in accordance with the guidelines published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).



2. First Responders



 Ensure that all persons (e.g., medics, paramedics, fire fighters, or medical personnel) designated by the
State or local disaster plans as members of the initial medical team that responds to a chemical warfare agent release
have the appropriate level of PPE and are trained in its proper use (2).

 Ensure that equipment of first responders is 

adequately maintained

 and available at all times.

 Schedule regular drills and training sessions designed to maintain first responders' familiarity with equipment
into State and local disaster plans.



3. The Public



CDC does not recommend distributing PPE (e.g., gas masks or protective suits) to the public. In the unlikely event
that a chemical agent release threatens the civilian population adjacent to a military facility, CDC recommends
the following graded emergency response:

 Evacuate the population at risk in accordance with State or local disaster management guidelines. If no local
guidelines exist, follow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and DA joint guidelines for evacuating
civilian populations threatened by chemical warfare agents (3).

 Follow FEMA and DA recommendations for sheltering the population in place (e.g., keep people in their homes,
institutions, or places of business and seal windows and doors from an external vapor threat) if it is not practical
to evacuate the population (3).



4. Decontamination



Decontamination is the careful and systematic removal of hazardous substances from victims, equipment, and the
environment. Transporting contaminated patients exposes emergency response personnel to chemical warfare agents
and contaminates rescue vehicles. Proper decontamination prevents secondary contamination and chemical injury
to medical and rescue personnel. Acceptable decontamination guidelines for persons who may possibly have been exposed
to chemical warfare agents are published by FEMA and DA (3,4).

 Decontamination of patients can be achieved by mechanically removing, diluting, absorbing, or neutralizing
the chemical agent.

<DOCNO> FR940727-2-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-2-00028 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Decontaminate all persons who may possibly have been contaminated with a chemical warfare agent before they
are transported to a hospital. 
 Decontamination substances should be readily available. Suitable decontamination substances include
soap, water, and 5% hypochlorite. 
 To protect the environment, include in State and local disaster plans a method for containing and disposing
of contaminated runoff. CDC does not recommend establishing fixed decontamination units in prehospital areas because
of the expense and inflexibility of such units. 


5. Level of Medical Preparedness Training 


 

At a minimum, 

train persons designated as prehospital medical responders in evaluating patients exposed to chemical warfare
agents, managing patients' airways (excluding intubation), transporting patients, and decontaminating patients.


 Train prehospital responders who have been designated in State or local disaster plans to operate in environments
contaminated by a chemical warfare agent in the proper use of PPE in accordance with OSHA guidelines (2). 

 Ensure that, 

at a minimum

, physicians who have been designated in State and local disaster plans to provide medical supervision for prehospital
emergency responders and medical care for victims of a chemical agent release receive specialized training through
continuing education in the emergency response areas specified for prehospital responders. 



6. Patient Triage 



 The basic premise of patient triage, to provide maximum benefit to the greatest number of victims, is of utmost
importance during a mass-casualty event involving chemical agents. 


 Have the most experienced responder conduct triage operations. 

 Base decisions regarding patient triage on local resources, the extent of patient contamination, the type
of chemical warfare agent to which the patient is exposed, the patient's clinical status, and the likelihood of additional
traumatic injuries. 



7. Public Information 



 Inform the public appropriately, accurately, and rapidly about chemical agent exposures that have or may
have occurred. 

 Establish, through the local emergency medical services (EMS) and hospital community, a coordinated public
information policy for chemical emergencies. 

 Contact local and regional news media in advance to establish an accurate and rapid way of disseminating critical
information to the public concerning a chemical agent emergency. 

 Ensure that hospital and EMS personnel coordinate their plans to provide public information with the plans
of those who have overall responsibility for emergency response. 



8. Communication 



Medical personnel must have access to the emergency communication network 24 hours a day. Such a network should link
the chemical agent depot, local and regional EMS, and all potential receiving hospitals. 

 Have medical personnel demonstrate the ability to access the emergency communications network during any
evaluation of preparedness for a chemical warfare release into civilian communities. 

 Ensure that the hospitals' emergency communications system allows hospital personnel to verify rapidly
whether a chemical warfare agent release has occurred. 



9. Transporting Exposed Victims 



 Coordinate the transportation of chemical agent-exposed victims with the overall disaster response plan,
and include a method for tracking transported patients during an emergency response. 

 Transport patients only after they have been properly decontaminated. 
 Transport decontaminated patients to medical facilities (e.g., hospitals, clinics, and urgent care centers).


 Formal agreements such as memorandums of understanding (MOUs) between organizations that transport patients
and the medical facilities that receive them must be part of the planning process. Medical facilities designated
to receive should be capable of evaluating and managing patients exposed to chemical agents as described later in
the hospital section (Section IV) of this document. 

 Base decisions regarding urgent and emergency transfers of decontaminated patients on the capabilities
of the receiving facilities, transportation resources, demand for hospital services, and the clinical condition
of the patients. Certain medical care (e.g., for burns, pediatric emergencies, trauma, or pulmonary complications)
might require prearrangements for patients to be transferred to a tertiary treatment center. CDC recommends that
transfer and evacuation 

plans 

for victims exposed to chemical warfare agents call for land_rather than air_transportation.

10. Medical Evaluation and Treatment 


 Train medical response personnel specifically to assess and manage patients exposed to chemical agents stored
at the nearby military depot. 
 Decontaminate all exposed patients as described above. 
 Provide medical treatment (during or after contamination), according to accepted treatment modalities,
to patients exposed to nerve or mustard agents. If antidotes to nerve agents are used in the field by civilian medical
responders as designated in State or local disaster plans, CDC recommends using single-dose, pre-armed autoinjectors,
unless a higher level of medical response has already been integrated into EMS operations. Additional information
on the effects of chemical warfare agents and accepted medical protocols for caring for patients exposed to mustard
or nerve agents is available (5-14). 


IV. Recommendations for Hospital Preparedness 


1. Primary Receiving Hospitals 


A primary receiving hospital is a hospital that is designated by State or local disaster plans to provide initial medical
care to the civilian population in the event of a chemical warfare agent release. Such hospitals must have established
protocols detailing evaluation, decontamination, and treatment procedures for patients exposed to chemical warfare
agents. 
 Include evaluation, treatment, and decontamination protocols in the hospitals' disaster plans. 
 Include chemical warfare agent scenarios in disaster drills for hospitals that have been designated in State
or local disaster plans to receive patients exposed to chemical warfare agents. 


2. Triage Considerations 


 Do 

not

 allow patients exposed to a chemical warfare agent to enter the emergency department without adequate evaluation
and decontamination. Signs of mustard agent 
exposure, in particular, may require 24-48 hours before they become clinically evident. 
 Train medical staff designated by the hospital disaster plan to perform triage during an emergency related
to chemical warfare agents to recognize the physical signs and symptoms of patients who have been exposed to such agents.

 Base modifications to patient triage procedures on the extent of patient contamination, the type of chemical
warfare agent to which the patient has been exposed, the patient's clinical status, and the possibility of additional
traumatic injuries. Priorities for medical treatment of patients should be determined by the most appropriately
trained and experienced medical professional. 


3. Security 


 Address issues related to emergency department security during disasters in the hospital disaster plan.

 Restrict access to the hospital to prevent contaminated patients from entering the hospital. During a chemical
agent release, security personnel should direct all patients to enter the hospital only through the triage area.



4. Decontamination 


 Decontaminate all persons who may have been contaminated with a chemical warfare agent. Proper decontamination
prevents secondary contamination and chemical injury to medical and rescue personnel. Acceptable decontamination
guidelines for persons exposed to chemical warfare agents are published by FEMA and DA (3,4). 
 Have decontamination substances readily available. Suitable decontamination substances include soap,
water, and 5% hypochlorite. 
 In the hospital disaster plan, detail a method for catching contaminated runoff from patients whether decontamination
is done inside or outside the hospital.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940727-2-00060 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-2-00028 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 

At a minimum

, be capable of decontaminating at least one nonambulatory patient. 
 During and after chemical agent releases that cause mass casualties, decontaminate patients outdoors. Having
indoor decontamination facilities does not obviate a hospital's need to have plans for decontaminating patients
outdoors during mass casualty situations. 
 Design hospital disaster plans, keeping in mind the possibility of integrating local emergency response
resources. Such resources could include hazardous materials emergency response teams or portable decontamination
vehicles or facilities. 
 In cold weather, set up temporary shelters and heaters to protect patients from extreme environmental conditions
when undergoing decontamination outdoors. 
 Have in place a method of controlling the flow of air in the decontamination area to prevent such air from contaminating
other areas of the hospital. 
 Set up a system to allow medical personnel in the decontamination area to be in continuous communication with
other medical personnel in the emergency department. 


5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 


Chemical protective clothing and respiratory protection enable responders to care for chemically exposed patients
while protecting themselves from secondary contamination. This equipment must protect the skin, eyes, and respiratory
tracts of the responders. 

 Use DA BDOs and PAPRs with organic vapor cartridges to protect civilian personnel against chemical warfare
agents. The BDO can be used in an agent-contaminated environment for up to 24 hours at contamination levels of up to
10 grams of agent per square meter of surface area. 
 Have hospital personnel follow Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) guidelines when managing patients exposed to unknown chemicals. 
 Have hospital emergency responders use the equipment with which they are most familiar, providing that such
equipment is at least as protective as the equipment recommended by CDC. 
 Train response personnel to use PPE when responding to a chemical agent emergency according to OSHA guidelines
(2). 


6. Level of Training 


 Train medical staff designated by the hospital disaster plan to provide direct patient care during a chemical
warfare agent emergency to a level of medical preparedness that allows them to assess, decontaminate, and manage
the treatment of victims of chemical warfare agent releases. 
 Medical staff who are required to wear decontamination attire in decontamination procedures must receive
training in the use of PPE according to OSHA regulations (2-4). 


7. Transportation of Patients to Other Medical Facilities 


 Have prearranged written agreements with those medical facilities that agree to accept patients who are exposed
to military chemical agents. 
 Do not transfer patients without notifying the hospital and having the patient accepted by a physician. 
 Have standardized forms available to record patient information and management status. 


8. Specific Antidotes 


 Have decontaminating solutions available in the emergency department. If nerve agents are stored adjacent
to the civilian community, have atropine in multiple-dose units available in the emergency department and in the
hospital pharmacy. In addition, have the hospital pharmacy stock atropine and pralidoxime in sufficient quantities
to cope with the anticipated number of patients who could be managed by that facility in response to a chemical warfare
agent release. Atropine and pralidoxime should be administered intravenously in the emergency environment. 


9. Hospital Disaster Plan 


 Include plans for providing medical care for patients exposed to chemical agents in the hospital's disaster
plan. 
 Have in place a method for using the emergency communication system so that reports of a chemical warfare agent
release can be verified rapidly. Also include provisions to coordinate activities with State and local disaster
plans for mass decontamination. 
 Include in disaster drills scenarios in which patients have become exposed to chemical warfare agents. 
 Use the hospital quality assurance program to review disaster drills and decontamination procedures and
to assist in maintaining the professional skills of hospital personnel necessary to treat the effects of exposure
to a chemical warfare agent.

10. Tertiary Hospitals 



A tertiary receiving hospital is a hospital that receives referrals from primary receiving hospitals. Additional
services such as burn care, psychiatric service, and toxicologic consultation are available at the level of care.


 Ensure that tertiary hospitals designated by State or local disaster plans to provide care for persons exposed
to chemical warfare agents have, at a minimum, emergency response capabilities similar to those of the primary receiving
hospital. 

 Ensure that tertiary hospitals coordinate their disaster plans with State and local disaster plans for mass
decontamination of persons exposed to chemical warfare agents.

Appendix A Summary of Important Medical Preparedness Considerations 
for Communities Surrounding Chemical Agent Stockpiles 



1. Do the communities that surround chemical warfare agent depots have a disaster plan that details the role of the
prehospital and hospital medical community during a chemical warfare agent emergency? 

2. If medical personnel are designated to treat chemical warfare agent casualties, do they have adequate training
to meet minimal standards for evaluating, decontaminating, and treating victims of a chemical warfare agent release?


3. Do medical personnel who are designated by State, local, and hospital disaster plans to use PPE in response to an
emergency related to chemical warfare agents have the necessary OSHA level of training to use these devices effectively
and safely? 

4. If the local disaster plan has provisions to evacuate or transfer patients to other hospitals for further treatment
and evaluation, do existing MOUs cover the transfer of chemically contaminated patients? 

5. Do hospitals named in the State or local disaster plans have an adequate stockpile of antidotes and decontamination
solutions to provide complete medical treatment to at least one chemically contaminated patient? 

6. Are hospitals named in the State or local disaster plans able to decontaminate at least one nonambulatory patient
exposed to chemical warfare agent? 

7. Do the disaster plans of hospitals named to receive patients by State and local disaster plans have specific provisions
which detail how they will control access to their medical facilities during a chemical warfare agent emergency?


8. Are all levels of the medical community that are designated by State or local disaster plans to respond to a chemical
warfare agent emergency able to communicate via either the State or local disaster communication network?

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces a forthcoming meeting of a public advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
This notice also summarizes the procedures for the meeting and methods by which interested persons may participate
in open public hearings before FDA's advisory committees.




MEETING: 

The following advisory committee meeting is announced:



Generic Drugs Advisory Committee With Dermatologic Drugs Advisory Committee Representation



Date, time, and place

. September 12 and 13, 1994, 8:30 a.m., Parklawn Bldg., conference rms. G, H, I, and J, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD.



Type of meeting and contact person

. Open committee discussion, September 12, 1994, 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.; open public hearing, 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., unless public
participation does not last that long; open committee discussion, 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.; open committee discussion, September
13, 1994, 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.; open public hearing, 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., unless public participation does not last that long;
open committee discussion, 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.; Kimberly L. Topper, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-9),
Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301-443-5455.



General function of the committee

. The committee gives advice on scientific and technical issues concerning the safety and effectiveness of human
generic drug products for use in the treatment of a broad spectrum of human diseases and makes appropriate recommendations
to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs,
and the Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The committee may also review agency sponsored intramural
and extramural biomedical research programs in support of FDA's generic drugs regulatory responsibilities.



Agenda_Open public hearing

. Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.
Those desiring to make formal presentations should notify the contact person before September 1, 1994, and submit
a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of
proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time required to make their comments.



Open committee discussion

. In April 1992, the Generic Drugs Advisory Committee met to consider methods for documenting the bioequivalence
of topical corticosteroids. Subsequently, on July 1, 1992, the Office of Generic Drugs issued a guidance document
entitled ``Interim Guidance for Topical Corticosteroids: 

In Vivo

 Bioequivalence and 

In Vitro

 Release Methods.'' The purpose of the September 1994 meeting is to reexamine the 1992 interim guidance in light of
new experimental data and methods of analysis. On September 12, 1994, the committee will discuss the pharmacodynamic
(i.e., vasoconstrictor) measurement of bioequivalence. On September 13, 1994, this topic will be further discussed
along with other issues related to the documentation of equivalence according to the interim guidance. Discussion
will be limited to dermatologic products and will not include ophthalmic or inhaled corticosteroid products. Also,
on September 13, 1994, there will be a review of the current status of topics discussed at previous Generic Drugs advisory
committee meetings.

FDA public advisory committee meetings may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public hearing, (2)
an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation. Every advisory
committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three
portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. There are no closed portions for the meetings announced
in this notice. The dates and times reserved for the open portions of each committee meeting are listed above.

The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.

Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.

Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.

Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.

The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.

Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI-35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A-16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 

This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Wells Resource Management Plan (RMP) Draft Elk Amendment and Environmental Assessment (EA) is available to the
public for a 30 day review period. This draft amendment analyzes the impacts of several alternatives for managing
elk in the BLM's Wells Resource Area, Elko County, Nevada. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Through a review of elk habitat management in the Wells Resource Area, it was determined that elk numbers and habitat
use areas are expanding from those identified in the Wells RMP Record of Decision, approved July 16, 1985. Elk are recognized
as highly adaptable creatures and during recent years have pioneered to adjacent previously unoccupied habitats
in the Wells Resource Area from the Pilot Mountain Management Area, northwestern Utah and southern Idaho. 



The purpose of this amendment is to establish elk habitat management areas, identify habitat requirements and specific
management objectives and practices, establish target elk population management levels, develop factors for attainment
and future adjustments in elk population management levels, and identify constraints on other resources within
the Wells Resource Area. 

Copies of the draft amendment are available from the BLM's Elko District Office.

<AGENCY>

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of document availability and public comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan
for the Texas trailing phlox (

Phlox nivalis

 spp. 

texensis

) which the Service listed as an endangered species on September 30, 1991 (56 FR 49639). The plant, Texas trailing phlox,
is known from two sites, one each in Tyler and Hardin counties, Texas. The Service solicits review and comment from
the public on this draft plan.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Restoring an endangered or threatened plant or animal to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe site specific management actions considered necessary for conservation and survival
of the species, establish objective, measurable criteria for recovery levels for downlisting or delisting species,
and estimate time and cost for implementing recovery measures needed. 

The Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote conservation of
a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988 requires that public notice and an opportunity for
public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal
agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. 

The Texas trailing phlox is an endangered species known from one site on private land in Tyler County and one population
in Hardin County located mostly on land owned by The Nature Conservancy, with a few plants occurring on adjoining roadside
rights-of-way and private property. The plant is restricted to sandy soils in open pine woodlands. Texas trailing
phlox is threatened primarily by habitat loss due to canopy closure, encroachment of hardwood trees, and soil disturbance
associated with human activities. 

The Texas trailing phlox recovery plan has been reviewed by the appropriate Service staff in Region 2. The plan will
be finalized and approved following incorporation of comments and materials received during this comment period.




Public Comments Solicited 



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to the approval of the plan. 



Authority 



The Authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533 (f).

Petitions for Modification



The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section
101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.



1. Consolidation Coal Company



[Docket No. M-94-87-C]



Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its Blacksville No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 46-01968)
located in Monongalia County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions in certain areas of the
return air course, traveling the entire area would be unsafe. The petitioner proposes to establish check points 1
and 2 to monitor the methane and quantity of air in the affected area; to have a qualified person conduct these tests
weekly at each check point and record the results in a book kept on the surface and made available for inspection by interested
persons; and to install a door in the overcast on the mainline track haulage in order to observe the mine roof over the
overcast once a day to determine whether a roof fall and possible collapse of the overcast exists. The petitioner asserts
that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.



2. Drummond Company, Inc.



[Docket No. M-94-94-C]



Drummond Company, Inc., P.O. Box 10246, Birmingham, Alabama 35202 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.800 (high-voltage circuits; circuit breakers) to its Shoal Creek Mine (I.D. No. 01-02901) located
in Jefferson County, Alabama. The petitioner requests a modification of that portion of the standard that pertains
to under-voltage, grounded phase, overcurrent, and ground check opening the circuit breaker. The petitioner proposes
to use high-voltage contactors with an electrical rating adequate for the connected load; to use under-voltage,
overload, grounded phase, and ground check protective devices that would de-energize the high-voltage contactor;
to use a control circuit design for each high-voltage circuit that would preclude automatic closing of the high-voltage
contactor when there is an under-voltage, overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; to use a control circuit
design for each high-voltage contactor that would preclude remote closing of the high-voltage contactor when there
is an overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; and to use a short circuit current that would trip the high-voltage
circuit breaker, and a control circuit design that would preclude automatic or remote closing of the high-voltage
circuit breaker. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure
of protection as would the mandatory standard.



3. Drummond Company, Inc.



[Docket No. M-94-95-C]



Drummond Company, Inc., P.O. Box 10246, Birmingham, Alabama 35202 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.803 (fail safe ground check circuits on high-voltage resistance grounded systems) to its Shoal Creek
Mine (I.D. No. 01-02901) located in Jefferson County, Alabama. The petitioner requests a modification of that
portion of the standard that pertains to under-voltage, grounded phase, overcurrent, and ground check opening the
circuit breaker. The petitioner proposes to use high-voltage contactors with an electrical rating adequate for
the connected load; to use under-voltage, overload, grounded phase, and ground check protective devices that would
de-energize the high-voltage contactor; to use a control circuit design for each high-voltage circuit that would
preclude automatic closing of the high-voltage contactor when there is an under-voltage, overload, grounded phase,
or ground check problem; to use a control circuit design for each high-voltage contactor that would preclude remote
closing of the high-voltage contactor when there is an overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; and to use
a short circuit current that would trip the high-voltage circuit breaker, and a control circuit design that would
preclude automatic or remote closing of the high-voltage circuit breaker. The petitioner asserts that the proposed
alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.



4. Dynamic Recovery, Inc.



[Docket No. M-94-96-C]



Dynamic Recovery, Inc., P.O. Box 25, Clarksville, Pennsylvania 15322 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1103-4(a) (automatic fire sensor and warning device systems; installation; minimum requirements)
to its Lazarus Mine (I.D. No. 36-08336) located in Greene County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to
install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system as an early warning fire detection system in all belt entries
where a monitoring system would identify a sensor location instead of in each belt flight. The petitioner asserts
that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard.

5. Helvetia Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-94-97-C] 



Helvetia Coal Company, Box 729, Indiana, Pennsylvania 15701 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR
75.1100-2(e)(2) (quantity and location of fire fighting equipment) to its Lucerne No. 6 Extension (I.D. No.
36-07691) located in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use two portable fire extinguishers,
or one portable fire extinguisher with twice the required capacity, at each temporary electrical installation instead
of using one fire extinguisher and rock dust at such installations. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



6. Keystone Coal Mining Corporation 



[Docket No. M-94-98-C] 



Keystone Coal Mining Corporation, P.O. Box 729, Indiana, Pennsylvania 15701 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.511 (low- medium- or high-voltage distribution circuits and equipment; repair) to its Emilie No. 1 Mine
(I.D. No. 36-00821) and its Jane Mine (I.D. No. 36-00823) both located in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.
The petitioner proposes to utilize non-qualified persons for changing fuses in DC pump fused disconnect boxes and
fused trolley wire taps. The petitioner states that the non-qualified persons would be briefed and trained to ensure
safe and proper conduct in performing fuse changes. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method
would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



7. Keystone Coal Mining Corporation 



[Docket No. M-94-99-C] 



Keystone Coal Mining Corporation, P.O. Box 729, Indiana, Pennsylvania 15701 has filed a petition to modify the application

Grant of Individual Exemptions; Beaumont Area Pipefitters Joint Apprenticeship Committee, et al. 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of individual exemptions. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 


Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 
hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated,
were received by the Department. 
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 


Statutory Findings 


In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and their participants and beneficiaries; and 
(c) They are protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries of the plans. 





Beaumont Area Pipefitters Joint Apprenticeship
Committee (the Plan)

Proposed Exemption 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is
granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act shall not apply to the purchase of certain
real property (the Property) by the Plan from Pipefitters Local 195 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices
of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (the Union), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the
following conditions are met: 
1. An independent fiduciary determines that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the Plan; 
2. The fair market value of the Property is established by an appraiser unrelated to the Plan or the Union; 
3. The Plan pays no more than the lesser of $462,800 or the fair market value of the Property as determined at the time
of purchase; 
4. The purchase is a one-time transaction for cash; and

5. The Plan pays no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The Plan is an apprenticeship training plan established and administered pursuant to the provisions of section
302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. As of January 31, 1994, the Plan had 580 participants and total assets
of $1,248,499. On the same date, the number of employers contributing to the Plan totaled 21. 
2. The Property consists of 2.74 acres of land and improvements located adjacent to property of the Union. The improvements
include three one and two-story buildings, constructed by the Union in 1968 and 1978, designed for use as classroom
and apprenticeship training facilities for the Plan and its participants. From 1968 to 1988 the Plan operated an apprenticeship
program on the Property pursuant to a lease of the Property by the Union to the Plan.
 In August 1988 the Union sold the Property to the Plan. The Plan partially financed this purchase by obtaining a loan
from the Sabine Area Pipefitters Local 195 Pension Trust Fund (Local 195 Pension Plan). The Local 195 Pension Plan,
which was later merged into the Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Fund, had interlocking trustees with the
Plan and the Plan made some contributions to the Local 195 Pension Plan on behalf of its participants. The loan was repaid
in June 1991. 




In September 1990 the Department commenced an investigation of the Plan regarding the sale of the Property by the Union
to the Plan and the loan between the Plan and the Local 195 Pension Plan.

2

 Also, an application for exemption for retroactive relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of the Act
was submitted to the Department for these transactions. In a letter in January 1992, the Department cited as reasons
for denying the exemption application, among other factors, the lack of the review and prior approval of the transactions
by an independent fiduciary. Following this exemption denial, an agreement was reached with the Department which
required that the Property be sold back by the Plan to the Union. Such sale occurred in December 1992. Since that date,
the Plan has utilized the Property as a training facility without charge from the Union. However, the applicant represents
that because of an economic downturn in the area, the Union considers it a hardship to continue this arrangement. 





3. The applicant obtained an appraisal on the Property on January 14, 1994, from Donnie M. Jones, MAI (Jones), a real
estate appraiser located in Port Arthur, Texas. Jones represents that he is not related in any way to the Plan or the
Union. Utilizing the income, cost and sales comparison approaches to value, Jones estimated that the Property had
a fair market value of $462,800 as of the date of the appraisal. By letter dated March 1, 1994, Jones stated that he was
aware, in preparing the appraisal, that the Plan was the prospective buyer of the Property and that this knowledge
had no influence on his calculation of value. 
4. The Plan now proposes to purchase the Property from the Union so that the Plan itself will own the training and educational
facilities used to train journeymen and apprentices. Plan fiduciaries note that ownership of the Property will give
the Plan full control of the buildings, grounds and parking lots and will enable the Plan to make improvements to the
Property as needed. The Plan will pay no more than current fair market value for the Property, as established by an updated
independent appraisal. The purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash and the Plan will pay no fees or commissions
in regard to the purchase. The applicant represents that, after the purchase of the Property, the Plan will have more
than enough funds for operational purposes of the training program. 
5. The Plan and the Union have selected Joseph P. 
Connors, Sr. (Connors), an attorney with the firm of Connors Associates, Inc. in Washington, D.C. to serve as independent
fiduciary in regard to the proposed transaction. The applicant represents that Connors is independent of the Plan
and the Union.
Connors states that he has had extensive experience working with Taft-Hartley plans, including serving as chairman
of funds of the United Mine Workers. Connors further states that he is well aware that while acting as independent fiduciary
he assumes personal liability and he must act solely in the interest of the Plan and its participants. 
Connors maintains that the proposed transaction is definitely in the best interests of the Plan. In this regard, Connors
has met with officers of the Union and trustees of the Plan and has made an inspection of the Property with Russell Allen,
the training director for the Plan. The Plan has operated an apprenticeship program utilizing the Property since
the initial time of construction in 1968. As independent fiduciary, Connors will make certain that the Plan pays no
more than fair market value for the Property and will enforce all rights of the Plan in regard to the proposed transaction.

6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (1) the purchase of the Property will give the Plan ownership of the facilities it uses for
its apprenticeship training program; (2) an independent fiduciary has determined that the proposed transaction
is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants; (3) the Plan will pay no more than fair market value for the
Property, based on an updated independent appraisal; (4) the purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash; and
(5) the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction.

General Information



The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 

(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and

(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

Profit Sharing Plan for Employees 
of Lewis-Gale Clinic, Inc. (the Plan) 
Located in Salem, Virginia 


[Exemption Application No. D-9654] 


Proposed Exemption 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of section
406(a), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the
Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed cash sale (the Sale)
of certain shares of stock (the Shares) from certain individually-directed accounts in the Plan (the Accounts) to
Lewis-Gale Clinic, Inc. 
(the Clinic), a party in interest with respect to the Plan. 
This proposed exemption is conditioned on the following requirements: (1) the terms and conditions of the Sale are
at least as favorable to the Accounts as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party;
(2) the Sale is a one-time cash transaction; (3) the Accounts are not required to pay any commissions, costs or other
expenses in connection with the Sale; (4) the Sales price for the Shares is based upon its fair market value as determined
by a qualified, independent appraiser; and (5) within ninety days of the grant of this proposed exemption, the Clinic
files Forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and pay all applicable excise taxes due with respect to past prohibited
transactions. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan sponsored by the Clinic, a Virginia professional corporation owned exclusively
by licensed physicians engaged in the practice of medicine. The Clinic employs 837 full-time and part-time employees
of which 124 are licensed physicians. The Clinic services the Greater Roanoke Valley with a central location located
in Salem, Virginia. The Clinic also operates various satellite clinics in towns and counties within a fifty mile radius
of its primary location. 
2. As of March 31, 1994, the Plan had total assets of $58,733,461 and 690 participants. The Plan permits each participant
to direct the investments of his or her account among several funds including a fund commonly referred to as Fund F.
First Union National Bank of Virginia (First Union) serves as trustee of all Plan assets except those held in Fund F.
The board of directors of the Clinic serves as the trustee with respect to the Plan assets held in Fund F. 
3. Fund F is designed to be invested exclusively in the common stock of the Lewis-Gale Building Corporation (the Building
Corporation), which was incorporated on December 22, 1970. From the time of such incorporation until 1983, all of
the outstanding common stock of the Building Corporation (the Stock) was owned exclusively by the physicians and
certain administrative personnel. The primary purpose of the Building Corporation is to own and operate certain
real property facilities which are leased to the Clinic and other health care providers for use in rendering medical
services.
 




4. As a condition to employment, each physician is contractually required to purchase a fixed dollar amount of the
Stock. In 1983, the Building Corporation and the physicians, upon the advice of counsel, amended the Plan and the pre-existing
stock restriction agreement to permit the Plan to acquire the Stock, thereby allowing the physicians to satisfy their
contractual obligations to purchase the Stock by self-directing portions of their individual account balances
into Fund F.
 




Because the Stock is not publicly traded, the Building Corporation values the Stock on an annual basis using its historic
valuation formula under the existing stock purchase agreement between the Building Corporation and its shareholders.
The valuation formula incorporates the fair market values of the underlying assets of the Building Corporation,
which are valued annually by a qualified, independent real estate appraiser. The Building Corporation has consistently
utilized this valuation formula to set the price per share for all sale and purchase transactions involving the Stock.


Fund F has experienced an average annual rate of return of 11.3 percent, and investment in this fund is open to all participants
in the Plan. As of May 11, 1994, Fund F held 16,413 shares (the Shares) of the Stock which represents approximately eighty-two
percent of the issued and outstanding shares of the Stock. The remaining issued and outstanding shares of the Stock
are owned by physicians and certain administrators. The terms of Fund F require a participant electing to invest in
Stock to remain invested in Fund F until his or her death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment.
Upon such occurrences, a number of shares of the Stock equal to the value of such participant's Fund F account balance
will be sold back to the Building Corporation for cash and such cash proceeds distributed to the participant as a part
of his or her Plan account balance.

5. Between 1988 and 1990, thirteen physicians (the Physicians), upon the advice of counsel, sold their individual
shares of the Stock for cash to their individually-directed accounts in the Plan indirectly through the Building
Corporation. Three of the Physicians were officers of the Clinic. The Clinic states that, as an indirect result of
these sales, some of the accounts of the Physicians held shares of the Stock in excess of twenty-five percent of the
balance of their account at some point. Because of the party in interest/ disqualified person relationships and the
past purchases by the accounts from the Physicians, the Clinic is aware of the fact that prohibited transactions have
occurred in violation of the Act. Accordingly, the Clinic represents that within ninety days of the grant of this proposed
exemption, the Clinic will file Forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and will pay all applicable excise taxes
due with respect to past prohibited transactions.
 




6. Upon discovering that certain accounts in the Plan had engaged in prohibited transactions, the board of directors,
acting as trustee, froze the assets in Fund F pending resolution of the prohibited transaction issues. As a result,
retiring participants are limited to receiving only a partial distribution. In order to allow participants to receive
full distributions, the trustee proposes to sell the Shares to the Clinic. Accordingly, the Clinic requests an administrative
exemption from the Department to permit the Sale under the terms and conditions described herein. 
The Sale will be a one time cash transaction, and the Accounts will pay no fees or commissions in connection with the
Sale. Prior to the Sale, First Union will become trustee with respect to the Plan assets in Fund F. At this time, First
Union will have the sole investment discretion over the entire assets of the Plan. Although the initial decision to
sell the Shares was made by the board of directors acting as trustee, First Union will have the ultimate authority to
approve or disapprove the terms and conditions of the Sale. 
7. The Clinic obtained an appraisal of the Stock dated May 13, 1994, from Dianne D. Cobb, CFA, ASA. Ms. Cobb is the Senior
Vice President of Investment Managements Services of Wachovia Bank of North Carolina which provides analysis with
regard to non-publicly traded securities and securities of closely held businesses. Ms. Cobb represents that both
she and Wachovia Bank of North Carolina are unrelated to and independent of the Clinic and its affiliates. Relying
upon the discounted future cash flow and recent trades of the Stock, Ms. Cobb placed the fair market value of the Stock
at $764 per share. Based on this valuation, the value of the Shares, which represent Fund F's eighty-two percent interest
in the Building Corporation, total $12,539,532. 
8. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the terms and conditions of the Sale will be at least as favorable to the
Plan as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the Sale will be a one-time cash
transaction; (c) the Plan will not be required to pay any commissions, costs or other expenses in connection with the
Sale; and (d) the Sales price for the Shares will be based upon its fair market value as determined by a qualified, independent
appraiser; and (e) within ninety days of the grant of this proposed exemption, the Clinic will file Forms 5330 with
the Internal Revenue Service and will pay all applicable excise taxes due with respect to past prohibited transactions.

Raytech Corporation Salaried Employees Savings 
Plan (the Salaried Plan) and Raytech Corporation Hourly Employee Savings Plan (the Hourly Plan; together, the Plans)

Located in Shelton, Connecticut 


[Application Nos. D-9722 and D-9723] 


Proposed Exemption 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the proposed extension of credit by Raytech Corporation (Raytech) to the Plans
in the form of payments (the Makeup Payments) with respect to group annuity contract CG01274B3A (the GIC) issued by
Executive Life Insurance Company (ELIC); and (2) the Plans' potential repayment of the Makeup Payments (the Repayments),
provided: (a) all terms of such transactions are no less favorable to the Plans than those which the Plans could obtain
in arm's-length transactions with an unrelated party; (b) no interest and/or expenses are paid by the Plans; (c) the
Makeup Payments are made only in lieu of payments due from ELIC with respect to the accumulated book value of the GIC
at the time of the Makeup Payments; (d) the Repayments are restricted to the amounts, if any, paid to the Plans after
March 27, 1994, by ELIC or other responsible third parties with respect to the GIC (the GIC Proceeds); (e) the Repayments
do not exceed the total amount of the Makeup Payments; and (f) the Repayments are waived to the extent the Makeup Payments
exceed the GIC Proceeds. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. Raytech is a multi-national manufacturer and marketer of specialty engineered products for heat resistant, inertia
control, energy absorption and transmission applications. In 1988, Raytech became the sponsor of the Plans, which
are defined contribution plans under section 401(k) of the Code. 
2. The Salaried Plan currently has 281 participants and beneficiaries, and has assets with an approximate aggregate
fair market value of $9,793,000. The Hourly Plan currently has 236 participants and beneficiaries, and has assets
with an approximate aggregate fair market value of $1,051,000. Effective January 1, 1994, Charles Schwab Trust Company
(the Trustee) was appointed as trustee to the Plans. 
3. Investments of funds contributed under the Plans are made by the Trustee as directed by participants in accordance
with provisions of the Plans. In 1988, the Plans provided two investment options: (i) a ``Guaranteed Interest Fund''
in which the monies were to be held under a contract or contracts issued by one or more major insurance companies providing
for a stipulated minimum rate of interest, as selected by the Plans' administrative committee (the Committee) or
(ii) a ``Managed Securities Fund'', consisting of a mutual fund managed by a bank which was selected by the Committee.
Under the provisions of the Salaried Plan, Raytech's matching contributions could be delivered in cash or Raytech
common stock at the direction of Raytech's Board of Directors. 
4. In 1992, both Plans were amended, revising the name of the Equity Fund from ``Managed Security Fund'' to ``Equity
Fund'', and the Salaried Plan was amended to add an additional investment option in a Balanced Fund as selected by the
Committee. In 1993, both Plans were amended to change the Guaranteed Interest Fund option. Prior to this amendment,
the Guaranteed Interest Fund provided for monies contributed in a particular year to be held by a single insurance
company (e.g., ELIC). Pursuant to this amendment, the Plans now permit investments in a ``pooled investment fund''
that features insurance company contracts issued by multiple insurance companies. Under the terms of each of the
Plans, the participants have withdrawal and transfer rights with respect to their accounts (Withdrawal Events).
The circumstances triggering Withdrawal Events include severance from service, disability, retirement, death,
hardship, transfer of funds and loans. 
5. The GIC was issued by ELIC to the Plans in 1988. Employee savings contributions directed to the Guaranteed Interest
Fund and related Raytech contributions were invested in the GIC during 1988. As of April 11, 1991, total principal
deposited under the GIC plus accumulated interest under the GIC, less previous withdrawals (the Accumulated Book
Value) for the Plans amounted to $1,774,779. On April 11, 1991 (the Conservation Date), ELIC was seized by the California
Insurance Commissioner and its assets were frozen and its payments suspended, including the GIC.
 Effective September 3, 1993 (the Closing Date), the California Superior Court approved a rehabilitation/liquidation
plan (the Rehab Plan).
 The Rehab Plan provides for the resolution of ELIC's contractual obligations.

6. Pursuant to the Rehab Plan, an interim benefit payment (the Interim Payment) was received by the Plans in the combined
amount of $288,528 in September, 1993. In January, 1994, the Plans were provided an option to elect to participate
in the Rehab Plan or to opt out. Notice was given that the contract values and terms of the original GIC had been adjusted
down as required by the Rehab Plan. The Plans were advised that there was no participating state guaranty association,
and thus no such source of makeup funds. The Plans' Committees elected to opt out of the Rehab Plan, and the GIC was surrendered
(see rep. 8, below). 
7. Under the Rehab Plan, a new insurance company, Aurora, was created to receive the ELIC assets. ELIC contractholders,
however, were not forced to invest in the new company and could opt out. Upon opting out, however, the ELIC contractholders
were to receive only a portion of their Accumulated Book Value, or a reduction of 31.5%. After that reduction, further
amounts were to be held back to cover potential liabilities from ELIC indemnities in the sale of the assets and ongoing
litigation concerning allocation of the ELIC assets, leaving the balance for the first opt out payment. 
In addition to the first opt out payment, the Rehab Plan provides for future potential payments as follows: 
(a) distributions from enhancement trusts; and (b) release of holdbacks. These are described below. 
Three enhancement trusts were created at the ELIC sale to protect certain ELIC assets that were not part of the sale,
one for real estate, one for below grade stocks and bonds, and one for ELIC rights not transferred. All of these assets
are to be liquidated by the enhancement trusts over time and the proceeds distributed to the ELIC contractholders.
As required by the Rehab Plan, a specified amount was held back to cover the indemnity and allocation contingencies.

The holdback amounts, if any remain, will be released to the participants in the future if not used to cover the indemnities
and allocation litigation result. The Rehab Plan provided no assurance that there would be distributions from enhancement
trusts or releases of holdbacks. 
8. The opt out provision of the Rehab Plan was equivalent to a repurchase of the GIC in return for the opt out payment.
Having elected to opt out, the Plans on March 27, 1994, received the first opt out payment in the amount of $730,912.
When added to the Interim Payment (see rep. 6, above) of $288,528, the Plans have received a total of $1,019,440 from
ELIC. In addition, approximately $200,000 was held back by ELIC (see rep. 7, above). When the opt out payment was received,
the Plans surrendered the GIC to Aurora. 
9. Following the receipt of the first opt out payment and assuming no future payments from the enhancement trusts or
from the holdback, each affected participant in the Plans will have lost approximately 42% of his/her account balance
invested in the GIC as of the Conservation Date of April 11, 1991. The applicant represents that the realization of
these losses and uncertainties surrounding the ELIC situation have caused substantial concern and anxiety among
the Plans' participants. In order to relieve the affected participants' concerns, to protect the participants'
accounts invested in the GIC, and to restore to the Plans the ability to fulfill obligations with respect to Withdrawal
Events involving amounts invested in the GIC, Raytech desires to make up the losses the participants have suffered
as a result of the investment in the GIC by way of the Makeup Payments. The Makeup Payments have been calculated as follows:






The totals that should have been earned match the payments made by ELIC (Interim Payment plus first opt out payment)
plus the Makeup Payment. (The totals will increase to account for interest at 6.19% up to the actual Makeup Payment
date.) 
The Makeup Payments, which are shown in the above chart, have been calculated in order to restore to the Plans the full
Accumulated Book Value of the GIC as of March 27, 1994 (the date of the first opt out payment), which is $2,261,278. In
addition, the applicant represents that it will pay interest to the Plans up to the actual Makeup Payment date at a rate
of 6.19%, since funds invested in the GIC would have been rolled over by the Trustee into the Hartford Insurance Company
GIC, having a guaranteed interest rate of 6.19% and expiring December 31, 1997. 
10. Raytech is prepared and able to contribute the above-calculated Makeup Payments plus interest to the Plans to
eliminate the participants' losses and future payment contingencies. The first opt out payments (including the
Interim Payment) and the Raytech Makeup Payments will fully restore the participants' accounts. Immediately following
the granting of the exemption proposed herein and the execution of a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service
pursuant to Rev. Proc. 92-16, the Makeup Payment will be contributed directly to the Trustee, who is obligated
under the terms of the Plans to invest the contribution directly into the Guaranteed Interest Fund. As future payments
from the enhancement trusts or return of holdbacks are received, the Trustee is to pay such amounts over to Raytech
to reimburse it for that portion of the Makeup Payments. The transaction can be characterized as a non-interest bearing
loan by Raytech to the Plans requiring no security or collateralization. 
11. The applicant represents that the losses suffered by the affected participants are known numbers since the Rehab
Plan has been implemented and the payment has been made except for enhancement trusts and holdbacks. In the absence
of the Makeup Payments, such participants stand to lose 42% of their account balances as of the Conservation Date of
April 11, 1991 and interest since such date totaling approximately $1,242,000. To summarize, Raytech is proposing
to make up the lost amounts and to cover the amounts not paid due to the enhancement trusts and the holdbacks under the
Rehab Plan. Raytech is looking to recoup such amounts only to the extent that they are subsequently paid under the Rehab
Plan.

12. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions will satisfy the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act because: (a) all terms of the transactions will be no less favorable to the Plans than those which the
Plans could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) no interest and/or expenses will be
paid by the plans; (c) the Makeup Payments will be made only in lieu of payments due from ELIC with respect to the accumulated
book value of the GIC at the time of the Makeup Payments; (d) the Repayments are restricted to the GIC Proceeds; (e) the
Repayments will not exceed the total amount of the Makeup Payments; and (f) the Repayments are waived to the extent
the Makeup Payments exceed the GIC Proceeds.

4. The Employer proposes to make the Advances to the Master Trust in a series of payments, pursuant to a written loan
agreement (the Agreement). The total amount of Advances will not exceed the aggregate account balances of the Plans'
participants attributable to the GICs as of April 11, 1991,

8

 adjusted for interest, as follows: Commencing on the date the Employer and the Internal Revenue Service enter into
a closing agreement pursuant to Internal Revenue Procedure 92-16,

9

 interest will be credited at the rate paid on the Interest Income Fund.

10

 The Employer represents that it wishes to enter into the proposed transaction in order to protect the Plan participants
from the effects of a prolonged rehabilitation process and from any potential loss resulting from Executive Life's
inability to meet its obligations under the GICs. In this regard, the Employer represents that the Plans' participants
will benefit from the proposed transaction because the Advances will ensure that the participants receive 100% of
the conservatorship date value of their accounts and such amounts will be available as soon as approval is received
from the Internal Revenue Service and the Department.

11

 The Employer further represents that the Advances will facilitate benefit distributions, loans, hardship withdrawals
and investment transfers which would not otherwise be possible because of Executive Life's suspension of payments
under the GICs. The Employer also represents that the Advances will be non-interest bearing and the Plan will not incur
any expenses in connection with the proposed transaction. 








5. Repayment of the Advances under the Agreement is limited to payments made to the Master Trust by or on behalf of Executive
Life, or its successor, or any other responsible third parties. No other assets of the Master Trust will be available
for repayment of the Advances. If the payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the
Advances, the Agreement provides that the Employer will have no recourse against the Plans or the Master Trust, or
against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plans, for the unpaid amount. To the extent the Master Trust receives
GIC proceeds in excess of the total amount of the Advances, such additional amounts will be retained by the Master Trust
and allocated among the accounts of the Plans' participants. 


6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act because: (1) The transaction will preserve the Plans' ability to timely fund participants' benefits, including
participant loans, hardship withdrawals and participant-directed investment re-allocations; (2) The Master
Trust will not incur any expenses with respect to the transaction; (3) Repayment of the Advances will be made only from
amounts paid to the Master Trust by Executive Life, its successor, or any other third party; (4) If the payments by or
on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Advances, the Employer will have no recourse against
the Plans or the Master Trust, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plans, for the unpaid amount; and
(5) Repayment of the Advances will be waived with respect to the amount by which the Advances exceed the amount the Master
Trust receives from GIC proceeds.

General Information


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries;
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan;
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






University of Washington; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact Regarding
Proposed Renewal of Facility License No. R-73 



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility License
No. R-73 for the University of Washington Research Reactor (the licensee) located on the University campus
in Seattle, Washington. 



Environmental Assessment 



Identification of Proposed Action 



This Environmental Assessment is written in connection with the proposed renewal date of February 14, 1999, for the
facility license of the University of Washington Research Reactor (UWRR) at Seattle, Washington, in response to
a timely application from the licensee dated August 10 and 31, 1989, as modified on February 14 and May 2, 1994. The proposed
action would authorize possession, but not operation, of the facility, for a period of five years. 



Need for the Proposed Action 



The license for the facility was due to expire on October 13, 1989. The licensee made a timely request for renewal as
a possession only license on August 10 and 31, 1989, for a period of 20 years which was later modified on February 14,
1994 for a period of five years. The proposed action is required to authorize continued possession, but not operation,
of the facility, so that the licensee can complete its decommissioning plan and ultimately decommission the reactor
facility. 



Alternatives to the Possession Action 



An alternative to the proposed action that was considered was not renewing the license. This alternative would have
led to possession of a facility and radioactive material without authorization by law. This alternative did not provide
an acceptable way for the licensee to possess the facility prior to decomissioning, or for decommissioning the facility
in a controlled, coordinated manner. The other alternative was to renew the license for possession only a period of
one year, but this would require license renewals on an annual basis until decommissioning is completed. 



Environmental Impact 



The reactor is defueled and all special nuclear material and source material have been shipped offsite or transferred
to the State license. The only remaining radioactivity at the facility is activated reactor components. There is
no potential for generation of further radioactive materials. The extension of the facility license as a possession
only license for a five year period allows the licensee time to complete its decommissioning plan and affords it a reasonable
time to implement decommissioning. Further, providing additional time for the licensee to develop and implement
the decommissioning plan should lessen the environmental impact, in that radioactive materials will continue to
be depleted by the decay process and the licensee will have an opportunity to better plan and conduct decommissioning
activities. 



Alternatives Use of Resources 



This action does not involve the use of any resources beyond those normally allocated for such activities. 



Agencies and Persons Consulted 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. 



Finding of No Significant Impact 



Based upon foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the propose
d action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has
determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for this proposed action. 

For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's request for a license renewal application dated
August 10 and 31, 1989, as modified on February 14 and May 2, 1994. These documents are available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Generic Communication; Information on NRC/Licensee Safeguards Meeting/Workshop on Revisions to 10 CFR
Part 73 To Protect Against Malevolent Use of Vehicles at Nuclear Power Plants</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of meeting. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On June 30, 1994, the Commission approved a final rule revising 10 CFR Part 73 associated with protection against malevolent
use of vehicles at nuclear power plants. The rule change modifies the design basis threat for radiological sabotage
to include use of a land vehicle. The rule change also requires vehicle control measures, including vehicle barrier
systems, to protect against the malevolent use of a land vehicle. The vehicle barrier system design requires that
the system stop the forward motion of the design basis vehicle.




As part of the implementation of this rule change, the NRC staff is publishing Regulatory Guide 5.68, ``Protection
Against Malevolent Use of Vehicles at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and NUREG/CR-6190, ``Protection Against Malevolent
Use of Vehicles at Nuclear Power Plants,'' Volumes 1 and 2. These documents were specifically developed to provide
guidance acceptable to the NRC staff by which a licensee can meet the requirements of the revised 10 CFR Part 73. The
Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation will conduct one-day technical workshops in each of the NRC Regional offices
to discuss Regulatory Guide 5.68 and NUREG/CR-6190, Volumes 1 and 2, and address implementation of the rule
change. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This meeting between the NRC technical staff and licensees is closed to members of the public or other parties due to
the fact that Safeguards Information will be discussed. An unclassified summary of the meeting will be prepared and
will be available upon request.



The regional conference rooms can accommodate up to three representatives from each facility. It is requested that
each licensee planning to send representatives to the workshop provide the names of the attendees to Elaine Koup at
(301) 504-2932 or Catherine Berney at (301) 504-2933 by August 8, 1994. If a licensee desires to send more
than three representatives, they may contact Ms. Koup after August 4 for additional spaces, if available.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of Staff Technical Position on Consideration of Fault Displacement Hazards in Geologic Repository
Design</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is announcing the availability of NUREG-1494, ``Staff Technical Position
(STP) on Consideration of Fault Displacement Hazard in Geologic Repository Design.''




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

NRC regulations for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in a geologic repository
recognize that prohibit designing the repository against the effects of such a potentially adverse condition. The
STP recognizes the acceptability of designing the geologic repository to take into account the attendant effects
(e.g., displacement) of faults of regulatory concern and express the staff's views on what is needed from the U.S.
Department of Energy if it chooses to locate structures, systems, and components important to safety or important
to waste isolation in areas that contain faults of regulatory concern.



On March 18, 1993, NRC published the ``Notice of Availability'' for the draft STP in the 

Federal Register 

(see 58 FR 14594) and solicited public comments. As a result, more than 25 comments were received from four different
parties. The NRC staff reviewed these comments and, as a result, changes and clarifications were incorporated into
the STP. Staff responses to these comments are documented separately as Appendix C to NUREG-1494.
On March 24, 1994, the NRC staff briefed the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) on the revised STP following
the end of the public comment period. As a result, the ACNW recommended, without additional comment, that the staff
publish the STP in final form.

<DOCTITLE>Baltimore Gas & Electric Co.; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-53 and DPR-69, issued to Baltimore Gas and Electric
Company (the licensee), for operation of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in Calvert
County, Maryland.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action


The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated March 23, 1994, for an exemption from certain
requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power plant
reactors against radiological sabotage.'' The requested exemption would allow the implementation of a hand geometry
biometric system of site access control in conjunction with photograph identification badges, and would allow the
badges to be taken offsite.


The Need for the Proposed Action


Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55(a), the licensee is required to establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system
and security organization.
The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' specifies in part that: ``The licensee
shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' The Code of Federal Regulations
at 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), specifies in part that: ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for
all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' It further indicates that an individual
not employed by the licensee (e.g., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without an escort provided
the individual, ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit
from the protected area.''
Currently, unescorted access for both employee and contractor personnel into the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant,
Unit Nos. 1 and 2, is controlled through the use of picture badges. Positive identification of personnel who are authorized
and request access into the protected area is established by security personnel making a visual comparison of the
individual requesting access and that individual's picture badge. The picture badges are issued, stored, and retrieved
at the entrance/exit location to the protected area. These picture badges are not taken offsite. This current practice
is in accordance with the applicable requirements of 10 CFR Part 73 discussed above.
The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve picture badges at the entrance/exit location to the protected area. The proposal would also
allow all individuals, including contractors, who have unescorted access to keep their picture badges in their possession
when departing the Calvert Cliffs site. Thus, an exemption is required from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) to allow contractors
who have unescorted access to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the Calvert Cliffs site.


Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action


The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action. In addition to their picture badges, all individuals
with authorized unescorted access will have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered
with their picture badge number in a computerized access control system. Therefore, all authorized individuals
must not only have their picture badges to gain access into the protected area, but must also have their hand geometry
confirmed.
All other access processes, including search function capability and access revocation, will remain the same. A
security officer responsible for access control will continue to be positioned within a bullet-resistant structure.
The proposed system is only for individuals with authorized unescorted access and will not be used for individuals
requiring escorts.
The underlying purpose for requiring that individuals not employed by the licensee must receive and return their
picture badges at the entrance/exit is to provide reasonable assurance that the access badges could not be compromised
or stolen with a resulting risk that an unauthorized individual could potentially enter the protected area. Although
the proposed exemption will allow individuals to take their picture badges offsite, the proposed measures require
not only that the picture badge be provided for access to the protected area, but also that verification of the hand
geometry registered with the badge be performed as discussed above. Thus, the proposed system provides an identity
verification process that is equivalent to the existing process.
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the exemption to allow individuals not employed by the licensee to take
their picture badges offsite will not result in an increase in the risk that an unauthorized individual could potentially
enter the protected area. Consequently, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological impacts
associated with the proposed action.
The proposed exemption does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Accordingly,
the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with
the proposed action.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the proposed action would be to deny the requested action. Denial of the requested action would not significantly
enhance the environment in that the proposed action will result in a process that is equivalent to the existing identification
verification process.


Alternate Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the April 1973 Final Environmental
Statement for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff consulted with the State of Maryland, Department of Natural Resources, regarding the environmental
impact of this proposed action. The State official had no comments.


Finding of No Significant Impact


Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed exemption.
For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's letter dated March 23, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Calvert County Library, Prince Frederick, Maryland
20678.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change Relating to Application for Membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.



July 20, 1994.




On May 4, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change
 pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The rule change amends Sections 1(b) and 1(c) to Article III of the NASD By-Laws and Schedule C to the By-Laws to clarify
the process by which an applicant applies for membership in the NASD.








Notice of the proposed rule change together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission release
and by publication in the 

Federal Register.


 No comments were received in response to the Commission release. This order approves the proposed rule change.





I. Description of the Rule Change




The NASD seeks to amend its By-Laws and Rules with respect to the procedural aspects of the membership application
process. The NASD has identified instances where its By-Laws and rules are inconsistent and where its actual practices
are inconsistent with its rules. This rule change corrects these aberrations and further clarifies the membership
application process.



A. Amendments Concerning the Role of the District Committee in the Membership Application Process



The NASD By-Laws currently provide that any application for membership shall be referred to the District Committee
of the NASD district in which the applicant has its principal place of business. The By-Laws further provide that the
appropriate District Committee shall determine whether the applicant satisfies the NASD's admission requirements.
 In contrast, the NASD's rules, Schedule C to the By-Laws, provide that the District Office staff initially determine
an applicant's eligibility for membership. The rules do, however, further set forth procedures for review by the
District Committee, upon request by the applicant, of the District Office's determination.







According to the NASD, the actual practice is for the appropriate District Committee to determine an applicant's
eligibility for membership. The NASD has determined to amend its By-Laws and Schedule C to allow each District Committee
to designate a Subcommittee to act, under limited circumstances, on behalf of the District Committee. The proposed
rule change, therefore, amends the NASD By-Laws and Schedule C to provide that all initial applications for membership
be reviewed by either the District Committee or a Subcommittee of the District Committee, with a right of appeal to
the full District Committee.







B. Amendments to Schedule C




The NASD has also submitted ministerial amendments to Schedule C designed to clarify the NASD's procedures concerning
the application process. These include amendments to Part I of Schedule C to the By-Laws:




Subsection (1)(a), clarifying that an applicant must provide other relevant information and documents requested
by the District Office staff;

Subsection (1)(a)(6), clarifying that an applicant must provide other relevant information and documents requested
by the District Office staff;

Subsection (1)(b), clarifying that the scheduling of an applicant's pre-membership interview and the determination
of which responsible personnel shall appear on behalf of the applicant at such interview will be determined by the
District Office staff;

Subsection (2)(a) clarifying that it is the determination of the designated Subcommittee, rather than the District
Office, which will be reviewed by the District Committee upon request of the applicant;

Subsection (2)(a) clarifying that the applicant's request for review must be filed within 15 calendar days after
notification of the Subcommittee's determination;

Subsection (2)(b) clarifying that, in connection with review by the District Committee, an applicant is entitled
to appear before a Hearing Subcommittee of the District Committee and that no member of the District Committee who
served as a member of the Subcommittee originally designated to review the applicant's submission and no member of
the Hearing Subcommittee shall participate in the determination resulting from the District Committee's review;


Subsection (2)(c) clarifying that the District Committee's determination of the record developed before it shall
be made independent of the determination of the Subcommittee designated by the District Committee;

Subsection (2)(d) clarifying that the District Committee's determination shall be subject to review by the National
Business Conduct Committee (``NBCC'') upon request made by the applicant filed within 15 calendar days after the
date of notification to the applicant by the District Committee of its determination;

<DOCNO> FR940727-2-00106 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940727-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Subsection (2)(e) clarifying that in connection with review by the NBCC, the applicant has the right to appear before
a Subcommittee of the NBCC;
Subsection (2)(f) clarifying that the NBCC's determination of the record developed before it shall be made independent
of the determination of the Subcommittee designated by the District Committee, and shall constitute final action
for the NASD for purposes of Subsection (2)(h) to Part I of Schedule C to the By-Laws unless called for discretionary
review by the Board of Governors;
Subsection (2)(f) clarifying that a decision by the Board pursuant to its power of discretionary review shall constitute
final action for purposes of Subsection (2)(h) to Part I of Schedule C to the By-Laws and that such determination and
its rationale shall be communicated to the applicant in writing;
New subsection (2)(g) clarifying that review by the Board of Governors of NBCC determinations is discretionary
 and may occur solely at the request of one or more governors and not at the request of the applicant;




Subsection (2)(h) (formerly subsection (2)(g)) clarifying that an applicant may apply for review to the Commission
of any determination by the NBCC or the Board;
Subsection (2)(i) (formerly subsection (2)(h)) clarifying that it applies to determinations of restrictions placed
on the applicant made by the NBCC or a Subcommittee designated by the District Committee, as well as to such determinations
made by the Board or a District Committee;
Subsection (3)(a) clarifying that review and removal or modification of restrictions placed on the applicant shall
be done by a Subcommittee designated by the District Committee;
Subsection (3)(b) clarifying that modifications of restrictions shall be subject to review by the District Committee
and the NBCC, as well as by the Board and the Commission; and
Subsection (3)(c) clarifying that the refusal by a Subcommittee designated by the District Committee to remove or
modify restrictions shall also be subject to review, but only upon request of the member filed with the District Committee
within ten calendar days after the date of notification of such refusal.


II. Discussion


The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. The Commission believes that the rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements
of Section 15A(b)(8) of the Act.
 Section 15A(b)(8) requires, in part, that the rules of the NASD be designed to provide a fair procedure concerning
the denial of membership in the NASD and prohibiting or limiting access to services of the NASD.




This rule change clarifies the NASD's membership application process by eliminating the inconsistencies between
the NASD's by-Laws and the Schedules to the By-Laws concerning the administration of this process. In addition, this
rule change clarifies the procedures set forth in the Schedules to the By-Laws for accepting, denying or accepting
with limitations an application for membership.


III. Conclusion


In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the rule change is designed to provide a fair
procedure concerning the denial of membership in the NASD and prohibiting or limiting access to services of the NASD.
The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act.





It is therefore ordered

, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change SR-NASD-94-14 be, and hereby
is, approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Marker Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

is hereby given that on May 12, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Amex proposes to amend Rule 205 (Manner of Executing Odd-Lot Orders) (1) to provide that no differential shall
be charged on odd-lot order transactions (except for non-regular way trades); (2) to revise provisions relating
to the price at which certain odd-lot limit orders shall be executed, and (3) to delete, reposition or re-number various
provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set
forth in Section A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 205 relating to the execution of odd-lot orders (1) to eliminate the odd-lot differential
for market and limit orders; (2) amend provisions relating to the price at which odd-lot limit orders are executed;
and (3) delete, reposition or re-number various provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders in Rule 205,
Section B.

Under current Exchange rules, market odd-lot orders to buy or sell, as well as marketable limit orders, are executed
with no differential charged.
 However, a differential may be charged in connection with executions of odd-lot limit orders, market orders to sell
marked ``short,'' stop orders, and other types of orders (

e.g., 

orders to buy or sell ``at the close''). In order to enhance the competitiveness of Exchange odd-lot execution procedures,
the Exchange has determined to require the execution of all odd-lot market or limit orders (except for non-regular
way executions under proposed Section C(2) of the rule) without a differential.





Rule 205, Section A(2) would require that limited orders to buy (sell) be executed at the price of the first round lot
transaction which is at or below (above) the specified limit price (the ``effective transaction'' price). Sell limited
orders marked ``short'' would be executed at the price of the first round lot transaction which is at or above the specified
limit and which is also higher than the last different round lot transaction price (a ``plus'' or ``zero-plus'' tick).
Marketable limit orders would continue to be executed in accordance with procedures applicable to market orders.

Provisions relating to orders that are infrequently or never entered (

i.e., 

limited orders to buy an offer, sell on bid, ``immediate or cancel''; buy or sell marked ``or on close'') would be deleted.
Provisions relating to ``seller's option'' or cash trades in Section C would be deleted and subsumed by new Section
C(2) (Non-Regular Way Trades). A differential could be charged on such executions.



2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives
of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities,
and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) by order approved the proposed rule change, or

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that maybe withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying at the commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-15
and should be submitted by August 17, 1994.

Purchase Agreement, Key Trust would acquire substantially all of the assets of First Albany related to the management
of applicant.
3. Consummation of the Asset Purchase Agreement was conditioned upon applicant's Board of Directors approving the

Fund for Income Portfolio (the ``Acquiring Fund''), a newly-created series of The Victory Fund in exchange for shares
of the Acquiring Fund. According to the Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Board of Directors determined
that the facilities and resources of Key Trust would be a benefit to applicant and its shareholders. The Board of Directors
also determined, among other things, that the opportunity to exchange shares of applicant for shares of the other
11 portfolios of the Victory Fund would be an added advantage to applicant's shareholders.

Acquiring Fund in exchange for full and fractional shares of the Acquiring Fund. Each of applicant's shareholders
received as a liquidating distribution shares of the Acquiring Fund in the same dollar amount as the shares of applicant
held by such shareholder immediately prior to the effective date of the reorganization, plus the right to receive
any unpaid dividends or distributions declared before the effective date of the reorganization.
7. The cost of preparing, filing, and distributing registration and proxy materials necessary to obtain shareholder
approval of the reorganization was borne by the Acquiring Fund's and applicant's managers. No cost of the reorganization
was borne by applicant.
8. As of the date of the application, applicant had retained $5,777 in cash to pay its remaining liabilities. Applicant
has no shareholders. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently
engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up
of its affairs.
9. Applicant intends to file Articles of Dissolution under Washington State law.

</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicants' Representations




1. SIT Mutual Funds, Inc., SIT Mutual Funds II, Inc., SIT Growth Fund, Inc., SIT Growth & Income Fund, Inc., SIT
U.S. Government Securities Fund, Inc., and SIT Money Market Fund, Inc. (collectively, the ``SIT Group'') are open-end
management investment companies. The SIT Group currently offers eleven series (each a ``Fund''). One of the Funds
is a money market fund subject to the requirements of rule 2a-7 under the Act (together with any future money market
portfolios, the ``Money Market Funds''). The other ten Funds are non-money markets funds (together with any future
non-money market funds, the ``Non-Money Market Funds'').

2. SIT Investment is the investment adviser for the SIT Group. Sit/Kim International Investment Associates, Inc.
serves as sub-adviser for two of the Funds (together with SIT Investment and any future sub-adviser to a Fund, the ``Investment
Advisers.'' SIA Securities Corp. serves as principal underwriter for the Funds. Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. serves
as transfer agent and custodian to the Funds. At the present time, each of the Funds is offered without any sales charge,
redemption fee, or rule 12b-1 or shareholder servicing fee.

3. The Money Market Funds seek current income, liquidity, and capital preservation by investing exclusively in short-term
money market instruments, such as U.S. government securities, bank obligations, commercial paper, municipal obligations,
or repurchase agreements secured by government securities. These short-term debt securities are valued at their
amortized cost pursuant to the requirements of rule 2a-7. The Non-Money Market Funds invest in a variety of debt
and/or equity securities in accordance with their respective investment objectives and policies. Each of the Funds
has, or may be expected to have, uninvested cash in an account with the custodian. This cash either may be invested directly
in individual short-term money market instruments or may not be otherwise invested in any portfolio securities.

<TEXT>
 

4. Applicants seek the ability for (a) the Funds to utilize their cash reserves that have not been invested in portfolio
securities to purchase shares of the Money Market Funds (each Fund, including Money Market Funds, purchasing shares
of the Money Market Funds is an ``Investing Fund'') and (b) the Money Market Funds to sell or redeem their shares to or
from each Investing Fund. By investing cash balances in the Money Market Funds as proposed, applicants believe that
the Investing Fund will be able to combine their cash balances and thereby (a) reduce their transaction costs, since
transaction costs currently incurred by the Investing Funds in connection with the short term investment of their
uninvested cash would be avoided; (b) create more liquidity; (c) enjoy greater returns; and (d) further diversify
their holdings. The policies of the Funds either permit or will be amended (pursuant to shareholder vote if required)
to permit the Funds to purchase money market instruments, including shares of a Money Market Fund.

5. The shareholders of the Investing Funds would not be subject to the imposition of double management fees. Applicants
would cause each Investment Adviser and its respective affiliates to remit to the respective Investing Funds or waive
investment advisory and any other fees these service providers earn as a result of the Investing Funds' investments
in the Money Market Funds to the extent the fees are based upon the Investing Funds' assets invested in shares of the
Money Market Funds. Further, no sales charge, contingent deferred sales charge, 12b-1 fee, or other underwriting
or distribution fee would be charged by the Money Market Funds with respect to the purchase or redemption of their shares.
If a Money Market Fund offers more than one class of shares, each Investing Fund will invest only in the class with the
lowest expense ratio at the time of the investment.

6. Several of the Funds have contractual or voluntary expense cap arrangements with SIT Investment for the purpose
of keeping each Fund's total expenses below a certain predetermined percentage amount (``Expense Waiver''). To
the extent actual expenses of the Funds exceed these caps, SIT Investment waives its advisory fee or reimburses a Fund
in the amount of the excess. Any applicable Expense Waiver will not limit the advisory and other fee waiver or remittance
discussed above.

7. Applicants also request relief that would permit the Funds to invest uninvested cash in a Money Market Fund in excess
of the percentage limitations set out in section 12(d)(A)(ii) of the Act. Section 12(d)(A)(ii) prohibits a registered
investment company from acquiring the securities of another investment company if, immediately thereafter, the
acquiring company would have more than 5% of its total assets invested in the securities of the selling company. Applicants
propose that each Fund be permitted to invest in shares of a single Money Market Fund so long as each Fund's aggregate
investment in such Money Market Fund does not exceed the greater of 5% of such Fund's total net assets or $2.5 million.
Applicants will comply with all other provisions of section 12(d)(1).



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act make it unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company,
or any affiliated person of such affiliated person, acting as principal, to sell or purchase any security to or from
such investment company, Because each Fund may be deemed to be under common control with the other Funds, it may be an
``affiliated person,'' as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the other Funds. Accordingly, the sale of shares
of the Money Market Funds to the Investing Funds, and the redemption of such shares from the Investing Funds, would
be prohibited under section 17(a).

2. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a transaction from section 17(a) if the terms of the
proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve
overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered
investment company concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general policy of the Act. Section
17(b) could be interpreted to exempt only a single transaction. However, the Commission, under section 6(c) of the
Act, may exempt a series of transactions that otherwise would be prohibited by section 17(a).

3. The Investing Funds will retain their ability to invest their cash balances directly into money market instruments
if they believe they can obtain a higher return. Each of the Money Market Funds has the right to discontinue selling
shares to any of the Investing Funds if its board of trustees determines that such sales would adversely affect the
portfolio management and operations of such Money Market Fund. Therefore, applicants believe that the proposal
satisfies the standards for relief.


4. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder prohibit an affiliated person of an investment company,
acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise
or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates. Each Investing Fund, by purchasing shares of
the Money Market Funds; each Investment Adviser of an Investing Fund, by managing the assets of the Investing Funds
invested in the Money Market Funds; and each of the Money Market Funds, by selling shares to the Investing Funds, could
be participants in a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement within the meaning of section 17(d)(1) and rule 17d-1.


5. Rule 17d-1 permits the Commission to approve a proposed joint transaction covered by the terms of section
17(d). In determining whether to approve a transaction, the Commission is to consider whether the proposed transaction
is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation of
the investment companies is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants. Applicants
believe that the proposal satisfies these standards.


6. Section 12(d)(1), as noted above, sets certain limits on an investment company's ability to invest in the shares
of another investment company. The perceived abuses section 12(d)(1) sought to address include undue influence
by an acquiring fund over the management of an acquired fund, layering of fees, and complex structures. Applicants
believe that none of these concerns are presented by the proposed transactions and that the proposed transactions
meet the section 6(c) standards for relief.



Applicants' Conditions




Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:

1. Shares of the Money Market Funds sold to and redeemed from the Investing Funds will not be subject to a sales load,
redemption fee, or distribution fee under a plan adopted in accordance with rule 12b-1.


2. Applicants will cause the Investment Advisers and their respective affiliates, in their capacities as service
providers for the Money Market Funds, to remit to the respective Investing Fund or waive an amount equal to all fees
received by them or their affiliates under their respective agreements with the Money Market Funds to the extent such
fees are based upon the Investing Fund's assets invested in shares of the Money Market Funds. Any of these fees remitted
or waived will not be subject to recoupment by the Funds' Investment Advisers or their respective affiliates at a later
date.


3. For the purpose of determining any amount to be waived and/or expenses to be borne to comply with any Expense Waiver,
the adjusted fees for an Investing Fund (gross fees minus Expense Waiver) will be calculated without reference to
the amounts waived or remitted pursuant to condition 2. Adjusted fees then will be reduced by the amount waived pursuant
to condition 2. If the amount waived pursuant to condition 2 exceeds adjusted fees, the Investing Fund's Investment
Adviser also will reimburse the Investing Fund in an amount equal to such excess.


4. Each of the Investing Funds will be permitted to invest uninvested cash in, and hold shares of, a Money Market Fund
only to the extent that the Investing Fund's aggregate investment in such Money Market Fund does not exceed the greater
of 5% of the Investing Fund's total net assets or $2.5 million.


5. The Investing Funds will vote their shares of each of the Money Market Funds in the same proportion as the votes of
all other shareholders in such Money Market Funds.


6. The Investing Funds will receive dividends and bear their proportionate shares of expenses on the same basis as
other shareholders of such Money Market Funds. A separate account will be established in the shareholder records
of each of the Money Market Funds for each of the acquiring Investing Funds.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application to Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Sterling Electronics Corporation,
Common Stock, $0.50 Par Value) File No. 1-5522 </DOCTITLE>


July 21, 1994.



Sterling Electronics Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). 

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:


According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on July 13, 1994
and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex. 

In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for the common stock. 

Any interested person may, on or before August 11, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been
made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the
protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Nationwide Implementation of a Revolving Line of Credit Program</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration (SBA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is issuing notice to advise the public it is implementing a new revolving
line of credit loan guaranty program on a national basis to be called the GreenLine Revolving Line of Credit Loan Guaranty
Program (GreenLine). This program authorizes SBA to use its guaranty authority to provide the Agency's full faith
and credit support to loans made by approved lenders that finance the short term, cyclical working capital needs of
small businesses.


The establishment of GreenLine is in response to information obtained over a two year period demonstrating the need
for a nationwide revolving line of credit loan guaranty program. Many lenders acknowledged that this type of financing
was generally available in the commercial marketplace to only larger businesses with a need for larger lines of credit.
Small businesses would require the guaranty from SBA in order for lenders to provide them with the same opportunity.
GreenLine shall serve as the umbrella for all the Agency's short term lending programs with the exception of the Export
Revolving Line of Credit (ERLC) and the Export Co-Guaranty programs. Under GreenLine, authority to provide a revolving
feature to the Agency's traditional Contract, Seasonal, and Contractors loan programs is added.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The predecessor for this program was tested on a pilot basis in selected local markets beginning on October 1, 1992
when SBA began piloting two revolving line of credit loan programs. Both Programs were designed to assist small business
in obtaining cyclical working capital financing through the authority of SBA's 7(a) guaranty loan program.


The first pilot, called the Green Line Revolving Line of Credit Program (GRLC), was implemented in the Agency's South
East and South Central Regions, while the second, called the Domestic Revolving Line of Credit Program (DRLC) was
tested in all SBA Regions not served by the Green Line pilot. The predominant distinction between the programs dealt
with the maximum maturity permitted on the loans: GRLC loans had a maturity of up to five years, while the DRLC loans
had a maturity of only one year.
Case files were collected from field offices active in the two pilot programs which were reviewed in order to determine
the creditworthiness of the businesses seeking this financing, as well as to identify various terms and conditions
which would be prudent for inclusion in the new loan program's approval documents. The reviews and program formation
meetings also revealed that the new program would need servicing guidelines designed to provide maximum assurances
that the line would revolve and the losses minimized.
Since October 1, 1992, 531 loans have been approved under the GRLC pilot for a total of $130.0 million, while for the
same period, 327 loans have been approved under the DRLC pilot for a total of $71.0 million. It is important to note that
this volume of GRLC activity was generated in only two regions, while the DRLC volume was generated in eight. This activity
indicated that a much keener interest exists for the extended terms available under Pilot GRLC than under the Pilot
DRLC Program.
Under this program, advances will generally be made against a borrower's certified level of inventory and accounts
receivable, while repayment will be derived from the sale of that inventory and the collection of any resulting accounts
receivable. Participating lenders will be expected to monitor the disbursements of funds from the line and control
the payment of funds back to the line. Primary collateral will consist of a senior lien position on the assets being
financed.


Implementation


SBA will consider all applications submitted by approved GreenLine lenders which seek up to a 75% SBA guaranty of the
GreenLine financing, not to exceed $750,000. Lender's desiring to participate need to complete a Lender's Qualification
Survey which can be obtained from their local SBA District Office. The processing of GreenLine applications can only
be done by SBA personnel from offices which have completed SBA sponsored training, and received approval from SBA's
Office of Financial Assistance (OFA). Training material has been developed and the training schedule set. Once the
staff in a field office completes the required training, and is designated by OFA, it will be eligible to process GreenLine
applications received from approved participating lenders.
All field offices which have processed either GRLC or DRLC loans under the respective regional pilots will continue
to be able to accept and process these loans under their existing pilot guidelines until training has been offered
to their office by the SBA Associate Administrator for Financial Assistance (AA/FA), but in no event later than August
30, 1994. After this date, offices will only be able to accept GreenLine applications.


Additional Fees Permitted


In recognition of the additional servicing and monitoring required to adequately protect the interest of the lender
and SBA, the Agency is temporarily waiving its limitations on service related fees in order to permit the lender to
offset the costs associated with increased servicing required to prudently monitor the lines, and to provide a program
that relates to the lending practices of the private sector.
All of SBA's Regulations presently in effect relative to 7(a) guaranteed business loans (see 13 CFR, paragraphs 120
and 122) will also govern the implementation of GreenLine, provided, however, that the limitation on processing
and servicing fees as found in   120.104-2(a)(3) and 120.104-2(e) of SBA regulations (13
CFR 120.104-2(a)(3) and 120.104-2(e)) will be waived for a maximum two year pilot period. Notice of this
pilot is issued pursuant to  120.1-2 of SBA regulations (13 CFR 120.1-2). In addition, SBA will ascertain
whether this type of loan can be sold on the secondary market.
SBA will require that participating lenders fully disclose to both the borrower and SBA the fees they intend to charge
the borrower, and that the borrower acknowledge these fees in writing to the lender and SBA prior to the time the guaranty
of the loan is authorized by SBA, and every six months thereafter.
SBA is waiving the fee restriction for GreenLine for up to two years provided the Lender charges their SBA supported
borrowers the same fees and charges for services they would normally charge their non-SBA borrowers with similar
types of revolving lines of credit for similar services.

Outside Servicing Contractors Permitted



GreenLine will require a greater servicing effort by lenders than the Agency's other business loan programs and two
existing pilot programs. SBA recognizes that the extent of these servicing requirements may potentially inhibit
the willingness of small community-based, rural, and independent banks from participating in the program. This
may, in turn, have the undesirable effect of limiting access of creditworthy small businesses to the program in the
areas serviced by such lenders. Therefore, the Agency is authorizing lenders to contract out for the servicing functions
they do not perform themselves. Contracting does not relieve the lender of its responsibilities contained in SBA
Form 750 (or 750 B) or any individual loan authorization issued by SBA. The lenders will be held responsible by SBA for
the activities of their contractors. Every contractor must meet the minimum requirements, as specified below.

To assure that each GreenLine maintains its revolving feature, lenders agree to make initial and periodic examinations
of the borrower's current assets which serve as collateral and forms the basis for disbursements. Lenders also agree
to continually monitor the financial data and control of the cash generated by the borrower as a result of their having
the use of the GreenLine proceeds. At a minimum, a borrower's generated cash must go to an operating account where the
business can not make withdrawals without the concurrence of the Lender.

Considering the volatility of the collateral securing revolving lines of credit, lenders shall agree as a condition
for approval that they will liquidate a GreenLine borrower's current assets prior to seeking SBA's purchase of any
guaranty.



Third Party Service Providers



Minimum Requirements



The following standards have been formulated as guidelines for lenders participating in SBA's GreenLine Program
for use when evaluating and selecting an outside or third party service provider (Provider) who may perform those
examination, monitoring, or control functions required to prudently administer GreenLine loans guaranteed by
the SBA: Experience; Competence; Character; Equal Opportunity; Financial Responsibility; Coverage; Business
Authorities; and Confirmation. These standards are numerically arranged from 1 to 8. Those standards noted by an
``a'' after the number are required for lender approval of Providers who will perform examination services. The standards
noted with a ``b'' are required for lender approval of Providers who will perform monitoring or control services.

The lender shall have the responsibility for providing the required examination, monitoring, or control functions.
Under this program, the lender may contract with a Provider who meets these standards to assist the lender with the
examination, monitoring, or control functions. SBA takes no position on the approvability or quality of any Provider.

Privacy Act of 1974; Creation of Two New Systems of Records


Notice is hereby given that the Department of State proposes to create two new systems of records, STATE-59 and
STATE-60, pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(r)) and the Office
of Management and Budget Circular No. A-130, Appendix I. The Department's report was filed with the Office of
Management and Budget on July 11, 1994.
These systems principally support the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration's role in the processing of
applicants for the U.S. refugee program and the initial reception and placement in the United States of those who are
selected. The Refugee Case Records contain information about applicants for the United States refugee program.
The Refugee Data Center Processing Records contain information on applicants for the U.S. refugee program that is
used by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to determine their eligibility for the U.S. refugee program.
The Refugee Data Center Processing Records contain information on applicants for the U.S. refugee program which
is used in the initial reception and placement of persons admitted to the U.S. as refugees and to assist in the collection
of refugee travel loans.
Any persons interested in commenting on these proposed systems of records may do so by submitting comments in writing
to Margaret P. Grafeld, Chief, Privacy, Plans, and Appeals Division, Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and
Classification Review, Room 1239, Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520-1239. These
systems of records will be effective 40 days from the date of publication, (September 6, 1994), unless we receive comments
which will result in a contrary determination. The proposed systems, ``Refugee Case Records, STATE-59'' and
``The Refugee Data Center Processing Records, STATE-60'' will read as set forth below.

In the matter of U.S.-Germany; Third/Fourth/Fifth Freedom 
Frequency Allocations for the 
1994-95 Winter Season; Docket 49673 




<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 By this notice, we invite interested U.S. carriers to apply for allocation of the available frequencies for third/fourth/fifth
freedom combination-service operations in the U.S.-Germany market for the upcoming winter season (

i.e. 

November 1, 1994_March 31, 1995).

1

 







BACKGROUND: 

On May 24, 1994, representatives of the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a new Agreement for
Transitional Arrangements for Air Transport Services. Under provisions of this Agreement, scheduled combination
services are subject to seasonal frequency limitations. For the upcoming winter season, U.S. scheduled combination
carriers may operate a total of 253 weekly round-trip frequencies for U.S.-Germany (third/fourth freedom) services
and 120 weekly round-trip frequencies for Germany-third country (fifth freedom) services.

2

 The Agreement further provides that thirty days prior to each traffic season, each Party shall notify the other Party
through diplomatic channels of the initial allocation of the frequencies among its airlines.

3

 






Applications 





To facilitate our allocation of these frequencies, we invite all U.S. carriers interested in using the third/fourth/fifth
freedom frequencies to file their applications with the Department in Docket 49673. 



Applications should include the following information (identify separately for third/fourth and fifth freedom
frequencies): (a) the overall number of frequencies requested; (b) the markets to be served; (c) distribution of
the requested frequencies by market; (d) aircraft to be used (per market) and (e) manner of operation (i.e., direct
service/own aircraft or code share; if code share, identify with which carrier and over what third country point,
if applicable). 


Applicant carriers that have previously been allocated and operated flights in third/fourth/fifth freedom markets
for the 1993/94 winter season should also provide the following information with respect to those operations (identify
separately for third/fourth and fifth freedom allocations): (a) the number of flights previously allocated; (b)
markets served; (c) frequencies operated per market and period of operation for each market; (d) aircraft type per
market; and (e) manner of operation (i.e., direct service/own aircraft or code share; if code share, identify with
which carrier and over what third country point, if applicable).

4

 






Applicants are also free to submit any additional information that they believe will help us in making our decision.



An original and 12 copies of each application should be filed with the Department's Docket Section, Room 4107, 400
Seventh Street S.W., Washington, D.C., in Docket 49673 and served on all parties on the attached list. 




Procedural Schedule 




In light of the 30-day advance notice requirements set forth in the Agreement, it is important that we complete the
allocation process as quickly as possible. Therefore, we will require that applications and responsive pleadings
be filed according to the following schedule:





Applications: August 4, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>In the Matter of U.S.-Germany; Third Country Code-Share Designations </DOCTITLE>
and Frequency Allocations 


Summary 


By this notice, we invite interested U.S. carriers to apply for the two available designations and available frequencies
for operation of third-country code-sharing services in the U.S.-Germany market for the period November 1, 1994-October
31, 1996. 


Background 


On May 24, 1994, representatives of the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a new Agreement for
Transitional Arrangements for Air Transport Services (Agreement). Under the provisions of this Agreement, for
the period November 1, 1994-October 31, 1996, two U.S. carriers may be designated to serve Germany pursuant
to code-share arrangements with two airlines of third countries.

1

 In holding out these services each airline may serve a single point in the respective intermediate country, and no
two airlines designated by the same Party may serve the same intermediate point. In addition, these operations are
limited to a total of 1428 weekly one-way frequencies.

2

 





The Agreement further provides that thirty days prior to each traffic season, each Party shall notify the other Party
through diplomatic channels of the initial allocation of the frequencies among its airlines.

3

 




The U.S. previously was entitled to authorize only one carrier to operate on a third-country code-share basis for
U.S.-Germany services. Northwest Airlines has been designated for this service since November 1993. When Northwest
was last authorized (March 24, 1994) to use the third-country code-share designation, it had requested that its designation
be effective through October 31, 1995. The Department, in extending Northwest's designation through this summer
season (i.e., October 31, 1994), deferred on a decision concerning which carriers would be authorized to use available
rights after November 1, and stated that further procedures regarding these designations would be announced at a
later date.

4

 





Applications 


Given the provisions of Article 6, Section 4 B(1)(b) of the new U.S.-Germany Agreement, we invite U.S. carriers interested
in using the available designations and frequencies for third-country code-share operations in the U.S.-Germany
market to file such applications in Docket 49674.

5

 




Applications should include, at a minimum, the following information: (a) the number of frequencies requested;
(b) the code-share partner involved and the country over which the services will be provided; (c) existing authority
held to conduct the operations, if applicable;

6

 (d) proposed startup date; 




Applicants are also free to submit any additional information that they believe will help us in making our decision.

An original and 12 copies of each application should be filed with the Department's Docket Section, Room 4107, 400
Seventh Street SW, Washington, D.C. 20590, in Docket 49674 and should be filed on all parties on the attached list.



Procedural Schedule 


In light of the 30-day advance notice requirements set forth in the Agreement, it is important that we complete the
designation/allocation process as quickly as possible. Therefore, we will require that applications and responsive
pleadings be filed in accordance with the following schedule: 

Applications: August 4, 1994 
Answers: August 11, 1994 
Replies: August 18, 1994 

We will serve this notice upon all U.S. air carriers licensed to conduct scheduled foreign combination services with
large aircraft, and will publish this Notice in the 

Federal Register

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a proposed
highway project in Barbour County, Alabama.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) on a proposal to improve a segment of U.S. Highway 431 in Barbour County, Alabama. The purpose of the proposed
project is to provide a safe, efficient, cost-effective, multi-lane facility, capable of handling existing and
future traffic demands. The EIS will evaluate the realigning of a portion of U.S. 431 to function as a bypass around
the City of Eufaula, Alabama. The proposed project will begin on U.S. Highway 431, south of the City of Eufaula near
Cheneghatchee Creek.




The route will extend to the northeast, passing around the City, and terminating with the intersection of U.S. 431
near Hoboken. The length of the proposal is approximately 6.4 kilometers (4 miles). Alternatives under consideration
include: (1) alternate route locations, (2) taking no action, and (3) postponing the action. 

Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies and private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest in
this proposal. A public involvement meeting and a public hearing will be held in the City of Eufaula. Public notice
will be given of the time and the place of the meeting and hearing. No formal scoping meeting is planned at this time.


To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) on a proposal to improve a segment of U.S. Highway 80 in Lee, Macon, and Russell Counties, Alabama. The proposed
project begins at Interstate Highway 85 (I-85) and extends to the east for approximately 58 kilometers (36 miles).
The proposal would serve as the primary connecting route between the Phenix City metropolitan area and the Interstate
highway system. It is anticipated that improvements will generally be made along the existing alignment of U.S. 80.
The improvements to the travel corridor are considered necessary to provide for the existing and projected traffic
demand. Alternatives under consideration include: (1) alternate route locations, (2) improving the existing roadway,
(3) taking no action, and (4) postponing the action.



Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies and private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest in
this proposal. A public involvement meeting will be held when sufficient information is available. Public notice
will be given of the time and the place of the meeting and hearing. No formal scoping meeting is planned at this time.

To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.
