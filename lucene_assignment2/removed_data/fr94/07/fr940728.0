 Correcting amendments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) is correcting its regulations on the Rural Economic Development
Loan and Grant Program in order to update Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers and internal references.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program contained in part 1703 in the Code of Federal Regulations is
in need of correction for two reasons: (1)  1703.34 contains a non-current Office of Management and Budget control
number which was inadvertently overlooked when the regulation was updated on March 14, 1994, at 59 FR 11702. The current
control number is being inserted; and (2) Internal references need to be redesignated in  1703.46 as the paragraphs
in which they are found were redesignated in the rule published on March 14, 1994, at 59 FR 11702.


List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1703 


Community development, Grant programs_housing and community development, Loan programs_housing and community
development, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Rural areas. 


PART 1703_RURAL DEVELOPMENT 


Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1703 is corrected by making the following correcting amendments: 
1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 1703 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

2. At the end of  1703.34, remove the Office of Management and Budget control number ``0572-0086'' in the
parentheticals, and add, in its place, the number ``0572-0090''. 


 1703.46

 [Amended] 


3. In the list below, for each paragraph indicated in the left column, remove the term indicated in the middle column
from wherever it appears in the paragraph, and add the term indicated in the right column:

Federal-State Research on Cooperatives Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Rural Development Administration, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rulemaking establishes within the Rural 
Development Administration (RDA) a matching fund cooperative 
research agreement program to State Departments of 
Agriculture, State Agricultural Experiment Stations, and other 
related State Agencies to conduct marketing research related 
to cooperatives. This rule establishes the procedures to be 
followed annually in the solicitation of cooperative agreement 
proposals, the evaluation of such proposals, and the award of 
the cooperative agreements under this program. These rules 
are necessary to award the funds appropriated to Agricultural 
Marketing Service in fiscal year 1994 for research on cooperatives under the Federal-States Marketing Improvement

Program. The intended effect is to encourage more research at 
state levels that will enhance the well-being of agricultural 
cooperatives and their members.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Classification 


This rule has been determined to be not-significant for 
purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been 
reviewed by OMB. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection or recordkeeping requirements 
contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provision of 44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 
0570-0005 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This final rule does not revise or 
impose any new information collection or recordkeeping 
requirement from those approved by OMB. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601-612), the undersigned has determined and certified 
by signature of this document that this rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. 


Environmental Impact Statement 


This regulation does not significantly affect the 
environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement is 
not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). 


Intergovernmental Review 


This program is considered a part of ``Technical 
Assistance To Cooperatives'' as listed as No. 10.350 in the 
``Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance''. For reasons set 
forth in the Final Rule-related Notice to 7 CFR part 3015, 
subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983), this program is 
excluded from the scope of Executive Order No. 12372 which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local 
officials. 


Civil Justice Reform 


This document has been reviewed in accordance with 
Executive Order (E.O.) 12778. It is the determination of RDA 
that this action does not unduly burden the Federal Court 
System in that it meets all applicable standards provided in 
section 2 of the E.O. 


Discussion of Rule 


A proposed rule was issued on this subject on May 9, 1994 
(59 FR 23804-10). No comments were received on the proposed 
rule. The proposed rule, therefore, is adopted as final 
except for the administrative changes discussed below. 
In error, the proposed rule indicated in one place the 
Federal-State Research On Cooperatives (FSROC) Program was 
subject to Executive Order 12372 requiring intergovernmental 
consultations and in another place that it was exempt from the 
Order. The FSROC Program is excluded from the scope of the 
Executive Order No. 12372; therefore, the incorrect reference 
in the proposed rule was removed. 
In addition, the definition of ``State agencies'' eligible 
under the program has been changed to include State 
Agricultural Experiment stations and State Departments of 
Agriculture in the 50 States, the Virgin Islands, and Guam, 
and other appropriate State agencies. The proposed rule 
included experiment stations and State Departments of 
Agriculture in the 50 States and all territories or 
possessions of the United States. The change was made to 
conform to the limiting language of 7 U.S.C. 1626 which 
defines ``state'' to include the Virgin Islands and Guam. The 
Agency has interpreted the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 
(7 U.S.C. 1621-27) as providing no authority to fund 
marketing research by agencies of other United States 
territories or possessions.

For the reasons set out in the preamble, 7 CFR Ch. XLII

(2) Have the necessary administrative and supervisory 
controls in place to assure an agreed upon contracting 
organization has the proven ability to perform responsibly in 
the field of economic, business management, or other needed 
research area; 
(c) Legally obligate itself to administer cooperative

(d) Provide at least 50 percent of the funds necessary to 
conduct the research from non-federal funds; and 
(e) Agree to conduct proposed research related to 
cooperatives and agricultural marketing. 


 4285.25 

Authorized use of cooperative agreement funds. 


Funds received for research under cooperative agreements 
in this program shall only be used for: 
(a) Payment of salaries and necessary employee benefits 
of personnel as agreed upon in the Cooperative Agreement. 
Included are salaries and benefits of State employees assigned 
full-time to one or more projects, or the percent of the 
salaries and benefits related to project work for State 
employees assigned part-time to research on one or more 
projects. Salaries and benefits include basic salary, other 
compensation such as holiday pay, sick or annual leave, and 
personnel benefits (quarters allowance, payments to other 
funds such as employees' life insurance, health benefits, 
retirement, Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), 
accident compensation, and similar payments). For any of the 
benefit items when the State usually pays the employer share, 
Federal funds may be used to pay the proportionate share of 
such employer contributions. 
(b) Payment of necessary and reasonable office expenses 
such as office rental, office utilities, and office equipment 
rental. The purchase of office equipment is permissible when 
the cooperator determines it to be more economical than 
renting. However, as a general rule, these types of expenses 
would be classified as indirect costs in multiple funded 
organizations and would not be an allowable expense. Planned 
purchases of equipment costing more than $200 per unit must be 
approved by RDA. Equipment purchased becomes State property 
pursuant to the cooperative agreement. 
(c) Payment of necessary and reasonable costs of printing 
publications of research project results. However, all such 
publications should show the RDA as cooperator in the project 
and bear the following statement: ``State funds for this 
project (publication) were matched with Federal funds under 
the Federal-State Research on Cooperatives Program of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, Rural Development Administration, 
Cooperative Services, as provided by the Agricultural 
Marketing Act of 1946 and (appropriate) fiscal year 
appropriations.'' 
(d) Purchase of office supplies (such as paper, pens, 
pencils, and trade magazines) and postage needed for project 
activities. 
(e) Payment of necessary and reasonable travel expenses. 


  4285.26-4285.45 

[Reserved] 


 4285.46 

Prohibited use of cooperative agreement funds. 


(a) The Agricultural Marketing Act prohibits the use of 
Federal funds to pay for newspaper or periodical space and 
radio and television time, either directly to the media or 
indirectly though an advertising agency or other firm. County 
and State fair exhibits, as well as commodity months and 
weeks, are also excluded as the research on cooperatives 
program activities. 
(b) Federal funds cannot be used to purchase products or 
samples of products to give away to the public. 
(c) Federal program funds cannot be used to purchase: 
(1) Promotional pieces such as point-of-sale materials, 
promotional kits, billboard space and signs, streamers, 
automobile stickers, table tents, and placemats; or 
(2) Promotion items of a personal gift nature. 
(d) Cooperative agreement funds cannot be used to conduct 
general publicity or information programs designed to build 
the image of the State's agriculture or of a particular State 
Department of Agriculture or Agricultural Experiment Station. 
(e) Project funds cannot be used to pay for the salary 
and travel of employees of cooperatives, trade associations, 
commodity groups, and other industry organizations, or of 
State personnel while engaged in managing market orders, 
cooperatives, or other group endeavors. 
(f) Commissioners, Directors, and Secretaries of State 
Departments of Agriculture, Agricultural Experiment Stations, 
and other State agencies cannot charge their salaries and 
travel to project funds, with the exception of travel to 
workshops or conferences devoted to the Federal-State Research 
On Cooperatives Program. 
(g) Funds made available for this program shall not be 
subject to reduction for indirect costs or for tuition 
remission.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>








Annual Physical Fitness Performance Testing for 
Tactical Response Team Members, Armed Response Personnel, 
and Guards at Category I Licensees 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations regarding annual physical fitness performance
testing for Tactical Response Team members, armed response personnel, and guards at fuel cycle facilities possessing
formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material (Category I licensees). This action is necessary to ensure
that these personnel are able to perform their assigned duties under conditions of strenuous tactical engagements.
Tactical Response Team members, armed response personnel, and guards at these facilities will be required to participate
in a continuing physical fitness program and, according to new criteria, pass an annual performance test. As an alternative
to the fitness program and the performance test, the licensee will be permitted to develop and submit for NRC approval
a content-based site specific test, to be administered quarterly, and to justify that this test duplicates the response
duties that are expected of Tactical Response Team members, armed response personnel, and guards in the event of a
strenuous tactical engagement.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On December 13, 1991 (56 FR 65024), the Commission published proposed amendments to 10 CFR Part 73 that contained requirements
relative to the physical fitness programs and day firing qualifications for security personnel at Category I fuel
cycle facilities. Those amendments would have required Tactical Response Team (TRT) members, armed response personnel,
and guards to participate in annual physical fitness performance testing and in a continuing physical fitness training
program to ensure that these individuals achieve and maintain the required fitness level. 
During the resolution of the public comments for those proposed amendments, the NRC concluded that an acceptable
alternative to the approach specified in the proposed rule would be for licensees to develop and submit for NRC approval
a site specific content-based physical fitness performance test. To provide the public the opportunity to comment
on the modified requirements, the NRC published yet another proposed rule on the physical fitness performance testing
requirements on October 6, 1993 (58 FR 52035). 
Under the alternative included with the modified rule, the licensee will administer the test quarterly and justify
that the test duplicates the response duties that a security force officer would perform during strenuous tactical
engagements. The NRC recognizes that, in the absence of an ongoing physical fitness training program, the use of a
content-based performance test may present risks of potential injury to security personnel. Each licensee should
evaluate these risks of potential injury to unfit employees when choosing between the alternatives. The NRC will
not object to the use of a content-based test on the basis of perceived risk of employee injury. Such risk of injury will
be assumed by the licensee and/or the armed security persons. 
The comment period expired on December 20, 1993, with no public comments being received. Therefore, the Commission
is publishing the requirements proposed on October 6, 1993 (58 FR 52035), as a final rule without any modification.



Criminal Penalties 


The Commission notes that these amendments are issued under Sections 161 (b) and (i) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,
as amended. Therefore, violation of these regulations may subject a person to criminal sanctions under Section 223
of the Atomic Energy Act. 


Finding of no Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 



The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in Subpart A of 
10 CFR Part 51, that this rule is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,
and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. The rule will not adversely affect either the safety
of the operations carried out by licensees possessing formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material
nor the routine release of, or exposure to, radioactivity. These amendments will specify (1) annual performance
testing criteria and a minimum physical fitness training program or (2) a quarterly administered site specific content-based
physical fitness performance test to assure that Tactical Response Team members, armed response personnel, and
guards can adequately perform their duties under conditions of strenuous tactical engagement. 
The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based is available
for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the
environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available from Mr. Harry Tovmassian, Office of
Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415-6231.



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


This rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44
U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget approval number 3150-0002.

The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 41 hours per licensee respondent,
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the
data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate
or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information
and Records Management Branch (T6 F33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; and to the Desk
Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-3019, (3150-0002), Office of Management
and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. 


Regulatory Analysis 


The Commission has prepared a regulatory analysis on this rule. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the
alternatives considered by the Commission and provides a decision rationale for the chosen approach. The analysis
is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single
copies of the regulatory analysis may be obtained from Ms. Carrie Brown, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards,
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415-8092. 


Regulatory Flexibility Certification 


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this rulemaking
will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The rule will affect two Category
I licensees. The companies that own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities''
set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business Size Standards set out in regulations issued by the
Small Business Administration in 13 CFR Part 121. Thus, this rule does not fall within the purview of the act.

Backfit Analysis 


The Commission has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this rule because these amendments
do not impose requirements on existing 10 CFR Part 50 licensees. Therefore, a backfit analysis is not required for
this rule. 


List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 73 


Criminal penalties, Export, Hazardous materials transportation, Nuclear materials, Nuclear power plants and
reactors, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures.

 
For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy
Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the Commission is adopting the following amendments

Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F-27 Mark 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F-27 series airplanes,
that requires the implementation of a corrosion prevention and control program either by accomplishing specific
tasks or by revising the maintenance inspection program to include such a program. This amendment is prompted by reports
of incidents involving corrosion and fatigue cracking in transport category airplanes that are approaching or have
exceeded their economic design goal; these incidents have jeopardized the airworthiness of the affected airplanes.
The actions 
specified by this AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural capabilities of the airplane due to the
problems associated with corrosion.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F-27 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register 

on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11739). That action proposed to require the implementation of a corrosion prevention and control
program either by accomplishing specific tasks or by revising the maintenance inspection program to include such
a program. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
One commenter supports the proposal. 
Another commenter suggests that the FAA reconsider the applicability of the proposed AD. This commenter requests
that the applicability statement be worded so that it will not affect future models of this airplane, such as the Model
F-27 Mark 800, which does not exist yet. The FAA concurs. Inclusion of a reference to that model in the applicability
of the proposed rule was in error. The final rule has been revised to delete reference to it. 
This same commenter points out that the latest version of the parallel Netherlands Airworthiness Directive (BLA)
is BLA 91-113, Issue 3, dated November 1, 1993. The preamble to the notice referred to an earlier version of this
BLA that was issued June 26, 1992. The FAA acknowledges this information. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
The FAA estimates that 55 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this proposed AD. It will take an average of
approximately 7 work hours per basic task to accomplish the 75 basic tasks called out in the Document; this represents
a total average of 525 work hours. The average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the AD on U.S. operators for the 6-year average inspection cycle is estimated to be $1,588,125, or $28,875
per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining 
safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so
by the AD. 
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft
must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA
makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining
those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial.
When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a 
finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and
that the proposed actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been
determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would be redundant and unnecessary. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at

PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 


 39.13 

[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:





94-15-11 Fokker: 

Amendment 39-8982. Docket 93-NM-76-AD.





Applicability: 

Model F-27 Mark 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 series airplanes (does not include Model F-27 MK 050
series airplanes) airplanes, certificated in any category. 


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To preclude degradation of the structural capabilities of the airplane due to the problems associated with corrosion,
accomplish the following:





Note 1: 

This AD references Fokker Document SE-291, ``F-27 Corrosion 
Control Program,'' including all revisions through October 1, 1993 (hereafter referred to as ``the Document''),
for basic tasks, definitions of corrosion levels, compliance times, and reporting requirements. In addition, this
AD specifies inspection and reporting requirements beyond those included in the Document. Where there are differences
between the AD and the Document, the AD prevails. 


Note 2: 

As used throughout this AD, the term ``the FAA'' is defined differently for different operators, as follows: For those
operators complying with paragraph (a) of this AD, ``the FAA'' is defined as ``the Manager of the Standardization
Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.'' For those operators operating under Federal Aviation
Regulation (FAR) Part 121 or 129, and complying with paragraph (b) of this AD, ``the FAA'' is defined as ``the cognizant
Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI).'' For those operators operating under FAR Part 91 or 125, and complying with
paragraph (b) of 
this AD, ``the FAA'' is defined as ``the cognizant Maintenance Inspector at the appropriate FAA Flight Standards
office.'' 


Note 3: 

The FAA recommends that priority for implementing the corrosion prevention and control program, specified in this
AD, be given to older aircraft and areas requiring a significant upgrade of previous maintenance procedures to meet
the program requirements.



(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this AD, complete each of the basic tasks specified in Section 2.4 of the Document
in accordance with the procedures of the Document, and the schedule specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this
AD.





Note 4: 

A ``basic task,'' as defined in Section 2.4 of the Document, includes inspections; procedures for a corrective action,
including repairs, under identified circumstances; application of sealants or corrosion inhibitors; and other
follow-on actions. 


Note 5: 

Airplane ``areas'' are those items listed in columnar form in the ``ACTION'' statement of each task, as listed in the
Document. 


Note 6: 

Basic tasks completed in accordance with the Document before the effective date of this AD may be credited for compliance
with the initial basic task requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this AD. 


Note 7: 

Where non-destructive inspection (NDI) methods are employed, in accordance with Section 2.4 of the Document, the
standards and procedures used must be acceptable to the Administrator in accordance with FAR Section 43.13.



(1) Complete the initial basic task of each aircraft zone specified in Section 2.4 of the Document as follows: 
(i) For airplane areas that have not yet exceeded the ``Initial Inspection Time (IIT)'' for a basic task as of one year
after the effective date of this AD: Initial compliance must occur no later than the IIT, or no later than one Repeat
Inspection Time (RIT) interval measured from a date one year after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs
later. 
(ii) For airplane areas that have exceeded the IIT for a particular basic task as of one year after the effective date
of this AD: Initial compliance must occur within one RIT interval for that task, or within 6 years, measured from a date
one year after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. 
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this AD, accomplish the initial basic task, for each
area that exceeds the IIT for that area, at a minimum rate of one such area every two years, beginning one year after the
effective date of this AD.





Note 8: 

This paragraph does not require inspection of any area that has not exceeded the IIT for that area. 


Note 9: 

This minimum rate requirement may cause an undue hardship on some small operators. In those circumstances, requests
for adjustments to the implementation rate will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis under the provisions of paragraph
(h) of this AD.



(2) Repeat each basic task at a time interval not to exceed the RIT interval specified in the Document for that task.

(b) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD: Prior to one year after the effective date of this
AD, revise the FAA-approved maintenance/inspection program to include the corrosion control program specified
in the Document; or to include an equivalent program that is approved by the FAA. In all cases, the initial basic task
for each airplane area must be completed in accordance with the compliance schedule 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this AD. 
(1) Any operator complying with paragraph (b) of this AD may use an alternative recordkeeping method to that otherwise
required by FAR Section 91.417 or Section 121.380 for the actions required by this AD, provided it is approved by the
FAA and is included in a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance/inspection program. 
(2) Subsequent to the accomplishment of the initial basic task, extensions of RIT intervals specified in the Document
must be approved by the FAA. 
(c) To accommodate unanticipated scheduling requirements, it is acceptable for an RIT interval to be increased by
up to 10%, but not to exceed 6 months. The FAA must be informed, in writing, of any such extension within 30 days after
such adjustment of the schedule. 
(d)(1) If, as a result of any inspection conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD, Level 3 corrosion
is determined to exist in any airplane area, accomplish either paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) within 7 days after
such determination: 
(i) Submit a report of that determination to the FAA and complete the basic task in the affected aircraft zones on all
Model F-27 series airplanes in the operator's fleet; or 
(ii) Submit to the FAA for approval one of the following: 
(A) A proposed schedule for performing the basic tasks in the affected aircraft zones on the remaining Model F-27
series airplanes in the operator's fleet, which is adequate to ensure that any other Level 3 corrosion is detected
in a timely manner, along with substantiating data for that schedule; or 
(B) Data substantiating that the Level 3 corrosion found is an isolated occurrence.





Note 10: 

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.1 of the Document, which would permit corrosion that otherwise meets
the definition of Level 3 corrosion (i.e., which is determined to be a potentially urgent airworthiness concern requiring
expeditious action) to be treated as Level 1 if the operator finds that it ``can be attributed to an event not typical
of the operator's usage of other airplanes in the same fleet,'' this paragraph 
requires that data substantiating any such finding be submitted to the FAA (ref. 

Note 2 

of this AD) for approval.



(2) The FAA may impose schedules other than those proposed, upon finding that such changes are necessary to ensure
that any other Level 3 corrosion is detected in a timely manner. 
(3) Within the time schedule approved under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this AD, accomplish the basic tasks in the
affected aircraft zones of the remaining Model F-27 series airplanes in the operator's fleet. 
(e) If, as a result of any inspection after the initial inspection conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b)
of this AD, it is determined that corrosion findings exceed Level 1 in any area, within 60 days after such determination,
implement a means, approved by the FAA, to reduce future findings of corrosion in that area to Level 1 or better. 
(f) Before any operator places into service any airplane subject to the 
requirements of this AD, a schedule for the accomplishment of basic tasks required by this AD must be established in
accordance with paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this AD, as applicable: 
(1) For airplanes previously maintained in accordance with this AD, the first basic task in each aircraft zone to be
performed by the new operator must be accomplished in accordance with the previous operator's schedule or with the
new operator's schedule, whichever would result in the earlier accomplishment date for that task. After each basic
task has been performed once, each subsequent task must be performed in accordance with the new operator's schedule.

(2) For airplanes that have not been previously maintained in accordance with this AD, the first basic task for each
aircraft zone to be performed by the new operator must be accomplished prior to further flight or in accordance with
a schedule approved by the FAA.

(g) Within 7 days after the date of detection of any Level 3 corrosion, and within 
3 months after the date of detection of any Level 2 corrosion, submit a report to Fokker of 
such findings, in accordance with Section 2.5 of the Document. 





Note 11: 

Reporting to the FAA of Level 2 and Level 3 corrosion found as a 
result of any opportunity inspections is highly desirable. 



(h) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time, 
which provides an acceptable level of safety, may be used when approved by the Manager, 
Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators 
shall submit their requests through the cognizant Maintenance Inspector at the appropriate 
FAA Flight Standards office, who may concur or comment and then send it to the 
Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113. 





Note 12: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods 
of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch,

(i) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 
21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the 
airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. 
(j) Reports of inspection results required by this AD have been approved by the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) and have been assigned OMB Control 
Number 2120-0056. 
(k) The completion of the ``basic tasks'' shall be done in accordance with Fokker

Airworthiness Directives: Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A-1,
269B, 269C, and TH-55A Series Helicopters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes
Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A-1, 269B, 269C, and TH-55A series helicopters, that requires mandatory
replacement of all the clevis pins associated with the belt drive clutch control installation. This amendment is
prompted by an accident involving the separation of the belt drive clutch control spring assembly (spring assembly)
from the idler pulley assembly. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent separation of the spring assembly
from the idler pulley assembly, loss of power to the main rotor system, and a subsequent forced landing. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A-1,
269B, 269C, and TH-55A series helicopters was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41444). That action proposed to require replacement of all clevis pins associated with the
belt drive clutch control installation. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed with one change. The AD proposed compliance on
or before January 13, 1994, or within the next 400 hours' time-in-service (TIS), whichever comes first. Since January
13, 1994, has passed, the AD has been changed to now require compliance within 30 days after the effective date of the
AD or within 400 hours' TIS, whichever comes first. 
The FAA estimates that 1,100 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
1/2 work hour per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts will cost approximately $10 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $41,250. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives: The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Model F-28C, F-28C-2, F-28F,
280C, 280F, and 280FX Series Helicopters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation
Model F-28C, F-28C-2,
  F-28F, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters. This action requires a visual inspection for cracks
in the tail rotor spindle; a repetitive dye penetrant inspection for cracks; and removal and replacement of the tail
rotor spindle upon reaching 1,200 hours' time-in-service (TIS). This amendment is prompted by five reports of cracked
tail rotor spindles. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the tail rotor spindle, loss
of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive that is applicable to The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom)
Model F-28C, F-28C-2,
  F-28F, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters equipped with tail rotor spindle (spindle), part number
(P/N) 28-150064-11 or 28-150064-13. The manufacturer advises that there have been five reports
of cracked spindles that had time-in-service (TIS) ranging from 282 to 3,449 hours. Three of the five defects were
found during a visual preflight inspection. One of the reported incidents resulted in an emergency landing due to
a tail rotor imbalance and the resultant high vibrations as a result of the cracked spindle. Based on an analysis and
evaluation of the data, the FAA has determined that an unsafe condition exists in the spindle. This condition, if not
corrected, could result in failure of the spindle, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of
the helicopter. 


The FAA has reviewed and approved The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Directive Bulletin (SDB) No. 0077,
Revision B, dated November 16, 1992, that describes procedures for performing a visual inspection of the area around
the spindle teeter bearing bores for cracks prior to the next flight and prior to each subsequent flight, and if cracks
are found, removal and replacement of the spindle with an airworthy spindle; continuing the visual inspection before
each flight and performing a dye penetrant inspection of the spindle for cracks within the next five hours' TIS; securing
the spindle bearing caps with safety wire following the dye penetrant inspection; and removing and replacing spindles
with 1,200 hours' or more total TIS. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Enstrom Model F-28C,
F-28C-2, F-28F, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters of the same type design, this AD is being
issued to prevent failure of the spindle, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.
Before further flight, this AD requires a visual inspection of the spindle, part number (P/N) 28-150064-11
or 28-150064-13, for cracks in accordance with paragraph 5.2 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16,
1992. A dye penetrant inspection is required whenever track and balance procedures are required more than once within
a 5 hours' TIS period. Additionally, within the next 25 hours' TIS and thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 25 hours'
TIS, this AD requires an inspection of the spindle for cracks (without removing the tail rotor from the helicopter)
using a visual and dye penetrant inspection in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November
16, 1992. Also, this AD requires replacement of spindles with cracks or scratches, nicks, or surface discontinuities
that are in excess of certain specified tolerances, or, if the spindle is not required to be replaced, returning the
helicopter to service in accordance with paragraph 5.4 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992. Replacing
a spindle, P/N 28-150064-11 or 28-150064-13, is also required within the next 100 hours' TIS,
or on or before reaching 1,200 hours' TIS, whichever occurs later. Installing a spindle, P/N 28-150074-11,
constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. Since the unsafe condition requires an immediate
inspection to ensure safety of the fleet, this AD needs to be adopted immediately, without prior public comment. The
compliance requirements of this AD and take precedence over those stated in the Service Directive Bulletin, except
where specifically referenced in this AD. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

procedures or track and balance procedures are required more than once within a 5 hours' TIS period, inspect the spindle
teetering bearing bores for cracks using a dye penetrant method in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of SDB 0077, Revision
B, dated November 16, 1992. 
(c) Within the next 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD)
and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 25 hours' TIS from the last inspection, without removing the tail rotor from
the helicopter, inspect the spindle teetering bearing bores for cracks using a dye penetrant inspection and visually
inspect for scratches, nicks, or surface discontinuities in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of SDB 0077, Revision
B, dated November 16, 1992. 
(d) If neither a crack nor any scratches, nicks, or surface discontinuities are found that exceed the tolerances specified
in paragraph 5.3.4 and 5.3.5 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992, during the inspections required by paragraphs
(a), (b), or (c) of this AD, return the helicopter to service in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph
5.3.5 of the SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992, and the applicable maintenance manual. 
(e) If a crack is found, or scratches, nicks, or surface discontinuities are found that exceed the tolerances specified
in paragraph 5.3.4 and 5.3.5 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992, remove the spindle before further flight
and install an airworthy spindle in accordance with the provisions of the appropriate maintenance manual. 
(f) Within the next 100 hours' TIS or, on or before reaching 1,200 hours' TIS, whichever occurs later, remove spindle,
P/N 28-150064-11 or 28-150064-13, from service and replace it with an airworthy spindle in
accordance with the appropriate maintenance manual. 
(g) Installation of a spindle, P/N 28-150074-11, constitutes terminating action for the requirements
of this AD. 
(h) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit
their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager,
Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. 





Note:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. 



(i) Except for the inspection required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD, special flight permits may be issued in
accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate
the helicopter to a location where the other requirements of this AD can be accomplished. 
(j) The inspections shall be done in accordance with The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Directive Bulletin
No. 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the
Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. Copies may be obtained from The Enstrom Helicopter
Corporation, Twin County Airport, P.O. Box 490, Menominee, Michigan 49858. Copies may be inspected at the FAA, Office

Modification of Class D Airspace and Establishment of Class E Airspace, Adak, Anchorage Merrill Field, Bethel, Juneau,
Kenai, King Salmon, and Kodiak, AK



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule; correction.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This document contains corrections to the final rule published on May 6, 1994. This final rule modified the Class D
airspace areas at Adak, Anchorage Merrill Field, Bethel, Juneau, Kenai, King Salmon, and Kodiak, AK, by amending
the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action established
Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower was closed. This action will correct these Class
E airspace descriptions to reflect that they extend upward from the surface to the overlying or adjacent controlled
airspace.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

On April 26, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule that modified the Class D airspace
areas at Adak, Anchorage Merrill Field, Bethel, Juneau, Kenai, King Salmon, and Kodiak, AK, by amending the areas'
effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also established
Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower is closed (59 FR 23621; May 6, 1994). The FAA inadvertently
modified the Class E airspace designation by including an altitude in feet MSL above the surface. This correction
will allow the Class E area's to extend upward from the surface to the overlying or adjacent controlled airspace.

Offsets, Recoupments and Refunds of Excess Payments of Royalties, Rentals, Bonuses, or Other Amounts Under Federal
Offshore Mineral Leases



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Minerals Management Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Royalty Management Program of the Minerals Management Service (MMS) is amending its regulations establishing
procedures for obtaining refunds and credits of excess payments made under Federal mineral leases on the Outer Continental
Shelf (OCS) which are subject to section 10 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (OCSLA section 10). The
rules also describe the circumstances in which a person may recover certain payments that are not subject to section
10's requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The principal authors of this proposed rule are Paul A. Knueven, Technical Compliance Branch, Division of Verification,
Royalty Management Program, MMS, Lakewood, Colorado, and Peter J. Schaumberg, Office of the Solicitor, Washington,
DC.



I. Background



Excess payments of royalties, rentals, bonuses, or other amounts made under OCS mineral leases result from a variety
of reasons (discussed in detail in the preamble to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) at 58 FR 53470-53471,
October 15, 1993). Section 10(a) requires that a request for refund or credit of an excess payment made in connection
with any lease issued under that Act be filed with the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) within 2 years after making
the payment. Section 10(b) requires that all refunds or credits which the Secretary proposes to approve be reported
to Congress, and that the Secretary wait at least 30 days while Congress is in continuous session before making a refund
payment or authorizing a credit. Any repayment made pursuant to the Act must be without interest.

The purpose of these regulations is to codify the Department's interpretation and application of section 10, incorporating
the policies and decisions from the various legal opinions, administrative decisions, and administrative practice
which are discussed in detail in the preamble to the NOPR.



II. Comments on Proposed Rule



The proposed rulemaking (58 FR 53470, October 15, 1993) provided for a 60-day public comment period, which ended December
14, 1993. Eleven commenters submitted written comments during this period. The principal comments are addressed
in this section.



General Comments



(a) Several commenters requested that MMS revisit the reasoning and legal arguments contained in the 1981 M-opinion
Refunds and Credits Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act M-36942, 88 I.D. 1091 (December 15, 1981) (``1981
M-Opinion''). One commenter proposed that MMS not permit offsetting as a means to recover an overpayment for one production
month to the extent underpayments exist on the same lease for another month. Another commenter requested MMS to reconsider
the operation of the 2-year period for requesting refund or credit, suggesting it could start later than the date of
payment in specific circumstances. This same commenter also suggested that section 10 should be construed to apply
only to refunds, with credit adjustments not subject to section 10's limitation.



Response:

 MMS disagrees with these comments. The 1981 M-Opinion, and a second M-Opinion, Applicability of section 10 of the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, M-36977 (Jan. 15, 1993) (``1993 M-Opinion''), reflect the Department's
interpretation of section 10's requirements. The Department is not convinced that its legal view is wrong. Therefore,
the purpose of the rulemaking is to codify the Department's existing interpretation and application of section 10.

(b) A commenter suggested that the regulations should require the Government to act on a refund request within 90 days.
Absent such action the lessee should automatically be authorized to process a credit adjustment.



Response:

 Section 10 is specific in the procedures that must be followed for approval of a refund or credit. Unless those preconditions
are satisfied, MMS does not have the legal authority to allow a refund or credit to be processed. The MMS has recognized
the obvious importance of approving refund requests quickly by changing procedures to expedite the process. For
example, the purpose of approval subject to audit at  230.455 is to eliminate the audit time delay required for
recoupment authorizations. Such audits will still be required for certain cash refunds.

(c) Several commenters stated that MMS should make any new rules prospective, with an effective date on or after the
date of publication.



Response:

 With one exception, the rulemaking codifies the Department's current interpretation and application of section
10. That exception is  230.458(b), which imposes an assessment of $500 for each unauthorized credit adjustment.
This assessment will apply only to transactions filed after the effective date of the regulations.

Specific Comments



(a) Most of the commenters objected to the inclusion of the definition of audit in  230.452. These comments questioned
the need to define a term that is used so little in the body of the regulations. One commenter pointed out that the word
``audit'' appears only three times in the rule (except in a section heading), and then only in conjunction with the
word ``review.'' Accordingly, it is suggested that the definition adds nothing to the comprehension of the regulations.



Response: 

MMS agrees with the comments and the definition of audit has been removed from the final regulations.

(b) Several commenters objected to the provisions of  230.453(a)(3) which require MMS notification to the
lessee that its request for refund or credit is authorized before a recoupment can be filed. Once MMS reviews the request,
transmits it to Congress and the Congressional review period is satisfied, these commenters argue that they should
be permitted to recoup. These commenters claim MMS is exceeding its authority by conditioning the lessee's right
to a timely filed legitimate credit or refund on the receipt of a notice from the MMS.



Response: 

MMS disagrees with these comments. First, it is the Government's responsibility to assure that the technical requirements
of section 10, including the 30-day congressional review period, have been satisfied before a recoupment is effected.
Second, the requirement for MMS to give final approval allows for proper control. After MMS approves a recoupment,
then it will know that when a credit adjustment appears on a Form MMS-2014, that credit adjustment is authorized.
Further, there may be circumstances where a request for refund or credit is approved, but MMS may not allow the recoupment
to be effected. MMS recently proposed rules related to administrative offset and to credit adjustments generally
(58 FR 43582, August 17, 1993). There may be circumstances where a lessee owes money to MMS and MMS would want to retain
the otherwise approved request for refund or credit as an offset. Thus, recoupments will not be permitted until MMS
provides approval.

(c) Several commenters objected to the requirements of  230.453(b)(5) that lessees certify the accuracy of
the data submitted in the refund request. One commenter noted that there is no necessity for the certification since
the provisions of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA) already contain adequate protection
of the Federal lessor. According to this commenter, the certification adds nothing but additional paperwork to the
process.



Response: 

MMS disagrees with these comments. It has been a long standing practice of MMS to require the certification as a condition
of processing the refund. This is not a new requirement. Most lessees have long made the certification part of their
refund request form letter, so no additional burden will be imposed by this requirement.

(d) The provisions of  230.453(c) specifically state that the submission of a credit adjustment on a Report
of Sales and Royalty Remittance, Form MMS-2014, will not constitute a refund request, or a partially completed
refund request as discussed in  230.453(c). Additionally,  230.459 does not include the filing of a Form
MMS-2014 as a reason the 2-year period of section 10 will be tolled. MMS requested comment on this issue.

Eight responders offered comments on the status of a Form MMS-2014 as a section 10 refund request and if such filing
should toll the 2-year limit. Four commenters stated that the Form MMS-2014 should toll the 2-year period since
it includes nearly all elements of a properly completed refund request. Another commenter proposed that the Form
MMS-2014 should serve as a conditional refund request. If during later audit it was judged valid, MMS should
process the request for congressional review. If invalid, the lessee would be required to repay the amount of the credit
with interest and apply for a refund. When more than 2 years had passed since making payment, the lessee would be time-barred
from recovering the funds. It was urged that these procedures would serve as an incentive for lessees to only file credits
in which they had a high level of confidence in their validity.

While noting that tolling the 2-year period by filing a Form MMS-2014 would not benefit them, the sixth commenter
observed that it would encourage lessees to file unauthorized recoupments on questionable properties ``just in
case.''

The last two commenters noted that most of the unauthorized recoupments filed in the past resulted from MMS' failure
to issue formal guidance on the application of section 10. They recognized that this rulemaking resolves that problem,
and they see no value to lessees in the future to toll the 2-year period by filing an unauthorized credit adjustment.
With the publication of these rules, the commenters stated that lessees will know what adjustments are and are not
subject to section 10.



Response: 

MMS disagrees with the first four commenters. While Form MMS-2014 filings contain most of the information required
for a refund request, they do not include the information necessary to constitute a proper request for refund or credit.
Moreover, these credit adjustments do not request recoupments, instead they effect recoupments and thereby reduce
Government receipts. Section 10 requires MMS and congressional review 

before 

the funds are recovered. The conditional refund request suggestion also would not meet this requirement.

<TEXT>
 

MMS agrees with the last three commenters. Accepting Form MMS-2014 filing as tolling the 2-year period could
increase the submission of unauthorized credit adjustments and increase review costs. Additionally, there is no
logical reason to toll the section 10 2-year period by filing a Form MMS-2014 credit adjustment after the rules
have been published.

(e) One commenter questioned the limited refund amendment rights provided by  230.453(e)(1). This commenter
stated that inadvertent errors of notation related to the lease or any particular month should be amendable.



Response: 

MMS disagrees with this commenter. Permitting exceptions to the rule in an effort to be fair usually has the opposite
effect. In this case, MMS would be required to judge an ``inadvertent error'' exactly the same in every case, an impossible
task. To assure clear understanding and equal application to all lessees, the rule provides for no exceptions and
will be strictly applied.

(f) Several commenters questioned the approval of refund requests subject to later audit contained in  230.455.



Reponse: 

The purpose of this section is to eliminate the time delay required to complete an audit prior to the lessee's recovery
of the overpayment (see discussion of general comment (b) above). Without an analysis of the lessee's records, MMS
cannot determine the validity of the refund request. Accepting refund requests as valid subject to audit provides
the lessees more timely use of funds, and provides for MMS' recovery in the event the requests were improper.

(g) One commenter stated that MMS should clearly indicate that the 2-year requirement of section 10 does not apply
to offsets described at  230.456.



Response: 

Since section 10 does not apply to offsets, the 2-year requirement of section 10 does not apply.

(h) One commenter stated that MMS should clearly define the word ``intentional'' within the meaning of  230.456,
to protect lessees. This commenter expressed concern that if this determination were based upon the subjective judgment
of the auditor, offsets would almost certainly be applied inequitably.



Response: 

MMS disagrees with this comment. To develop a finding of intentional underpayment for the purpose of  230.456,
an auditor would have to demonstrate that the lessee's policy is to recover overpayments by filing subsequent underpayments.
This finding would not be a subjective audit determination.

(i) Three commenters objected to the provisions of  230.458(b) which impose an assessment of $500 for each unauthorized
credit adjustment. Because MMS often discovers the unauthorized recoupment more than 2 years after payment, one
commenter stated that the recovery of the improperly taken credit with interest already exceeds the actual amounts
required by lease terms. An additional penalty appears harsh to this commenter. Another commenter argued that if
it costs MMS $500 to research and approve refunds, then all amounts less than that should be allowed without following
 230.453 procedures. The third commenter stated that the amount is arbitrary and excessive because unauthorized
recoupments are generally unintentional and are incurred when attempting to make internal accounting adjustments.
Since proposed Form MMS-2014 line entries must be submitted with a refund request, it is often necessary and
more expedient to process accounting corrections, allow the MMS-2014 credit lines to be generated, and then
eliminate those credit entries prior to the normal monthly royalty payment. If the adjustments are numerous or complex,
a credit entry may fail to be pulled, resulting in an inadvertent unauthorized adjustment. This commenter further
argued that the time delays in the process, both before the overpayment is discovered and after the refund request
is filed and authorization issued, result in the Government receiving the time value of the funds at the expense of
the lessees.



Response: 

MMS disagrees with these comments. First, the review of unauthorized recoupments within MMS is now an automated process.
Once these regulations are effective MMS will begin reviewing for such recoupments on a current basis. The MMS plans
to discover unauthorized recoupments in time for the lessee to file a refund request before the 2-year period after
payment has expired. Without the penalty, lessees will incur no material costs as a consequence of filing an unauthorized
recoupment. In such an environment, some lessees may decide not to establish internal controls to prevent unauthorized
recoupments, but rely instead on the Government. This reliance would shift the costs from the lessees and provide
protection from the effects of missing the 2-year limit. The MMS would not be properly enforcing section 10 if it allowed
such a result. Moreover, even with the penalty, many lessees will incur less costs than with the less timely Government
review that has occurred in the past.

The penalty is not established to recover the costs of refund request processing. Rather, MMS is recovering the costs
of review recoupments and comparing them with approved refunds. Since MMS cannot determine the effect publishing
these rules will have on the rate of unauthorized recoupments, the cost per incident is not quantifiable.

The concerns of the third commenter related to production and filing of proposed Forms MMS-2014 being eliminated
when the regulations are effective, since the forms are not required by  230.453.

(j) One commenter noted that the purpose of  230.459(a)(3) as explained in the section-by-section analysis
would be better served by changing the date of tolling from the date of ``application'' for unitization to the effective
date of the unit. The commenter also noted that unit revisions should be added as covered by this section.



Response: 

MMS disagrees that the date of tolling should be changed to the effective date of the unit. As noted in the discussion
of this commenter, the effective date is subject to the judgment of the Regional Supervisor. In contrast, the date
of application is a fixed event. Unit revisions are included in the operation of  230.459(a)(3), as discussed
in the proposed rule preamble.

(k) One commenter expressed concern that it may be impossible to comply with the requirements of  230.459(a)(4).
This section provides that to toll the 2-year period, lessees must specifically identify an action or proceeding
that could result in payments becoming excess, the lease(s) and sales months affected, and an estimated of the amount
that could be subject to refund or credit.

Response:

 When a person becomes aware of a pending administrative or judicial action, or other action that may affect its royalty
obligation, prudence would require a complete analysis. While MMS realizes the exact impact may not be determinable,
a list of all leases and sales months within those lease accounts which could possibly be affected can be compiled.
Paragraph (a)(4) of  230.459 requires only an estimated dollar impact. The 2-year period for leases and/or
sales months not included in the tolling request will not be tolled. The purpose of this strict construction is to minimize
subjective judgments in applying section 10 requirements.
(l) Two commenters objected to the provisions of  230.460 which repeal the special treatment of advanced rental
payments when leases are later subject to suspensions.


Response:

 The IBLA rulings discussed with the preamble (58 FR 53474) were issued prior to any regulations governing section
10. These cases concluded that under the unique fact situations presented, excess rental payments which otherwise
were not subject to refund or credit under section 10 could be credited against future rentals. Upon review, MMS still
concludes that IBLA's conclusion is not consistent with the Department's interpretation of section 10. Thus, after
this rule is effective, the IBLA decision will not be followed. However, these cases are exactly the type of situation
envisioned for tolling the 2-year limit by filing a request pursuant to  230.459(a)(4).
(m) One commenter questioned the requirement of  230.461(d) which disallows the recoupment of a payment amount
that exceeds the reported amount. This commenter stated that if the overpayment is not subject to section 10, then
the payor should not be required to file a refund request.


Response:

 In those cases to which  230.461(d) applies, the payor may recover its funds without a section 10 refund request.
A payment amount exceeding the total reported for more than one lease is not a payment ``in connection with any lease.''
(See the detailed discussion in the 1993 M-Opinion). Such an amount cannot be recouped by reporting a credit entry
for a specific lease since the funds were not applied to any lease. After the Form MMS-2014 lines are processed,
amounts in excess of the total reported remain as an unapplied credit in the payor's account. The MMS accountants would
then contact the payor for direction as to how the funds should be applied. In most cases, the payor could reduce the
next payment by an equal amount to balance its payor account. In other situations, the funds could be applied to an underpaid
invoice or other Forms MMS-2014. If these situations did not apply, the payor could request a non-section 10
cash refund as outlined in the MMS ``Oil and Gas Payor Handbook'' (1986), Volume II, page 4-25.
(n) One commenter stated that the provisions of  230.461(g), which would not require a section 10 refund request
after a successful challenge of an MMS order to pay, would be more useful if MMS specifies how such funds would be recovered.

Response

: The overpayments may be recovered as explained in the response to comment (m). 

(o) Seven commenters submitted responses to the proposed 

de minimis

 exception of  230.461(h). One commenter stated that MMS does not have authority under the interpretations
contained in the 1981 M-Opinion to establish such a provision. Another commenter stated that the amount should be
set at 1/2 percent of the normal monthly payment to be meaningful. No support was received for the alternative of limiting
section 10 refund requests to $100 or more. 

The other five commenters supported the de minimis idea, but suggested the limit be increased from $25 to $100 per payor
code per month. 



Response

: After considering the comments, MMS has concluded that instead of a fixed amount for the de minimis exception, MMS
will periodically review the matter and establish a de minimis amount. Accordingly, the final regulations provide
that a limit will be published periodically in the 

Federal Register. 

This limit will be based on the cost incurred to process a section 10 refund request. Based on the cost experience for
fiscal year 1993, the initial limit is established at $250. Under these procedures, payors will be able to file credits
for OCS leases totalling less than $250 for each reporting month, provided the payments subject to adjustment were
made within 2 years of the date of the adjustments. Thus, even if a payor used this exception to avoid section 10's reporting
requirements, the most it could recover for any lease is $6,000 (24 months  x  $250). 



III. Summary of Final Rule 



The MMS is adding new regulations at 30 CFR 230.451 through 230.461, which codify MMS' policy regarding the requirements
of OCSLA section 10, 43 U.S.C. 1339. Except for the changes to the rules discussed above in response to the comments,
MMS is adopting the rule as proposed with some minor working changes. A detailed discussion of each section is included
in the preamble to the proposed rules, 58 FR 53470, explaining the purpose and effect of each section. 



Procedural Matters 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Department certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). There are not many small entities involved in
offshore oil and gas operations. 



Executive Order 12630 



The Department certifies that the rule does not represent a governmental action capable of interference with constitutionally
protected property rights. Thus, a Takings Implication Assessment need not be prepared under Executive Order 12630,
``Government Action and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.'' 



Excutive Order 12778 


The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that the rule meets the applicable standards provided
in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Oder 12778. 



Executive Order 12866 



This document has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and is not a significant regulatory action. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 


This rule does contain information collection requirements which have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and assigned approval number 1010-0094. 



National Environment Policy Act of 1969 



It is hereby determined that this rulemaking does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment and a detailed statement pursuant to paragraph (2)(C) of section 102 of the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is not required.

Subpart J_Refunds and Recoupments of Overpayments Under Federal Leases on the Outer Continental Shelf; Implementation
of Section 10 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act


 230.451 

Scope.


This subpart establishes the procedures that lessees and other persons who make royalty and other payments on Federal
oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) must follow to recover certain excess payments made in connection
with their leases in accordance with section 10 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (section 10), 43 U.S.C. 1339.
The requirements of this subpart apply to both requests for refund from the Treasury of excess payments and requests
to recover excess payments by recouping the amount through a credit adjustment. This subpart applies only to Federal
leases on the OCS.


 230.452 

Definitions.


Terms used in this subpart shall have the same meaning as in 30 U.S.C. 1702. In addition, the following definitions
apply to this subpart:


Credit

 or 

crediting

 means reduction of a current or future royalty or other payment made in connection with a lease as a result of reporting
a credit adjustment.


Credit Adjustment

 means any adjustment reported on a Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance (Form MMS-2014) or any other royalty
report form which reduces any royalty or other payment made in connection with a lease which was reported and paid in
any previous period.


Offset

 means to net or cancel previous overpayments against previous underpayments on the same OCS lease or across lease
boundaries if all the individual leases are part of an approved unit agreement.


Overpayment

 means any payment made in excess of the amount that the lessee was lawfully required to pay.


Payment

 means money MMS receives in satisfaction of a lessee's royalty, rental, bonus, net profit share, or late payment interest
obligation as established by statute, regulation, or the terms of a lease.


Recoup

 or 

recoupment

 means to recover a previous overpayment through a credit against a current or future royalty or other payment or liability
under an OCS lease. A recoupment occurs whenever a payor reports a credit adjustment on a Form MMS-2014 or other
royalty report form resulting in a net negative dollar value for the transaction and the credit is taken against the
royalty or other payment or liability shown in the balance of the report.


Refund

 means a repayment by the United States Treasury to a person of any overpayment.


Unit

 means an area of 2 or more leases subject to an agreement for the consolidated development and recovery of oil and gas
contained on the leases which are part of the agreement approved by MMS.


 230.453 

Request for refund or credit.


(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, no person may recover an excess payment it has made in connection
with an OCS lease unless:
(1) That person has made a request for refund or credit in accordance with the provisions of this subpart;
(2) MMS has transmitted a report on the request for refund or credit to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of
the House of Representatives and 30 days have expired since the submission in accordance with section 10(b), 43 U.S.C.
1339(b); and
(3) MMS notifies the person that its request for refund or credit is authorized and that the person may receive its refund
for, or may report a credit adjustment to recoup, the excess payment.
(b) A request for refund or credit must:
(1) Be in writing;
(2) Provide the person's MMS-established payor code;
(3) Identify the leases and sales months with respect to which the excess payments occurred;
(4) Identify the amount of the excess payment or, with specificity, describe a class of payments that are, or as a result
of an administrative or judicial decision or other identified contingency, may become, excess payments;
(5) Provide the reasons why a refund or credit is due;
(6) Include a certification that, to the best of the person's knowledge or belief, the information provided in response
to paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section is accurate and complete.
(c) If MMS determines that a request for refund or credit is incomplete, the person who submitted the request will have
30 days, or such time as MMS may specify, following notice from MMS, to supplement the request for refund or credit.
(d) A credit adjustment reported on a Form MMS-2014 does not constitute a request for refund or credit for purposes
of this section, and does not constitute an incomplete request for refund or credit for purposes of paragraph (c) of
this section.

(e) A person who has filed a request for refund or credit pursuant to this section may amend that request to add an additional
amount if:

(1) The additional amount is for the same lease and sales month; and

(2) The reason for the excess payment for the additional amount is the same as for the originally requested amount.


(f) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, no request for a refund or credit will be approved unless the request
is received at MMS at the address provided below within 2 years of the date that MMS received the excess payment.

(1) The request for refund or credit must be received at the following address:

(i) By mail: Minerals Management Service, Section 10 Refund Requests, P.O. Box 173702, Denver, CO 80217-3702.

(ii) By express delivery or courier: Minerals Management Service, Section 10 Refund Requests, Building 85, Denver
Federal Center, Room A-212, Denver, CO 80225.

(2) If the last day of the 2-year period from the date MMS received the excess payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday, holiday
or any other day that MMS is not open for business at the address specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, then
the last day of the 2-year period will be the next regular business day. Requests received at the specified MMS address
after 4 p.m. Mountain Time are considered received the following business day.



 230.454 

Interest on excess payments.



No person is entitled to interest on any excess payment made in connection with a lease that is refunded or recouped
pursuant to this subpart.



 230.455 

Authorization of refund or credit and subsequent audit.



MMS may grant a refund or authorize a credit based upon satisfactory evidence that the payment for which a refund or
credit is requested was made, and upon a determination that the payment was excess. An approved request for refund
or credit may be subject to later review or audit by MMS. If, based upon later review or audit, MMS determines that the
refund or credit should not have been granted or authorized, the person who requested the refund or credit must repay
the amount refunded or recouped plus interest determined pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 1721(a) and 30 CFR 218.150 from the
date the refund was made or the recoupment taken until the date it is repaid.



 230.456 

Offsets of overpayments and underpayments on the same lease (or unit) by the same person.



If a person makes an overpayment on any OCS lease or unit in a prior month, it may offset that overpayment against an underpayment
that same person made in any prior month on that same lease or unit for the same or a different product without submitting
a request for refund or credit. This offset is permitted only if the underpayment was not created as a result of a credit
adjustment to recoup the amount of the overpayment or was not otherwise created intentionally to provide an underpayment
against which to offset the overpayment. This offset also is subject to any limitations imposed by other applicable
law or regulations.



 230.457 

Offsets among different persons who reported and paid royalties on a lease for the same prior sales month.



(a) This section applies to any reallocation of production for a prior sales month among different persons who reported
and paid royalty for that month on a lease or unit, except for reallocations of production that result from the approval
or amendment of a unit agreement subject to  230.461(b).

(b) In the event of a reallocation of production as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the respective persons
who reported and paid royalty may reconcile any resulting differences in royalty payment obligations between themselves
without submitting revised royalty reports or requests for refund or credit to MMS under this subpart, except that:

<TEXT>
 

(1) Any person who paid any amount which remains as a net overpayment after such reconciliation must file a request
for refund or credit in accordance with the requirements of this subpart to recover the excess payment;

(2) Any person whose royalty obligation remains underpaid after such reconciliation must report the additional
royalties due for the prior sales month on a Form MMS-2014 and pay interest on the underpayment from the last day
of the month following the sales month until the date the additional royalties are paid; and

(3) All persons involved in such reconciliation must retain all documents pertaining to the reallocation of production,
calculation of royalties due, and the subsequent reconciliation among the persons involved together with other
records pertaining to production from that lease during the prior sales month and the royalty due and paid thereon,
and make such documents available for review and audit in the same manner as other records pertaining to the lease.

(c) If persons who reported and paid royalty do not reconcile between themselves any differences in royalty payment
obligations arising as a result of a reallocation as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each person who pays
royalties for the lease must report and pay any additional royalties due, or file a request for refund or credit in accordance
with the requirements of this subpart to recover the excess payment, as applicable. Any person who reports additional
royalties due for the prior sales month must pay interest pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54 on the underpayment from the last
day of the month following the sales month until the date the additional royalties are paid.



 230.458


Unauthorized credit adjustments.



(a) If a person reports a credit adjustment on Form MMS-2014 that results in a credit before MMS approves the recoupment
pursuant to  230.455, and if the credit adjustment does not qualify as one of the transactions not subject to
section 10 as provided in  230.461, then that person has taken an unauthorized credit adjustment.

(1) If the unauthorized credit adjustment recouped a payment that MMS received more than 2 years before the date MMS
received the Form MMS-2014 which includes the unauthorized credit adjustment, the person must repay the amount
recouped plus late payment interest determined pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 1721(a) and 30 CFR 218.150 from the date the unauthorized
recoupment was taken until the date it is repaid. Unless the person filed a request for refund or credit pursuant to
 230.453 within 2 years of the making of the excess payment for which the unauthorized credit adjustment was
reported, the excess payment is not subject to refund or recoupment.

(2) If the unauthorized credit adjustment recouped a payment that MMS received less than 2 years before the date MMS
received the Form MMS-2014 with the unauthorized credit adjustment, the person must repay the amount recouped
plus late payment interest determined pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 1721(a) and 30 CFR 218.150 from the date the unauthorized
recoupment was taken until the date it is repaid. The report of the unauthorized credit adjustment on the Form MMS-2014
does not constitute a request for refund or credit that tolls the 2-year period in section 10(a), 43 U.S.C. 1339(a).
The person may file a request for refund or credit pursuant to section 230.453 for the payment for which the unauthorized
credit adjustment was reported. MMS will review the request pursuant to the requirements of this subpart only if the
request for refund or credit is received within 2 years of the making of the original payment for which the unauthorized
credit adjustment was reported.

(b) A person who reports an unauthorized credit adjustment to MMS on a Form MMS-2014 will be assessed $500 for
each unauthorized credit adjustment reported.



 230.459


Stopping or tolling of the section 10(a) 2-year period.



(a) The period of 2 years from the making of the excess payment, within which a request for refund or credit must be filed
under section 10(a), 43 U.S.C. 1339(a), will be:

(1) Tolled by MMS's receipt of a substantially complete request for refund or credit pursuant to  230.453; or


(2) Tolled by a general tolling notice issued by MMS and published in the 

Federal Register

 in circumstances where MMS believes a substantial number of requests for refund or credit could result as a consequence
of a pending administrative or judicial proceeding or other action. The running of the 2-year period will be tolled
for the time period specified in the notice; or 

(3) Stopped by an application for unitization of OCS leases with respect to any excess payment that may result from
the reallocation of production among leases after the unit or revision is approved; or 

(4) Tolled by a notice filed by a person at the address stated in  230.453(f) stating that a specifically identified
action or proceeding may result in payments made on an OCS lease becoming excess payments. The notice must include:

(i) A list of affected leases and sales months;

(ii) The specific action or proceeding that could result in payments becoming excess;

(iii) An estimate of the amount that could be subject to a request for refund or credit; and

(iv) The person's MMS-established payor code.

(b) A request for refund or credit that is filed timely by a person who made an excess payment on an OCS lease does not stop
or toll the running of the 2-year period with respect to any excess payment made by any other person on that lease.



 230.460

Lease suspension.



If MMS suspends an OCS lease pursuant to 30 CFR 250.10(b)(6), a person who has made excess rental payments for the period
of suspension may request a refund or credit of any excess payments pursuant to this subpart. If the request for refund
or credit is filed more than 2 years after MMS received the excess rentals, the excess payment will not be refunded,
recouped, or credited against future rentals due on the same lease.



 230.461

Transactions not subject to section 10.



(a) A request for refund of, or any other action to recover, excess payments made by a refiner/purchaser under a royalty-in-kind
contract for royalty oil produced from an OCS lease is not subject to section 10.

(b) If MMS approves a unit agreement on the OCS, or a revision to a unit, a person may file amended Forms MMS-2014
within the time period MMS prescribes, reallocating production among its affected leases. A person must file a request
for refund or credit pursuant to this subpart only if, and to the extent that, there is a net reduction in the royalty
that person previously paid for the leases committed to the unit as a result of the amendments.

(c) A person may amend Form MMS-2014 to adjust volume and royalty reports among OCS leases within a unit within
the same sales month without filing a request for refund or credit pursuant to this subpart, except that a request for
refund or credit must be filed to the extent that there is a net reduction in the royalty previously paid for the leases
committed to the unit as a result of the amendments.

(d) A person who pays more money than the total royalty due as reported on the Form MMS-2014 accompanying the payment,
where all amounts reported on the Form MMS-2014 are correct, may submit a request for refund of the overpaid amounts.
The request for refund is not subject to section 10's requirements unless the Form MMS-2014 includes reports
for only one OCS lease. Any overpayment subject to this paragraph may not be recovered by recoupment.

(e) A person may reduce an estimate balance, established for any lease product pursuant to MMS instructions, by submitting
a credit adjustment on a Form MMS-2014, or a request for refund, for all or part of the established estimate balance.
A credit adjustment or request for refund to recover all or part of an estimate balance authorized by this paragraph
is not subject to the requirements of section 10.

(f) (1) If adjustment of an estimated oil transportation allowance or estimated gas transportation allowance pursuant
to 30 CFR 206.105(e) and 206.157(e), respectively, results in an overpayment for any sales month because the estimated
transportation costs were less than the actual costs, a person may submit a credit adjustment on a Form MMS-2014
to recoup, or may request a refund of, the overpayment. The credit adjustment or request for refund authorized by this
paragraph is not subject to the requirements of section 10, and MMS approval is not required before reporting the credit
adjustment.

(2) If adjustment of an estimated gas processing allowance pursuant to 30 CFR 206.159(e) results in an overpayment
for any sales month because the estimated processing costs were less than the actual costs, a person may submit a credit
adjustment on a Form MMS-2014 to recoup, or may request a refund of, the overpayment. The credit adjustment or
request for refund authorized by this paragraph is not subject to the requirements of section 10, and MMS approval
is not required before reporting the credit adjustment.

(3) If a person makes an error in the report of actual transportation or processing costs pursuant to paragraphs (f)(1)
or (f)(2) of this section, any subsequent adjustment to the report that results in a credit is subject to section 10
and the requirements of this subpart.

(g) If a person pays pursuant to an MMS order and challenges the obligation to pay in an administrative appeal or judicial
action, and if the person is successful in a challenge to all or part of the MMS order to pay, section 10 does not apply
to the refund or recoupment of the disputed payment or portion thereof.

(h) MMS approval is not required for an adjustment by any person to the amount reported for a report month that results
in a credit of not more than an amount established periodically by MMS and published in the 

Federal Register

. However, no adjustment may be reported more than 2 years after the date MMS received the Form MMS-2014 including
the excess payment.

Certifications and Exemptions Under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972; Amendment



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of the Navy, DOD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for
Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined
that USS BOXER (LHD 4) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully
with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with its special functions as a naval amphibious assault
ship. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR Part 706. This amendment
provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy,
has certified that USS BOXER (LHD 4) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot
comply fully with 72 COLREGS: Rule 21(a), pertaining to the location of the masthead lights over the fore and aft centerline
of the ship; Annex I, section 2(g), pertaining to the distance of the sidelights above the hull; Annex I, section 3(a),
pertaining to the location of the forward masthead light in the forward quarter of the ship; and the horizontal distance
between the forward and after masthead lights; and Annex I, section 3(b), pertaining to the positioning of the sidelights
in relationship to the forward masthead light, without interfering with its special function as an amphibious assault
ship. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy has also certified that the aforementioned lights are located in closest
possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements.


Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR Parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for
public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based
on technical findings that the placement of lights on this vessel in a manner differently from that prescribed herein
will adversely affect the vessel's ability to perform its military functions.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of the Air Force, DOD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Air Force has added provisions for alternate use of Air Force airfields by commercial air carriers
that have contracted to participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program. It is necessary to identify the
CRAF Alternate as a purpose for which the Air Force will grant civil aircraft landing permits. The availability of
Air Force airfields for use as alternates by CRAF carriers is intended to encourage greater participation in the CRAF
program, which is structured to meet military airlift requirements during military emergencies that involve US
forces.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of the Air Force has determined that this proposed rule is not a major rule because it will not have an
annual adverse effect on the economy of $100 million or more. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower, Reserve
Affairs, Installations & Environment) has certified that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612 because this rule does not have a significant economic impact on small entities
as defined by the Act, and does not impose any obligatory information requirements beyond internal Air Force use.



List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 855 


Aircraft, Federal buildings and facilities.

 

Accordingly, 32 CFR part 855, is amended as follows: 


PART 855_USE OF UNITED STATES AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS BY OTHER THAN UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AIRCRAFT

Salary Offset 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Library of Congress.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulation.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Library of Congress is authorized to collect debts owed by current and former staff members to the Federal Government
by making deductions from the current pay account of the individual. The Library of Congress is issuing this final
regulation to prescribe the procedures the Library will follow when collecting a debt owed to the Federal Government
via deductions from an employee's pay. It also describes the rights of current employees, former employees who owe
debts to other agencies, and former employees who are currently employed by other agencies in the collection of debts
owed to the Federal Government by them and sets out the procedures for collecting debts through deductions from their
pay following due process.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under section 5514 of title 5 U.S.C. and 5 CFR 550.1101, when an agency head or his/her designee determines that an employee
is indebted to the Federal Government, he/she will authorize the collection of that indebtedness in monthly installments
or at officially established pay intervals, by deduction from the current pay account of the individual. The amount
deducted for any period may not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay, except that a greater percentage may be deducted
upon the written consent of the individual involved. If the individual retires or resigns, or if his/her employment
otherwise ends, before collection of the amount of the indebtedness is completed, deductions shall be made from subsequent
payments of any nature due the individual from the agency concerned. This final Regulation sets out the procedures
the Library of Congress will follow when collecting debts through deductions from the employee's pay following due
process. 


The proposed regulation was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 27, 1994, for public comment. No comments were received. No changes were made to the text.

(vii) The staff member's right to a hearing conducted by an official arranged for or engaged by the Library (an administrative
law judge or, alternatively, a hearing official not under the control of the Librarian of Congress) if a petition is
filed as prescribed by the Library; 
(viii) The method and time period for petitioning for a hearing; 
(ix) That the timely filing of a petition for hearing will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;

hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings; 
(xi) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the staff member
to 
(A) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under Library of Congress Regulation 2020-3, or any other applicable
regulations or statutes, 
(B) Penalties under the False Claim Act, Section 3729 of Title 31, U.S. Code, or any other applicable statutory authority,

for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the staff member;

(xiv) That if the staff member elects not to contest the determination of indebtedness or the amount or the terms of
a repayment schedule, the staff member may still wish to exercise the right to request a waiver of the collection of
the indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of Library of Congress Regulation 1556, 

Claims

 (if the amount of the indebtedness exceeds $1,500, the staff member should be advised that a final determination must
be made by the Comptroller General of the United States); and 
(xv) That any involuntary payments already made or withheld from salary of any portion of the indebtedness will not
be construed as a waiver by the staff member of any rights that he or she may have under this part. 
(2) 

Amount of deduction. 

If possible, the debt shall be collected in one lump sum. If multiple deductions are necessary, however, the amount
deducted from a staff member's pay for any single period will not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay, except that a
greater percentage may be deducted upon the written consent of the individual involved. The staff member may enter
into a written agreement for a repayment schedule different from that proposed so long as the terms are approved by
the Library. If the individual retires or resigns or if his or her employment otherwise ends before collection of the
amount of the indebtedness is completed, deduction shall be made from subsequent payments of any nature due the individual.


(3) 

Petitions for hearing. 

(i) To elect a hearing, the staff member must notify the Director, Human Resources, no later than 15 days after the receipt
of the notification of indebtedness. A timely filing of a petition for hearing will stay any further commencement
of collection proceedings. A final decision on the hearing will be issued at the earliest practicable date, but not
later than 60 days after the filing of petition, unless the individual requests and the hearing official grants a delay
in the proceedings. 
(ii) The petition or statement must be signed by the staff member and must fully identify and explain with reasonable
specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses, if any, which he or she believes supports his or her position.

(iii) Petitions for hearings made later than 15 days after the receipt of the notification of indebtedness will be
accepted provided the staff member can show that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control or
because of failure to receive notice of the time limit (unless otherwise aware of it). 

(4) 

Form of hearings and final decisions. 

(i) The staff member shall be provided an appropriate hearing as decided by the hearing official, based on the nature
of the transactions giving rise to the debt. The hearing official shall be guided by the procedures set out in 4 CFR 102.3(c)
in deciding on the type of hearing to provide. 
(ii) A written decision will be provided to the staff member and must, at a minimum, state the fact(s) purported to support
the nature and origin of the alleged debt; the hearing official's analysis, findings, and conclusions, in light of
the hearing, as to the staff member's or the Library's grounds; the amount and validity of the alleged debt; and, where
applicable, the repayment schedule. 

(d) 

Creditor agency is not the Library of Congress. 

When the Library receives from a creditor agency a debt claim properly certified in accordance with 5 CFR 550.1108(a),
deductions shall be scheduled to begin at the next officially established pay interval. The Director, Human Resources,
shall provide the employee with written notice stating that the Library has received a certified debt claim from the
creditor agency (including the amount) and written notice of the date deductions from salary will commence and of
the amount of such deductions. When the Library receives an incomplete debt claim from a creditor agency, the Director,
Human Resources, shall return the debt claim with a written notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 must be followed
and a properly determined debt claim received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's pay account.


(e) 

Exclusions and exceptions. 

(1) This part does not apply to debts where collection of the debt is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another
statute, or to debts of $1 or less, which, it is hereby determined, is not cost effective to attempt to collect (65 Comp.
Gen. 843, September 29, 1986). 
(2) An exception to the entitlement of notice, hearings, written responses, and final decisions provided for under
paragraph (c) of this section is made for overpayments arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change
in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered
was accumulated over four pay periods or less.

Fees 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Copyright Office, Library of Congress.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim regulations with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Copyright Office is adopting interim amendments concerning fees with a request for comments. These fee adjustments
are limited to special services, and reflect the actual cost of providing the services. They include full-term storage
of copyright deposits, special handling of copyright registrations, and other expedited services. The effect of
these interim regulations is to increase or institute fees for special services as authorized under the Copyright
Code.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 


Today we are issuing two separate but associated documents concerning fees for providing certain discretionary
services to the public. This document contains interim regulations to increase or institute fees for special services
authorized under the Copyright Code. Published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

 is an associated document dealing with proposals for fees to cover costs for providing and maintaining Deposit Accounts.


Copyright Office Funding 


The Copyright Office is funded annually by Congressional appropriation; however, the total appropriation includes
a credit based on income from projected fees. We base this projection on an estimate of the fees we expect to receive
over the course of the next fiscal year from services provided during that period. If revenue from fees falls short
of our estimate, the total Congressional appropriation is decreased by the amount of the shortfall. In fiscal year
1993, our receipts failed to reach the projected level. Analysis of current fees indicates that the total received
in fiscal year 1994 will again fall short of the projected amount. 
Not only has Congressional funding been reduced, but the fee income has also declined because the number of copyright
registrations, and the consequential fees they generate, have not increased in recent years. There are several possible
explanations for this shortfall, including an increase in group registrations and fewer renewal registrations
resulting from legislation in 1992 making renewal registration optional. 


Congressional Authorization 


Title 17 of the United States Code authorizes the Register of Copyrights to require payment of fees for services specifically
described in section 708(a)(1)-(9). In addition, paragraph 708(a)(10) permits the Register to require ``for
any other special services requiring a substantial amount of time or expense, such fees as the Register of Copyrights
may fix on the basis of the cost of providing the service.'' The final sentence in 17 U.S.C. 708(a) provides that ``[t]he
Register of Copyrights is authorized to fix the fees for preparing copies of Copyright Office records, whether or
not such copies are certified, on the basis of the cost of such preparation.'' Paragraph 708(d) further permits the
Register to prescribe regulations for the refund of ``any sum paid by mistake or in excess of the fee required. . . .''



Actual Costs of Providing Special Services 


Before proposing these fee adjustments, we consulted the Library of Congress' financial managers and conducted
a comprehensive economic analysis of the operating costs involved in providing special user services to ascertain
the actual costs of providing these services. Our analysis concluded that the current fees charged for special services
do not offset the costs of the services provided. Most of the fees for special services have not been adjusted in almost
a decade. Special services entail high administrative costs because requests for these services disrupt the normal
work flow, are labor intensive, and are moved ahead of regular requests. The analysis included an examination of all
the discretionary fees set under authority of 17 U.S.C. 708(a)(10). It identified the special services currently
offered, and it calculated the cost of providing each service, taking into account staff time, overtime, and storage.
In the past, the Office has chosen not to charge any fee for some services. Our analysis confirmed that we should adjust
fees in order to justify the disruption to our normal work-flow and the high cost of these services, and to recapture
actual cost; it also confirmed that we should impose charges for certain other administrative expenses. 


Fees for Expedited Services 


Users who request expedited services need information or certified documents in order to meet extraordinary time
deadlines, usually for business or litigation purposes. In these situations a user asks us to move his or her request
ahead of the hundreds of pending requests; in most cases, if sufficient reason is given, we will comply. Compliance
requires additional staff time or overtime to respond to the request in an expedited manner. It is appropriate to charge
special service fees that reflect the actual costs of these services to avoid other users or the general public from
having to subsidize these services. We are not proposing adjustments to the statutory fees set under  708(b)
or seeking any legislative change in these fees. We will continue to provide regular searches, certifications, or
copies of registration or recordation materials at the current fees.
 




II. Special Handling Fees 


Special Handling Procedure 


Although the effective date of registration is the date the application, required fee, and deposit are received,
it usually takes us several weeks to process a claim and mail the certificate of registration. Special handling is
granted at the discretion of the Register in a limited number of cases as a special service to copyright applicants
who have a compelling reason for the expedited issuance of a certificate of registration or recordation of a document
pertaining to copyright. A request for special handling is granted only for claims involved in pending or prospective
litigation, customs matters, or contract or publishing deadlines that necessitate expedited service. For many
years, we used an informal procedure for special handling of applications. When we began providing this service,
we noted that we could not continue to absorb the extra charges for providing such a service, but did not establish a
fee for special handling until 1982 when these procedures were formalized. 47 FR 19254 (May 4, 1982). 


Work Involved in Special Handling 


Under normal work procedures, applications for registration or documents for recordation pass through various
administrative and examining processing steps. Special handling requests disrupt the regular workflow procedure
and require expedited handling outside the normal first-in, first-out basis. These claims require special handling
at each step and routing between work stations that supersedes the normal, chronological processing. A separate
system of controls must be maintained to assure that each claim moves expeditiously through each stage and that these
claims can be quickly located. Special handling claims take staff away from processing all other claims, including
those received earlier, in order to process them in a substantially shorter time period. Under regular procedures
these same employees could more efficiently process many standard claims. 


Multiple Applications 


Another special workflow problem for the Office arises from processing multiple applications accompanied by a single
deposit when the request for special handling is limited to one claim or fewer than all of the multiple claims. Because
all the applications share the deposit for the special handling claim, all claims must be processed in the same expedited
manner. A $50 surcharge is currently applied to each additional claim attached to the deposit used for the special
handling claim and processed at the same time. This surcharge will remain at $50, but it may be avoided by submitting
a separate deposit. 


Fees for Special Handling 


When a fee is charged for special handling, this fee is added to the regular fee for registration ($20.00) or recordation
($20.00 for a document listing no more than one title).

<DOCNO> FR940728-0-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940728-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In 1982 we set the special handling fee at $120. 47 FR 19254 (May 4, 1982). In 1984 we raised the fee to $200 to reflect the
actual cost of the service. 49 FR 39741 (Oct. 10, 1984). In 1985, we established the special handling procedures for
import statements and documents. 50 FR 46206 (Nov. 6, 1985). In 1991 we reviewed our special handling procedure, but
did not increase fees. 56 FR 37528 (August 7, 1991). 
We have not adjusted special handling fees for almost ten years. Our analysis indicates that to recover actual costs
the new fee should be $330. The conditions under which a request for special handling is approved will not change. We
are also raising the fee for special handling of mask work claims, which have not changed since 1985, 50 FR 26719 (June
28, 1985), as amended at 56 FR 59886 (Nov. 26, 1991), from $200 to $330. 


III. Full-Term Storage 


Service Provided 


The Copyright Code mandates storage for the full copyright term of copies or phonorecords of unpublished registered
works. It does not specify how long we should retain deposits for published works. Retention is more important in the
case of unpublished works because our copy or phonorecord may be the only one in existence. Our policy for published
works is to retain deposit copies or phonorecords not selected by the Library for its collections for at least five
years from the date of registration; if possible, we retain copies of visual arts works for at least ten years or longer.
In addition, we offer optional full-term storage service for those who register published works and want to assure
that the deposits will be retained in our custody for the full term of copyright. 


Fees for Full-Term Storage 


Congress authorized a fee for full-term storage in 17 U.S.C. 704(e). Our current charge for full-term storage of published
copyright deposits is $135. 52 FR 28821 (Aug. 4, 1987). Our recent analysis of the costs of this service reveals that
the actual cost is much higher. Our new regulations increase the charge to $270 for full-term storage of published
deposits. We will continue to provide full-term storage of unpublished deposits without a fee. 


IV. Expedited Certifications and Documents Services 


Services Provided 


Users may request an additional certificate of registration, or copies of the copyright deposit, the copyright application,
correspondence, and other copyright related documents. Frequently the requester needs these services on an expedited
basis for compelling business or litigation reasons. The Certifications and Documents Section expedites these
services when sufficient reason is provided. 


Justification of Increase 


The fees for these expedited services were established after the revision of the Copyright Code in 1978 and have never
been increased. Our new interim regulations increase the fees for expedited services performed by the Certifications
& Documents Section to reflect actual costs and expenses. Actual costs for these services include the staff time
necessary to travel to and search off-site storage facilities; in contrast, non-expedited requests are mailed to
off-site division offices where regular staff can search for the requested material. All of these expedited service
fees are surcharges that will be added to the regular charge for the service provided. 


Expedited Additional Certificates 


The fee for providing an expedited additional certificate, performing a search for a document that is ``in-process''
(where the recordation process has not been completed), or certifying or furnishing a copy of a document has been $18
per hour for almost ten years. These new regulations will raise the rate to $50 per hour. 


Copy of Deposit or File Under Copyright Office Control 


The fee for providing an expedited copy of a copyright deposit stored off-site in a Copyright Office storage facility,
or for furnishing a copy of a correspondence file stored either on-site or off-site, has been $18 per hour. The new fee
will be $70 for the first hour spent in providing the copy and $50 for each additional hour. The first hour is more costly
because it reflects time expended by several staff members.


Copy of Deposit or File Not Under Our Control 


Expedited provision of a copy of a deposit or correspondence file stored off-site at a Federal Records Center, a more
remote site not under the control of the Copyright Office, has also been $18 per hour. It is being increased to $135 for
the first hour and $50 for each additional hour. This service costs more to provide because support services are more
numerous and time-consuming and must also cover the cost of returning the deposit or correspondence file to the Federal
Records Center. 


V. Reference and Bibliographic Searches 


Services Provided 


Copyright owners and users frequently need to get information on registrations, renewals, and transfers and other
documents relating to copyright. Our records on these copyright related facts are public and are available for public
inspection. A researcher can either come to the Office during regular business hours and perform a free search (with
assistance from Copyright Office staff) or the researcher can have someone else perform the search. Several organizations
provide such services for a fee. In addition, the post-1978 records of the Copyright Office (and the bibliographic
records of the Library of Congress) are available on-line via the Internet. 
The Reference and Bibliography Section of the Copyright Office will perform an expedited search of these public records
for a fee when there is a compelling reason to do so. The Reference and Bibliography Section regularly performs searches
of Office records at the statutory rate of $20 for each hour or fraction of an hour consumed. Before January 3, 1991,
that section performed approved expedited searches for the statutory $10 hourly fee plus an additional charge of
$20 per hour for the expedited service with a two hour minimum charge (a $60 minimum). Since then, the statutory fee
has been $20 per hour, bringing the minimum to $80.00. Under the new fee schedule the charge for approved expedited
searches is $100 for the first hour and $50 for each additional hour plus the $20 statutory fee for each hour.

<TEXT>
 

The public can conduct searches on the Copyright Office in-process systems (COINS) database through a public access
terminal in the Records Maintenance Unit for the search fee of $20 per hour or fraction of an hour. This fee will remain
unchanged.


VI. Copying Fees


We will continue to duplicate our records under the conditions detailed in the applicable regulatory provisions
and offer use of photocopy equipment and microfilm printers for the public's use at the prevailing rates established
by the Photoduplication Service of the Library of Congress, except for certain specialized services for which the
rates are based on our operational costs (

e.g. 

color photocopying). Additional charges for specialized copying, for example audio cassette copying charges,
are fixed by other divisions of the Library providing these services. All of these fees may be adjusted periodically.


VII. Policy Decision on Refund of Excess Fees


Automatic Refund Level


Our practice until 1991 was automatically to refund excess fees of more than $5.00; amounts of $5.00 or less were not
refunded unless specifically requested. In 1991 we changed the automatic refund policy to provide automatic refund
for payments of $10.01 or more in excess of the statutory fee; 56 FR 7812 (Feb. 26, 1991). 37 CFR 201.6(c). We are now adjusting
the level at which automatic refunds of overpayments will be made from $10.01 to $50.01; we will not refund amounts
of $50 or less unless specifically requested.


VIII. Administrative Processing Fee for Nonregistration Services


In 1991, we determined that an administrative processing fee is authorized under section 708(a) of the Copyright
Code to reflect the minimum administrative cost of responding to a request for a nonregistrative service, even if
the service cannot be successfully completed. For example, a request is made for a certification of records and after
a search by our staff, the file cannot be found. We need to charge an administrative fee for the search even though it
is unsuccessful. Accordingly in 1991, we amended 37 CFR 201.6(c) to state that in making any refund of fees remitted
for nonregistration services, we could first deduct our administrative cost. Our regulation permits us to charge
a processing fee ``in an amount equivalent to one hour of the requested service, or the minimum fee set by statute for
the service.'' 37 CFR 201.6(c). We will not make any change to this charge.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Technical amendment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, this document adds the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control
numbers issued under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) for Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles and New
Motor Vehicle Engines; Regulations Requiring On-Board Diagnostic Systems on 1994 and Later Model Year Light-Duty
Vehicles and Light-Duty Trucks.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA is today amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued
by OMB for various regulations. Today's amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements
promulgated under the on-board diagnostics (OBD) final rulemaking which appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on February 19, 1993 (58 FR 9468). The affected regulations are codified at 40 CFR part 86. EPA will continue to present
OMB control numbers in a consolidated table format to be codified in 40 CFR part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in
each CFR volume containing EPA regulations. The table lists the section numbers with reporting and recordkeeping
requirements, and the current OMB control numbers. This display of the OMB control number and its subsequent codification
in the Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR 1320. 


This ICR was previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there
is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this
table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would
be unnecessary.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; 
Massachusetts; RACT for S. Bent and Brothers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This revision establishes and requires reasonably available 
control technology (RACT) for S. Bent and Brothers in Gardner, Massachusetts. The 
intended effect of this action is to approve a source-specific RACT determination made by 
Massachusetts in accordance with commitments specified in its Ozone Attainment Plan 
approved by EPA on November 9, 1983. This action is being taken in accordance with 
section 110 of the Clean Air Act.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 31, 1991 (56 FR 24765), EPA published 
a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The NPR 
proposed approval of a plan approval submitted by Massachusetts on November 2, 1990 
which defined and imposed reasonably available control technology (RACT) for S. Bent and 
Brothers in Gardner, Massachusetts. The NPR indicated that final approval would be 
contingent upon the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) providing 
additional technical support documenting that the limits established for S. Bent represent 
RACT. A revised Plan approval was submitted as a SIP revision by Massachusetts on August 
26, 1992. This SIP revision provides the additional technical support requested by EPA in its 
NPR. 


The DEP issued this plan approval pursuant to the requirements found in 310 CMR 7.18(17), 
which was approved by EPA on November 9, 1983 (48 FR 51480) as part of Massachusetts' 
Ozone Attainment Plan. Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17), ``Reasonably Available 
Control Technology (RACT),'' requires the DEP to determine and impose RACT on otherwise 
unregulated stationary sources of VOC with the potential to emit greater than or equal to 100 
tons per year. 
Massachusett's revised final approval lowers the VOC content in the sealer coating category 
to 5.43 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating (minus water). Reporting requirements were also amended to track long term
VOC emissions in tons on a 12 consecutive month rolling 
VOC limit instead of a 12 month calendar limit. 
For the reasons outlined in the Technical Support Document prepared for this revision, EPA 
believes that the limits the DEP has established represent RACT for S. Bent and Brothers. 
Other specific requirements of the plan approval and the rationale for EPA's proposed action 
are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were received 
on the NPR. 



Final Action 


EPA is approving this plan approval for S. Bent and Brothers as a revision to the 
Massachusetts SIP. The plan approval defines and imposes RACT on S. Bent, a manufacturer 
and coater of wood furniture in Gardner, Massachusetts. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory 
flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 
U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, 
small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of 
less than 50,000. 
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the 
procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225).

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the CAA do not create any new 
requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, 
because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does 
not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of 
the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis 
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA 
forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must 
be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by September 26, 1994. Filing a petition
for reconsideration by the Administrator of 
this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor 
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not 
postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in 
proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

ACTION:

 Final regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends regulations governing the State Vocational and Applied Technology Education Program, National
Tech-Prep Education Program, and State-Administered Tech-Prep Education Program. These regulations implement
statutory changes to the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Act) contained in the Higher
Education Technical Amendments of 1993, enacted December 20, 1993, and the School-to- Work Opportunities Act of
1994, enacted May 4, 1994. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Part 403 


The regulations amending part 403 affect the State Vocational and Applied Technology Education Program, which assists
States in conducting directly, or through awards to local recipients, vocational education programs. The amendments
implement provisions that make consortia of eligible institutions, as defined in 34 CFR 403.117(a), eligible to
receive funds under the Postsecondary and Adult Vocational Education Programs (  403.116 (b) and (c)
and 403.118 (a), (b), (c)(1), (4) and (5)), describe the conditions that must be met by consortia operating joint projects
( 403.116(d)), and make conforming changes (  403.32(b)(4), 403.120, and 403.193). 


Parts 405 and 406 


The regulations amending parts 405 and 406 affect the National Tech-Prep Education Program and the State-Administered
Tech-Prep Education Program that provide for sequences of study leading to a two-year associate degree or a two-year
certificate and that provide strong comprehensive links between secondary schools and postsecondary educational
institutions. The amendments to parts 405 and 406 implement provisions that allow for tech-prep programs to begin
in either the ninth or eleventh grades (  405.1, 405.3(a), 406.1(a), and 406.3(b)(2)), and require that
special consideration be given to applications that, among other things, are developed in consultation with business,
industry, labor unions, and institutions of higher education that award baccalaureate degrees (  405.20(e)(2)
and 406.10(b)(2)(ii)). 


Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 


In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)), and
the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the
opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, these amendments merely incorporate congressionally
mandated statutory changes into the regulations and do not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary
has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that public comment on the regulations is unnecessary and contrary
to the public interest. 


Intergovernmental Review 


This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective
of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and strengthened federalism by relying on processes
developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.

In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for this program.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency is today excluding from the RCRA regulatory definition of solid waste certain
in-process recycled secondary materials utilized by the petroleum refining industry. Specifically, today's rule
states that oil recovered from petroleum refinery wastewaters and from other sources, both on-site and off-site,
is excluded from the regulatory definition of solid waste if it is subsequently inserted (along with normal process
streams) into the petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking.

I. Authority 


These regulations are issued under the authority of Sections 2002 and 3001 

et seq. 

of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by the Hazardous
and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 6912 and 6921 

et seq. 


II. Background 


A. Statutory Definition of Solid Waste 


The statutory definition of solid waste, RCRA Section 1004 (27), is the starting point for determining RCRA Subtitle
C jurisdiction. This is because the term ``hazardous waste'' is a subset of ``solid waste.'' RCRA Sections 1004 (5)
and 1004 (27). The statutory definition of solid waste indicates that ``garbage, refuse, sludge * * *
and other discarded material'' are solid wastes. The critical issue is when secondary materials (see definition
at 50 FR at 616 n. 4, Jan. 4, 1985) that are going to be recycled can be solid wastes. Today's rulemaking addresses this
question for certain operations commonly occurring in the petroleum refining and related industries. 
The reader should note that EPA is conducting an assessment of the RCRA Definition of Solid Waste, as described in the
EPA report, RCRA Implementation Study Update

.

1

 This ongoing effort may result in proposed regulatory changes to the definition set forth in 40 CFR 261.2 and related
requirements. Today's action, however, is fairly narrow, applying to situations where certain oil-bearing secondary
materials are used or reused within the petroleum refining process. EPA will continue its broad policy review of the
Definition of Solid Waste, but deemed unnecessary any delay in issuing today's rule. 




B. Prior Litigation 


In its decision in 

American Mining Congress 

v. 

EPA, 

824 F. 2d
1177 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (

AMC I

), a divided panel of the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Agency's rules defining the statutory term ``solid
waste,'' RCRA Section 1004 (27), exceeded the Agency's statutory authority to the extent that the rules asserted
RCRA authority over ``materials that are recycled and reused in an 

ongoing 

manufacturing or industrial process.'' 

Id. 

at 1186 (emphasis original). Because ``these materials have not yet become part of the waste disposal problem'',


id., 

they are not yet ``discarded'' within the meaning of Section 1004 (27) and so cannot be considered to be ``solid wastes.''
Subsequent judicial decisions confirm that the holding in 

AMC I 

is limited to situations involving ``materials that are `destined for 

immediate reuse 

in another phase of the industry's ongoing production process' and that `have not yet become part of the waste disposal
problem.''' 

American Mining Congress 

v. 

EPA, 

907 F. 2d 1179, 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1990 (

AMC II

) (emphasis original);

EPA, 

976 F. 2d 2, 14 (D.C. Cir. 1992), 

cert. denied 

113 S.Ct. 1961 (1993). 


C. January 8, 1988 Proposal 


On January 8, 1988, EPA proposed rules to implement the 


AMC I 

opinion. Of particular significance to today's action, EPA proposed certain amendments relating to the scope of
the regulatory definition of solid waste as applied to operations occurring within the petroleum refining industry.
In particular, the Agency proposed to exclude from the regulatory definition of solid waste secondary materials
associated with ``on-going fuel production activities in the petroleum refining industry. These activities involve
situations where crude oil is refined, and oil-bearing residues from that refining process are returned for further
refining as part of one continuous and on-going process.'' 53 FR at 525 (Jan. 8, 1988). The Agency specifically proposed
to exclude oil-bearing residues from the refining process when those residues are generated on-site and inserted
into that on-site petroleum refining process or coker, provided that these residues are not managed in such a way as
to be ``characterized by elements of discard'' such as placement in a disposal unit like a surface impoundment. 

Id

. EPA is not taking any action today with respect to the portions of the January 8, 1988 proposal dealing with non-petroleum
materials. These issues are being addressed by other on-going Agency activities (see above, Section II.A.). The
Agency is, as described below, taking final action with respect to the petroleum materials. 



D. Description of Petroleum Exploration, Development & Production, and the Petroleum Refining Process 


The presence of petroleum in geologic formations is confirmed by the drilling of exploratory wells. Once located,
the development of a petroleum reservoir includes the drilling of additional wells to extract the oil or gas, and well
completion and stimulation techniques designed to increase the recovery of oil or gas from that reservoir. Petroleum
production generally includes all the activities associated with the recovery of petroleum from the geologic formation.
These production activities involve the operation and maintenance of the producing well, and the handling and separation
of the recovered crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and water. The separation of water/crude oil emulsions
is performed in tanks by gravity settling, or heat may be added to separate emulsions. Crude oil is then transported
via pipeline, vehicle or vessel to stock tanks and ultimately to the refinery. 
Petroleum refining involves several manufacturing operations and processes, including crude desalting, atmospheric
and vacuum distillation, hydrotreating, catalytic cracking, thermal processing and residual upgrading, light
hydrocarbon processing, hydrocracking, catalytic reforming, extraction, isomerization, lubricating oil processing,
sulfur removal and recovery, and product blending and inventory. Products manufactured from petroleum refining
include hydrogen, fuel gas, sulfur, liquified petroleum gas, butane, aromatic feedstocks, leaded and unleaded
motor gasolines, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel, heating oil, fuel oil, and asphalt. See generally, 55 FR at 46359 (Nov.
2, 1990); and EPA's Development Document for the effluent guidelines for the petroleum refining industry.

2






E. Petroleum Refining Wastewater Treatment 


Petroleum refining operations generate large amounts of wastewater that require treatment in order to reduce or
remove wastewater pollutants so as to produce effluent that meets discharge requirements of the Clean Water Act.
Principal sources of wastewater are refinery process units (where wastewater comes in direct contact with oil),
as well as oily cooling waters from cooling towers and heat exchangers. Storm water, which may be subject to minor oil
contamination from leaks or spills, is also a type of wastewater at a petroleum refinery.

3

 




Wastewater treatment systems at petroleum refineries generally consist of: (1) a drainage and collection system
to collect and carry wastewaters to treatment units; (2) a primary treatment system to separate oil/water/solids,
and (3) a secondary treatment system, normally involving biological treatment, to remove soluble biodegradable
wastewater pollutants. Some refineries have tertiary treatment systems as well, consisting of water polishing
steps before discharge. Secondary and tertiary treatment is frequently conducted using surface impoundments.
Primary treatment, i.e. the initial separation of water, oil, and solids, normally occurs in tanks.

F. Recovered Oil and Recovered Oil Systems 


Today's rule deals primarily with the status under RCRA Subtitle C of recovered oil which is returned to the petroleum
refining process. ``Recovered oil'' is a generic term that applies to secondary materials consisting primarily
of oil such as oil separator skimmings from plant wastewaters, slop oil and emulsions, oil skimmed from ballast water
tanks, and oil from refinery process units (

e.g.,

 off-specification process streams). As explained in detail below, today's rule excludes from the definition of
solid waste recovered oil from petroleum exploration and production, petroleum refining, and transportation incident
to either of these activities, when the recovered oil is reinserted into a petroleum refining process. The exclusion
does not apply to recovered oil generated from petroleum operations downstream of refining such as marketing or retail
sales_because this oil is already excluded for the most part, as discussed below _, or from non-petroleum industry
operations. 
This rule also does not exclude hazardous sludges (such as wastes K048, K051, or F037) or other similar wastes from
regulation. Distinguishing between these wastes and recovered oil is sometimes difficult. Factors EPA will consider
in making this distinction include water content, solids content, and potentially, metals content. See generally
50 FR at 49170 n. 16 (Nov. 29, 1985). EPA repeats, however, that the salient characteristic of recovered oil is the obvious
one: that it consist primarily of oil. 
Used oil also is not a type of recovered oil, and hence remains subject to the applicable regulations for used oil. See
generally 59 FR 10550 (March 4, 1994). The only exception is when 

de minimis 

quantities of used oil are incidentally captured by refinery wastewater treatment systems. This could occur, for
example, when small leaks, spills, or drippings of used oil from machinery, pumps, or other refinery equipment during
normal operations are lost to the wastewater treatment system. In these instances, the used oil present in de minimis
quantities in wastewater is not subject to the used oil standards. See generally 57 FR at 41566 (Sept. 10, 1992). 
The objective of a recovered oil system is to gather and recycle oil generated throughout the refinery, or (to a lesser
extent) generated from off-site sources.

4

 Recovered oil operations almost always occur in tanks, usually a series of tanks that successively purify the oil
to the point where it is sufficiently clean and dewatered to be inserted into the petroleum refining process. 53 FR
at 525. Some oil is collected directly from process units and sent by means of pipes or vacuum trucks to the refinery's
dedicated oil tanks. Occasionally this recovered oil is of sufficient purity that it can be inserted directly into
the refining process with little or no treatment in the recovered oil system. 




Recovered oil from plant wastewater operations is most often a water-in-oil emulsion, which is sent first to tanks
where gravity separates much of it into oil, emulsion, and water layers. The intermediate layer of emulsions then
may be sent to other tanks where it will undergo further emulsion-breaking treatment (

e.g.,

 mechanical centrifuging, heating, or chemical additives). At the end of each stage, the separated water is returned
to the refinery oil/water separators, while the oil is either further treated or, if sufficiently dewatered, is returned
to one or more refinery process units. These may include crude oil distillation or catalytic cracking units.

G. Status of Wastewater Streams, Wastewater Treatment Units, Recovered Oil, and Recovered Oil Systems Under Current
RCRA Rules 


Under present RCRA regulations, petroleum refinery wastewaters upstream of a wastewater discharge that is subject
to regulation under Sections 307(b) or 402 of the Clean Water Act, are solid wastes. See 40 CFR 261.4(a)(1) and (2).
Such petroleum refinery wastewaters are hazardous if they exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste, or are listed
hazardous wastes (although there are presently no specific hazardous waste listings for petroleum refining industry
wastewaters). Petroleum refining wastewater storage and treatment operations generate a number of listed hazardous
wastes. In particular, sludges from primary treatment operations are listed under the generic F037 and F038 listings.
Sludges from Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) wastewater treatment units and API separators (particular types of primary
wastewater treatment devices) are listed as wastes K048 and K051, respectively. Slop oil systems generate listed
wastes as well: slop oil emulsion solids are listed as K049. Also, EPA is studying additional petroleum refining wastes
as part of a listing determination required by RCRA 3001 (e)(2). 
In addition, petroleum refineries typically generate large volumes of wastes that exhibit hazardous waste characteristics.
Individual wastewater streams upstream of wastewater treatment may exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic, particularly
for chromium, lead and benzene (see 40 CFR 261.24), or the characteristics of corrosivity or ignitability (40 CFR
261.21 and 261.22, respectively). These wastewaters may also contain other hazardous constituents that are not
part of the Toxicity Characteristic. See Tables in Section V, Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines,
New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment Standards for the Petroleum Refining Point Source Category.

 Sludges generated from secondary or tertiary wastewater treatment also may exhibit one or more hazardous waste characteristics.

Tanks storing listed wastes which engage in primary wastewater treatment operations are presently exempt from federal
Subtitle C regulation because they are wastewater treatment units (

i.e. 

tanks). 40 CFR 264.1 (g)(6) and 265.1 (c)(10). Hazardous wastes removed from those units are subject to regulation
upon exiting the tanks. However, recovered oil is exempt from Subtitle C regulation, as is any fuel produced from such
oil, under the current exemptions at  261.6 (a)(3)(iv)-(vii). The units engaged in recovered oil operations
would also be exempt under current regulations, to the extent that these units are managing materials exempt under
 261.6 (a)(3)(iv)-(vi).

III. Summary of Today's Final Rule 




EPA is finalizing a revised version of the January 8, 1988 proposal in today's notice. The final rule states in essence
that recovered oil from petroleum refinery operations, petroleum exploration and production, and transportation
incident thereto, is excluded from the regulatory definition of solid waste if it is subsequently inserted into the
petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. The recovered oil thus need not be
generated at the site of the refining process_a potentially significant expansion of the proposal. This exclusion
applies, however, only if the oil is not managed in land disposal units or accumulated speculatively before it is inserted.



EPA expects that most of the recovered oil affected by this rule will be generated from wastewater treatment operations.
As explained below, EPA is narrowing the proposal (which would have excluded petroleum refining wastewaters containing
oil that eventually gets recycled) by finding that refinery operations upstream of recovered oil systems involve
wastewater treatment, not an on-going refining process. Thus, petroleum refinery wastewaters undergoing treatment
should not be excluded from the definition of solid waste. In addition, even if these wastewater treatment operations
are characterized as also involving recycling, the operations involve discarded residuals that can be part of the
waste disposal problem, and hence the wastewater treatment operations need not be characterized as part of an ``ongoing
production process'' for purposes of excluding materials from the definition of solid waste. Once oil is recovered,
however, the Agency believes it reasonable to exclude it from the definition of solid waste if the oil is to be reused
in the refining process (even though the oil may still require a significant amount of further processing before it
can actually be so reused). This is because the recovered oil and its management within refining operations can be
viewed as part of the petroleum refining process and not part of the waste disposal problem. 




EPA is also slightly amending the regulatory exemption for petroleum coke produced using oil-bearing refinery hazardous
waste (see  261.6 (a)(3)(vii), redesignated (a)(3)(vi) in today's rule). The Agency is slightly broadening
the current exemption so that it also applies to coke produced by a single petroleum refining entity, but the coker
is located at a different facility from where the hazardous wastes are generated. 



As a matter of drafting, the principal change brought about by today's rule takes the form of an exclusion from the regulatory
definition of solid waste. Specifically, paragraph (12) is being added to the list of exclusions in  261.4 (a).
In addition, EPA is removing the regulatory exemption in  261.6(a)(3)(v) which is superseded by today's exclusion,
and redesignating the remaining exemptions in  261.6(a)(3) (vi) and (vii) as  261.6(a)(3) (v) and (vi),
respectively, in order to maintain consecutive numbering. EPA is also revising two other regulatory exemptions
in  261.6(a)(3). Finally, EPA is making conforming changes to   261.3(c)(2)(ii)(B) and 266.100(b)(3),
both as a result of today's rulemaking, and to reflect conforming changes that EPA inadvertently omitted during promulgation
of the used oil final rule (57 FR 41566 (September 10, 1992)). 


IV. Scope of Today's Final Rule 




A. Limiting Scope to Recovered Oil From Petroleum Refining, Exploration and Production 




As noted above, today's rule excludes recovered oil generated from petroleum exploration, production and refining
activities, and from the transportation incident thereto, from being a solid waste when the recovered oil is inserted
into a designated point in a petroleum refining process. This section of the preamble discusses why EPA is crafting
the exclusion in this manner. More specifically, we discuss why the exclusion does not cover oil recovered in operations
downstream from petroleum refining, and why the exclusion does not apply to recovered oil from industries other than
petroleum refining, exploration, or production.

EPA is not excluding recovered oil from operations downstream of refining, such as marketing or retail sales, because
such oil is already excluded from regulation (so long as it is not disposed of). Under existing section 261.33, unused
commercial chemical products that are recycled in most manners are not solid wastes when they are recycled. This principle
applies to unused fuels that are recycled by being returned to fuel-production processes. (See also RCRA section
3004 (q)(l), establishing a similar principle.) Thus, for example, if a bulk oil storage terminal has a spill of product
and is able to capture the spill and return it to a refinery or other legitimate fuel production operation, the spilled
product is not a solid waste. (As noted at 55 FR 22671 (June 1, 1990) however, mere assertion of an intent to recycle a
commercial product spill does not convert the spill into a non-waste. There must be objective indicia that recycling
is reasonable, and that it will occur in a timely manner.) 


For different reasons, EPA is not extending the exclusion to recovered oil from non-petroleum industries. First,
such an exclusion is beyond the scope of the proposed rule. It is also beyond the scope of the judicial decisions construing
the definition of solid waste. These decisions indicate that when one industry sends its residual materials to another
industry for recycling, the initial industry can be considered to have discarded them. 

API 

v. 

EPA, 

906 F. 2d at 741-42; 

Ilco 

v. 

EPA, 

996 F. 2d 1126 (11th Cir. 1993). EPA is also concerned that when recovered oil originates with non-petroleum industries,
the likelihood increases that the oil can be contaminated with toxic constituents that would not normally be found
in petroleum industry recovered oil. See generally, 56 FR at 48009 (Sept. 23, 1991); and see, e.g., EPA's Development
Document for effluent guidelines for the iron and steel industry (skimmed oil from iron and steel industry contains
contaminants not found in petroleum recovered oil).

6

 Such oily material consequently is more likely to differ from the feedstocks customarily processed by refineries
and thus need not be viewed as part of that process, and may also pose risks that can be viewed as part of the waste disposal
problem. Finally, the Agency is studying this issue under the aegis of the Solid Waste Definition Task Force and is
not at a point where it is in a position to make a final determination.

7

 





B. Rationale for Excluding Recovered Oil and Not Wastewater from Being a Solid Waste 




EPA is also determining today that the oil that is skimmed from plant wastewaters during wastewater treatment (normally
during the initial oil/water/solids separation step occurring during primary wastewater treatment), as well as
oil recovered from other sources, is not a solid waste if it is going to be inserted into the refining process prior to
the point in the process where crude distillation or catalytic cracking occurs. Thus, the recovered oil systems themselves
would not be waste management units. (These units may, however, contain hazardous wastes, such as K049, which become
subject to regulation when removed from such units. See 40 CFR 261.4 (c), which says that hazardous waste regulation
does not begin for (among other things) hazardous waste which is generated in an associated non-waste-treatment-manufacturing
unit until the waste is removed from the unit.) 



The petroleum industry argued in its public comments to the January 8, 1988 proposal that plant wastewaters containing
oil are not solid wastes either. Rather, they characterize the primary wastewater treatment operations in which
oil is skimmed from plant waters as still being part of the refining process. Thus, the argument goes, any step at a refinery
that involves some recovery of oil for further use is still part of the ongoing refining process and cannot involve
solid waste under the holding of 

AMC I

. 


EPA disagrees with respect to primary wastewater treatment operations. These operations do not involve secondary
materials that are ``recycled and reused in an 

ongoing

 manufacturing or industrial process'', 

AMC I

, 824 F. 2d at 1186 (emphasis original); 

see also AMC II

, 907 F. 2d at 1186 (

AMC I 

concerns only ``materials that are `destined for 

immediate reuse 

in another phase of 

the industry's 

ongoing production process''') (emphasis original). Primary wastewater treatment operations exist to treat plant
wastewater. The percentage of oil in plant wastewaters that form the influent to primary wastewater treatment is
minuscule, on the order of .0001 % to .000001 % (

i.e.

 from 1 to 100 parts per million oil). See Tables in Section V, 

Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment
Standards for the Petroleum 
Refining Point Source Category. 

While some oil may be recovered from this wastewater (an activity the Agency certainly encourages, and indeed requires
to prevent the oil's discharge to surface waters and POTWs), the amounts are not significant in the context of a refinery's
overall production activities. Clearly, wastewater treatment is the main purpose of the systems in question, and
any oil recovery is of secondary import. 


Refinery wastewater is not a ``secondary material immediately reused within an industrial process''. 

Chemical Waste Management 

v. 

EPA

, 976 F. 2d at 14. Primary wastewater treatment is the first step in the wastewater treatment process that purifies
the discarded wastewaters from the refining process so that those discarded waters can ultimately be discharged
to navigable waters pursuant to Clean Water Act requirements. That a small amount of oil is removed from these wastewaters
in the course of treatment does not make wastewater treatment a petroleum refining operation. Put another way, the
fact that a small amount of oil may be recovered from large volumes of the discarded plant wastewaters does not require
EPA to consider those operations to involve non-discarded materials, and hence to exclude all of the materials going
to primary wastewater treatment operations from the definition of solid waste. 

AMC II

, 907 F.2d at 1186-7 (``discarded'' is an ambiguous term that EPA may interpret in a reasonable manner, and EPA's
interpretation that recoverable materials managed in wastewater treatment operations containing surface impoundments
were discarded solid wastes was reasonable).

On the other hand, recovered oil systems can be legitimately viewed as part of the petroleum refining process. The
input to the recovered oil systems is primarily oil skimmed from wastewater treatment operations as well as oil recovered
from other sources, not discarded refining process wastewaters. Recovered oil systems do not exist to remove contaminants
from wastewater. Rather, their purpose is to restore recovered oil to sufficient purity so that it can be reused as
a feedstock material in the refining process. This is a natural point to characterize activities as being part of the
refining process. 
It is thus EPA's view that until oil is recovered from refinery process wastewaters, the wastewaters are discarded
materials and hence solid wastes potentially subject to regulation under RCRA.

8

 (Wastewaters remaining after oil has been recovered are still solid wastes, and are typically returned to an upstream
point in the refinery's wastewater treatment system.) The oil recovered from such wastewaters is not a solid waste,
however (assuming it is reinserted into the refining process). This reading is not only in accord with common sense,
as explained above, but also is in accord with RCRA's goals and purposes. 

AMC II

, 907 F. 2d at 1186-87; 

API

, 906 F. 2d at 740-41. As these cases make clear, EPA may ordinarily consider secondary materials that have ``become
part of the waste disposal problem'' to be discarded. 

API

, 906 F. 2d at 741; 

AMC II

, 907 F. 2d at 1186. That is the case here. Discarded plant wastewaters up to and including the primary wastewater treatment
step, can contain high loadings of hazardous constituents that may pose environmental harm if released. It is estimated
that an average of 34% of the benzene (a human carcinogen) entering a petroleum refinery's wastewater treatment system
is emitted to air from the wastewater collection portion of the system; when primary wastewater treatment (i.e.,
a non-enclosed oil-water separator) is included in this calculation, the amount of benzene emitted relative to the
influent concentration rises to 47%.

9

 Primary wastewater treatment also is sometimes conducted in land-based or in-ground units, which can (and have)
resulted in environmental contamination.

10

 This further indicates that these operations can be part of the waste management problem. 






In addition, petroleum refineries frequently generate individual wastewater streams that exhibit characteristics
of hazardous waste, which streams are mixed together so that the characteristic is removed. (The characteristic
can be removed either before or during primary treatment.) These aggregated wastewater streams may still contain
high volumes of hazardous constituents, however, because aggregation (i.e. dilution) and primary treatment do
not significantly remove or destroy all hazardous constituents. See Tables in Section V, 

Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment
Standards for the Petroleum Refining Point Source Category

. The aggregated wastewaters are then managed in surface impoundments, where biological treatment occurs. The D.C.
Circuit has made clear, in 

Chemical Waste Management 

v.

 EPA

, that in such circumstances the decharacterized wastewaters cannot be managed in surface impoundments unless they
have first been treated to meet the treatment requirements of RCRA Section 3004(m) (requiring treatment that substantially
removes or destroys hazardous constituents so that threats to human health and the environment are minimized), or
unless treatment equivalent to Section 3004(m) treatment occurs before the wastewaters are discharged. 

Id

. at 7, 20-24.
 The court indeed repeatedly referred to these treatment standards as the core of RCRA's hazardous waste management
scheme. 

Id

. at 23, 24. 




EPA's interpretation that the influent into primary wastewater treatment consists of discarded wastes, not in-process
petroleum, is fully in accord with these core principles of RCRA. Decharacterized wastewaters that are going to be
managed in surface impoundments would nevertheless receive Section 3004 (m) treatment before their ultimate discharge,
as required by the 

Chemical Waste Management 

opinion. Under industry's preferred reading, however, the decharacterized wastewaters would not be solid wastes
at all until all oil recovery has been completed, even if held in impoundments. At that point, the wastewaters would
no longer exhibit a characteristic (because they have been diluted through aggregation), and thus would not be prohibited
wastes subject to Section 3004 (m) treatment. The ``core principles of RCRA'' would thus be avoided. EPA considers
its interpretation of ``discarded,'' that assures proper treatment of characteristically hazardous petroleum
refinery wastewaters that are going to be managed in surface impoundments, to be more reasonable.

12

 




EPA acknowledges that it initially proposed to exclude all such wastewaters from the definition of solid waste. 53
FR 525-526. However, the Agency's reasoning was based in part on the same mistaken view of the scope of 

AMC I

 that was later rejected by the 

API 

court. 906 F. 2d at 740-41. (EPA even relied in part on the overbroad ``indigenous'' concept, 53 FR 525, 526, that
was remanded in 

API

. 906 F. 2d at 739, 742.) The Agency is obviously not bound by its proposal, and subsequent case law makes clear that the
Agency has more interpretive discretion than it imagined in 1988. The interpretation adopted in today's rule is reasonable
and in accord with statutory goals and purposes.

Nor is today's action inconsistent with 

AMC I's 

statements regarding the scope of petroleum refining activities that are outside the scope of Subtitle C. That opinion
indicated that in petroleum refining operations ``(a)ny hydrocarbons that are not usable in a particular form or
state are returned to an appropriate stage in the refining process so they can eventually be used. Likewise, the hydrocarbons
and materials which escape from a refinery's production vessels are gathered and, by a complex retrieval system,
returned to appropriate parts of the refining process.'' 824 F. 2d at 1181. Today's rule does not assert RCRA jurisdiction
over any refining operations that process hydrocarbons into products, nor over hydrocarbons that are lost from process
vessels and are gathered for return to refining. Rather, the Agency is stating that up to and including primary wastewater
treatment, plant wastewaters are just that, and their management is potentially subject to Subtitle C controls.
Oil that is recovered from wastewater, however, is no longer a solid waste, and recovered oil systems that do engage
in retrieval of hydrocarbons for eventual refining are not subject to RCRA controls.

13

 





C. Rationale for Excluding Recovered Oil From Off-Site Sources 



Today's final rule, in defining the scope of recovered oil subject to the exclusion, excludes recovered oil from both
off-site and on-site sources. EPA believes that recovered oil from petroleum refining, exploration and production,
and transportation incident thereto, whether generated from these off-site or on-site sources, is essentially
the same raw material (i.e., ``oil'') as that which is normally and routinely transported to, and inserted into, petroleum
refining processes. Therefore, recovered oil from off-site sources should also be excluded when it is going to be
recycled in this manner.

14

 Examples of off-site sources of recovered oil include oil recovered from other petroleum refineries, and from oil
and gas drilling operations.

15

 






This exclusion is somewhat broader than that proposed in the January 8, 1988 notice, which would have limited the exclusion
to materials generated on-site. 53 FR 525. However, the 1988 proposal would not have been limited to recovered oil,
but rather would have included all oil-bearing secondary materials, so that the Agency was particularly concerned
with limiting the exclusion's scope because such materials as listed sludges, tank bottoms and contaminated media
could be excluded. 

Id

. In addition, if the exclusion was to cover oil-bearing hazardous secondary materials, EPA was concerned that RCRA
Section 3004(r)(2) would be rendered meaningless. 

Id

. These concerns are no longer present when the exclusion is limited to recovered oil. 

The main reason for extending the exclusion to recovered oil generated at locations other than a refinery (when such
oil is ultimately returned to a refinery) is that the oil is essentially the same (in terms of physical composition
and potential risk) as recovered oil generated on-site. (The only significant difference is that recovered oil generated
off-site is transported_in the same manner as crude oil. EPA does not regard this distinction as significant enough
to warrant different regulatory status for off-site recovered oil.) The Agency thus is responding to comments received
from industry, urging the Agency to extend the scope of the exclusion to certain off-site activities. However, these
commenters argued further that refineries comprise but one segment of a large, integrated industry, extending from
the production field, through the pipeline, to the refinery, to the marketing terminal, to tank trucks, and, ultimately,
to the customer. EPA does not necessarily accept this argument, which is unnecessary to justify today's rule. Again,
EPA will continue its broader policy review of the Definition of Solid Waste. EPA notes as well that the action in today's
rule is not precedential for other industries. Determining what activities are a part of on-going production activities
and not part of the waste disposal problem necessarily entails fact-specific evaluation. The Agency's conclusions
regarding secondary materials generated by particular industries thus need not be germane to the regulatory status
of secondary materials generated by other industries. 



V. Rationale for Conditioning the Exclusion on Recovered Oil Not Being Placed on the Land and Not Being Accumulated
Speculatively 



This rule does not exclude land-based hazardous waste management units from which oil may be recovered. Thus, if recovered
oil, or material containing oil, is placed in land-based units such as surface impoundments or land treatment units,
those units remain subject to Subtitle C requirements (provided the material being placed is hazardous under RCRA).
The Agency considers material placed in such units to be discarded, and hence solid wastes. See also 

AMC I

, 824 F. 2d at n.20. These are classic disposal practices (see RCRA Section 1002(b)(7)), and placement of oily materials
in such units (whether for storage, treatment, or disposal) is inconsistent with the use of the material as a valued
product. In addition, the D.C. Circuit held in 

AMC II

 that materials destined for recycling were still solid wastes if held in surface impoundments before being recycled
(907 F. 2d at 1186). 

The final condition for the exclusion to apply is that recovered oil not be accumulated speculatively (as defined
in  261.1(c)(8)) before it is recycled back into a petroleum refining process. This is a standard condition
that the Agency applies to otherwise excluded secondary materials (see, e.g., 
 261.2(e)(2)(iii)) to prevent the materials being held for prolonged periods without being recycled, with
attendant increased environmental risk. See 50 FR at 634-635, 658-661 (Jan. 4, 1985). No commenter seriously
questioned applying this condition. Thus, recovered oil that would otherwise be excluded that is accumulated speculatively
is considered to be discarded and hence a solid waste.

VI. Rationale for Not Excluding Recovered Oil That Is Inserted Into the Petroleum Refining Process After Crude Distillation
or Catalytic Cracking (i.e., Into a Petroleum Coker)


Today's final rule is narrower in scope than the January 8, 1988 notice in that the Agency is not finalizing the proposed
exclusion of recovered oil that is converted to petroleum coke. EPA is deferring the exclusion at this time because
EPA lacks data assuring that hazardous constituents from petroleum refining do not end up in the product in quantities
that, when such product is utilized as a fuel, could be harmful to human health and the environment. EPA is also concerned
that toxic constituents, such as heavy metals, can be discarded by simple incorporation into the coke product. In
effect, the product would be used as a disposal medium for toxic constituents, and so could be part of the ``waste disposal
problem.'' The Agency also lacks sufficient data to show whether oil recovered from refinery wastewater treatment
systems contains toxic metals that are not present in the normal feed to a petroleum coker. Such metals could end up
in the coke product.
In contrast, the Agency is excluding recovered oil inserted at or before a point in the refining process designed to
remove toxic metal and organic contaminants, 

i.e., 

prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. See 50 FR 28725 (July 15, 1985) and 50 FR 49169 (November 29, 1985).
As explained there, the distillation process splits the feedstock into fractions based on the differing boiling
points of feedstock components. Data submitted by API at that time indicated that most metals concentrate in the heavier
petroleum fractions, thereby increasing the probability of contaminant removal from many fuel fractions produced
using distillation (and other contaminant-removing processes). See 50 FR 49170.
Although the proposed exclusion of recovered oil that is converted to petroleum coke is not being finalized in today's
rule, for different reasons EPA is slightly amending the regulatory exemption at  261.6(a)(3)(vii) (redesignated
 261.6(a)(3)(vi) in today's rule) for petroleum coke produced using oil-bearing refinery hazardous waste.
The exemption states that such coke is subject to regulation only if it exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste.
(The exemption recites the provisions of RCRA section 3004(q)(2)(A).) The purpose of the statute, and the exemption,
is to allow petroleum companies to recycle their oily refinery waste to their petroleum coker, without automatically
subjecting the coke output to the rules applicable to hazardous waste fuels. (Such automatic effect could occur without
the exemption, if listed wastes are being reinserted into the coker, because of the derived-from rule.) S. Rept. No.
298, 98th Cong. 1st Sess. 39 (1983).
Both the statutory and current regulatory exemption, however, are worded so as to apply only to situations where petroleum
coke is produced from hazardous wastes ``at the same facility at which such wastes were generated * * *''.
EPA believes that this limitation is unnecessarily narrow, and does not foreclose a regulatory expansion. In particular,
so long as a petroleum refinery is coking its own wastes, it should not matter whether the coker is located at the site
where wastes are generated or at a different facility. Since the generator and coker operator remain the same entity
(or ``person'', as defined in  260.10) there is sufficient guarantee that hazardous wastes of unknown or uncertain
composition will not be used in the coking process, which is the evident concern behind the limitation in the statute.
Cf. 50 FR at 28725 (July 15, 1985); 50 FR 49170 (Nov. 29, 1985). Since the hazardous wastes would remain regulated under
RCRA when they are generated, transported, and stored prior to recycling, 

id., 

potential concerns regarding tracking are also addressed. EPA also sees no difference in the composition of coke
produced partially from on-site and off-site hazardous wastes when the coke is produced by the same entity. Consequently,
the Agency is slightly broadening the current regulatory exemption so that it applies to coke produced by a single
petroleum refining entity, even if the coker is located at a different facility from where the hazardous wastes are
generated.
Finally, the coking process itself continues to be exempt from RCRA regulation as a recycling unit, provided this
recycling is legitimate. Section 261.6(c)(1) (``The recycling process itself is exempt from regulation except
as provided in  261.6(d).''). Today's rule does not affect this provision.


VII. Rationale for Not Excluding Other Oil-Bearing Hazardous Materials


Just as EPA is not excluding oil-bearing wastewaters from the definition of solid waste, it is not excluding other
similar types of oil-bearing materials, such as hazardous wastewater treatment sludges. These materials are not
composed primarily of oil; they are unlike raw materials normally used in the petroleum refining process; and the
units in which they are managed_API separators, DAF units, land treatment units and surface impoundments_are not
parts of the refining process, but rather function as waste holding and treatment units. In addition, there have been
many damage incidents associated with management of such materials as toxic sludges from wastewater treatment,
confirming that these materials are part of the waste disposal problem, rather than part of an on-going manufacturing
operation. (See, for example, the Listing Background Documents for Hazardous Wastes K048-052 and F037-038.)
For these reasons, the Agency continues to classify these materials as discarded, within the meaning of RCRA Section
1004 (27). Recovered oil that is obtained from such wastes, however, is excluded from the definition of solid waste
under today's final rule (assuming the rule's conditions are satisfied).
The Agency is also aware of various types of units designed to treat wastes K048-K052 and F037-F038, in
order to reduce the volume and toxicity of these wastes, as well as to recover oil. See, e.g., 57 FR 37198 (August 18,
1992). EPA does not view these units as part of the manufacturing (i.e., refining) process, because such units are
not part of a continuing series of unit operations that crack/distill/fractionate crude oil. The input to these units
are materials such as wastewater treatment sludges, that contain relatively small amounts of oil. A different determination
frustrates the Congressional objective that hazardous waste be treated properly. These types of units are the basis
for treatment standards under the land disposal restrictions for K048-K052 and F037-F038. If the sludges
treated in these units are no longer hazardous waste, they would not need to be treated by application of BDAT so as to
minimize the threats they pose. Cf. 

API

, 906 F. 2d at 741-742. Thus, excluding such sludges from jurisdiction until properly treated could contribute
to the waste disposal problem that Congress sought to remedy. Finally, although EPA is not excluding these types of
oil-bearing materials (such as hazardous wastewater treatment sludges), the units in which the recovery of oil is
occurring may still be a type of recycling unit, and therefore may be exempt from RCRA permitting requirements under
40 CFR 261.6(c)(1).

VIII. Demonstration That Recovered Oil Meets Conditions of Exclusion


Under  261.2(f), persons claiming that recovered oil is excluded from the definition of solid waste bear the
burden of proof in enforcement actions to demonstrate that they qualify for the exclusion. This would normally require
some type of demonstration that the recovered oil is going to be and actually is used in a petroleum refining operation
prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. For on-site sources, this documentation could be entries in the
operating records of the facility showing where the oil is recovered and where it re-enters the refining process.
For off-site sources, this demonstration is especially important. Adequate documentation could entail 

bona fide 

contractual agreements with other facilities to take the recovered oil, shipping or delivery records to the receiving
facility, or other similar records. These records are important to show enforcement personnel that the conditions
of the exclusion have been met. Without this documentation, the burden of proof will ordinarily not be satisfied because
enforcement personnel will have no way of verifying that the recovered oil actually was used in the refining process
and the assumption can be made that the oil was not reused, and was instead sent off-site or managed on-site as a hazardous
waste.


IX. Examples of How Today's Rule Operates


Example 1


Petroleum refinery A generates wastewater. As part of primary wastewater treatment, it skims oil from the wastewater.
This operation occurs in wastewater treatment tanks. The skimmed oil is then gathered and inserted directly into
crude oil storage units for insertion into the refining process.
The refinery process wastewater is still considered to be a solid waste, notwithstanding that some oil is skimmed
from it. The wastewater treatment tanks used for treating the wastewater are exempt from subtitle C regulation. Section
264.1(g)(6), 265.1(c)(10). The skimmed oil is recovered oil that is excluded from being a solid waste under today's
regulation because it originates from petroleum refining, it is not land disposed before being recycled, and it is
returned to the designated part of the petroleum refining process. (This answer assumes that the recovered oil is
not being accumulated speculatively.)


Example 2


Same facts as Example 1, except that the skimmed oil requires processing in the plant's slop oil system. This process
involves demulsifying and separation via chemical addition, thermal treatment, and gravity separation.
Same answer as in Example 1. It should also be noted that water and solids from the slop oil system can be wastes, and if
hazardous, can be subject to Subtitle C regulation once they are removed from the slop oil tank.


Example 3



Same facts as Example 1, except that the source of the recovered oil is a petrochemical plant wastewater treatment
system.
The oil is not excluded from being a solid waste under today's rule because it does not come from petroleum refining,
exploration or production operations.



Example 4



Facility B recovers oil from spills at exploration and production operations. The oil is trucked to a tank, where separation
occurs. The separated oil is put into a pipeline for ultimate insertion into crude oil storage units at a petroleum
refinery.

The oil recovered from the spills is excluded from being a solid waste. It is a type of recovered oil, and is excluded
because it originates from exploration and production activities, is not land disposed or accumulated speculatively,
and is inserted into a refining process.



Example 5



Facility C is a bulk petroleum storage facility. Oil spilled from its product storage tanks is too contaminated to
be directly used as product. The oil is sent back to a refinery where it is placed in a slop oil system and returned to the
refining process.
The spilled oil is excluded from being a solid waste, not under today's rule, but under  261.33 (and  261.2
Table 1) because it is a commercial chemical product that is being recycled rather than abandoned. (EPA interprets
this principle to apply to commercial chemical products that exhibit characteristics as well as those listed in  261.33.
50 FR 14219 (April 11, 1985).) (This answer assumes that the oil is recovered promptly and that the spills do not create
permanent land disposal units. See 55 FR 22671 (June 1, 1990).)
All of these answers assume that legitimate recycling is occurring. See discussion of sham recycling criteria in
many prior Agency notices, such as 53 FR 522 (Jan. 8, 1988) and 56 FR 7143, 7185 (Feb. 21, 1991).


X. Relationship to Other Programs


A. Clean Air Act (Benzene NESHAP)



On January 7, 1993 (58 FR 3072) EPA promulgated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412) final amendments
to the benzene waste operations national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) (V FF at 40 CFR
part 61). Sources affected by V FF include chemical manufacturing plants, by-product recovery plants, petroleum
refineries, and facilities at which waste management units are used to treat, store, or dispose of waste generated
by chemical manufacturing plants, by-product recovery plants, or petroleum refineries.


B. Clean Water Act


Today's rule does not affect petroleum facilities' obligations under the Clean Water Act, and is consistent with
the Agency's prior descriptions of primary wastewater treatment activities at petroleum refineries as involving
wastewater treatment, not recycling of in-process material.


C. RCRA


1. RCRA Air Emission Standards


EPA has issued regulations that implement portions of RCRA Section 3004(n), which provision requires EPA to issue
rules regulating air emissions resulting from facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous wastes. 40 CFR
parts 264 and 265 Subparts AA and BB. These rules control organic emissions from vents and equipment leaks from units
managing hazardous wastes, which units either are already subject to RCRA Subtitle C permitting requirements, or
are recycling units located at facilities which has other units already subject to Subtitle C permitting requirements.
Today's rule does not affect any units that are subject to regulation under subparts AA or BB. This is because the units
that are affected by today's rule are not presently subject to Subtitle C regulation, either because they are wastewater
treatment tanks exempt from regulation under   264.1(g)(6) and 265.1(c)(10), because they are recycling
units not covered by the Subpart AA or BB regulations (i.e., are not ``distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation,
solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation'', see   264.1030(b), 264.1050(b), 265.1030(b),
and 265.1050(b)) and otherwise exempt from regulation under  261.6(c)(1), or because they manage materials
exempt from regulation under  261.6(a)(3) (iv), (v) and (vi).

2. Used Oil 


Today's rule does not affect petroleum facilities' obligations under the Used Oil Rule. See generally, 57 FR 41566
(September 10, 1992) and 59 FR 1994 (March 4, 1994). Today's rule excludes from RCRA Subtitle C requirements only recovered
oil as described. Whether or not recovered oil excluded under today's rule is subject to the used oil management standards
depends on whether or not the recovered oil does or does not also meet the definition of used oil. 

Id. 

The Agency recently issued a final used oil rule on March 4, 1994 (see 59 FR 10550) which affects the definition of used
oil and deals with issues similar to those in today's rule. According to this final used oil rule, 

de minimis 

quantities of used oil that are incidentally captured by a refinery's wastewater treatment system and subsequently
recovered along with other oil in a refinery's recovered oil system are not regulated as used oil. 59 FR 10550 (March
4, 1994). 



D. Enforcement; Effect of Today's Final Rule on RCRA 3007, 3013, 7002 and 7003 Authorities 



EPA's action today affects only the final regulatory definition of solid waste. It does not interpret the scope of
the term ``solid waste'' for purposes of the non-regulatory authorities in RCRA Sections 3007, 3013, 7002 and 7003.
See 40 CFR  261.1(b). Thus, for purposes of those authorities, the Agency (or citizens in the case of citizen
suits under Section 7002(a)(1)(B)) would have the benefit of the full jurisdictional reach of the statutory definition
of solid waste. See 

Comite Pro Rescate de la Salud v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority

, 888 F. 2d 180, 185 (1st Cir. 1989), 

cert. denied

, 494 U.S. 1029 (1990) (upholding reasonableness of applying narrower definition for regulatory purposes than for
purposes of imminent and substantial endangerment authority);
