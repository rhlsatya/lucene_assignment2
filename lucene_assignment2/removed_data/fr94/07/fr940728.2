<USBUREAU>Forest Service</USBUREAU>



<DOCTITLE>Sensitive Plant Program; Eldorado National Forest, CA </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Eldorado National Forest proposes to refine existing sensitive plant direction in order to provide greater specificity,
promote program effectiveness, and improve the efficiency in which Eldorado National Forest programs and activities
are reviewed through the biological evaluation process as required under FSM  2670.32. 



The Forest Service will prepare an environment impact statement (EIS) to consider the ramifications of implementing
species-specific standards and guidelines for the sensitive plant species found on the Eldorado National Forest.
The decision may include the following: an amendment to the 

Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan

 and/or the delisting of one or more species as sensitive. The agency invites written comments and suggestions on the
scope of the analysis. The agency also gives notice of the full environmental analysis and decision-making process
that will occur on the proposal so that interested ad affected people are aware of how they may participate and contribute
to the final decision. 

 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

USDA regulations (9500-4), Forest Service policy, and the 

Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan 

(1989) require that the Eldorado National Forest maintain the viability of sensitive plant species. Direction is
provided (FSM 2670.22) to ``develop and implement management practices to ensure that species do not become threatened
or endangered because of Forest Service actions.'' Additional policy includes (FSM 2670.32): 





Establish management objectives in cooperation with the States when projects on National Forest System lands may
have significant effect on sensitive species population numbers or distributions. Establish objectives for Federal
Candidate species, in cooperation with FWS or NMFS and the States. 




When the 

Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan 

was approved, little was known about the habitat requirements of the ten sensitive plant species thought to occur
on the Forest. General Direction in the 

Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan 

was limited to the following (p.4-91): 




Provide for protection and habitat needs of sensitive plants so that Forest activities will not jeopardize the continued
existence of such species. 




One Standard/Guideline applies: 




Participate in the implementation of approved species recovery plans and Species Management Guides as specified
for the Eldorado. 




Since that time, a considerable amount of information has been gathered about the habitat requirements of the eight
species documented to occur on the Forest. The Forest now has sufficient information on the range, distribution,
and status of six of these species to enable the development of species-specific conservation strategies. The species
to be considered are: 

Calochortus clavatus 

var. 

avius 

(Pleasant Valley mariposa lily), 

Draba asterophora 

var. 

macrocarpa 

(Cup Lake draba), 

Lewisia longipetala 

(long-petaled lewisia), 

Lewisia serrata 

(saw-toothed lewisia), 

Navarretia prolifera 

ssp. 

lutea 

(yellow-bur navarretia), 

Phacelia stebbinsii 

(Stebbins' phacelia), 

Silene invisa 

(short-petaled campion), and 

Arctostaphylos nissenana

 (Nissenan manzanita). 

There are no known permits or licenses required to implement the proposed action. 

Preliminary issues identified during internal scoping include: 

1. How will current and future habitat options for sensitive plant species be managed to address Forest Service requirements
(CFR 219.19) to maintain viability? 

2. What will be the economic consequences of implementing mitigation measures for sensitive plant species?

3. Should plants species that are managed under the provisions of conservation agreements and/or standards and guidelines
still be listed as sensitive?

4. How will fuel conditions that have a high probability of contributing to catastrophic fire behavior be affected
by sensitive plant management practices? 

5. Will other land uses be constrained or altered?

<TEXT>
 

6. Will species-specific standards and guidelines improve the efficiency of Forest project planning and implementation?

7. Will the efficiency and effectiveness of the Forest sensitive plant program improve?

Based on the preliminary issues listed above and other issues that may be developed, the Forest Service will identify
and consider a range of alternatives for managing sensitive plant species. These alternatives will include a no action
alternative (continuing with existing 

Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan 

direction). Other alternatives to consider may include implementation of species-specific standards and guidelines
and/or delisting one or more of the species under consideration. These preliminary alternatives may be revised before
the draft EIS is issued as new information is developed or new comments are received:

Public participation will be especially important at several points during the analysis. The first point is during
the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7).

The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from federal, state, and local agencies
and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed project. This input will
be used in preparation of the draft EIS. The scoping process includes:

1. Defining the scope of the analysis and nature of the decision to be made.

2. Identifying the issues and determining the significant issues for consideration and analysis within the EIS.

3. Defining the proper interdisciplinary team make-up.

4. Determining the effective use of time and money in conducting the analysis.

5. Identifying potential environmental, technical, and social impacts of the EIS and alternatives.

6. Determining potential cooperating agencies.

7. Identifying groups or individuals interested or affected by the decision.

John Phipps, Forest Supervisor, Eldorado National Forest, is the responsible official.

The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public
review in September 1994. At that time, EPA will publish a notice of availability of the draft EIS in the 

Federal Register

. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date that EPA's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewers's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). 

Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage, but that
are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the
courts. 

City of Angoon v. Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) 

and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980).

Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by
the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest
Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality. Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the
National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

After the comment period ends on the draft EIS, the comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in
preparing the final EIS. The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by January 1994. In the final EIS the Forest Service
is required to respond to the comments and responses received (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official will consider
the comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the draft EIS; and applicable laws, regulations,
and policies in making a decision regarding this project. If a decision is made to amend the Land and Resource Management
Plan, the responsible official will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision.
That decision will be subject to appeal pursuant to 36 CFR part 215.

United States Price


For Enlin, we calculated USP according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the following
exceptions: 
1. We revised inland freight, ocean freight and packing case cost to incorporate the average weight of cross pipe fittings
as determined during verification because Enlin did not do so as requested by the Department. (

See 

Comment 1.) 
2. We disregarded cancelled sales which were included in the sales listing. 
3. For those sales with updated payment and/or shipment dates which were not incorporated into the final computer
tape submission, we recalculated the imputed credit expenses based on the weighted-average difference between
payment and shipment dates for those sales which were both shipped and paid for during the POI. For the associated expenses,
we calculated a product specific weighted average. 
For Ta Chen, we calculated USP according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the
following exceptions: 
1. We estimated the appropriate shipment date for U.S. purchase price sales which had an incorrect shipment date reported.
(

See 

Comment 3.) 
2. We recalculated imputed credit for purchase price sales based on amended shipment dates that were improperly reported
and by using the lower of two U.S. interest rates available to Ta Chen. (

See 

Comment 3 and 4 below.)
3. We recalculated U.S. inventory carrying costs on a warehouse-specific basis taking into account the amended interest
rate noted in item 2. 
4. For ESP sales made from all U.S. warehouses, we recalculated the movement expenses and bank charges based on expenses
incurred on shipments that were made during the POI rather than on expenses incurred on shipments made twelve months
prior to the POI.
For Yih Tai, we calculated USP according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the
following exceptions:
1. We recalculated packing based on revisions to packing labor as determined at the cost verifications.


Foreign Market Value


As stated in our preliminary determination, we determined that the home market was not viable for sales of SST pipe
fittings made by either Enlin and Yih Tai. We selected Canada as the third-country market basis for FMV for both Enlin
and Yih Tai. We found the home market viable for sales of SST pipe fittings made by Ta Chen. We calculated FMV as noted
in the ``Price-to-Price Comparisons'' and ``Price to Constructed Value (CV)'' sections of this notice.


Cost of Production


As stated in our preliminary determination, the Department initiated a cost investigation based on reasonable grounds
to believe or suspect that Enlin, Ta Chen, and Yih Tai's home market/third country sales were made at prices below their
respective cost of production (COP). We received responses to our cost questionnaires and verified the submitted
data.

We calculated COP based on the sum of the individual respondent's reported cost of materials, fabrication, general
expenses, and home market packing. For each company, we derived selling expenses from its respective home market
or third country sales listing, as appropriate. We added home market packing expenses derived from the respective
sales listing. 

For Enlin, we relied on the submitted COP. 

For Ta Chen, we relied on the submitted COP information, except in the following instances where the costs were not
appropriately quantified or valued: 

1. We recalculated cost of manufacturing (COM) by reducing Ta Chen's submitted conversion costs for packing materials
and labor as presented and verified during the cost verification. 

2. We recalculated Ta Chen's COM by reducing the reported materials costs for scrap revenues received during the POI
as presented and verified during the cost verification. 

3. As a result of reducing COM for packing material, packing labor, and material scrap revenue, we recalculated Ta
Chen's general and administrative expense using the revised COM figure in the calculation. 

4. We reclassified a percentage of Ta Chen's president's salary from general and administrative expenses to indirect
selling expenses because a portion of the president's time was devoted solely to sales. 

For Yih Tai, we relied on the submitted COP information, except in the following instances where the costs were not
appropriately quantified or valued: 

1. We adjusted the packing labor expense, which was understated in the submission, to reflect the verified amount.


2. We adjusted the allocation basis to include all products for the machine revenue received from the machining subcontractor.




B. Test of Home Market/Third Country Sale Prices 



After calculating COP, we tested whether home market or third country sales of SST pipe fittings were at prices below
COP over an extended period of time, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act. 

We compared model-specific COP to reported prices that were net of movement charges, and where appropriate, discounts,
and rebates. If over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices above the COP, we did not disregard
any below-cost sales because we determined that the respondent's below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities.
If between ten and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices above the COP, we discarded only
the below-cost sales if made over an extended period of time. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's
sales of a given product were at prices below the COP, we disregarded all sales for that model and calculated FMV based
on constructed value (CV). 

In order to determine whether below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time, we performed the following
analysis on a product-specific basis: (1) if a respondent sold a product in only one month of the POI and there were sales
in that month below the COP, or (2) if a respondent sold a product during two months or more of the POI and there were sales
below the COP during two or more of those months, then below-cost sales were considered to have been made over an extended
period of time. 



C. Results of COP Test 



For Ta Chen and Yih Tai, we did not find any sales below cost. 

For Enlin, we determined that there were sales below cost, and disregarded those sales. Where more than 90 percent
of the sales of a particular model were below cost we based FMV for that model on CV. 



Price-to-Price Comparisons 



For those products for which we had an adequate number of sales at prices equal to or greater than the COP, we based FMV
on home market or third country prices, as appropriate. 

For Enlin, we calculated FMV according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the following
exceptions: 

1. We treated duty drawback as it was reported after verifying that Enlin only received duty drawback on its sales to
the U.S. and not on its sales to Canada. 

2. We disregarded cancelled sales which were included in the sales listing. 

3. We revised inland freight, ocean freight and packing case cost to incorporate the average weight of cross pipe fittings
as determined during verification because Enlin did not do so as requested by the Department. (See Comment 1.) 

4. For those sales with updated payment and/or shipment dates which were not incorporated into the final computer
tape submission, we recalculated the imputed credit expenses based on the weighted-average difference between
payment and shipment dates for those sales which were both shipped and paid for during the POI. For the associated expenses,
we calculated a product specific weighted average. 

For Ta Chen, we calculated FMV according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the
following exceptions: 

1. We treated home market freight as a circumstance of sale adjustment in light of the Court of Appeals of the Federal
Circuit's (CAFC) decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement

 v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), which held that the Department may no longer deduct home market
movement charges from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead adjusted
for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the exporter's sales price offset
provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1) and (2), as appropriate. 

2. We made a circumstance of sale adjustment for certain mailing charges brought to the Department's attention prior
to verification. 

For Yih Tai, we calculated FMV according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the
following exceptions: 

1. We recalculated packing based on revisions to packing labor found at the cost verifications. 



Price to CV Comparisons 



For Enlin's products without an adequate number of sales at prices above the COP, we based FMV on CV. We calculated CV
based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and U.S. packing cost. In accordance with
section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act we: (1) included the higher of the respondent's reported general expenses
or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM, as appropriate and; (2) for profit, we used the higher of the statutory
minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses or the actual profit incurred as calculated on a market
specific basis. 

We calculated CV based on the information submitted by Enlin, except in the following instances where the costs were
not appropriately quantified or valued:

<TEXT>
 

1. For CV, we recalculated profit based on revised general administrative and interest expense rates provided at
verification. 

In instances where we compared Enlin's U.S. prices to CV, we made deductions, where appropriate, for the weighted-average
home market or third country direct selling expenses as appropriate. 



Currency Conversion 



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 



Verification 



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we verified information provided by Enlin, Ta Chen and Yih Tai by using standard
verification procedures, including the examination of relevant sales and financial records, and selection of original
source documentation containing relevant information. 



Interested Party Comments 





Comment 1: 

Enlin contends that certain corrections requested by the Department, to revise certain expenses affected by a change
in the reporting of weight of cross-shaped fittings, should be disregarded as insignificant under 19 CFR 353.59.
 


DOC Position: 

We disagree with Enlin. The Department has discretion under 19 CFR 353.59(a) to disregard insignificant adjustments.
However, in this case we have sufficient verified information to revise these related expenses and have done so for
the final determination. 



Comment 2: 

Enlin contends that its profit calculation, which was provided in its April 21, 1994, response to the Department's
Section D deficiency letter, should be updated to reflect changes made to COP based on the use of 1993 audited financial
statement information in the calculation of general and administrative and interest expense. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with Enlin. At verification, Enlin updated its general expense figure to reflect the audited 1993 figures,
as opposed to the 1992 figures used in the original calculation. Therefore, the Department adjusted Enlin's submitted
profit percentage to reflect the changes made to Enlin's general expenses.
 


Comment 3: 

At verification, the Department noted that Ta Chen incorrectly reported the date of shipment for its U.S. purchase
price sales. Ta Chen reported the date the SST pipe fittings were exported rather than the date the SST pipe fittings
were shipped from the factory. Ta Chen requests that, when the Department makes an adjustment to its reported date
of shipment, based on the average time between shipment and export of specific sales examined at verification, it
should not take into account one shipment in particular because it was shipped in an atypical manner. 



DOC Position: 

We disagree with respondent. At verification, the Department selected a number of U.S. purchase price sales and noted
the period between shipment and export for most of the sales examined. The Department's observations were made on
Ta Chen's actual experience. We found no indication that the shipment in question was unusual or distortive. Accordingly,
we have included this shipment in calculating the average lag time between factory shipment and export in order to
estimate shipment dates for Ta Chen's U.S. purchase price sales. For those sales specifically examined at verification,
we used the actual lag time noted. 



Comment 4: 

Ta Chen claims that the Department should not use the interest rate available to its U.S. subsidiary, TCI, to calculate
imputed credit for its purchase price sales because Ta Chen receives lower U.S. denominated financing specifically
for these sales. Ta Chen further argues that to use TCI's interest rate for purchase price sales would be inconsistent
with 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Certain Forged Steel Crankshafts from the United Kingdom, 

(52 FR 32951 (September 1, 1987) (

Crankshafts

). 

At verification, the Department noted that TCI receives payment from the U.S. customer for purchase price sales and
reimburses Ta Chen for the price of the merchandise. Ta Chen argues that it bears the burden of TCI's costs for purchase
price sales and thus it is appropriate to use the Taiwan interest rate for U.S. dollar borrowing.
 


DOC Position: 

We agree with respondent that the U.S. dollar interest rate at which Ta Chen borrowed in the home market is the most appropriate
for U.S. purchase price sales, but for a reason other than that expressed in 

Crankshafts. 

In 

Crankshafts, 

the Department stated that its policy at that time was to use the home market interest rate to compute credit for U.S.
purchase price sales where respondent did not receive U.S. dollar denominated financing. However, in accordance
with, 

United Engineering and Forging 

v. 

United States 

779 F. Supp. 1375, 1386-7 (CIT 1991) and 

LMI La Metalli Industriale, S.p.A. 

v. 

United States 

912 F.2d 455 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the Department is required to use the lowest rate at which the respondent has borrowed
or to which the respondent has access. 

See Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain
Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length
Carbon Steel Plate from Canada, 

59 Fed. Reg. 37099, 37113 (1993). Ta Chen, as a whole, had access to U.S. dollar funding at two interest rates. Accordingly,
it is reasonable to assume that Ta Chen would have been able to borrow at the lower rate. Therefore, we used the lower
U.S. dollar borrowing rate for both ESP and PP sales, in this case Ta Chen's home market borrowing rate for U.S. dollars.




Comment 5: 

Ta Chen contends that conversion costs used in its calculation of COM included the labor and material cost of packing,
which was recorded separately in Ta Chen's submitted costs. Ta Chen claims that these packing labor and material costs
are double counted, as both packing and COM, and thus should be removed from COM. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with Ta Chen. At verification, the Department verified that the packing labor and material costs had been
included in Ta Chen's reported conversion costs used in the calculation of COM. In order to avoid double counting these
costs as both packing and COM, we reduced COM by the packing labor and material amounts reported. 



Comment 6: 

Ta Chen states that it allocated total material input costs over good product produced, without adjusting for revenue
received from the sale of scrap generated in production. Ta Chen claims that the Department should thus reduce reported
material costs to account for revenue from the sale of scrap. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with Ta Chen. At verification, the Department was able to confirm the amount of scrap sales during the POI and
the fact that they had not been included as a reduction of Ta Chen's material costs when calculating COM.
 


Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation 



We are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of Class 150 Stainless Steel
Pipe Fittings from Taiwan, except for those of Ta Chen and Yih Tai, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption on or after March 8, 1994, the date of publication of our preliminary determination in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV
of the merchandise subject to this investigation exceeds the U.S. price, as shown below. This suspension of liquidation
will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: 





ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the U.S. International Trade Commission of our determination.




Notification to Interested Parties 



This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. This determination is published pursuant to section
735(d) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4).

 Minority Business Development Agency.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications to operate its Chicago Minority Enterprise Growth Assistance (MEGA) Center. 



The purpose of the MEGA Center is to provide integrated business development services to minority entrepreneurs
in geographic areas containing high concentrations of minority individuals and businesses. In addition to basic
business assistance services, the center will provide specialized assistance in the areas of Construction Assistance
and Bonding, Capital Development, Franchise Development, International Trade and Tourism Development. Each one
of these specialized business areas are considered functional components, and serve as integral parts of the center.
The MEGA Center is, therefore, equipped to meet the more complex business needs of the minority business community.
This, in turn, is expected to create growing and more profitable ventures resulting in increased job opportunities.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (15 months)
from January 1, 1995 through March 31, 1996 is $1,343,158 in Federal funds and a minimum of $237,028 (15%) in non-federal
(cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $1,580,186. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form
of cash contributions, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions, or combinations
thereof. The Chicago MEGA Center will provide service in the Chicago Metropolitan Area with selected services throughout
the States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin. The
award number of this MEGA Center will be 05-10-95002-01. 



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.


Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: Applicant capability in addressing the needs of the business
community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses, individuals and organizations
(45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing business development services (10 points); the firm's
approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included in the application (25 points);
and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application must receive at least 70%
of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive.
Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final
award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant,
and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and
recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being
considered for funding. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award. 

The MEGA Center shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MEGA Center may choose to charge client fees for business services rendered. Fees for
assistance rendered under the Basic Service Component of the MEGA Center range from $10.00 to $60.00 per hour based
on the size of the client's business. Fees for assistance under the Market-Specialized Service Components of the
MEGA Center may be based on a portion of the current market rate for such services. 

If an application is selected for funding, MBDA has no obligation to provide any additional future funding in connection
with that award. Renewal of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance is at the total discretion
of MBDA. 

Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. The
collection of information requirements for this project have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006. Questions concerning the preceding information can be answered
by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application kits and applicable regulations can be obtained
at the above address.

or financial integrity. 



Award Termination_

The Departmental Grants Officer may terminate any cooperative agreement in whole or in part at any time before the
date of completion whenever it is determined that the award recipient has failed to comply with the conditions of the
cooperative agreement. Examples of some of the conditions which can cause termination are failure to meet cost-sharing
requirements; unsatisfactory performance of the MEGA Center work requirements; and reporting inaccurate or inflated
claims of client assistance. Such inaccurate or inflated claims may be deemed illegal and punishable by law. 



False Statements_

A false statement on an application for Federal financial assistance is grounds for denial or termination of funds,
and grounds for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Defense Manpower Data Center, Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Defense.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a new computer matching program between the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and the Department
of Defense (DoD) for public comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Subsection (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a) requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any proposed or revised computer matching program by the matching agency for public comment. The DoD, as the matching
agency under the Privacy Act is hereby giving constructive notice in lieu of direct notice to the record subjects of
a computer matching program between DFAS and DoD that their records are being matched by computer. The record subjects
are DFAS delinquent debtors who may be current or former Federal employees receiving Federal salary or benefit payments
and who are delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to the United States Government under programs administered
by DFAS so as to permit DFAS to pursue and collect the debt by voluntary repayment or by administrative or salary offset
procedures under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to subsection (o) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the DMDC and DFAS have concluded
an agreement to conduct a computer matching program between the agencies. The purpose of the match is to exchange personal
data between the agencies for debt collection. The match will yield the identity and location of the debtors within
the Federal government so that DFAS can pursue recoupment of the debt by voluntary payment or by administrative or
salary offset procedures. Computer matching appeared to be the most efficient and effective manner to accomplish
this task with the least amount of intrusion of personal privacy of the individuals concerned. It was therefore concluded
and agreed upon that computer matching would be the best and least obtrusive manner and choice for accomplishing this
requirement.


A copy of the computer matching memorandum of understanding between DFAS and DMDC is available upon request to the
public. Requests should be submitted to the address caption above or to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service,
(DFAS-DE/FYSA), 6760 E. Irvington Place, Denver, CO 80279-7000. Telephone (303) 655-0400.
Set forth below is the notice of the establishment of a computer matching program required by paragraph 6.c. of the
Office of Management and Budget Guidelines on computer matching published in the 

Federal Register

 at 54 FR 25818 on June 19, 1989.
The matching memorandum of understanding, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, and an advance copy of
this notice was submitted on July 15, 1994, to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives,
the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Office of Management and Budget pursuant to paragraph 4d of Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A-130, `Federal
Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records about Individuals,' dated June 25, 1993 (58 FR 36075, July 2, 1993).
The matching program is subject to review by OMB and Congress and shall not become effective until that review period
has elapsed.



Dated: July 20, 1994.

S322.11 DMDC, entitled `Federal Creditor Agency Debt Collection Data Base,' last published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 22, 1993, at 58 FR 10875. 

Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection Act authorize agencies to disclose information about debtors in order to effect
salary or administrative offsets. Agencies must publish routine uses pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of the Privacy
Act for those systems of records from which they intend to disclose this information. Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection
Act will comprise the necessary authority to meet the Privacy Act's `compatibility' condition. The systems of records
described above contain an appropriate routine use disclosure between the agencies of the information proposed
in the match. The routine use provisions are compatible with the purpose for which the information was collected.





E. 

Description of computer matching program: 

The DFAS, as the source agency, will provide DMDC with a magnetic tape which contains the names of delinquent debtors
in programs the DOD administers. Upon receipt of the computer tape file of debtor accounts, DMDC will perform a computer
match using all nine digits of the SSN of the DFAS file against a DMDC computer database. The DMDC database, established
under an interagency agreement between DOD, OPM, OMB, and the Department of the Treasury, consists of employment
records of Federal employees and military members, active, and retired. Matching records (`hits'), based on the
SSN, will produce the member's name, service or agency, category of employee, and current work or home address. The
hits or matches will be furnished to the DFAS. The DFAS is responsible for verifying and determining that the data on
the DMDC reply tape file are consistent with the DFAS source file and for resolving any discrepancies or inconsistencies
on an individual basis. The DFAS will also be responsible for making final determinations as to positive identification,
amount of indebtedness and recovery efforts as a result of the match.

The magnetic computer tape provided by DFAS will contain data elements of the debtor's name, SSN, debtor status and
debt balance, internal account numbers and the total amount owed on approximately 100,000 delinquent debtors.

The DMDC computer database file contains approximately 11 million records of active duty and retired military members,
including the Reserve and Guard, and the OPM government wide Federal civilian records of current and retired Federal
employees.

DMDC will match the SSN on the DFAS tape by computer against the DMDC database. Matching records, hits based on SSN,
will produce data elements of the member's name, SSN, service or agency, and current work or home address.





F. 

Inclusive dates of the matching program: 

This computer matching program is subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget and Congress. If no objections
are raised by either, and the mandatory 30 day public notice period for comment has expired for this 

Federal Register

 notice with no significant adverse public comments in receipt resulting in a contrary determination, then this computer
matching program becomes effective and the respective agencies may begin the exchange of data 30 days after the date
of this published notice at a mutually agreeable time and will be repeated annually. Under no circumstances shall
the matching program be implemented before the 30 day public notice period for comment has elapsed as this time period
cannot be waived. By agreement between DFAS and DMDC, the matching program will be in effect and continue for 18 months
with an option to renew for 12 additional months unless one of the parties to the agreement advises the other by written
request to terminate or modify the agreement.




G. 

Address for receipt of public comments or inquiries: 

Director, Defense Privacy Office, Crystal Mall 4, Room 920, 1941 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202-4502.
Telephone (703) 607-2943.

<DOCTITLE>Arbitration Panel Decision Under the Randolph-Sheppard Act </DOCTITLE>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Arbitration Panel Decision Under the Randolph-Sheppard Act. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that on March 22, 1991, an arbitration panel rendered a decision in the matter of 

David Everett, Vendor, 

v. 

State of Tennessee, Department of Human Services

 (Docket No. R-S/89-6). This panel was convened by the Secretary of the Department of Education pursuant
to 20 U.S.C. 107d-2, upon receipt of a complaint filed by petitioner David Everett. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. 107d-2(c)), (the Act), the Secretary publishes a synopsis
of arbitration panel decisions affecting the administration of vending facilities on Federal property. 



Background 



David Everett, complainant, is a blind vendor licensed by the respondent, the Tennessee Department of Human Services
(TDHS). Mr. Everett signed an agreement with TDHS to operate vending machines located in the County Building in Knoxville,
Tennessee, on September 20, 1983. 

The State licensing agency (SLA), through its Department of Rehabilitation, operates the Tennessee Vending Facility
Program for blind vendors. The purpose of the program is to establish and support blind vendors operating vending
facilities on State, local, and Federal property. As the agency designated in Tennessee to carry out and manage the
vending facility program established by the Act, the SLA duly promulgated rules and regulations to govern the State
vending facility program. These rules and regulations are comprehensive in scope. Based on the State's Randolph-Sheppard
rules and regulations governing its program, Mr. Everett was required to make monthly income reports, paying a set-aside
fee based upon those monthly reports. 

On January 11, 1988, Mr. Everett's Business Enterprise Program (BEP) counselor wrote him regarding his report and
fees, advising him that he had not filed reports for July through December, nor had he paid his fees. Mr. Everett was
given until January 25, 1988, to file the reports or be recommended for probation. Mr. Everett did not respond and,
on February 1, 1988, was placed on probation. Mr. Everett was given 30 days to comply with the requirements to file the
reports and pay the fees. Failure to do so would result in the termination of his license. Mr. Everett again failed to
respond to the probation letter. 

On March 8, 1988, Mr. Everett received his letter of license termination. This notification allowed Mr. Everett 30
additional days to comply with the stated requirements. Mr. Everett attempted to comply by mailing a certified check
in the amount of $1,033 to the SLA and agreed to mail the reports once corrections were made, even though the reports
would be a day late. After discussion with his BEP counselor, Mr. Everett assumed this arrangement was satisfactory.
However, his BEP counselor stated that she had not agreed to this arrangement. 

On April 13, 1988, Mr. Everett was informed that his license was terminated and that a final inventory would be made
of his vending machine facility. At this time he was notified that fees were delinquent in the amount of $1,466.85.


On May 10, 1988, Mr. Everett filed for an administrative review and an evidentiary fair hearing of his termination.
The SLA neither granted nor denied the request for the administrative hearing but did proceed with the evidentiary
fair hearing. 

Mr. Everett sought financial relief for what he would have earned had he not been terminated, reinstatement into the
program, and attorney's fees. The TDHS Commissioner denied relief on all grounds. 

Mr. Everett filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education requesting arbitration regarding his termination.
A hearing was conducted September 21, 1990. 




Arbitration Panel Decision 




In the substantive issues in this case, the panel found that the SLA was in error in terminating Mr. Everett's license
because he had made a good faith effort to pay his fees and file the report after March 8, 1988. 

The panel concluded that Mr. Everett should be reinstated with back pay to the program in a facility reasonably equivalent
to the one he left. Mr. Everett's testimony that he netted $1,500 a month was not contradicted. However, because of
his long-standing delinquency in failing to file reports and pay his fees and his failure to make a more timely response
to the probation and termination letters, the panel found that Mr. Everett is due less than a full award. The panel found
Mr. Everett was due back pay in the amount of $27,500, less fees he owes the SLA in full and less his interim earnings in
full. The panel also concluded that attorney's fees may not be allowed. 

The panel member selected by the SLA filed a dissenting opinion in which he maintained that the State was entitled to
the sovereign immunity embodied in the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution_an immunity the State
did not waive by participating in the Randolph-Sheppard program. This panelist concluded that the State was, therefore,
not liable for monetary damages. 

The views and opinions expressed by the panel do not necessarily represent the views and opinions of the U.S. Department
of Education.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Savannah River Operations Office, DOE.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The DOE announces that it plans to award a renewal grant to South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control
(SCDHEC), 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, SC 29201. The grant, ``Emergency Response and Environmental Monitoring at
the Savannah River Site (SRS)'' will be awarded for a five-year period at a projected funding level of $17.4 million.
Funds of $3,360,000 are available for the first budget period, and subject to the availability of funds, the remainder
will be awarded thereafter. Pursuant to Section 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(C) of the DOE Assistance Regulations (10 CFR
Part 600), DOE has determined that a noncompetitive award is appropriate since SCDHEC is the authorized regulatory
agency qualified to perform the activities covered under the grant within the subject jurisdiction.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Procurement Request Number: 

09-94SR18265.001.



Project Scope: 

The proposed renewal grant allows the State of South Carolina to set up and maintain a program to oversee the environmental
monitoring and emergency/planning preparedness compliance programs at the SRS. Activities of the SCDHEC are intended
to supplement activities conducted under applicable environmental laws and regulations but do not include legally
required environmental oversight activities or required regulatory inspections. The emergency preparedness/planning
activities have been conducted under an existing grant with SCDHEC; however, this amendment will combine oversight
of environmental monitoring and emergency preparedness activities at the SRS under one grant.

Based on documentation presented and appropriate evaluation, it is determined that this award to SCDHEC on a noncompetitive
basis is appropriate and is in the best interest of DOE.

<DOCTITLE>Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



July 22, 1994.



Take notice that on July 20, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle) tendered for filing Ninth Revised
Tariff Sheet Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 which are proposed to become effective August 1, 1994.

Panhandle states that its filing implements, in accordance with Section 18.7 of the General Terms and Conditions
of First Revised Volume No. 1 of Panhandle's FERC Gas Tariff, the recovery of certain of its Gas Supply Realignment
(GSR) Costs by means of GSR Reservation Surcharges applicable to service under Rate Schedules FT, EFT and SCT and the
comparable component applicable to interruptible rates under Rate Schedules IT and EIT.

Panhandle states that the costs included for recovery herein are costs which resulted from Panhandle having to terminate
and assign its existing gas supply contracts in connection with implementing Order No. 636, et seq., which, among
other things, required Panhandle to restructure its services and operations to provide its sales customers the choice
of reducing and terminating their obligations under their existing sales contract.

Panhandle states that the costs encompassed by its filing, which total $14,368,766, consist of actual payments made
by Panhandle for terminations and assignments of its gas supply contracts, all of which became stranded upon the termination
of Panhandle's merchant function in conjunction with customer elections under 18 CFR 284.14(d). Also included are
certain Account No. 165 costs incurred for what would have been recappable take-or-pay had Panhandle continued its
merchant function and the unrecovered balance of a take-or-pay buyout and buydown agreement which had been subject
to a three year amortization. These latter gas supply transition costs also became stranded upon the termination
of Panhandle's merchant function.

Panhandle states that the amounts included for recovery as GSR Reservation Surcharges under Rate Schedules FT, EFT
and SCT and the amounts included for recovery under Rate Schedules IT and EIT have been calculated using the methods
set forth in Section 18.7 of the General Terms and Conditions of its Tariff and are consistent with the Commission's
orders and pronouncements regarding the recovery of GSR Costs. Carrying charges have been calculated in accordance
with Section 154.67(c) of the Commission's Regulations and Section 18.7 of Panhandle's Tariff. 

Panhandle states that a copy of this filing has been served on all customers affected by this filing and the respective
state commissions.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest the filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
July 29, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but
will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public
Reference Room.

Title: Radon Measurement Protocol Evaluation Study (EPA ICR 

#

1703.01). This ICR requests approval of a new collection.

Abstract: A statistically valid sample of homeowners who participated in the National Residential Radon Survey
will be selected to participate in a follow-up study to measure year-long household exposure to radon. The EPA will
use the results to validate the mathematical model used in preparing public information documents on radon such as
the Citizen's Guide to Radon and the Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon. In addition, the results will be available
in the Agency's national radon database and will be used in articles for publication in scientific journals.

Homeowners will place radon detectors in specified locations in their homes, replace them quarterly for a year, and
prepare a log of placement/replacement dates and times. EPA labs and contractors will analyze the detectors and provide
homeowners with the results.

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Application for Extension of the Reformulated Gasoline Program to the Kentucky portions of the Louisville
and the Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone non-attainment areas. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice publishes the application by the Governor of the state of Kentucky to have the prohibition set forth in
section 211(k)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, (the Act) applied to the Kentucky portions of the Louisville and
Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone non-attainment areas. Under section 211(k)(6) the Administrator of EPA shall apply
the prohibition against the sale of gasoline which has not been reformulated to be less polluting in an ozone nonattainment
area upon the application of the governor of the state in which the nonattainment area is located. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


As part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Congress added a new subsection (k) to section 211 of the Clean Air Act.
Subsection (k) prohibits the sale of gasoline that EPA has not certified as reformulated in the nine worst ozone nonattainment
areas beginning January 1, 1995. To be certified as reformulated a gasoline must comply with the following formula
requirements: oxygen content of at least 2.0 percent by weight; benzene content of no more than 1.0 percent by volume;
and no heavy metals (with a possible waiver for metals other than lead). The gasoline must also achieve toxic and volatile
organic compound emissions reductions equal to or exceeding the more stringent of a specified formula fuel or a performance
standard. 
Section 211(k)(10)(D) defines the areas covered by the reformulated gasoline program as the nine ozone nonattainment
areas having a 1980 population in excess of 250,000 and having the highest ozone design values during the period 1987
through 1989. Applying those criteria, EPA has determined the nine covered areas to be the metropolitan areas including
Los Angeles, Houston, New York City, Baltimore, Chicago, San Diego, Philadelphia, Hartford and Milwaukee. Under
section 211(k)(10)(D), any area reclassified as a severe ozone nonattainment area under section 181(b) is also to
be included in the reformulated gasoline program. 

Any other ozone nonattainment area may be included in the program at the request of the governor of the state in which
the area is located. Section 211(k)(6)(A) provides that upon the application of a Governor, EPA shall apply the prohibition
against selling conventional gasoline (gasoline EPA has not certified as reformulated) in any area requested by
the Governor which has been classified under subpart 2 of part D of title I of the Act as a Marginal, Moderate, Serious
or Severe ozone nonattainment area.

1

 Subparagraph 211(k)(6)(A) further provides that EPA is to apply the prohibition as of the date the Administrator
``deems appropriate, not later than January 1, 1995, or 1 year after such application is received, whichever is later.''
In some cases the effective date may be extended for such an area as provided in section 211(k)(6)(B) based on a determination
by EPA that there is ``insufficient domestic capacity to produce'' reformulated gasoline. Finally, EPA is to publish
a governor's application in the 

Federal Register

. To date, EPA has received and published applications from the Mayor of the District of Columbia and the Governors
of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Texas. Although Vermont has requested to opt-in to the program, states without
ozone nonattainment areas, such as Vermont, can not do so.

EPA published final regulations for the reformulated gasoline program on February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7716). 


II. The Governor's Request 


EPA received an application from the Hon. Brereton C. Jones, Governor of the State of Kentucky, for the Kentucky portions
of the Louisville and the Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone non-attainment areas to be included in the reformulated gasoline
program. His application is set out in full below. 


[State of Kentucky letterhead] 


September 19, 1993. 


Ms. Carol Browner, 
Administrator, 


U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
401 M Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20460

 

Dear Ms. Browner: In accordance with Section 211(k), (6)(A) of the Federal Clean Air Act, I request that, beginning
January 1, 1995, the prohibition applying to the sale of conventional gasoline be extended to the Kentucky portion
of the Louisville ozone non-attainment area and the Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone non-attainment
area. The Kentucky portion of the Louisville non-attainment area consists of Jefferson County and a portion of Bullitt
and Oldham Counties. The Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati ozone non-attainment area consists of Boone, Campbell
and Kenton Counties. 
The Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet recommended that I apply to you to require the
use of reformulated gasoline in these counties in order to help achieve the reduction of volatile organic compounds
mandated in Section 182(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act. The revision to Kentucky's State Implementation Plan for achieving
a 15% reduction of volatile organic compounds due by November 15, 1993 will include emission reductions gained by
the use of reformulated gasoline. 



   Sincerely, 


<SIGNER>


Brereton C. Jones. 



III. Action 


Pursuant to the governor's letter and the provisions of section 211(k)(6), the prohibitions of subsection 211(k)(5)
will be applied to the Kentucky portions of the Louisville and Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone non-attainment areas beginning
January 1, 1995 (unless delayed, as provided above). The Kentucky 
portion of the Louisville non-attainment area consists of Jefferson County and a portion of Bullitt and Oldham Counties.
The Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati ozone non-attainment area consists of Boone, Campbell and Kenton Counties.
These ozone nonattainment areas are classified as moderate.

2

 




Based on the governor's application, EPA's final rule for reformulated gasoline included these areas as covered
area (40 CFR 80.70(j)).

3

 




The application of the prohibitions to the Kentucky portions of the Louisville and Cincinnati-Hamilton areas cannot
take effect any earlier than January 1, 1995 under section 211(k)(5) 
and cannot take effect any later than January 1, 1995, under section 211(k)(6)(A), unless the Administrator extends
the effective date by rule under section 211(k)(6)(B).

<DOCTITLE>Acid Rain Program: Notice of Final Permits </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of permits. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing, as a direct final action, 5-year Phase I Acid Rain Permits
to 13 utility plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72). 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by
promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated
final rules implementing the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On November 18, 1993, EPA published a notice of proposed
revisions to rules regarding Phase I substitution and reduced utilization plans [sections 404 (b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B)
of the Act]. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties 
signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. 



In today's action, EPA is issuing permits that are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement. Except as noted below,
EPA approves for 1995-1999 all compliance options for which EPA deferred action for 1996-1999 in the draft
permits. In addition, except as noted below, the numbers of substitution and compensating unit allowances allocated
to each unit for 1995-1999 are identical to the numbers of allowances allocated to each unit for 1995 in the draft
permits. The additional allowances discussed below are a one-time only allocation pursuant to the settlement. Upon
activation of conditionally-approved plans, substitution or compensating unit allowances are allocated for the
remaining years the plan is in effect. EPA issues the following permits: 

Northport in New York. 

Port Jefferson in New York. 

Big Bend in Florida. 

F J Gannon in Florida: No change for unit GB01; 4,581 substitution allowances for each year and 9 additional allowances
to unit GB02 upon activation of substitution plan; 7,003 substitution allowances for each year and 437 additional
allowances to unit GB03 upon activation of substitution plan; 7,570 substitution allowances for each year and 450
additional allowances to unit GB04 upon activation of substitution plan; 10,295 substitution allowances for each
year and 520 additional allowances to unit GB05 upon activation of substitution plan; 16,107 substitution allowances
for each year and 377 additional allowances to unit GB06 upon activation of substitution plan. 

Hookers Point in Florida: 0 substitution allowances for each year and 27 additional allowances to unit HB01 upon activation
of substitution plan; 31 substitution allowances for each year and 3 additional allowances to unit HB02 upon activation
of substitution plan; 92 substitution allowances for each year and 9 additional allowances to unit HB03 upon activation
of substitution plan; 145 substitution allowances for each year and 15 additional allowances to unit HB04 upon activation
of substitution plan; 124 substitution allowances for each year and 13 additional allowances to unit HB05 upon activation
of substitution plan; 207 substitution allowances for each year and 13 additional allowances to unit HB06 upon activation
of substitution plan.

<DOCTITLE>Restatement of Policies Related to Environmental Auditing </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA Environmental Auditing Policy Statement (``1986 Policy'') was originally published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 9, 1986 (51 FR 25004). The 1986 Policy states that ``(c)larification of EPA's position regarding auditing
may help encourage regulated entities to establish audit programs or upgrade systems already in place.'' The goal
of this notice is to clarify EPA's current policies on and approach to auditing. This notice summarizes salient points
from the 1986 Policy, which remains in effect. In addition, this notice updates the Agency's activities with respect
to auditing and auditing policy and references pertinent language from other relevant policy documents, in anticipation
of the public meeting on auditing scheduled for July 27-28, 1994. This notice does not represent a new EPA policy
or position on environmental auditing; all existing policies remain in effect. 



I. Auditing Public Meeting: Change of Location 



The response to EPA's announcement (59 FR 31914, June 20, 1994) to hold a public meeting on auditing on July 27-28,
1994 has been overwhelming. Due to the expected size of the audience, therefore, the Agency has changed the location
of this event. The new location is the Stouffer Mayflower Hotel in Washington, DC, at 1127 Connecticut Avenue, NW,
Phone (202) 347-3000.



II. The Auditing Policy Reassessment 



In response to a request by Administrator Carol M. Browner, the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA)
is reassessing the Agency's current policy regarding environmental auditing and self-evaluation by the regulated
community. EPA has committed to investigating the perceived problems relating to auditing, self-evaluation, and
disclosure through an empirical, information-gathering effort. The Agency must develop an adequate information

base to give serious consideration to any policy options and to ensure that any decision to either reinforce, change,
or supplement existing policy is informed by fact. 

EPA hopes to collect such relevant data through the implementation of four actions this summer. First, the Agency
will convene a public meeting on July 27-28, 1994, as an opportunity to obtain a wide variety of views and to sharpen
the focus on these issues. The range of issues appropriate for discussion at the public meeting include: the implementation
of the 1986 Policy; specific suggestions for auditing policy options; State audit privilege legislation; auditing
in the context of criminal enforcement; and advances in the field of auditing since 1986. Interested parties are encouraged
to read the 

Federal Register

 notice dated June 20, 1994 (59 FR 31914) for more details on the public meeting. 

Second, EPA published in the June 21, 1994 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 32062) a notice requesting proposals for Environmental Leadership Program (ELP) pilot projects. EPA expects
that these pilot projects will generate useful data on auditing methodology and measures, and may also serve as vehicles
for experimenting with policy-driven incentives. 

Third, EPA will encourage the private sector to collect data and survey auditing practices in order to gauge the effect
of enforcement policies on self-evaluation and disclosure in the regulated community. The Agency will also seek
input on auditing and related issues from States, environmental and public interest groups, and trade and professional
associations. 

Finally, in this 

Federal Register

 notice, EPA is restating salient points from the 1986 Policy and reviewing its activities and other policies relating
to environmental auditing. The goal of this notice is to clarify EPA's current policies on and approach to auditing,
in order to ensure 
a well-informed policy debate. 



III. Review of General EPA Policy on Environmental Auditing 



A. EPA Encourages the Use of Environmental Auditing 



EPA has actively encouraged and participated in the development of environmental auditing and improved environmental
management practices since the mid-1980s. In fact, the 1986 Policy has served as the basis for defining the practice
and profession of environmental auditing. The 1986 Policy clearly states EPA support for auditing: 

 


Effective environmental auditing can lead to higher levels of overall compliance and reduced risk to human health
and the environment. EPA endorses the practice of environmental auditing and supports its accelerated use by regulated
entities to help meet the goals of Federal, state and local environmental requirements. 



* * * * * 



Auditing serves as a quality assurance check to help improve the effectiveness of basic environmental management
by verifying that management practices are in place, functioning and adequate. Environmental audits evaluate,
and are not a substitute for, direct compliance activities such 
as obtaining permits, installing controls, monitoring compliance, reporting violations, and keeping records.
Environmental auditing may verify but does not include activities required by law, regulation, or permit (e.g.,
continuous emissions monitoring, composite correction plans at wastewater treatment plants, etc.). Audits do
not in any way replace regulatory agency inspections. However, environmental audits can improve compliance by complementing
conventional Federal, state and local oversight. 



* * * * * 



Environmental auditing has developed for sound business reasons, particularly as a means of helping regulated entities
manage pollution control affirmatively over time instead of reacting to crises. Auditing can result in improved
facility environmental performance, help communicate effective 
solutions to common environmental problems, focus facility managers' attention on current and upcoming regulatory
requirements, and generate protocols and checklists which help facilities better manage themselves. Auditing
also can result in better-integrated management of environmental hazards, since auditors frequently identify
environmental liabilities which go beyond regulatory compliance. 

 


The Agency clearly supports auditing to help ensure the adequacy of internal systems to achieve, maintain, and monitor
compliance. By voluntarily implementing environmental management and auditing programs, regulated entities
can identify, resolve, and avoid environmental problems. 

 


EPA does not intend to dictate or interfere with the environmental management practices of private or public organizations.
Nor does EPA intend to mandate auditing (though in certain instances EPA may seek to include provisions for environmental
auditing as part of settlement agreements, as 
noted below). Because environmental auditing systems have been widely adopted on a voluntary basis in the past, and
because audit quality depends to a large degree upon genuine management commitment to the program and its objectives,
auditing should remain a voluntary activity. 

 


Because senior managers of regulated entities are ultimately responsible for taking all necessary steps to ensure
compliance with environmental requirements, EPA believes they have a strong incentive to use reasonable means,
such as environmental auditing, to secure reliable information 
about facility compliance status. 



B. Definition of Environmental Auditing, Elements of Effective Environmental Auditing Programs 



The 1986 Policy also defines environmental auditing, and outlines what EPA considers to be the elements of an effective
environmental auditing program. The 1986 Policy presents the following definition: 

 

</SUMMARY>
</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940728-2-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940728-2-00041 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


Environmental auditing is a systematic, documented, periodic and objective review by 
regulated entities of facility operations and practices related to meeting environmental requirements. 
Audits can be designed to accomplish any or all of the following: verify compliance with environmental 
requirements; evaluate the effectiveness of environmental management systems already in place; or 
assess risks from regulated and unregulated materials and practices. 






An organization's auditing program will evolve according to its unique structures and 
circumstances. The 1986 Policy acknowledges this fact, and also states EPA's belief that 
effective environmental auditing programs appear to have certain discernible elements in common 
with other kinds of audit programs. EPA generally considers these elements important to ensure 
program effectiveness. This general description of effective, mature audit programs can help 
those starting audit programs, especially Federal agencies and smaller businesses. Regulatory 
agencies may also use these elements in negotiating environmental auditing provisions for consent 
decrees. Finally, these elements can help guide states and localities considering auditing 
initiatives. 




As stated in the 1986 Policy, an effective environmental auditing system will likely 
include the following general elements:








I. Explicit top management support for environmental auditing and commitment to follow-up 
on audit findings. 

Management support may be demonstrated by a written policy articulating upper 
management support for the auditing program, and for compliance with all pertinent requirements, 
including corporate policies and permit requirements as well as Federal, state and local statutes and 
regulations. 



Management support for the auditing program also should be demonstrated by an explicit 
written commitment to follow-up on audit findings to correct identified problems and prevent their 
recurrence. 





II. An environmental auditing function independent of audited activities. 

The status or 
organizational locus of environmental auditors should be sufficient to ensure objective and unobstructed 
inquiry, observation and testing. Auditor objectivity should not be impaired by personal relationships, 
financial or other conflicts of interest, interference with free inquiry or judgment, or fear of potential 
retribution. 





III. Adequate team staffing and auditor training.

 Environmental auditors should possess or have 
ready access to the knowledge, skills, and disciplines needed to accomplish audit objectives. Each 
individual auditor should comply with the company's professional standards of conduct. Auditors, 
whether full-time or part-time, should maintain their technical and analytical competence through 
continuing education and training. 





IV. Explicit audit program objectives, scope, resources and frequency. 

At a minimum, audit 
objectives should include assessing compliance with applicable environmental laws and evaluating the 
adequacy of internal compliance policies, procedures, and personnel training programs to ensure 
continued compliance. 



Audits should be based on a process which provides auditors: all corporate policies, permits, 
and Federal, state, and local regulations pertinent to the facility; and checklists or protocols addressing 
specific features that should be evaluated by auditors. 



Explicit written audit procedures generally should be used for planning audits, establishing 
audit scope, establishing audit scope, examining and evaluating audit findings, communicating audit 
results, and following-up. 





V. A process that collects analyzes interprets and documents information sufficient to achieve 
audit objectives. 

Information should be collected before and during an on-site visit regarding 
environmental compliance (1) environmental management effectiveness (2) and other matters (3) related 
to audit objectives and scope. This information should be sufficient, reliable, relevant and useful to 
provide a sound basis for audit finds and recommendations. 



a. 

Sufficient 

information is factual, adequate and convincing so that a prudent, informed person 
would be likely to reach the same conclusions as the auditor. 



b. 

Reliable

 information is the best attainable through use of appropriate audit techniques. 



c. 

Relevant

 information supports audit findings and recommendations and is consistent with the 
objectives for the audit. 



d. 

Useful

 information helps the organization meet its goals. 



The audit process should include a periodic review of the reliability and integrity of this 
information and the means used to identify, measure, classify and report it. Audit procedures, including 
the testing and sampling techniques employed, should be selected in advance, to the extent practical, 
and expanded or altered if circumstances warrant. The process of collecting, analyzing, interpreting 
and documenting information should provide reasonable assurance that audit objectivity is maintained 
and audit goals are met. 





VI. A process that includes specific procedures to promptly prepare candid clear and appropriate 
written reports on audit finds corrective actions and schedules for implementation.

 Procedures should 
be in place to ensure that such information is communicated to managers, including facility and 
corporate management, who can evaluate the information and ensure correction of identified problems. 
Procedures also should be in place for determining what internal findings are reportable to state or 
Federal agencies. 





VII. A process that includes quality assurance procedures to assure the accuracy and thoroughness 
of environmental audits.

 Quality assurance may be accomplished through supervision, independent 
internal reviews, external reviews, or a combination of these approaches.

C. EPA Activities Related to Auditing Standards 




EPA is currently participating in two major non-regulatory efforts to develop voluntary 
standards for auditing and environmental management systems. First, the International 
Organization of Standards (ISO), based in Geneva, Switzerland, established in 1993 a Technical 
Committee for Environmental Management Standards (ISO-TC-207). Subcommittee Two of TC-207 is
in the process of developing environmental auditing standards. The standards fall into 
three groups: Auditing Principles, Auditing Procedures, and Auditor Qualifications. Second, in 
the U.S., the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is developing 
environmental auditing standards that are intended to be compatible with and augment the ISO 
standards. Work is proceeding rapidly within ISO and NSF, with draft standards expected by the 
end of the year. 



The proposed NSF and ISO auditing standards are being developed within the framework 
of overall environmental management systems standards. Neither ISO nor NSF intends to 
establish specific environmental standards; instead both are seeking to provide management tools 
that include auditing schemes and standards. The EPA 1986 Policy has been a central reference 
document for both the ISO and NSF work. As these new documents develop, issues of auditor 
qualifications and explicit management commitment to audit follow-up will be of particular 
interest to EPA. 




IV. Review of EPA Policy on Specific Environmental Auditing Issues 




A. Agency Requests for Audit Reports 





EPA's 1986 Policy clearly states that:






. . . EPA believes routine Agency requests for audit reports could inhibit auditing in the long 
run, decreasing both the quantity and quality of audits conducted. Therefore, as a matter of policy EPA 
will not routinely request environmental audit reports.






The 1986 policy also acknowledges regulated entities' need to self-evaluate environmental 
performance with some measure of privacy. However, audit reports may not shield monitoring, 
compliance or other information that would otherwise be reportable and/or accessible to EPA 
even if there is no explicit requirement to generate that data. Thus, the 1986 Policy does not 
alter regulated entities' existing or future obligations to monitor, record or report information 
required under environmental statutes, regulations or permits, or to allow EPA access to that 
information. Nor does the 1986 Policy alter EPA's authority to request and receive any relevant 
information_including that contained in audit reports_under various environmental statutes or in 
other administrative or judicial proceedings.






EPA's authority to request an audit report, or relevant portions thereof, will be exercised on 
a case-by-case basis where the Agency determines it is needed to accomplish a statutory mission, or 
where the Government deems it to be material to a criminal investigation. EPA expects such requests 
to be limited, most likely focused on particular information needs rather than the entire report, and 
usually made where the information needed cannot be obtained from monitoring, reporting, or other 
data otherwise available to the Agency. Examples would likely include situations where: audits are 
conducted under consent decrees or other settlement agreements; a company has placed its management 
practices at issue by raising them as a defense; or state of mind or intent are a relevant element of 
inquiry, such as during a criminal investigation. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive, since 
there doubtless will be other situations, not subject to prediction, in which audit reports rather than 
information may be required . . .




B. EPA Response to Environmental Auditing 




1. General Policy 





The 1986 Policy states that ``EPA will not promise to forgo inspections, reduce 
enforcement responses, or offer other such incentives in exchange for implementation of 
environmental auditing or other sound environmental management practices.'' EPA is required 
by law to independently assess compliance status of facilities, and cannot eliminate inspections 
for particular firms or classes of firms. Certain statutes (e.g. RCRA) and Agency policies 
establish minimum facility inspection frequencies to which EPA will adhere. Environmental 
audits are in no way a substitute for regulatory oversight. 



As explained in the 1986 Policy, however, EPA will take into account a facility's efforts 
to audit in setting inspection priorities and in fashioning enforcement responses to violations:






. . . EPA will continue to address environmental problems on a priority basis and will 
consequently inspect facilities with poor environmental records and practices more frequently. Since 
effective environmental auditing helps management identify and promptly correct actual or potential 
problems, audited facilities' environmental performance should improve. Thus, while EPA inspections 
of self-audited facilities will continue, to the extent that compliance performance is considered in 
setting inspection priorities, facilities with a good compliance history may be subject to fewer 
inspections. 



In fashioning enforcement responses to violations, EPA policy is to take into account, on a 
case-by-case basis, the honest and genuine efforts of regulated entities to avoid and promptly correct 
violations and underlying environmental problems. When regulated entities take reasonable precautions 
to avoid noncompliance, expeditiously correct underlying environmental problems discovered through 
audits or other means, and implement measures to prevent their recurrence, EPA may exercise its 
discretion to consider such actions as honest and genuine efforts to assure compliance. Such 
consideration applies particularly when a regulated entity promptly reports violations or compliance data 
that otherwise were not required to be recorded or reported to EPA.






These principles have been incorporated into the Agency's enforcement response and civil 
penalty policies.




2. Audit Provisions as Remedies in Enforcement Settlements 





The 1986 Policy includes the following language on audit provisions as remedies in 
enforcement settlements:






EPA may propose environmental auditing provisions in consent decrees and in other 
settlement negotiations where auditing could provide a remedy for identified problems and reduce the 
likelihood of similar problems recurring in the future. Environmental auditing provisions are most 
likely to be proposed in settlement negotiations when: 



 A pattern of violations can be attributed, at least in part, to the absence or poor functioning of an 
environmental management system; or 



 The type of nature of violations indicates a likelihood that similar noncompliance problems may exist 
or occur elsewhere in the facility or at other facilities operated by the regulated entity.






EPA's enforcement office issued further guidance on this issue in 1986 in a document 
entitled ``EPA Policy on the Inclusion of Environmental Auditing Provisions in Enforcement 
Settlements.'' This guidance has been consistently applied in enforcement actions as appropriate, 
and has formed the basis for the inclusion of audit agreements or provisions in numerous consent 
decrees. Selected text from this document, also still in effect, is included here:






In recent years, Agency negotiators have achieved numerous settlements that require regulated 
entities to audit their operations. These innovative settlements have been highly successful in enabling 
the Agency to accomplish more effectively its primary mission, namely, to secure environmental 
compliance. Indeed, auditing provisions in enforcement settlements have provided several important 
benefits to the Agency by enhancing its ability to:



 Address compliance at an entire facility or at all facilities owned or operated by a party, rather 
than just the violations discovered during inspections; and identify and correct violations that 
may have gone undetected (and uncorrected) otherwise; 



 Focus the attention of a regulated party's top-level management on environmental compliance; 
produce corporate policies and procedures that enable a party to achieve and maintain 
compliance; and help a party to manage pollution control affirmatively over time instead of 
reacting to crises; 



 Provide a quality assurance check by verifying that existing environmental management 
practices are in place, functioning and adequate. 




* * * * * 





It is the policy of EPA to settle its judicial and administrative enforcement cases only where 
violators can assure the Agency that their noncompliance will be (or has been) corrected. EPA . . .

considers auditing an appropriate part of a settlement where heightened management attention could 
lower the potential for noncompliance to recur.

<PARENT> FR940728-2-00041 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In most cases, either (or both) of the following two types of environmental audits should be considered [in enforcement
settlements]: 

1. 

Compliance Audit:

 An independent assessment of the current status of a party's compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory
requirements. This approach always entails a requirement that effective measures be taken to remedy uncovered compliance
problems, and is most effective when coupled with a requirement that the root causes of noncompliance also be remedied.


2. 

Management Audit:

 An independent evaluation of a party's environmental compliance policies, practices, and controls. Such evaluation
may encompass the need for: (1) A formal corporate environmental compliance policy, and procedures for implementation
of that policy; (2) educational and training programs for employees; (3) equipment purchase, operation and maintenance
programs; (4) environmental compliance officer programs (or other organizational structures relevant to compliance);
(5) budgeting and planning systems for environmental compliance; (6) monitoring, record keeping and reporting
systems; (7) in-plant and community emergency plans; (8) internal communications and control systems; and (9) hazard
identification and risk assessment. 

Whether to seek a compliance audit, a management audit, or both will depend upon the unique circumstances of each case.
A compliance audit usually will be appropriate where the violations uncovered by Agency inspections raise the likelihood
that environmental noncompliance exists elsewhere within a party's operations. A management audit should be sought
where it appears that a major contributing factor to noncompliance is inadequate (or nonexistent) managerial attention
to environmental policies, procedures or staffing. Both types of audits should be sought where both current noncompliance
and shortcomings in a party's environmental management practices need to be addressed. 



C. Environmental Auditing and Criminal Enforcement Policy 



Following EPA's 1986 Policy, three significant developments mark the evolution and implementation of criminal
enforcement policy governing the use of self-audits and the voluntary disclosure of environmental violations.


First, on July 1, 1991, the Department of Justice issued a guidance entitled: ``Factors In Decisions On Criminal Prosecutions
For Environmental Violations In The Context Of Significant Voluntary Compliance Or Disclosure Efforts By The Violator.''
The guidance sets the general DOJ policy on auditing:

 


It is the policy of the Department of Justice to encourage self-auditing, self-policing, and voluntary disclosure
of environmental violations by the regulated community by indicating that these activities are viewed as mitigating
factors in the Department's exercise of criminal enforcement discretion.




The guidance and the examples contained therein provide a framework for the determination of whether a particular
case presents the type of circumstances in which lenience would be appropriate. The factors to be considered in exercising
the Department's prosecutorial discretion, in cases where the law and evidence are otherwise sufficient for prosecution,
include: voluntary disclosure; cooperation; preventive measures and compliance programs; pervasiveness of noncompliance;
internal disciplinary action; and subsequent compliance efforts. 



Second, on November 11, 1993, the Final Draft Environmental Sentencing Guidelines provided for the mitigation of
sentences where a court finds that the following factors for environmental compliance are satisfied: line management
attention to compliance; integration of environmental policies, standards, and procedures; auditing, monitoring,
reporting and tracking systems; regulatory expertise, training and evaluation; incentives for compliance; disciplinary
procedures; continuing evaluation and improvement. 

Finally, on January 12, 1994, EPA's Director of Criminal Enforcement issued a guidance entitled: ``The Exercise
of Investigative Discretion,'' that sets forth specific factors that distinguish cases meriting criminal investigation.
With respect to corporations conducting environmental audits, the guidance states:

 


Corporate culpability may be indicated when a company performs an environmental compliance or management audit,
and then knowingly fails to promptly remedy the non-compliance and correct any harm done. On the other hand, EPA policy
strongly encourages self-monitoring, self-disclosure, and self-correction. When self-auditing has been conducted
(followed up by prompt remediation of the non-compliance and any resulting harm) and full, complete disclosure has
occurred, the company's constructive activities should be considered as mitigating factors in EPA's exercise of
investigative discretion. Therefore, a violation that is voluntarily revealed and fully and promptly remediated
as part of a corporation's systematic and comprehensive self-evaluation program generally will not be a candidate
for the expenditure of scarce criminal resources.



D. Audit Privilege Legislation 



Four States (Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, and Oregon) have recently enacted legislation which, with some variations,
creates a ``self-evaluative'' privilege for audit reports. EPA has consistently opposed this approach, principally
because of the risk of weakening State enforcement programs, the imposition of unnecessary transaction costs and
delays in enforcement actions, and the potential increase in the number of situations requiring the expenditure
of scarce Agency resources, including the ``overfiling'' of State enforcement actions. EPA urges States that are
considering a privilege-oriented approach to actively participate in the comprehensive process described in the
June 20, 1994 

Federal Register

 notice (59 FR 31914) before pursuing any legislative action. The Agency also encourages States that have passed such
legislation to present documentary justification for this approach either at the public meeting on July 27-28,
1994, or in written comments. 



E. Environmental Auditing at Federal Facilities 



The 1986 Policy also encourages all Federal agencies subject to environmental laws and regulations to institute
environmental auditing, to help ensure the adequacy of internal systems to achieve, maintain and monitor compliance.
Such Federal facility environmental audit programs should be structured to promptly identify environmental problems
and expeditiously develop schedules for remedial action. 

Where appropriate, EPA will enter into agreements with other agencies to clarify the respective roles, responsibilities
and commitments of each agency in conducting and responding to Federal facility environmental audits. Also, to the
extent feasible, EPA will provide technical assistance to help Federal agencies design and initiate audit programs.
Currently, the EPA Federal Facility Enforcement Office (FFEO) is co-chairing an inter-Agency work group to revise
auditing guidelines and protocols for Federal agencies. In addition, FFEO is developing the Federal Government
Environmental Challenge Program required by Executive Order 12856, which calls for the establishment of a Code of
Environmental Principles and a Model Installation Program for Federal facilities. This program is likely to include
environmental auditing components. 

The 1986 Policy states that:

 


With respect to inspections of self-audited facilities and requests for audit reports, EPA generally will respond
to environmental audits by Federal facilities in the same manner as it does for other regulated entities. 



* * * * *



Federal agencies should, however, be aware that the Freedom of Information Act will govern any disclosure of audit
reports or audit-generated information requested from Federal agencies by the public.

 


When Federal agencies discover significant violations through an audit, EPA encourages them to voluntarily submit
the related findings and corrective action plans to the appropriate EPA Regional office and State agencies, even
when not specifically required to do so. EPA will review the audit findings and action plans, and negotiate either
a consent agreement or a Federal Facilities Compliance Agreement, pursuant to its enforcement authorities under
the various environmental statutes. In any event, Federal agencies are expected to report to EPA pollution abatement
and prevention projects involving costs necessary to correct compliance problems discovered through the audit,
in accordance with OMB Circular A-106. Upon request, and in appropriate circumstances, EPA may assist affected
Federal agencies through coordination of any public release of voluntarily submitted audit findings with approved
action plans once agreement has been reached and/or appropriate enforcement actions have been taken.

V. Review of Relationship to State or Local Regulatory Agencies 



Effective Federal/state partnerships are critical to accomplishing the mutual goal of achieving and maintaining
high levels of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The greater the consistency between state and
local policies and the Federal response to environmental auditing, the greater the degree to which sound auditing
practices might be adopted and compliance levels improved. State and local regulatory agencies, of course, have
independent jurisdiction over regulated entities. EPA encourages them to adopt these or similar policies on environmental
auditing, in order to advance the use of effective environmental auditing in a consistent manner. 

The 1986 Policy emphasizes this point further:

 


EPA recognizes that some states have already undertaken environmental auditing initiatives that differ somewhat
from this policy. Other states also may want to develop auditing policies that accommodate their particular needs
or circumstances. Nothing in this policy statement is intended to preempt or preclude states from developing other
approaches to environmental auditing. EPA encourages state and local authorities to consider the basic principles
that guided the Agency in developing this policy: 

 Regulated entities must continue to report or record compliance information required under existing statutes
or regulations, regardless of whether such information is generated by an environmental audit or contained in an
audit report. Required information cannot be withheld merely because it is generated by an audit rather than by some
other means. 

 Regulatory agencies cannot make promises to forgo or limit enforcement action against a particular facility
or class of facilities in exchange for the use of environmental auditing systems. However, such agencies may use their
discretion to adjust enforcement actions on a case-by-case basis in response to honest and genuine efforts by regulated
entities to assure environmental compliance. 

 When setting inspection priorities, regulatory agencies should focus to the extent possible on compliance
performance and environmental results. 

 Regulatory agencies must continue to meet minimum program requirements (e.g., minimum inspection requirements,
etc). 

 Regulatory agencies should not attempt to prescribe the precise form and structure of regulated entities'
environmental management or auditing programs. 



VI. Conclusion 



All of the policies referenced in this notice remain in effect. The Agency intends, however, to re-examine these policies
comprehensively and remains open to suggestions for changes and improvements regarding all aspects of existing
auditing policy. The information presented here is intended for the convenience of interested parties, in preparation
for the July 27-28, 1994 public meeting. The Agency hopes that this information will clarify EPA's current activities
and policies related to environmental auditing. 

The Office of Compliance will respond to written requests for copies of the documents referenced in this notice. Send
all requests to: U.S. EPA, Office of Compliance, Attn: Ira R. Feldman, Special Counsel, 401 M Street, NW (5503), Washington,
DC 20460.

 The Effluent Guidelines Task Force, an EPA advisory committee, will hold a meeting to discuss improvements to the
Agency's Effluent Guidelines Program. The meeting is open to the public. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), the Environmental Protection Agency gives
notice of a meeting of the Effluent Guidelines Task Force (EGTF). The EGTF is a subcommittee of the National Advisory
Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT), the external policy advisory board to the Administrator
of EPA. 


The EGTF was established in July of 1992 to advise EPA on the Effluent Guidelines Program, which develops regulations
for dischargers of industrial wastewater pursuant to Title III of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). The
Task Force consists of members appointed by EPA from industry, citizen groups, state and local government, the academic
and scientific communities, and EPA regional offices. The Task Force was created to offer advice to the Administrator
on the long-term strategy for the effluent guidelines program, and particularly to provide recommendations on a
process for expediting the promulgation of effluent guidelines. The Task Force generally does not discuss specific
effluent guideline regulations currently under development. 
The meeting agenda will include discussions on draft recommendations for improving the project management and data
collection processes for effluent guidelines. There will also be discussions on the methodology for conducting
preliminary industry studies, and a planning session for future task force activities. 
The meeting is open to the public. Limited seating for the public is available on a first-come, first-served basis.
The public may submit written comments to the Task Force regarding improvements to the Effluent Guidelines program.
Comments should be sent to EPA at the above address. Comments submitted by August 8 will be considered by the Task Force
at or subsequent to the meeting.

<DOCTITLE>Improving EPA's Indian Program Operations</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Environmental protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Soliciting public comments on the agency's efforts to enhance Indian program operations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is soliciting comments from the public on the following potential approaches
for improving the Agency's Tribal operations, including the establishment of a new national Indian Program Office.
To obtain Tribal input into this process, as well as input on future Tribal matters, the EPA Administrator convened
the Tribal Operations Committee (TOC) comprised of Tribal representatives and EPA Senior Managers. EPA is now seeking
broader input on these approaches, and will consider comments received during the public comment period to ensure
that the strongest options have been identified.




PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD: 

Comments must be received by September 12, 1994.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Environmental Protection Agency has made continual progress in building its Tribal program since issuance of
the Agency's 1984 Indian Policy. In Fiscal Year 1993, approximately $35 million and 165 work years were utilized to
implement EPA Indian programs, either through direct grants to Tribes or through Federal implementation and technical
assistance to Tribes.




Regulations and guidance specific to Tribes have been developed under many of EPA's programs establishing the process
for Tribes to apply for grants and program authorization. Over 90 Treatment in the Same Manner as a State determinations,
formerly referred to as Treatment as a State, have been made under various water programs. Numerous Tribes have submitted
water quality standards for authorization by EPA, and three have already been approved. Many more Tribal applications
are expected in the future for a broad array of EPA programs.

The growth of EPA's Indian program has led to an increased understanding of the seriousness of environmental threats
to human health and the environments within Indian Country by EPA and the Tribes. To promote improved communications
and partnerships with Tribes to address these concerns, the EPA Administrator convened a Tribal Operations Committee
(TOC) to meet with her and other EPA Senior Management as co-regulators, on a regular basis, and to provide Tribal input
into Agency decision making that may affect Tribes.

The TOC is comprised of 18 Tribal representatives, who are either Tribal Leaders or Tribal environmental officials
selected by Tribes within EPA regions. There are Tribal representatives from each of EPA's regions except Region
III, which has no Federally recognized Tribes.

On February 17, 1994, at the first official TOC meeting, the Administrator committed to strengthening the Agency's
Tribal operations and reaffirmed the Agency's 1984 Indian Policy. As one of the first actions for the Tribal representatives
to the TOC and in response to Tribal recommendations, the Administrator authorized a group of Senior Managers from
EPA Headquarters and regions to develop recommendations, in consultation with Tribal representatives to the TOC,
on ways to strengthen EPA's Tribal environmental programs and daily operations.


Over the last few months, the EPA Senior Team, working with the TOC, has identified options for advancing and strengthening
Tribal environmental protection and improving relations between EPA and the Tribes, in the following program areas:
organization, implementation and resource needs.

To ensure constant Tribal input while developing these options, weekly conference calls were held with the TOC. Two
meetings have been held at which the TOC and Team met face-to-face. In addition, early in June 1994, a letter was sent
to all Tribal Leaders providing information on the approaches the Agency was considering, and soliciting additional
comment. These comments have been considered and the Agency hopes to obtain further input through publishing this
Notice.


EPA's Current Indian Program Structure




Under the Agency's current Indian program structure, the central coordination responsibility has been one of many
functions undertaken by the Office of Federal Activities (OFA) in the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.
OFA is currently the central point of contact for Tribes at Headquarters, and also develops the budget for the General
Assistance Grant Program, works with regions to oversee administration of such grants to Tribes, and fosters overall
coordination between the various offices at Headquarters and the regions.

Responsibility for administering specific programs such as water, air and waste are handled by those program and
regional offices. This includes specifically (but not exclusively) provision of technical assistance, direct
Federal implementation and program development and implementation funds as allowed by law. This will continue to
be necessary because these offices have the technical expertise and the responsibility for developing and administering
program-specific resources, policies, and regulations.


EPA's regional offices interact with each Tribe on matters specific to the Tribes and this should continue even though
a national office will be responsible for the coordination of the Agency's Tribal program. In fact, regions and programs
need to increase their efforts to assist Tribes in addressing environmental issues as part of the effort to enhance
Tribal operations.


Proposed National EPA Indian Operations



Altering the current structure by creating a national office, whose sole responsibility is Tribal operations, would
provide a more consistent and streamlined approach for implementing EPA's Indian Policy. This new Office could also
ensure that Tribal input and concerns are heard and integrated into the Agency's ongoing activities.

The EPA Team identified, in consultation with Tribal representatives to the TOC, key factors, functions and organizational
options to consider in establishing the new office. The Agency is seeking suggestions on functions for the Office
as well as its appropriate title. Among others, titles such as ``National Office of Indian Affairs'' or ``National
Tribal Environmental Management Office'' have been suggested to date.

Functions for the New Office



Tribal representatives to the TOC have suggested that it is critical for the new Office to have flexibility to develop
its specific Action Agenda after it is officially established. Therefore, some of the key functions envisioned for
the new Office are identified here in general terms. The Agency expects that the new Office will further refine and
develop these functions while establishing a more detailed Action Agenda.

Following is a list of key functions the Agency believes to be critical for the new Office.



Function 1._Implementation of Policies



The Agency believes that a main function of the Office should be to ensure that the 1994 Presidential Memorandum addressing
Tribal program implementation and the Agency's recently reaffirmed 1984 Indian Policy are fully implemented. These
documents both recognize Tribal sovereignty and call for a government-to-government relationship with Tribes.

The Office should also ensure that other Agency policies affecting Tribes are being implemented responsibly, and
that Tribal operations continue to be a priority Agency wide. The new Office should review and update existing Agency
guidance that relates to Tribes, in order to facilitate the full implementation of these policies.



Function 2._Develop Environmental Workplans



In order for EPA and Tribes to plan for and respond effectively to Tribal environmental problems requiring action,
the Agency and the Tribes need to establish a baseline description and evaluation of the types of environmental problems,
the seriousness of such problems and Tribal priorities for action. To accomplish this, the Agency is recommending
the formulation of individual Tribal workplans or strategies for responding to environmental problems. To facilitate
and support these workplans, each EPA Regional Administrator would retain flexibility to determine, in consultation
with the Tribes, the most appropriate manner to develop these workplans. Workplans should include the Tribe's plans
to manage authorized environmental programs and/or their need for Federal technical assistance and funding, direct
Federal implementation and management of specific programs.

These Tribal workplans would be the basis for region specific workplans upon, which in turn, a national EPA Tribal
operations workplan would be based.

A Tribal representative to the TOC asked that funding for needs assessments be made available to Tribes in order to
build a foundation of information upon which to base Tribal workplans. The commentor further suggested that EPA and
the Tribes jointly develop a model to provide initial guidance for workplan development. The Agency is considering
how this might be done.

Commentors have also suggested that the Agency must set realistic schedules for completing these workplans. The
Agency specifically solicits comments on how long it would take for such Tribal workplans to be completed and ideas
on effective approaches for assessing Tribal needs. Finally, the Agency believes it is important to be cognizant
of the fact that workplan development is likely to identify needs that cannot be met immediately with available funding
and that a Tribal/EPA strategic approach to meeting needs over time will be required. Comments on how these decisions
can be developed and managed are specifically solicited.



Function 3._Ensuring Consistency



The Office should coordinate the Agency's Indian operations to ensure an appropriate level of consistency throughout
the programs and regions in the areas of policy, guidance, program implementation and regulatory and legislative
initiatives. To assist Tribes and EPA managers, the Office should develop a compendium of Agency policies and statements
concerning Indian matters. Further, the Office may develop regulations and legislative initiatives of a multi-media
nature relating to Tribes.

The Office should work with the Office of General Counsel, other appropriate Agency parties and Federally recognized
Tribes to review Federal environmental laws, regulations, policies and guidance to strengthen, coordinate and
ensure consistency with EPA's Indian Policy, and the Federal trust responsibility to Tribes. This review should
foster improvements to Agency Tribal operations leading to effective program delivery while maintaining sufficient
flexibility to meet Tribal needs.



Function 4._Budget and Resource Development



A function of the Office should be coordination and development of budget proposals to meet the Agency's and Tribal
environmental program resource needs. The Office should also work to ensure appropriate management and staff to
support Tribal operations. Resource proposals should be sufficient to ensure the success of Tribal environmental
programs and to carry out EPA program responsibilities in a manner consistent with Federal law.



Function 5._General Assistance Grant Oversight, Grant Flexibility and Streamlining



The new Office should oversee the General Assistance Grant Program to assist Tribes in building capacity to manage
environmental programs, and should, to the extent allowed under law, use the flexibility in this program as broadly
as possible to meet Tribal needs. The new Office may develop recommendations for statutory changes in granting authorities
to permit Tribal block grants and to explicitly authorize the use of the General Assistance Grants, where practicable,
for a full range of implementation activities. However, growth in the General Assistance Grant Program should not
lead to any diminishing of available funds from specific program grants such as Section 106 Water Quality Management
grants under the Clean Water Act.

Finally, given that most Tribes have a small environmental staff, if any, to manage various program-specific grants,
it is important to increase the efficient use of limited resources. The Office should work with other EPA Senior Management
to use available discretion to consolidate (to the extent allowed by law), issuance and administration of grants
to reduce the burden on Tribes.



Function 6._Promote Agency Wide Participation in Tribal Operations



The Office should promote Agency-wide participation in the development and implementation of Tribal environmental
programs. The new Office should chair the National Indian Workgroup which is made up of EPA Headquarters Program Coordinators
and Regional Indian Program Coordinators. The new Office should also coordinate with EPA National Indian Attorneys
Workgroup to ensure consistency in legal matters.



Function 7._Reporting Systems and Feedback Mechanisms



Another key function of the Office would be to expand, establish, where necessary, and oversee internal Agency reporting
requirements. Feedback should be provided to EPA management and staff through tracking and reporting systems that
monitor progress, yet are not overly demanding on limited Tribal government staff and resources. Principles of partnership
should be considered while coordinating joint management of oversight activities.

To facilitate the collection of baseline data, and other periodic data concerning Tribal capacity development,
program authorization and EPA direct implementation and management activities, the new Office should work with
Assistant and Regional Administrators to develop a regular reporting system and schedules for a variety of Indian
Program activities and milestones.

A Tribal representative has suggested that criteria through which Tribal environmental programs can be judged to
be sufficient need to be developed as a benchmark for both Tribes and EPA to measure and evaluate their progress in a
consistent manner. Further, the commentor calls for the new Office to conduct periodic workshops and evaluations
in the regions with Tribes to provide feedback and to be accessible to the Tribes in the field.

Reviewers are specifically asked to comment upon appropriate forms of reporting and methods of evaluation likely
to be most effective. The Agency is considering these suggestions.

Function 8._Clearinghouse For Environmental Information and Data Generation



The Office would serve as a cross-media clearinghouse for environmental information related to the Indian program
and would coordinate Agency-wide data collection for the Indian program. Assistant and Regional Administrators
would be asked to have systems in place to identify and update Tribal data for their programs and, as part of the ``comprehensive''
Tribal environmental picture. This data should be accessible to the new Office for analysis and evaluation.

To fulfill this function and improve EPA's ability to respond quickly and effectively to Tribal environmental problems,
the Agency is considering calling for the new Office to establish a Tribal environmental database, in cooperation
with program and regional offices and Tribes. The Office should make use of existing data base systems, information
and documents already compiled by EPA and other relevant agencies and build upon these as appropriate.



Function 9._Tribal Environmental Training



The Office would coordinate Agency-wide development of training, education and technical assistance, in all relevant
environmental areas, for Tribes. In doing so, attempts should be made to make ongoing training that other co-regulators
receive, available and appropriate for Tribes.

Several commentors have stated that, in particular, technical assistance is critical to successful Tribal environmental
capacity building and program development. The Agency is exploring options for providing more technical assistance
to Tribal environmental managers. Resources may limit certain options, but improvements can be made. The Agency
is specifically looking for suggestions on how best to provide this service to Tribes.



Function 10._Training of EPA Staff



It is important that EPA employees have the necessary sensitivity, knowledge and understanding of Indian affairs
to facilitate communication between EPA and Tribal representatives. The Office would promote and coordinate training
on Indian issues for Agency managers and staff, particularly those working on Tribal and related programs. In the
interim, EPA managers will be encouraged to provide training that moves the Agency in the direction of a better understanding
of Indian issues.

This training should address responsibilities under Federal Indian law and the EPA Indian Policy, EPA's Indian program
activities, Tribal sovereignty and jurisdiction, Tribal environmental needs and activities, the role of Tribal
individuals and organizations and cultural and historical differences that may affect EPA's working relationship
with the Tribes.



Function 11._Communication With Tribes



Promoting and facilitating improved communication between EPA and Tribal governments (pursuant to the 1984 Indian
Policy), and Tribal members and/or organizations, would be a major function of the new Office in cooperation with
the program and regional offices.

In keeping with the spirit of environmental justice and Executive Order 12875, EPA management should include Tribes
in decision-making and program management activities that affect them. Communications and requests for Tribal
input should occur early in any Agency process that may affect Tribes, and full consideration should be given to the
policies, priorities, and concerns of the affected Tribe(s) and/or, where appropriate, affected Tribal members.

Specifically, but not exclusively, EPA will notify and communicate with Tribes on an ongoing basis for such activities
as rulemaking, policy development and direct implementation and management of EPA programs in Indian country. Commentors
have suggested that it is critical for communication to occur between elected Tribal leaders, Tribal members and
Tribal organizations, and the EPA Administrator and Regional Administrators in decisions that affect Tribes.

In addition, the Office should serve as the central point of contact to interact with the Agency and Tribes on matters
of national concern and should coordinate the activities and participation of the TOC in the future. The Agency invites
comments on how to further improve communications with Tribes.



Function 12._Interagency Coordination Efforts



The Office would work to improve communication, cooperation and funding utilization between EPA and other Federal
agencies regarding Indian matters. The new Office should review the content and status of existing Memoranda of Understanding
on Indian Affairs between EPA and other Federal agencies for effectiveness and implementation.

The new Office should also take appropriate steps to improve interagency coordination, especially with regard to
specific environmental issues, opportunities for cooperative use of public funds and disputes that may arise from
time to time. As a part of this effort, the new Office may find it useful to undertake an evaluation of all Federal resources
available to Tribes and their relationship to Tribal environmental management in coordination with the other Federal
agencies.

To the extent possible, EPA's Headquarters and regional program offices should be encouraged to participate in interagency
work groups to facilitate the resolution of environmental matters of mutual concern and foster integrated use of
funds.



Conclusion



The Agency invites comments the issues addressed in this Notice, as well as additional suggestions for strengthening
EPA's Tribal operations. The Agency will publish its final determinations based on review of public comment received
in response to this Notice.

<DOCTITLE>The State of New York; Adequacy Determination of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Tentative Determination on Application of the State of New York for Full Program Adequacy Determination,
Public Hearing and Public Comment Period.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid
waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply
with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR Part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribe Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are
submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR,
adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between State/Tribe and the
owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by Part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval
status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted
and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. 



The State of New York applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed New York's MSWLF
application and certain revisions thereto, and made a tentative determination that all portions of New York's MSWLF
permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. New York's application for program
adequacy determination and its revisions are available for public review and comment. 

Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has scheduled two public hearings on this tentative determination. Details appear below in the 

DATES 

section. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

A. Background 



On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR Part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under Part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine
that State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs are adequate to comply with the revised Federal Criteria.
To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.


EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also
must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.
These various components of authority and capability were submitted by New York State in its application and revisions
thereto. 

EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``Adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before
it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.

B. New York State 



On Sept. 24, 1993 New York State submitted an application for adequacy determination. On March 14, 1994, May 10, 1994
and June 28, 1994 New York State submitted revisions to the original application. EPA reviewed the application together
with the subsequent revisions and has tentatively determined that all portions of New York's subtitle D program are
adequate to provide compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. 

The New York Department of Environmental Conservation adopted its initial set of regulations relative to the regulatory
permitting requirements for solid waste management facilities in 1977. These regulations underwent substantial
amendment in 1981, and again were significantly amended in 1988. 

Since December 31, 1988, the effective date of the existing Part 360 Solid Waste Management Facilities regulations,
numerous technological advances have taken place in solid waste reduction, reuse and recycling, composting, construction
and demolition debris processing, and other solid waste treatment, storage, and disposal activities. These changes,
combined with ever diminishing landfill disposal capacity, have exacerbated the complexities of managing solid
waste in New York State. In response to the increased environmental awareness surrounding the siting, design, construction,
operations and closure of solid waste management facilities, as well as the requirements of 40 CFR Part 258, the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation again revised its Part 360 Solid Waste Management Facilities
regulations to include full public involvement, including workshops, public hearings, environmental impact/assessment,
and responsiveness summary. The revised regulations were approved by the State Environmental Board on June 30, 1993
and filed with the New York Department of State on August 5, 1993. The amended regulations became effective on October
9, 1993. 

The Part 360 regulations contain provisions whereby the Department of Environmental Conservation, in appropriate
circumstances, may grant variances from one or more specific provisions of the Part 360 requirements. New York has
stated that such a variance will not be granted in any way that is less stringent than the Part 258 requirements. The
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation will also formally amend its Part 360 regulations to clarify
that variances to Part 360 provisions will not be granted in any way that is less stringent than the Part 258 requirements.


There are currently 41 active landfills in New York State subject to both the 40 CFR Part 258 and 6 NYCRR Part 360 regulations.
There was a significant decrease in the number of active MSWLFs as a result of the April 9, 1994 federal deadline for
small landfills to either close or be subject to all of the federal criteria. Twenty-eight (28) facilities are under
Part 360 permits, eleven (11) facilities are under consent order, and two (2) facilities are operating without either
a permit or consent order. 

New York State is concentrating its efforts to bring all landfills that receive municipal solid waste into compliance
with the Part 360 regulations through one or more forms of enforcement actions. Landfills that are permitted under
the revised Part 360 regulations, effective October 9, 1993, will meet the federal criteria. For existing facilities
all owners or operators must file a renewal application if they intend to continue construction or operation beyond
the expiration date of existing permits. For those facilities with Part 360 permits that will expire over the next
2-3 years, the Department will ensure that each such facility meets the applicable federal and state regulations
before a renewal permit is issued. Further, for the estimated seven facilities with permits that will expire three
or more years beyond the date of program approval, the Department will pursue permit modifications in accordance
with requirements contained in 6 NYCRR Part 621 Uniform Procedures. New York State expects to complete those seven
permit modifications so as to ensure compliance with both federal and state regulations within three years of program
approval. Those facilities operating under a consent order will either be required to close or be upgraded to meet
the applicable regulations in accordance with the terms and conditions of their consent order. 

New York does not have the statutory authority to enforce the MSWLF permit program on Indian Lands. MSWLFs located
on Indian Lands are subject to the Federal Criteria.

The EPA will hold two public hearings on its tentative decision. Comments can be submitted orally at the hearing or
in writing at the time of the hearing. The public may also submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination
to the location indicated in the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this notice such that they are received by the close of business on September 13, 1994. Copies of New York's
state application are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this notice. 

EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and
during each public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for
New York's state program. EPA expects to make a final decision on whether or not to approve New York's state program
by November 1, 1994, and will give notice of it in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and responses to all major comments.


Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR Part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA will be considered to be in compliance with Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991). 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866.




Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice,
therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 






Authority:

 This notice is issued under the authority of Section 4005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended; 42 U.S.C. 6946.

Notice of Availability of Guidance Document.







Text



Section 106(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA),
42 U.S.C. 9606(b), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, allows any person who complies
with an EPA order issued under section 106(a) of the statute to petition for reimbursement of the reasonable costs
incurred in complying with the order, plus interest. Reimbursal is authorized if a petitioner can establish that
it was not liable for response costs, or that the Agency's selection of a response action was arbitrary or capricious
or otherwise not in accordance with law.

The authority to decide whether to grant such petitions has been delegated by the President to the EPA Administrator,
and redelegated to EPA's Environmental Appeals Board under EPA Delegation of Authority CERCLA 14-27 (June
1994). EPA is today announcing the availability of a guidance document, ``Guidance on Procedures for Submitting
CERCLA Section 106(b) Petitions and on EPA Review of those Petitions,'' issued by the Environmental Appeals Board
on June 9, 1994. This guidance document, which supersedes previous Agency guidance, details both the information
a petitioner is expected to submit as part of a petition for reimbursement and the procedures the Board intends to follow
in evaluating petitions. This guidance is applicable to all petitions submitted after June 9, 1994, and may also be
applied, to the extent practicable, to petitions pending on that date.

 Notice; Preparation of Draft General NPDES Permits_MAG640000, MEG640000, and NHG640000. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Regional Administrator of Region I is today providing Notice of a Draft General NPDES Permit for water treatment
facilities in certain waters of the States of Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. This draft general NPDES Permit
proposes effluent limitations, standards, prohibitions and management practices for these types of discharges
(Appendix A contains the Draft General NPDES Permits and Appendix B is the Draft General Conditions applicable to
all three general permits). The permit will become effective 30 days after the date of publication of the final general
permit in the 

Federal Register

. The permit will expire 5 years from the effective date. Owners and/or operators of facilities discharging effluent
from water treatment facilities will be required to submit to EPA, Region I, a notice of intent (NOI) to be covered by
the appropriate general permit and will receive a written notification from EPA of permit coverage and authorization
to discharge under the general permit. 




The draft permit is based on an administrative record available for public review at: Environmental Protection Agency,
Region I, John F. Kennedy Federal Building, WMM, Boston, Massachusetts 02203. 

The following ``Fact Sheet and 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

'' section sets forth principal facts and the significant factual, legal, and policy questions considered in the
development of the draft permits.

Maine 




In the State of Maine, there are 271 industrial applicants or permittees. It is estimated that 13 of the industries
that have direct discharges to the waters of the State are strictly water treatment facilities. 


New Hampshire 




In the State of New Hampshire, there are 171 estimated industrial applications or permittees. It is estimated that
2 or more of the industries that have the direct discharges to the waters of the State are strictly water treatment facilities.





Massachusetts 




In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, there are 651 industrial applicants or permittees. It is estimated that 33
of the industries that have direct discharges to the waters of the State are strictly water treatment facilities.





II. Conditions of the Draft General NPDES Permit 



A. Geographic Areas 



Maine (Permit No. MEG640000) 




All of the discharges to be authorized by the general NPDES permit for the State of Maine from dischargers are limited
to Class B, C, SB and SC waters of the State, except lakes. The drainage areas must be more than 10 square miles. 




Massachusetts (Permit No. MAG640000) 
 



All of the discharges to be authorized by the general NPDES permit for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts dischargers
are into all waters in Water Quality Classifications B, C, SB and SC as designated in Massachusetts Water Quality Standards,
314 CMR 4.00 

et seq

. 


New Hampshire (Permit No. NHG640000) 
 



All of the discharges to be authorized by the general NPDES permit for the State of New Hampshire dischargers are into
all waters of the State of New Hampshire unless otherwise restricted by the State Water Quality Standards, New Hampshire
RSA 485-A:8. 



B. Notification by Permittees 




Operators of facilities whose discharge, or discharges, are described in Part IB and whose facilities are located
in the geographic areas described in Part II. A. above may submit to the Regional Administrator, Region I, a notice
of intent to be covered by the appropriate general permit. This written notification must include the owner's or operator's
legal name and address, the number and type of facilities to be covered, the facility locations, the names of the receiving
waters into which discharge will occur. The facilities authorized to discharge under a final general permit will
receive written notification from EPA, Region I, within 30 days of permit coverage. Failure to submit to EPA, Region
I, a notice of intent to be covered or failure to receive from EPA written notification of permit coverage means that
the facility is not authorized to discharge. 




C. Effluent Limitations 



1. Statutory Requirements 

 

The Clean Water Act requires all dischargers to meet effluent limitations based on the technological capability
of dischargers to control the discharge of the pollutants. Section 301(b)(1)(A) requires the application of ``Best
Practicable Control Technology Currently Available'' (BPT). Section 301(b)(2) (A), (C), (D), and (F) requires
the application of ``Best Available Technology Economically Available'' (BAT) by July 1, 1984, for all toxic pollutants
referred to in Table 1 of Committee Print Numbered 95-30 of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation
of the House of Representatives and not later than three years after the date any limitations are established for toxic
pollutants listed under paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 307 of the Act which are not referred to in subparagraph
(C) of Section 301(b)(2). Section 301(b)(2)(A) and (F) requires ``Best Available Treatment Technology Economically
Achievable'' (BAT) for nonconventional pollution by July 1, 1984, and Section 301(b)(2)(E) requires the application
of the Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology (BCT) for conventional pollutants by July 1, 1984. The effluent
limitations in the general permit are consistent with these statutory requirements. 




2. Technology-based Effluent Limitations 
 



The Environmental Protection Agency has not developed effluent guidelines for water treatment facilities. In the
absence of national standards, effluent limitations for the TSS limitations are based upon best professional judgement
pursuant to Section 401(a)(1) of the CWA. 
 

The ``Maximum Daily'' TSS limitation and the limitations for settleable solids and pH are based upon state certification
requirements under Section 401(a)(1) of the CWA, 40 CFR 124.53 and 124.55, and water quality considerations. 




3. Water Quality Standards 
 



The effluent from the water treatment facility may contain toxic pollutants due to use of chemicals and chlorine.
However, they do not contain hazardous pollutants or oil and grease. Therefore, water quality criteria established
for oil and grease and hazardous pollutants do not apply to these discharges. Water Quality Standards applicable
to these discharges are limited to pH, seettleable solids, and TSS. In addition testing requirements are necessary
for aluminum, chlorine and LC50, C-NOEC. The limits of total residual chlorine and aluminum for the state of
Maine are based upon state certification requirements. 




4. Antidegradation Provisions 
 



The conditions of the permit reflect the goal of the CWA and EPA to achieve and maintain water quality standards. The
environmental regulations pertaining to the State Antidegradation Policies which protect the State's surface
waters from falling below State standards for water quality are found in the following provisions: Maine Title 38,
Article 4-A, Section 464.4.F.; Massachusetts Water Quality Standards 314 CMR 4.04 Antidegradation Provisions;
and New Hampshire policy RSA 485-A:8, VI Part Env-Ws 437.01 and Env-Ws 437.02. 
 


This general permit will not apply to any new or increased discharge unless it can be determined that such discharges
will result in insignificant effects to the receiving waters. This determination shall be made in accordance with
the appropriate State Antidegradation Policies. 
 



5. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements 
 



Effluent limitations and monitoring requirements are included in the general permit describing requirements to
be imposed on facilities to be covered. 
 

Facilities covered by the final general permits will be required to submit to EPA, Region I, and the appropriate State
a Discharge Monitoring Report containing effluent data on a semi-annual basis. 
 

The monitoring requirements have been established to yield data representative of the discharge under authority
of Section 308(a) of the Act and 40 CFR 122.41(j), 122.44(i) and 122.48, and as certified by the State. 




III. Other Requirements 




The remaining conditions of the permit are based on the NPDES regulations 40 CFR parts 122 through 125 and consist primarily
of management requirements common to all permits.

IV. State Certification 


Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Act requires that NPDES permits contain conditions which ensure compliance with applicable
State water quality standards or limitations. Section 401 requires that States certify that Federally issued permits
are in compliance with State law. 
These permits are for operations within waters of the States. EPA is requesting the States to review and provide appropriate
certification to these general permits pursuant to 40 CFR 124.53. 


V. Administrative Aspects 


A. Request To Be Covered 


Owners or operators of water treatment facility discharges are not covered by this general permit until they meet
two requirements. First, they must send a letter of intent to EPA indicating that they meet the requirements of the
permit and wish to be covered. Second, they must be notified by EPA that they are covered by a general permit. If the facility
has an existing individual NPDES permit, it will be terminated as outlined in 40 CFR 122.28(b)(2)(iv). 


B. Mechanisms 


All persons, including dischargers who believe any condition of the draft permit is inappropriate must raise all
issues and submit all available arguments and supporting material for their arguments in full by the close of the public
comment period, to the U. S. EPA, Wastewater Management Branch, WMN, JFK Federal Building, Boston, Massachusetts,
02203. Any person, prior to such date, may submit a request in writing for a public hearing to consider the draft permit
to EPA and the State Agency. Such requests shall state the nature of the issues proposed to be raised in the hearing.
A public hearing may be held after at least a 30-day public notice whenever the Regional Administrator finds that response
to this notice indicates significant interest. In reaching a final decision on the draft permits, the Regional Administrator
will respond to all significant comments and make these responses available to the public at EPA's Boston office.

Following the close of the comment period, and after the public hearing, if such hearing is held, the Regional Administrator
will issue a final permit in the 

Federal Register

. 


C. The Coastal Zone Management Act 


The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. 1451 

et seq.,

 and its implementing regulations [15 CFR Part 930] require that any federally licensed activity affecting the coastal
zone with an approved Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) be determined to be consistent with the CZMA. EPA, Region
I, has determined that these general NPDES permits are consistent with the CZMA. EPA has requested the Massachusetts,
Maine, and New Hampshire coastal zone agencies for a determination that these three permits are consistent with their
respective State policies. 


D. The Endangered Species Act 


EPA Region I has concluded that the discharges to be covered by the general NPDES permits will not affect or jeopardize
the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or adversely affect its critical habitat. EPA has
requested consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to confirm
this conclusion. 


E. Environmental Impact Statement Requirements 


The general permits do not authorize the construction of any water resources project or the impoundment of any water
body or have any effect on historical property, and are not major Federal activities needing preparation of any Environmental
Impact Statement. Therefore, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1273 

et seq.,

 the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C 470 

et seq.,

 the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, 16 U.S.C. 661 

et seq., 

and the National Environmental Policy Act, 33 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.,

 do not apply to the issuance of this general NPDES permit. 


VI. Other Legal Requirements 


A. Economic Impact (Executive Order 12866) 


EPA has reviewed the effect of Executive Order 12866 on this draft general permit and has determined that it is not a
significant rule under that order. This regulation was submitted previously to the Office of Management and Budget
for review as required by the former Executive Order 12291. The Office of Management and Budget exempted this action
from the review requirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant to Section 8(b) of that Order, which was revoked and
superseded by Executive Order 12866. 


B. Paperwork Reduction Act 


EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities by these draft general NPDES permits under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et. seq.

 The information collection requirements of these draft permits have already been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget under submissions made for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean Water Act. No comments
from the Office of Management and Budget or the public were received on the information collection requirements in
these permits. 


C. The Regulatory Flexibility Act 


After review of the facts presented in the notice printed above, I hereby certify, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C.
605(b), that this permit does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Moreover, the
draft permit will reduce a significant administrative burden on regulated sources.

Appendix A_Draft General Permit 


Proposed Draft General Permit Under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) 




Note:

 The Following draft general NPDES permit has been combined for purposes of this 

Federal Register

 notice in order to eliminate duplication of material common to all permits for the individual states.

 

1. Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire Draft General Permit. 
In 

compliance

 with the provisions of the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended, (33 U.S.C. 1251 et.seq.) the ``CWA'' operators of facilities
located in Part II A. which discharge effluent from water treatment facilities as defined in Part IB at a rate of one
million gallons per day or less to waters as designated in Part II A in accordance with effluent limitations, monitoring
requirements and other conditions set forth herein.

Part I 


A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements 


1. During the period beginning effective date and lasting through expiration, the permittee is authorized to discharge
from each outfall effluent from water treatment facilities to receiving waters as designated in Part II A. 
a. Such discharges shall be limited and monitored by the permittee as specified below: 






b. The discharge shall not cause objectionable discoloration of the receiving waters. 
c. There shall be no discharge of floating solids or visible foam. The discharge shall be adequately treated to insure
that the surface water remains free from pollutants in concentratins or combinations that settle to form harmful
deposits, float as foam, debris, scum or other visible pollutants. It shall be adequately treated to insure that the
surface waters remain free from pollutants which produce odor, color, taste or turbidity in the receiving water which
is not naturally occuring and would render it unsuitable for its designated use. 
d. The effluent limitations are based on the state water quality standard and are certified by the states. 
e. Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements specified above shall be taken at the point of discharge.

f. All discharges as designated in IB shall pass through a settling pond for 24 hours minimum detention time or other
approved treatment system and meet the effluent limitations in Part I.1.a. prior to discharge to waters of the states.

g. pH. Massachusetts. 
The pH of the effluent shall not be less than nor greater than the range given for the receiving water classifications,
unless these values are exceeded due to natural causes. 
The following table specifies ranges for Massachussetts: 






Maine 


The pH range in both freshwater and saltwater is 6.0 to 8.5 su. Unless establishes on a case-by-case basis (By State
Policy). 


New Hampshire 


The pH of the effluent shall not be less than 6.5 standard units (su) nor greater than 8.0 su at any time unless these values
are exceeded due to natural causes. 
h. One chronic and modified acute toxicity screening test shall be performed by the permittee within 90 days after
the issuance date of this general NPDES permit. One grab sample will be taken during normal facility operation. The
Cerio-daphnia dubia for fresh water and sea-urchin for marine water shall be used as test organism in the test. A copy
of the test procedure and detailed protocol will be provided upon request from EPA, Region I. The results of the chronic
biological test (C-NOEC and LC50) will be forwarded to State and EPA within 30 days after the completion of all
tests. 
i. The states of Massachusetts and New Hampshire will have a maximum daily limit of 1.0 mgd. The state of Maine will have
a maximum daily limit of 0.15 mgd. 
j. For the states of Massachusetts and New Hampshire report only. For the state of Maine the maximum daily limit of Aluminum
will be 5.0 mg/l.

System (NPDES) permit no. AK-G52-0000 for seafood processors in Alaska pursuant to the provisions of the Clean
Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

 The proposed general NPDES permit will authorize discharges from offshore, nearshore and shore-based vessels and
onshore facilities engaged in the processing of fresh, frozen, canned, smoked, salted and pickled seafoods. The
proposed permit will also authorize discharges from offshore vessels (operating more than one nautical mile from
shore at MLLW) that are engaged in the processing of seafood paste, mince or meal. The proposed permit will authorize
discharges of processing wastes, process disinfectants, sanitary wastewater and other wastewaters, including
domestic wastewater, cooling water, boiler water, gray water, freshwater pressure relief water, refrigeration
condensate, water used to transfer seafood to a facility, and live tank water. The proposed permit will authorize
discharges to waters of the United States in and contiguous to the State of Alaska, except for receiving waters excluded
from coverage as protected, special, at-risk, degraded or adjacent to a designated ``seafood processing center.''




The proposed general NPDES permit for seafood processors in Alaska will not authorize discharges from nearshore
or shore-based seafood processors of mince, paste or meal (operating one nautical mile or less from shore at MLLW).
The proposed permit will not authorize discharges of petroleum hydrocarbons, toxic pollutants, or other pollutants
not specified in the permit. The proposed permit will not authorize discharges to waters excluded from coverage as
protected, special, at-risk, degraded or adjacent to a designated ``seafood processing center.'' 

A draft NPDES permit, fact sheet and other documents of the administrative record are available upon request. 

PUBLIC NOTICE ISSUANCE DATE: Monday, July 25, 1994. 

PUBLIC NOTICE EXPIRATION DATE: Tuesday, August 23, 1994.

After the expiration date of the public notice, the Director, Water Division, EPA Region 10, will make a final determination

Attachment 1._Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI) 



To All Interested Government Agencies, Public Groups, and Individuals: 

In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) procedures for complying with the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), 40 CFR Part 6, Subpart F, EPA has conducted an environmental review of the following proposed action:


Reissuance of general National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit no. AK-G52-000
to owners and operators of facilities engaged in the processing of seafood, both floating and onshore facilities,
in certain waters of the State of Alaska and waters of the United States adjacent to the Alaska State Waters 

The general NPDES permit requirements, including effluent limitations, monitoring provisions, and other conditions
applicable to the operations covered are specified in the proposed permit. The permit fact sheet describes the basis
for the permit provisions. 

An environmental assessment (EA) for this proposed action has been prepared. Under the proposed action, those new
source seafood processing facilities which are excluded from the general NPDES permit will continue to be subject
to individual NEPA reviews, involving preparation of an EA and, if impacts could be significant, an environmental
impact statement (EIS). 

Based on the EA, and in accordance with the guidelines for determining the significance of federal actions (40 CFR
1508.27) and EPA criteria for initiating an EIS (40 CFR 6.605), EPA has concluded that reissuance of the General NPDES
Permit will not result in a significant effect on the human environment. This action will not significantly affect
land use patterns or population, wetlands or floodplains, threatened or endangered species, farmlands, ecologically
critical areas, historic resources, air quality, water quality, noise levels, fish and wildlife resources, nor
will it conflict with approved local, regional, or state land use plans or policies. For the above reasons EPA has determined
that an EIS will not be prepared. A copy of the EA evaluating the potential impacts of the proposed action and explaining
why an EIS is not required is available upon request by calling (206) 553-1761, or at the above address, and is
incorporated into this FNSI by reference. 

Comments supporting or disagreeing with this FNSI may be submitted to EPA at the above address for consideration.
After evaluating the comments received, EPA will make a final decision. No administrative action will be taken on
the proposed reissuance for at least 30 days after the release date (indicated above) of this FNSI. EPA will fully consider
all comments received during this public notice period before taking final action. 

  Sincerely,

<DOCTITLE>Addendum to Announcement 101; Program Announcement and Availability of Funds for FY 1994 Demonstration Projects
for the Development of State Immunization Information Systems </DOCTITLE>



Introduction 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through the National Immunization Program (NIP) and the CDC
Information Network for Public Health Officials (CDC INPHO), announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994
supplemental grant funds to implement pilot demonstrations of statewide immunization information systems. Funds
provided by this announcement will be divided into two parts or components. This is an addendum to Program Announcement
Number 101. 
Component One will provide funds for the development of the core or central operating system for the State Immunization
Information System (SIIS). While grantees should plan for the eventual implementation of a total statewide system,
this announcement provides funding only for the acquisition and installation of hardware and software for centralized
data storage, linkages, and interfaces to other systems from the State office. If a grantee already has an immunization
information system, they may apply for funds to expand or enhance their system. The level of funding, however, will
be predetermined and based upon the hardware and software needed to manage a specific number of new patient records
as indicated by the number of live births occurring in a State each year. 
Component Two will provide funds for developing, acquiring, installing, and maintaining statewide information
systems and communications networks that support the goals of the SIIS and of the CDC Information Network for Public
Health Officials (CDC INPHO). When implemented, these statewide networks will enable public health personnel to
communicate with each other and with CDC by exchanging electronic mail, accessing CDC information databases, and
exchanging public health data. The networks will be fully integrated into and supportive of statewide immunization
information systems. These integrated networks and systems will serve to ensure the highest possible vaccination
levels of children by recording individual immunization events, prompting follow-up of those children who missed
their scheduled vaccinations, and allowing for the confidential exchange of immunization information between
States to ensure continuity of care. 
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Immunization and Infectious Diseases. (To order a copy
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section entitled 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

.) 


Authority 


This program is authorized under Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 247b, as amended. Applicable
program regulations are found in 42 CFR Part 51b, Subparts A and B. 


Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 


Assistance will be provided only to departments of public health in each State; New York, New York; District of Columbia;
Puerto Rico; Virgin Islands and U.S. territories located in the Pacific Basin; hereafter referred to as grantees.
This eligibility limitation is based on the governmental entity responsible for legislation on disseminating birth
certificate data. Grantees with no immunization information system in place are encouraged to apply. Grantees with
immunization information systems in place are encouraged to apply with the intent of upgrading, enhancing, or expanding
their current system to the conditions set forth in this announcement. 


Availability of Funds 


Approximately $7,000,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund two separate components of this Announcement. Of the $7 million,
approximately $5 million (Component One) will be available for grantees to implement the central or core portion
of a statewide immunization information system (SIIS) database. This will include hardware and software that will
eventually be required for interstate and intrastate transfer of immunization data. The average award is expected
to be $200,000, ranging from $100,000 to $400,000. The awards will be provided to approximately 20 grantees. The supplemental
awards will be made on or about September 15, 1994. Based on availability of funds, it is anticipated that additional
projects, if their applications are approved, will be awarded grants early in FY 1995 to install the core or centralized
portion of the SIIS. 
The remaining $2 million (Component Two) will be available for funding two to four grantees to develop wide-area telecommunication
networks. The average award is expected to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000 per year for up to three years and will
be made for a 12-month activity period within a three year period of performance, beginning in FY 1994. These awards
will be made on or about September 30, 1994. 






Note: 

Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. 




Additional awards for Component Two only, will be made based on satisfactory progress of developing and maintaining
statewide informational systems and communication networks that support the goals of State immunization information
systems and of the CDC INPHO, and the availability of funds. 


Purpose 


The purpose of this grant program is to ensure that the following automated systems are in place for each State by October
1, 1996: 


 A system that ensures the adequate immunization of at least 90 percent of all children born on or after October
1, 1994. 
 A system that ensures the follow-up of children who miss scheduled vaccinations. 
 A secure and confidential system that enables appropriate health care providers within States to access a
child's vaccination record to determine their status. 

 A system that monitors adverse reactions to immunizing agents.

<PARENT> FR940728-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 A system that monitors vaccine distribution and usage. 


The distribution of grant funds has been systematic. Funds were provided in FY 1993 for each project area to conduct
a needs assessment. In FY 1994, funds were available to each grantee to develop short- and long-range plans using the
data acquired from the needs assessment. Funds are now available for the next step_the installation of the core or
central portion of the SIIS. 

This grant announcement is divided into two components: 
(1) To implement a core or central computerized immunization information system and communications interfaces
that will allow transfer of immunization information on an intra- and interstate network between heterogenous systems
(Component One). 
(2) To develop and implement statewide telecommunications networks that will eventually connect CDC, State, and
local health agencies. These networks (local area networks and wide area networks) will directly link with and support
the National Immunization Program (NIP) immunization information system goals and objectives (Component Two).

Therefore, applicants may apply for funding for one of the following: 
1. Component One only. 
2. Component Two only. 
3. Components One and Two. 


Program Requirements 


To receive funds, each applicant must satisfactorily address the following program elements for funding Component
One. 
1. Complete and submit a satisfactory needs assessment and plan for implementing an immunization information system(s).

2. Develop and implement an initial immunization record in the SIIS database using an electronic birth registry interface
or an appropriate alternative method which would capture all infants in the State's annual birth cohort. 
3. Provide evidence of cooperation, coordination, and collaboration between the State health department and the
various local public and private health care agencies that will be involved in the planning, development, and implementation
of SIIS. 
4. Demonstrate the capability to expand the number of other systems that are able to interface effectively with SIIS.

5. Provide assistance and the physical space for the installation of the communications lines, hardware and software.

6. Prepare to coordinate demonstration activities among State and local data processing units, State immunization
program, and major immunization health care providers, e.g., health department clinics, health maintenance organizations,
hospital outpatient clinics, community health centers. 
7. Seek support from the health community and professional organizations in promoting acceptance and participation
in the SIIS activities. 
8. Demonstrate the use of other funding resources to include redirecting existing funds, unobligated funds, IAP
funds, funds from other Federal, State, or private sources and the like. 
9. Provide an estimate of State, local, or other funds spent to date on the development of a statewide immunization
system or an integrated system of which immunization is a part. Also provide an estimate of the amount of State, local,
or other funds that will be needed to complete the statewide system. 
10. Describe hardware and software requirements and estimated costs. Growth and flexibility of the system must be
considered in the purchase of hardware and software. 






Note: 

State immunization information systems must meet or exceed the System Fault Tolerance Level II standard described
in Novell operating systems manuals, including disk mirroring, differential backups, off-site storage of backups,
continuous and non-interrupted power and power surge protection. The system(s) should potentially be capable of
24-hour operation. Downtime episodes must not exceed 30 minutes and must not occur more than once a month. 




11. Describe personnel requirements and estimated costs. There will not be enough funds from this grant to support
all the personnel the grantee may believe are required. If additional personnel are needed, the grantee can apply
for funds under the Immunization Action Plan or through local or State funds. 
12. Describe training requirements and estimated costs. Personnel will receive support for technical and programmatic
training. The development of an automated system of this magnitude with the number of interfaces that will be necessary
will require close collaboration with CDC staff in conjunction with appropriate training. Training may occur within
the State, at CDC in Atlanta, or at a designated conference site. Project personnel may obtain training on- or off-site
from private vendors. 
13. Describe travel requirements and estimated costs. Close collaboration with CDC and other applicants is essential
for the development of SIIS. Funds for periodic training and CDC meetings for the purpose of information sharing will
be supported. 
To receive funds for Component Two, grantees must satisfactorily address the following program elements: 
1. The grantee should develop a plan that addresses three phases: (1) electronic linkage via computer networks among
State and local public health agencies, (2) rapid and efficient access to local, State and Federal information needed
by public health practitioners, and (3) electronic data exchange. The plan addressing each of these three phases
should address planning, implementation, and evaluation. 


A. Linkage 


The goal of this element is to establish computer network linkages with and among the various component agencies within
the State public health system and also to investigate or establish linkages with primary care providers, especially
large organizations, such as managed care organizations. The plan for this element should include: 


i. Planning Phase

user training) between local and State health departments and CDC, including an Internet interface. 
 User applications, including support and training. 


iii. Evaluation Phase 


 Demonstrate that there has been an adequate inclusion of all agencies and organizations that will be critical
to successful implementation of elements B and C below (i.e., Information Access and Data Exchange). 
 Thorough specification of existing public health related systems infrastructure and current plans for and
funding sources for expanding this infrastructure. 


B. Information Access 


i. Planning Phase 


 Grantee should specify the types of immunization information needed to assist public health personnel to
more effectively improve and protect the health of the public. For example, directories of training resources, guidelines
for disease prevention, operational guidelines for prevention programs, State information databases, etc., to
which online access would be desirable. 
 Grantee should specify the process through which these information resources will be determined and developed.



ii. Implementation Phase 


 Grantee must present an implementation strategy and timeline for placing these information resources into
electronic access. 


iii. Evaluation Phase 


 Grantee should present an evaluation plan that provides a basis for determining the impact that access to the
immunization information databases (item B.i.) above has on changing the practice of public health and potentially
the outcomes as measured by health status indicators. 


C. Data Exchange 


Future public health information systems should provide for efficient capture, transmission and exchange of the
universe of data relevant to the practice of public health. 


i. Planning Phase 


 Grantee must describe the State's approach to state-wide public health data system integration, the goal
of which is to provide efficient capture, transmission and exchange of public health data (e.g., patient specific
data, immunization events, vital records, disease surveillance and reporting data, population based assessments,
etc.). 
 The plan should specify how the State is proceeding or will proceed to develop an integrated data system to meet
the future needs of public health. Where appropriate, the plan should discuss plans for electronic interaction with
non-government health care organizations, such as managed care organizations, private practitioners, etc. 


ii. Implementation Phase 


 The grantee should present a data system implementation plan and system design with timeliness and development
schedules. 


iii. Evaluation Phase 


 The grantee's evaluation plan should correspond to the goals (as identified in the PURPOSE section of this
announcement) of the integrated State system and include an inventory of existing health-related information systems.

2. Hardware and software requirements and estimated costs. 
3. Personnel requirements and estimated costs. 
4. Training requirements and estimated costs. 
5. Travel requirements and estimated costs. 
6. Other funding sources, if any, supporting project activities.

In formulating an approach, grantees are strongly encouraged to use the structure, technical descriptions, core
data set, etc., which are included in the application kit. 

CDC supports the concept of comprehensive health information systems which give priority to the immunization information
function. Documentation must be provided (amount of dollars and source) by the project if funds from other sources
will also be used to support the development of a comprehensive health information systems. CDC will also support,
in concept, the use of limited grant funds, if approved, for the development of some hardware or software interfaces
that will ensure that key linkages can be made, such as to State offices of vital statistics and managed health care
organizations. 



Review and Evaluation Criteria 



Applications for funds for the State Immunization Information System will be evaluated by a CDC-appointed Objective
Review Committee (ORC) whose members have expertise in disease prevention and service delivery. These reviewers
will be persons representing a variety of disciplines and may or may not have specific expertise with immunization
programs or automated data processing systems. Grantees, therefore, should consider the clarity of presentation
and the use of terms that are widely understood or clearly defined. The ranking of scores made by the committee and program
need will determine which grantees will be funded in FY 1994 and FY 1995 for Component One, as well as which grantees
will be funded for Component Two. 

Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria (Component One and Component Two
will be reviewed separately according to the criteria set forth below): 

A. The applicant's understanding of the purpose of the program, the appropriateness and feasibility of the stated
activities to meet the criteria set forth in the announcement, and the likelihood that the activities conducted by
the applicant will achieve the desired outcomes. (Component One: 10 points); (Component Two: 25 points) 

B. The extent to which background information and other data demonstrate that the applicant has the appropriate organizational
structure, administrative and technical support, accessibility to birth records, and accessibility to immunization
records of the target population to implement the project and produce statistically valid results, evidence of support
from public and private agencies and providers, and the ability to accomplish project objectives. (Component One:
15 points); (Component Two: N/A) 

C. The degree to which long-term and short-term objectives are consistent with the purpose of the demonstration project
and are realistic, specific, measurable, and time-phased. (Component One: 15 points); (Component Two: 15 points)


D. The quality of the plan of operation for developing and implementing proposed activities and the degree to which
the plan specifies the what, who, where, how, and the timing for start and completion of each activity. (Component
One: 20 points); (Component Two: 15 points) 

E. The degree to which the evaluation plan can be used in measuring achievement of each objective and the quality of
methods and techniques to be used. (Component One: 10 points); (Component Two: 15 points) 

F. The extent to which methods and strategies proposed are financially feasible and have a system capacity to link
with the SIISs in other States. (Component One: 15 points); (Component Two: 15 points) 

G. The extent to which qualified and experienced personnel are available to carry out the proposed activities of the
project. (Component One: 15 points); (Component Two: 15 points) 

In addition, consideration will be given to the extent to which the budget request is clearly explained, adequately
justified, reasonable, and consistent with the intended use of funds, and the extent to which the applicant is contributing
its own resources to childhood immunization activities.

Maps identifying these lands, restrictions, and exempted motorized vehicle routes are available at the Las Vegas
District Office.
Authority for this interim closure and use restrictions is found in 43 CFR 8364.1 and 8342. Violation of these rules
are punishable by a fine not to exceed $100,000 ($200,000 if the violator is an organization), imprisonment not to
exceed 12 months, or both, as provided for under the Federal Land Policy Management Act (Pub. L. 94-579) as amended
by 18 U.S.C. 3571(b)(5).



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The purpose of this interim closure and use restrictions is to provide increased protection for desert tortoise populations
and their habitat until final approval and implementation of the comprehensive Stateline Resource Management Plan.
The desert tortoise is listed as a threatened species under the Federal Endangered Species Act and is afforded increased
protection under terms of the Act.


On May 15, 1991 the Bureau of Land Management became a signatory to the Clark County Short-Term Desert Tortoise Habitat
Conservation Plan. On August 12, 1991 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved the plan. Under this plan, the Bureau
of Land Management agreed to take appropriate management actions, within certain areas established for conservation
of desert tortoises and their habitat, through procedures outlined in the plan. Recommendations were made to the
Bureau of Land Management by the Clark County Habitat Conservation Plan Implementation and Monitoring Committee
that certain areas within Eldorado Valley and Nelson Hills should be closed to motorized vehicular traffic except
for existing roads and trails or, designated roads and trails. This action would afford increased protection of desert
tortoises and their habitat. This closure will provide the basis for effective enforcement of these protective measures.
This closure is adjacent to and compliments a previous Interim Closure of Public Lands in Eldorado Valley issued by


Federal Register

 Notice on Monday, December 6, 1993 (Vol. 58, No. 232).

<DOCTITLE>Quarterly Status Report of Water Service and Repayment Contract Negotiations</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Reclamation, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given of contractual actions that are new, modified, discontinued or completed since the last publication
of this notice on May 6, 1994. The May 6, 1994 notice should be used as a reference point to identify changes. This notice
is one means in which the public is informed about contractual actions for capital recovery and management of project
resources and facilities. Additional Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) announcements of individual contract
actions may be published in the 

Federal Register

 and in newspapers of general circulation in the areas determined by Reclamation to be affected by the proposed action.
Announcements may be in the form of news releases, legal notices, official letters, memorandums, or other forms of
written material. Meetings, workshops, and/or hearings may also be used, as appropriate, to provide local publicity.
These public participation procedures do not apply to proposed contracts for the sale of surplus or interim irrigation
water for a term of 1 year or less. Either of the contracting parties may invite the public to observe any contract proceedings.
All public participation procedures will be coordinated with those involved in complying with the National Environmental
Policy Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to section 226 of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1273) and 43 CFR 426.20 of the rules and regulations
published in 52 FR 11954, April 13, 1987, Reclamation will publish notice of proposed or amendatory contract actions
for any contract for the delivery of project water for authorized uses in newspapers of general circulation in the
affected area at least 60 days prior to contract execution. Pursuant to the ``Final Revised Public Participation
Procedures'' for water resource-related contract negotiations, published in 47 FR 7763, February 22, 1982, a tabulation
is provided of all proposed contractual actions in each of the five Reclamation regions. Each proposed action is,
or is expected to be, in some stage of the contract negotiation process in 1994. When contract negotiations are completed,
and prior to execution, each proposed contact form must be approved by the Secretary, or pursuant to delegated or redelegate
authority, the Commissioner of Reclamation or one of the Regional Directors. In some instances, congressional review
and approval of a report, water rate, or other terms and conditions of the contract may be involved.



Public participation in and receipt of comments on contract proposals will be facilitated by adherence to the following
procedures: 

11. Only persons authorized to act on behalf of the contracting entities may negotiate the terms and conditions of
a specific contract proposal

2. Advance notice of meetings or hearings will be furnished to those parties that have made a timely written request
for such notice to the appropriate regional or project office of Reclamation

3. Written correspondence regarding proposed contracts may be made available to the general public pursuant to the
terms and procedures of the Freedom of Information Act (80 Stat. 383) as amended.

4. Written comments on a proposed contract or contract action must be submitted to the appropriate Reclamation officials
at the locations and within the time limits set forth in the advance public notices.

5. All written comments received and testimony presented at any public hearings will be reviewed and summarized by
the appropriate regional office for use by the contract approving authority.

6. Copies of specific proposed contracts may be obtained from the appropriate Regional Director or his designated
public contact as they become available for review and comment.

7. In the event modifications are made in the form of a proposed contact, the appropriate Regional Director shall determine
whether republication of the notice and/or extension of the comment period is necessary.

Factors considered in making such a determination shall include, but are not limited to: (i) the significance of the
modification, and (ii) the degree of public interest which has been expressed over the course of the negotiations.
As a minimum, the Regional Director shall furnish revised contracts to all parties who requested the contract in response
to the initial public notice.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of availability of final environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality
Final Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508); and the Operational Procedures of the United States Section,
International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico (USIBWC), for Implementing Section 102 of
NEPA, published in the 

Federal Register

 September 2, 1981 (46 FR 44083); the USIBWC hereby gives notice that the Final Environmental Assessment and Final
Finding of No Significant Impact for Quisto Energy Corporation (Quisto) to construct, operate, and maintain a gas
well located on the Main Floodway of the Lower Rio Grande Flood Control Project (LRGFCP) are available. The USIWBWC
finds that the proposed action to issue a license to Quisto for such works is not a major federal action that would have
a significant adverse effect on the quality of the human environment. A Notice of Finding of No Significant Impact
was signed June 17, 1994, (59 FR 33303-33304) and provided a thirty (30) day review and comment period before
making the finding final.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Proposed Action



The action proposed is the USIBWC to issue a license to Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well and install
related features with Meyerhoff No. 3 Drilling Unit, Lot 271, Kelly-Pharr Subdivision, Hildalgo County, Texas.
The gas well is proposed to be located on privately owned land within the Main Floodway of the USIBWC LRGFCP approximately
8 kilometers (5 miles) southeast of the town of Pharr. Access to the drilling site is by way of existing county and private
roads. 



Alternatives Considered



Three alternatives were considered in the Environmental Assessment (EA):

The Proposed Action Alternative is for Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well in a cultivated field
within the Main Floodway of the USIBWC LRGFCP. The proposed action will require the USIBWC to issue a license to ensure
that such works do not cause an obstruction to flood flows within the floodway or interfere with the operation and maintenance
of the LRGFCP.

The No Action Alternative is for Quisto to not construct, operate, and maintain a gas well within the Main Floodway
of the LRGFCP. The no action alternative will not require the USIBWC to issue a license since no work will be done within
the LRGFRCP. The no action alternative will result in the denial of access to the mineral owner to rightfully owned
minerals, loss of tax revenues to the State of Texas, and result in an unrecoverable clean energy source.

The Directional Well alternative is for Quisto to drill a well from outside the Main Floodway to a depth below the proposed
surface location. The directional well alternative will not require the USIBWC to issue a license since no work will
be done within the LRGFCP. The directional well alternative is considered not workable because of a lack of an available
surface drillsite outside the Main Floodway and technical problems associated with a bottomhole location some 610
meters (2,000 feet) or more from the surface location.

Finding of the Final Environmental Assessment


The EA finds that the proposed action for Quisto to construct, operate, an maintain a gas well within the Main Floodway
of the USIBWC LRGFCP (and the USIBWC to issue a license for such work) does not constitute a major federal action which
would cause a significant local, regional, or national adverse impact on the environment based on the following facts:
1. The United States Army Corps of Engineers has determined that no waters of the United States including wetlands
will be impacted by the proposed gas well and related features.
2. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that federally listed endangered or threatened species
are unlikely to be adversely affected by the proposed gas well and related features.
3. The Texas Historical Commission and Department of Antiquities Protection have determined that no survey is required
and the project may proceed.
4. The USIBWC Water Resources Investigations Division has determined that the proposed gas well and related features
will have no significant effect upon the flood carrying capacity of the Main Floodway.

SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this notice is to announce a hearing, open to the public, on Submissions 

#

940001 and 

#

940002. These submissions, filed with the U.S. National Administrative Office, respectively, by the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, AFL-CIO, and the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America, involve

were published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 20, 1994.




Article 16(3) of the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) provides for the review of labor law matters
in Canada and Mexico by the U.S. National Administrative Office, in accordance with U.S. domestic procedures. Revised
procedural guidelines pertaining to the submission, review, and reporting process utilized by the Office were published
in the 

Federal Register 

on April 7, 1994. The guidelines provide for a hearing as part of the review.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Nature and Conduct of Hearing




As set out in the notices published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 20, 1994, the objective of the U.S. National Administrative Office's reviews of Submissions 

#

940001 and 

#

940002 is to gather information to assist it to better understand and publicly report on the Government of Mexico's
promotion of compliance with, and effective enforcement of, its labor law through appropriate government action,
as set out in Article 3 of the NAALC.

The allegations of both submissions relate principally to the right to freedom of association and the right to organize.
Accordingly, it is appropriate to consolidate the reviews for purposes of Section G, paragraph 3 of the procedural
guidelines, which provides for a hearing on a submission accepted for review.

The hearing will be conducted by the Secretary of the U.S. National Administrative Office or the Secretary's designee.
It will be open to the public. All proceedings will be conducted in English, with simultaneous translation provided
as the Secretary deems necessary. The public file for each submission, including written statements, briefs, and
requests to present oral testimony, will be made a part of the hearing record. The public file will also be available
for inspection at the Office prior to the hearing.

The hearing will be transcribed. A transcript of the proceedings will be made available for inspection, as provided
for in Section E of the procedural guidelines, or may be purchased from the reporting company. No cameras or recording
devices (other than any recording device used by the reporting company in connection with transcribing the hearing)
will be allowed.

Disabled persons should contact the Secretary of the U.S. National Administrative Office no later than fifteen days
prior to the date of the hearing if special accommodations are needed.




II. Written Statements or Briefs and Requests To Present Oral Testimony




Written statements or briefs shall provide a discussion of the information presented or position taken and shall
be legibly typed or printed. Requests to present oral testimony shall include the name, address, and telephone number
of the witness, the organization represented, if any, and any other information pertinent to the request. Five copies
of a statement or brief and a single copy of a request to present oral testimony shall be submitted to the Office at the
time of filing.

No request to present oral testimony will be considered unless accompanied by a written statement or brief. A request
to present oral testimony may be denied if the written statement or brief suggests that the information sought to be
provided is unrelated to the review of Submission 

#

940001 or 

#

940002 or for other appropriate reasons. The Office will notify each requester of the disposition of the request to
present oral testimony.

In presenting testimony, the witness should summarize the written statement or brief, may supplement the written
statement or brief with relevant information, and should be prepared to answer questions from the Secretary of the
U.S. National Administrative Office or the Secretary's designee. Oral testimony will ordinarily be limited to a
ten minute presentation, not including the time for questions. Persons desiring more than ten minutes for their presentation
should so state in the request, setting out reasons why additional time is necessary.

The requirements relating to the submission of written statements or briefs and requests to present oral testimony
may be waived by the Secretary of the U.S. National Administrative Office for reasons of equity and the public interest.

Cooper Industries; Cameron Forged Products Division, a/k/a Wyman-Gordon Forgings Co., Houston, TX; Amended Certification
Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance


In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on October 22, 1993, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm. The certification notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59492).
At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New
findings show that on May 26, 1994, Wyman-Gordon Forgings became the successor-in-interest firm to Cooper Industries.
The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports.
Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to show the correct name of the worker group.
The amended notice applicable to TA-W-28,925 is hereby issued as follows:
``All workers of the Cameron Forged Products Division of Cooper Industries, Houston, Texas the predecessor-in-interest
firm to Wyman-Gordon Forgings, Houston, Texas who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after
July 22, 1992 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialties, Inc., Manistee, MI; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for
Reconsideration </DOCTITLE>

 

On July 7, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative
Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm.
The Department's Negative Determination was issued on May 25, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30617). 

 The company submitted additional information showing a reduction in the production of refractories in the first
six months of 1994 compared to the same period in 1993. This reduction was accompanied by substantial increases of
company imports of refractories in the same period. 

 

Conclusion 

 

After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

(C) That the increase in imports contributed importantly to such workers' separations or threat of separation and
to decline in sales or production of such firm or subdivision; or

(2) That there has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like
or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision.



Negative Determinations NAFTA-TAA



NAFTA-TAA-000131; August F. Nielsen Co., Inc., Allentown, PA




The investigation revealed that criteria (3) & criteria (4) were not met. A Departmental survey revealed that
the manufacturers for whom August F. Nielsen Co. supplied contract labor did not utilize Mexican or Canadian contractors
for its production of boys' sleepwear, nor import boys' sleepwear from Mexico or Canada.

The investigation revealed that criteria (3) & criterion (4) were not met. There was no shift in production of
roses from the workers' firm to Mexico or Canada. The investigation further revealed that the roses produced by the
subject firm were marketed through affiliated distributors/wholesalers. These distributors also sell imported
roses; however, the imported roses were from countries other than Mexico and Canada.




NAFTA-TAA-00135; Twin Cities Tire & Retread, El Paso, TX




The investigation revealed that workers of the subject firm did not produce an article within the meaning of the Act.
The Department of Labor has consistently determined that the performance of services did not constitute production
of an article as required by the Trade Act of 1974.




NAFTA-TAA-00136; Farah Manufacturing Co., Farah USA, Inc., El Paso, TX




The investigation revealed that criteria (2) and (4) were not met. Farah's sales and production increased substantially

In 1993, employment increased on a temporary basis, to process a backlog of garments that needed finishing. Employment
declines in June 1994 resulted from the elimination of the backlog. After the layoff, employment levels in June 1994
continued to exceed the level of employment for fiscal year 1993.




NAFTA-TAA-00132; F.C.I., Freeman South Dakota




The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and (4) were not met. A survey of F.C.I.'s customers revealed that customers

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Approval of Class III Tribal Gaming Ordinances</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Indian Gaming Commission.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of approval of class III gaming ordinances.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of class III gaming ordinances approved by the Chairman of the National
Indian Gaming Commission.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) 25 U.S.C. 2701 

et seq., 

was signed into law on October 17, 1988. The IGRA established the National Indian Gaming Commission (the Commission).
Section 2710 of the IGRA authorizes the Commission to approve class II and class III tribal gaming ordinances. Section
2710(d)(2)(B) of the IGRA as implemented by 25 CFR 522.8 (58 FR 5811 (January 22, 1993)), requires the Commission to
publish, in the 

Federal Register

, approved class III gaming ordinances.



The IGRA requires all tribal gaming ordinances to contain the same requirements concerning ownership of the gaming
activity, use of net revenues, annual audits, health and safety, background investigations and licensing of key
employees. The Commission, therefore, believes that publication of each ordinance in the Federal Register would
be redundant and result in an unnecessary cost to the Commission. The Commission believes that publishing a notice
of approval of each class III gaming ordinance is sufficient to meet the requirements of 25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(2)(B).
Also, the Commission will make copies of approved class III ordinances available to the public upon request. Requests
can be made in writing to: National Indian Gaming Commission, 1850 M St., N.W., suite 250, Washington, D.C. 20036.

The Chairman has approved tribal gaming ordinances authorizing class III gaming for the following Indian tribes:






Campo Band of Mission Indians

Colusa Band of Wintun Indians

Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians

Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa/Chippewa Indians

Kootenai Tribe of Idaho

Pueblo of Pojoaque

Santa Rosa Band of Tachi Indians

Squaxin Island Tribe

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting
Accelerated Approval to Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Identification of Broker-Dealer
Orders



July 21, 1994.



On April 13, 1992, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposal to require that broker-dealer
orders be identified as such before being executed at the disseminated bid or offer price. On May 19, 1992, the PSE amended
the filing to eliminate duplicative language from Rule 6.85(c) by substituting a cross reference to proposed Rule
6.66(b) (``Amendment No. 1'').







The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on May 21, 1992.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the PSE's proposal, as amended.





The Exchange states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is to facilitate efficient options trading on the
PSE floor by requiring the identification of broker-dealer orders to the trading crowd so that market makers will
be aware of whether orders represented in the trading crowds are for public customers or broker-dealers. Under PSE
Rule 6.86, the ``Ten-Up Rule,'' floor brokers are required, prior to executing a ten-up order, to ascertain and note
on the subject order ticket whether any given order is for the account of a broker-dealer. Therefore, the PSE believes
that no additional burdens would be placed on floor brokers in executing orders under the proposed rule. The PSE also
believes that requiring broker-dealer orders to be identified as such will result in an improvement in the quality
of the Exchange's options markets and help to encourage trading crowds to provide greater volume guarantees to public
customers than the minimum ten-up amount.

Existing PSE Rules 6.66 and 6.85, and Options Floor Procedure Advice (``OFPA'') D-9 currently require account
information to be identified for the trading crowd in connection with the execution of orders on the floor. Rule 6.66(a)
requires members participating in transactions to immediately give up the name of the clearing member through whom
the transaction will be cleared. Rule 6.85(c) requires that orders for the account of a market maker be verbally identified
as such prior to the consummation of a transaction. Finally, OFPA D-9 provides that, if a floor broker requests
a market quotation and also requests the size of the market, the floor broker must indicate with his request the name
of the member organization for whom he is acting.

Under the proposal, if an order is for the account of a broker-dealer, a member must indicate by public outcry that such
order is for a broker-dealer if it is to be executed at the trading crowd's disseminated bid or offer price. Proposed
PSE Rule 6.66(b) and existing Rule 6.85(c) place identical obligations on floor brokers with respect to orders executed
for market makers. Under Amendment No. 1 to the proposal, Rule 6.85(c) would be amended to eliminate duplicative language
and replaced with a cross reference to 6.66(b). Although OFPA D-9 will be deleted, the substance of it is being
consolidated into Rule 6.66(b).

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5)
 in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the
public interest.





The Commission concludes that the PSE's proposal requiring members to identify broker-dealer orders to the trading
crowd will enhance the market-making mechanism on the PSE, thereby improving the markets for listed options on the
Exchange. Specifically, the Commission believes unnecessary delays in trading occasioned by the market maker's
need to inquire as to the account status of orders represented on the floor will be reduced or minimized.


Furthermore, under the PSE's current ``Ten-Up Rule,'' floor brokers are required to ascertain whether a given order
is for the account of a broker-dealer. Requiring a floor broker to verbally identify prior to consummation that an
order is undertaken on behalf of a broker-dealer should improve the quality of the PSE's options markets and enhance
market depth because trading crowd participants may be more inclined to provide greater volume guarantees to public
customers than the minimum ten-up amount. Finally, as the Commission has not received any negative comments from
broker-dealers or market makers potentially affected by the proposal, the Commission has no reason to believe that
the identification requirement will be particularly burdensome on them.






The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Accelerating approval will allow the Exchange to implement the complete rule change without delay. Further, the
purpose of the amendment is non-substantive, limited to amending Rule 6.85(c) so that it will cross-reference Rule
6.66(b), and, moreover, the substance of both Rules was fully described in the original filing.

Finding of No Significant Impact: Lakehead Pipe Line Company Pipeline at Neche, ND


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a finding of no significant impact with regard to an application to construct, connect, operate and maintain
a pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids across the U.S.-Canada border.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of State has conducted an environmental assessment of the proposed construction by Lakehead Pipe
Line Company of an oil pipeline across the international boundary at Neche, North Dakota. Based on the environmental
assessment and after reviewing all comments, the Department of State has concluded that issuance of a Presidential
Permit authorizing construction of the proposed pipeline will not have a significant effect on the human environment
within the United States. An environmental impact statement will not be prepared.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Lakehead Pipe Line Company, Limited Partnership has applied for a Presidential Permit to authorize construction,
connection, operation and maintenance of a 20 inch diameter pipeline to convey crude oil and natural gas liquids across
the border with Canada at Neche, North Dakota. The proposed pipeline would be constructed in the same right of way presently
occupied by three oil pipelines owned and operated by the company. The existing pipelines are operating at full capacity
and are unable to transport the volume of oil demanded by U.S. markets in the midwest. The purpose of the proposed new
pipeline is to eliminate this capacity constraint.



The Department of State has concluded that issuance of the permit will not have a significant effect on the quality
of the human environment within the United States. This finding is based on an environmental assessment conducted
by the Department of State which included a review of comments submitted in response to the Notice of Application published
on March 4, 1994. On the basis of the environmental assessment, a finding of no significant impact is adopted, and an
environmental impact statement will not be prepared.
Construction and operation of the proposed pipeline is subject to regulation by the North Dakota Public Service Commission
and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The Special Committee in its work should:


1. Review current requirements and associated frequency allocations for continuing validity both near and long
term.


2. Identify requirements for new or planned systems and concepts expected to come into being during the referenced
time-frame and recommended specific areas of the spectrum resource needed to satisfy these requirements.


3. Consider the political and regulatory implications, both domestic and international; of current and foreseen
demands upon the aeronautical frequency spectrum as they may relate to forthcoming World Radio Conferences of the
International Telecommunication Union, and recommend alternative strategies to satisfy such spectrum requirements
at these conferences and in the domestic regulatory form.


4. The committee should complete its work within ten months.

The Special Committee should:
1. Review and incorporate, to the maximum extent practical, information and knowledge gained form the design, test,
and implementation of the Universal Access System (UAS) prototype.
2. Review the present security/access control systems from a representative sample of each airport category. To
manage this process, an inventory/survey of present systems would have to be conducted.
3. Identify near-term approaches to improvement of maintainability, and easing the difficulties of hardware/software
modification.

4. Establish a plan for the progression of existing systems, toward a functionally standard system. This would include,
but not be limited to, the development of guidance on function, performance, hardware, software, and communications
standards for airport security/access control systems.

5. Establish a standard communications protocol/process and access media.

6. These characteristics, for both hardware and software, would be developed to achieve commonality to save life
cycle costs and to stimulate competition to the degree possible, they should promote upgrading of existing systems
to the standards.

7. The Special Committee needs to complete its work 9 months from delivery of the initial UAS prototype results.

<DOCTITLE>Accuride Corporation; Receipt of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance</DOCTITLE>



The Accuride Corporation (Accuride) of Henderson, Kentucky, has determined that some of its wheels fail to comply
with 49 CFR 571.120, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 120, ``Tire Selection and Rims for Vehicles
Other Than Passenger Cars,'' and has filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance
Reports.'' Accuride has also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C.
Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor
vehicle safety.

This notice of receipt of a petition is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise
of judgement concerning the merits of the petition.

FMVSS No. 120, Paragraph S5.2(b) requires that each wheel be marked with the rim size designation.

On January 11, 1994, Accuride produced an estimated 103 Accu-Forge 22.5  x  9.00 inch, 15 degree drop center,
one-piece tubeless dual wheels with incorrect size designations for the rim width. The wheels were incorrectly stamped
``22.5  x  8.25.'' The wheels should have been stamped ``22.5  x  9.00.'' All other stampings and markings
required by FMVSS No. 120 are correctly identified on each of the subject wheels.

Accuride supports its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:




Accuride has fully analyzed the issues surrounding the incorrect width designation on these wheels and has sought
the input of the others with particular expertise on this subject. Based upon all of this analysis and the information
obtained, it appears clear that there is no safety-related issue potentially arising from the incorrect width designations
indicated on the wheels.

According to the 1994 Tire and Rim Association Yearbook, the permissible tires on a 22.5  x  9.00 inch rim are the
295/75*22.5 and the 12*22.5. The permissible tires for use on a 22.5 x 8.25 inch rim are the 265/75*22.5, 295/75*22.5,
11*22.5, and the 12*22.5 size. Because the 12*22.5 and the 295/75*22.5 tires are acceptable on both the 8.25 inch and
9.00 inch rims, these tire combinations are not of concern. The remaining 11*22.5 and 265/75*22.5 tires that are specified
only for the 8.25 inch rim have been given particular attention. Acccuride has carefully evaluated all of the issues
surrounding the possible effect of use of such tires on a wider 9.00 inch rim. We have also solicited the input of two
major tire manufacturers and specifically inquired as to potential negative effects of such usage. Our analysis,
as well as that of the tire manufacturers, is that there is no safety-related issue. Load carrying capacities, air
retention, handling characteristics, and other aspects of performance will not be affected to any degree significant
to motor vehicle safety. The only potential effect of such usage results from the fact that the tires in question are
slightly more spread on the wider 9.00 inch rim resulting in some chance of reduction in tread wear to a minor degree.

It should also be pointed out that the 22.5  x  9.00 inch size is generally a special application tire and wheel
combination typically used in North America only on fleets requiring a particular larger tire for the needs of their
operation. The wheel in question is heavier and more expensive than a standard 8.25 inch wheel, and these fleets use
the product because of specific higher load requirements and would also use the larger tire to meet those same requirements.
It is, therefore, Accuride's conclusion that the possibility that narrower tires would be used on these wheels is
extremely remote.




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the petition of Accuride, described
above. Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C., 20590. It is requested but not required that
six copies be submitted.

All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application
and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date, will also be filed and will be considered
to the extent possible. When the petition is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to the authority indicated below.

Educational Media Research, Production, Distribution, and Training Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Funding Priorities.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes priorities under the Educational Media Research, Production, Distribution, and Training
Program. The Secretary takes this action to focus Federal financial assistance on those areas of greatest need. These
priorities are intended to ensure the continued availability of closed-captioned daytime television programming,
provide cultural experiences to deaf and hard of hearing individuals, continue to provide educational books on audiotapes
to people who are visually or print disabled, continue the operation of the captioned films/video distribution system,
and support video description of national television programming.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice contains five proposed priorities under the Educational Media Research, Production, Distribution,
and Training Program authorized under Part F of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The purposes
of the program are to promote the general welfare of deaf and hard of hearing individuals and individuals with visual
impairments, and to promote the educational advancement of individuals with disabilities. 


The priorities proposed in this notice would ensure the continued availability of closed-captioned daytime television
programming. In addition, the proposed priorities would support activities that provide cultural experiences
to enrich the lives of deaf and hard of hearing individuals, including children and youth, as well as adults. The proposed
priorities would provide educational reading materials and textbooks on audiotape to persons who are visually or
print disabled. 
Additional proposed priorities would support a captioned films/videos distribution system to provide hearing
impaired and other qualified individuals with access to captioned educational and general interest films and videos
on a nonprofit free loan basis, and video description of national television programming in order to make television
more accessible to persons with visual impairments. 
This program supports the National Education Goals by assisting those with disabilities in school readiness and
adult literacy. 
The Secretary will announce the final priorities in a 
notice in the 

Federal Register

. The final priorities will be determined by comments received in response to this notice, available funds, and other
considerations of the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, the content
of the final priorities, and the quality of the applications received. The publication of these proposed priorities
does not preclude the Secretary from proposing 
additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject to meeting applicable
rulemaking requirements.

 



Note: 

This notice of proposed priorities does 

not

 solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under these competitions will be published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrent with or following publication of the notice of final priorities. 


Priorities


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet the following
priorities. The Secretary proposes to fund under these competitions only those applications that meet these absolute
priorities:

Proposed Absolute Priority 1_Closed-Captioned Daytime Television Programs 



Background
 


This proposed priority would continue and expand closed-captioning of a variety of daytime television programs
broadcast nationally for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing during this segment of the day that has proven to be
the most difficult in terms of private sector support. 



Priority: 

To be considered for funding under this proposed priority, a project must_ 

(1) Include the criteria used to determine which programs are proposed for captioning. These criteria must take into
account the preference of consumers for particular programs, the diversity of programming available, and the contribution
of programs to the general educational and cultural experiences of individuals with hearing impairments; 

(2) Determine the total number of hours and the projected cost per hour for each program to be captioned; 

(3) For each proposed program to be captioned, identify the source of private or other public support and the projected
dollar amount of that support; 

(4) Identify the methods of captioning to be used for each hour and the projected cost per hour for each method used;


(5) Provide and maintain back-up systems that would ensure successful, timely captioning service; 

(6) Demonstrate the willingness of major national television networks and companies to permit captioning of their
programs; and 

(7) Implement procedures for monitoring the extent to which full and accurate captioning is provided and use this
information to make refinements in captioning operations. 



Proposed Absolute Priority 2_Cultural Experiences for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Individuals 



Background 



This priority supports a variety of cultural activities designed to enrich the lives of deaf and hard of hearing individuals,
including children and youth, as well as adults. These activities must use an integrated approach that mixes children,
youth, and adults, who are deaf and hard of hearing with those who can hear while conducting cultural experiences that
will increase public awareness and understanding of deafness and other hearing impairments and of the artistic and
intellectual achievements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals. 

During FY 1992 the Department funded projects that: (1) provided theatrical experiences for deaf and hard of hearing
individuals, and (2) used integrated approaches by having among 
cast members a mixture of deaf, hard of hearing and hearing performers. During FY 1993 cultural experiences were extended
specifically to younger people with hearing impairments and to the creation of art as well as theatrical experiences,
using the same approaches. Projects under this proposed priority can include a variety of artistic approaches such
as the creation of works of art (painting, drawing, designing, etc.), dance, and storytelling, as well as developing
and performing dramatic productions. A grantee 

may not 

use funds under this priority for passive activities such as viewing a play or video, or passively watching a storyteller
or artist at work. 



Priority: 

To be considered for funding under this priority, a project must_ 


(1) Use an integrated approach that mixes children, youth, and adults who are deaf and hard of hearing, with those who
are hearing in carrying out project activities; and 


(2) Develop and implement strategies that will increase public awareness and understanding of deafness and other
hearing impairments and of the artistic and intellectual achievements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals, including
children, youth, and adults. Outreach activities such as promoting the project to schools, community organizations,
news media, and relevant national organizations are encouraged. 



Invitational Priority 




Within this absolute priority 2, the Secretary is particularly interested in applications that meet the following
invitational priority. However, pursuant to 34 CFR 75.105(c)(i), an application that meets this invitational priority
does not receive competitive or absolute preference over applications that do not meet this priority:

Projects that include people from a variety of cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds.


Proposed Absolute Priority 3_Captioned Films and Videos Distribution System


Background


This proposed priority would support the operation of a captioned films/videos distribution system which provides
deaf and hard of hearing individuals, as well as other eligible individuals with disabilities, with access to captioned
educational and general interest films and videos on a nonprofit free-loan basis. Activities under this proposed
priority include, but are not limited to: 1) a computerized user-registration process; 2) circulation of captioned
films and videos; 3) development or updating of a catalog of captioned films and videos in the collection; and 4) outreach
activities. This proposed priority would provide students and other eligible individuals with disabilities with
captioned films and videos so they may benefit from the same educational media used to enrich the educational experiences
of students and other individuals who do not have disabilities. 



Priority: 

To be considered for funding under this proposed priority, the project must_



(1) Develop strategies and procedures to be implemented in operating a distribution system, consisting of local
and regional centers including depositories, and one central general interest and educational films/video center.
Local and regional centers may include State schools for disabled individuals, public or private school systems,
public libraries, colleges or universities, or other distribution points that distribute captioned films/videos.

(2) Ensure that the system permits interdepository circulation of captioned films/videos, allows individuals,
depositories, and local and regional centers to access booking information from the computerized depositories
and the general interest and educational films/video center via modem and 

generic 

communication software, and provides immediate confirmation or denial of a request; 
(3) Establish and describe the computerized registration procedures that will be used to register users. The current
computerized system configuration may be used as a basis; 
(4) Develop and implement criteria and procedures for replacing irreparable films/videos; 
(5) Prepare, update, and distribute copies of a catalog listing all captioned films/videos available under this
project; 
(6) Convene an annual meeting of depository managers, librarians, and audiovisual and other personnel from local,
regional, and State educational agencies for the purpose of training, planning, sharing, brainstorming, and other
activities related to improving the access of eligible individuals to audiovisual materials. The Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area will be the site of the meeting; 
(7) Implement outreach activities, especially activities that reach out to local school systems to make them aware
of the open and closed captioned materials that are available to them under this program and from other sources; and

(8) Submit quarterly progress reports to the grants and project officers.


Proposed Absolute Priority 4_Recorded Audio Cassettes for Visually and Print Disabled Students


Background


This proposed priority would support recording, producing, duplicating, and distributing 15/16 ips (inch per second)
four-track cassette versions of textbooks and other educational reading materials for students (elementary, secondary,
postsecondary & graduate) who are visually or print disabled. These cassette tapes will help provide equal educational
opportunities to target students and lessen some of the barriers they face in classrooms. 


Priority: 

To be considered for funding under this priority, the project must_

(1) Handle all requests for materials, including confirmation of eligibility by disability; 
(2) Arrange for use of copyrights from publishers of supplied textbooks; 
(3) Record or duplicate the books on 15/16 ips (inch per second), four-track cassettes of one hour per track recording
time. (Publishers must be provided rights to copies of the master tape and rights to market the cassettes as they see
fit); 
(4) Mail the cassettes on a free-loan, postage paid basis; and 
(5) Handle returned cassettes, preservative re-recording, and all other associated administrative and circulation
functions. 
(6) To the extent that funds are not sufficient to meet the demand for free materials, place a priority on providing
free materials that are not otherwise required to be provided by educational agencies or institutions.


Proposed Absolute Priority 5_Video Description Project


Background


This proposed priority supports the description of national television programming in order to make television
more accessible to persons with visual impairments. The intent of this priority is to provide access to a diversity
of programming available in order to enhance shared educational, social, and cultural experiences for persons who
are visually impaired. The range of programs proposed for description may include, but is not limited to, children's
programs, prime time programming, emergency broadcasts, sports programs, and documentaries.

Guideline for the Juvenile Mentoring Program 


Purpose: To support one-to-one mentoring programs for youth at risk of educational failure, dropping out of school,
or involvement in delinquency activities. 
Background: Part G of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended (JJDP Act), establishes
authority for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to fund a new Juvenile Mentoring
Program (JUMP). For Fiscal Year 1994, Congress appropriated $4,000,000 to implement this program. 
Mentoring, as the term is currently used, can be defined as a one-to-one relationship between a pair of unrelated individuals,
usually of different ages, which takes place on a regular basis over an extended period of time. It is usually characterized
by a ``special bond of mutual commitment'' and ``an emotional character of respect, loyalty and identification.''
(Hamilton, 1990.) 
As a movement, mentoring has its roots in the closing decades of the 19th century with ``Friendly Visitors'' who would
serve as role models for children of the poor. In 1904, Ernest K. Coulter founded a new movement which utilized ``Big
Brothers'' to reach out to children who were in need of socialization, firm guidance and human connection with mainstream
adults. The resulting program, Big Brother/Big Sisters of America, continues to operate today as the largest mentoring
organization of its kind. 
Mentoring underwent a second reincarnation in the 1970's as corporations heralded the concept as one which fosters
achievement. Mentoring was seen as a particularly critical ingredient to success on the corporate ladder (Freedman,
1992). 
Within the past ten years, mentoring has taken on a new dimension and a new target group, disadvantaged children and
youth. It has emerged as a promising approach for enriching children's lives; addressing the isolation of youth from
adult contact; and providing, on a one-to-one basis, support and advocacy to children who need it. Mentoring is also
recognized as an important vehicle for harnessing the talents of volunteers to address the problems of poverty (Freedman,
1992). 
Congress has recognized the potential of mentoring as a tool for addressing two critical concerns: poor school performance
and delinquent activity. Accordingly, OJJDP is making funds available for mentoring programs that specifically
address these concerns. Congress also has recognized the importance of school collaboration in mentoring programs,
whether as a primary applicant or in partnership with other public/non-profit private entities. 
Goals of Mentoring Programs: 
To reduce juvenile delinquency and gang participation; 
To improve academic performance; and 
To reduce the dropout rate through the use of mentors for at-risk youth. 
Objectives:
Provide general guidance to at-risk youth; 
Promote personal and social responsibility among at-risk youth; 
Increase at-risk youth participation in and enhance their ability to benefit from elementary and secondary education;

Discourage at-risk youths' use of illegal drugs and firearms, involvement in violence, and other delinquent activity;

Discourage involvement of at-risk youth in gangs; and 
Encourage at-risk youths' participation in service and community activity 
Program Strategy: Applicants may submit funding requests for project periods up to but not exceeding three years.
OJJDP encourages new programs to apply as well as those which have proven track records of implementing programs and
a desire to expand their programs in accordance with these guidelines. All applicants must address the following
elements in their application. 
1. The Nature of the Partnership with Local Educational Agencies 
Both local education agencies (LEA) and public/private non-profit organizations may apply. When public/private
non-profit agencies are the primary applicant, their programs must involve collaboration with the LEA. Likewise
an LEA must collaborate with a relevant public/private non-profit agency. Because two goals of this program are to
improve academic performance and reduce the dropout rate, applications must contain written assurance from the
LEA that it will agree to provide academic records in accordance with its own regulations for use in carrying out a funded
program and that it will cooperate to the fullest extent possible with a national program evaluator. Another example
of the form this coll
