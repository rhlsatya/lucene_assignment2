Commodity Credit Corporation









1994 Wheat and Feed Grain Acreage Reduction Programs and the 1994 Oilseed Price Support Rates 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued proposed rules with respect to the 1994 production adjustment program
for wheat on April 6, 1993, and for feed grains on August 5, 1993, which is conducted by the CCC in accordance with the
Agricultural Act of 1949 (1949 Act), as amended. This final rule amends the regulations to set forth the following
determinations: the Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) percentages for the 1994 crops of wheat, corn, grain sorghum,
barley, and oats will be zero percent; a paid land diversion (PLD) program will not be implemented for the 1994-crop
of wheat and feed grains; producers of malting barley must, as a condition of eligibility for feed grain loans, purchases,
and payments, comply with requirements of the zero percent ARP for the 1994 crop of barley; and the 1994-crop price
support rates per bushel will be $2.58 for wheat, $1.89 for corn, $1.80 for grain sorghum, $1.54 for barley, $0.97 for
oats, $1.61 for rye, $4.92 for soybeans, and $0.087 per pound for canola, flaxseed, mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower,
and sunflower seed. These actions are required by section 107B, in the case of wheat, section 105B, in the case of feed
grains, and section 205, in the case of oilseeds, of the 1949 Act. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Final Regulatory Impact Analysis 



The Final Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this rule and the impact of
the implementation of each option is available on request from the above-named individual. 



Executive Order 12866 



This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the USDA, it
has been determined to be ``economically significant'' because it would have an annual effect on the economy of more
than $100 million and would materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, or loan programs or rights and
obligations of recipients thereof. Budget outlays for 1994-crop deficiency payments are expected to range from
$1.3 billion to $1.8 billion for wheat and from $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion for feed grains. This final rule would not
adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; would not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; and would not raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.




Federal Assistance Programs 



The titles and numbers of the Federal Assistance Programs, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance,
to which this rule applies, are as follows: 






Regulatory Flexibility Act 



It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this final rule because the CCC is required
by sections 107B(o) and 105B(o) of the 1949 Act to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to certain provisions
of this rule. A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for the 1994 Wheat and Feed Grain ARP was prepared as part of the
Final Regulatory Impact Analysis. Copies of this analysis are available from the above-named individual. 



Executive Order 12778 



This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this final rule do not
preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not require the exhaustion of any administrative appeal remedies.




Environmental Evaluation 



It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality
of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement
is needed. 



Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR
29115 (June 24, 1983). 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The amendments to 7 CFR parts 1413 and 1421 set forth in this final rule do not contain information collections that
require clearance by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 35).




Background 



This final rule amends 7 CFR parts 1413 and 1421 to set forth determinations of the 1994 production adjustment programs
for wheat and feed grains and the 1994 price support rates for wheat, feed grains, and oilseeds. General descriptions
of the statutory basis for the 1994 Wheat and Feed Grain Program determinations in this final rule were set forth at
58 FR 17087 (April 6, 1993) and at 58 FR 41641 (August 5, 1993), respectively.

1994 Wheat Program 



The public was asked to comment on whether the 1994 wheat ARP percentage should be set at 5 percent, 10 percent, or 15
percent or another percentage between 0 and 15 percent. Comments received during the comment period are summarized
as follows: 

A total of 45 respondents commented on the ARP level. Table 1 shows a breakdown of the comments received by type of respondent.







Respondents favored lower ARP percentages for the following reasons: (1) Wheat-sector net income is higher with
lower ARP levels; (2) the need to send a message to our competitors that the U.S. will not unilaterally reduce production
and abandon world markets; (3) higher payment acres after flexibility; and (4) idling acres under the conservation
reserve program and annual programs hurt rural economic activity. 

Advocates for higher ARP percentages noted that higher ARP levels: (1) result in higher wheat prices; (2) result in
lower Government costs; and (3) reduce concerns over stock-building. 

After considering these comments, the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) announced, on May 28, 1993, an ARP
of zero percent. The Secretary was authorized to make adjustments in the 1994 ARP percentage no later than July 31,
1993. No change was made because estimated 1994 wheat supplies did not change significantly (up 4 percent) from the
May 1993 supply estimates. The Secretary determined that a zero percent ARP for wheat would maintain U.S. competitiveness
in world markets while balancing the risks of excessive supplies and possible shortages, signal U.S. competitors
that the U.S. will not idle acreage to support the world price of wheat, and signal to domestic and foreign customers
that the U.S. will be a reliable supplier. 

The zero-percent ARP option is the only option under which U.S. wheat supplies are estimated to increase over 1993
levels. Table 2 compares supply and demand estimates under four different ARP options based on May 1993 estimates
(the month in which the ARP decision was made). 






The announced ARP level of zero percent is 15 percentage points below the statutory maximum of 15 percent. The 1949
Act provides that an ARP of not more than 15 percent may be implemented if the ending stocks-to-use (S/U) ratio for the
previous marketing year is equal to or less than 40 percent. When the 1994 ARP was announced, the S/U for the 1993 marketing
year was estimated to be 27.0 percent. Because the 1993 S/U level is below 34 percent, the minimum 7-percent ARP imposed
by section 1104 of the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1990 does not apply. 

A PLD will not be implemented for 1994 wheat because it is unnecessary given the supply and use conditions which led
to an ARP of 0 percent. 



1994 Feed Grain Program 



The public was asked to comment on the appropriate 1994 ARP percentage for corn, grain sorghum, and barley and on whether
or not malting barley producers, as a condition of eligibility for feed grain loans, purchases, and payments, should
be exempt from complying with requirements of the feed grain ARP. The statutory range for establishing the 1994 ARP
percentages, based on the supply and demand estimates published in the proposed rule, was 0 to 12.5 percent for corn
and 0 to 20 percent for grain sorghum and barley. The oats ARP percentage is statutorily mandated at zero percent. 

Comments received during the specified comment period are summarized as follows: 

A total of 34 respondents commented on the ARP percentage. Twenty-nine of the respondents commented on the corn ARP
percentage, 14 of the respondents commented on the grain sorghum ARP percentage, and 17 of the respondents commented
on the barley ARP percentage. Table 3 shows a breakdown of the comments received on the corn, grain sorghum, and barley
ARP percentage by type of respondent.

In general, most individual producers favored an ARP level of 10 percent or higher while most farm organization and
agri-business respondents favored an ARP level of 7.5 percent or less. 

Respondents favoring the lower ARP percentages noted that the U.S. needs to produce more to take advantage of export
opportunities and confirmed USDA's analysis that a lower ARP level results in higher producer incomes. Advocates
for a zero-percent barley ARP indicated the need for adequate supplies to aggressively implement the Export Enhancement
Program for barley. 

Respondents favored higher ARP percentages because feed grain prices would be higher, Government costs would be
lower, and the rural economy would improve. 

Two respondents commented on whether or not malting barley producers should be exempt from the 1994 ARP requirement
for barley. One respondent favored and one respondent opposed the malting barley exemption. 

After considering these comments, the Secretary announced on 
September 30, 1993, an ARP level of 5 percent for corn, and 0 percent for grain sorghum, barley, and oats, and that malting
barley producers would not be exempt from complying with the 1994 barley ARP requirements. 

The Secretary was authorized to make adjustments in the 1994 ARP percentages no later than November 15, 1993. On November
15, 1993, the Secretary announced that the 1994 level for corn would be lowered from 5 percent to 0 percent. A change
was warranted because 1994 feed grain supplies had decreased 8 percent since the September announcement. 

The Secretary determined that zero-percent ARP's for corn, grain sorghum, and barley would maintain U.S. competitiveness
in world markets, provide adequate supplies of quality feed and food for domestic and foreign utilization, and support
farm income. 

The corn ARP level of 0 percent is 12.5 percentage points below the statutory maximum of 12.5 percent. The 1949 Act provides
that an ARP of 0 to 12.5 percent may be implemented if the corn ending S/U ratio for the previous marketing year is equal
to or less than 25 percent. The corn ending S/U for the 1993/94 marketing year was estimated to be 16.6 percent when the
1994 ARP levels were announced on September 30 and 11.4 percent when the corn ARP was lowered on November 15. In the case
of grain sorghum and barley, the 1949 Act provides for ARP percentages from 0 to 20 percent. Section 1104 of the Agricultural
Reconciliation Act of 
1990 provides for a minimum 7.5 percent ARP for the 1994 crop unless the 
1993/94 corn ending S/U ratio is less than 20 percent. Since the 1993/94 corn S/U ratios estimated on September 30 and
on November 15 were below 20 percent, the 7.5-percent minimum ARP does not apply. 

Table 4 shows the three different 1994 feed grain ARP options that were considered when determining the final 1994
ARP percentages.

Tables 5 through 7 compare the supply and demand estimates of three different 1994 ARP options based on November 1993
estimates for corn, grain sorghum, and barley. 












Malting barley producers will not be exempted from complying with the barley ARP requirement because exempting them
would increase the complexity of the program and increase program outlays. 

Acreage Reduction Percentage. In accordance with sections 107B(e)(1) and 105B(e)(1) of the 1949 Act, the ARP has
been established with respect to the 1994 crop of corn, grain sorghum, barley, and oats at 0 percent. Accordingly,
producers will not be required to reduce their 1994 acreage of corn, grain sorghum, and barley for harvest from the
crop acreage base established for feed grains for a farm in order to be eligible for price support loans, purchase,
and payments for the respective feed grain. 

Paid Land Diversion. In accordance with sections 107B(e)(5) and 105B(e)(5) of the 1949 Act, a PLD program will not
be implemented for the 1994 crops of wheat and feed grains. 

Malting Barley Exemption. In accordance with section 105B(e)(2)(G) of the 1949 Act, producers of malting barley
shall as a condition of eligibility of feed grain loans, purchases and payments, comply with the requirements of the
zero-percent ARP for the 1994 crop of barley. 

Price Support Rates. In accordance with sections 107B(a), 105B(a), and 205 of the 1949 Act, the price support rates
have been established with respect to the 1994 crops of wheat at $2.58 per bushel, corn at $1.89 per bushel, grain sorghum
at $1.80 per bushel, barley at $1.54 per bushel, oats at $0.97 per bushel, rye at $1.61 per bushel, soybeans at $4.92
per bushel, and canola, flaxseed, mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower, and sunflower seed at $0.087 per pound.

1994 Cotton Loan and LDP Provisions 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule amends the regulations with respect to the upland and extra long staple cotton loans and loan deficiency
payments (LDP) made by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) in accordance with The Agricultural Act of 1949 (the
1949 Act), as amended. The amendments made by this interim rule will provide: greater clarity; enhance the administration
of CCC programs by providing uniformity between CCC price support programs; eliminate obsolete provisions; provide
more authority to State and county committees in administering the programs; lessen administrative actions CCC
imposes on producers who violate the loan and LDP agreements; and correct errors. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 


This rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 


Federal Assistance Program 


The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to
which this rule applies are: Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable because CCC is not required by 5 U.S.C.
553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of these
determinations. 


Environmental Evaluation 


It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality
of human environment. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24,
1983). 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778. To the extent State and local laws are in conflict with
these regulatory provisions, it is the intent of CCC that the terms of the regulations prevail. The provisions of this
rule are not retroactive. Prior to any judicial action in a court of jurisdiction, administrative review under 7 CFR
part 780 must be exhausted. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


Public reporting burden for the information collections contained in this regulation with respect to price support
programs is estimated to average 15 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of
information. The information collections have previously been cleared under the current regulations by OMB, and
assigned OMB Nos. 0560-0087 and 0560-0129. The content and format of the information collections have
not changed as a result of this amendment to 7 CFR part 1427; however, the frequency of reporting has been reduced. ASCS
will submit a burden correction worksheet to OMB for review. 


Comments 


Since producers are currently making decisions regarding upland and extra long staple cotton which may be pledged
as collateral for CCC price support loans, it has been determined that it is impractical and contrary to the public
interest for CCC to engage in proposed rulemaking requirements with respect to the provisions of this rule. Accordingly,
the provisions of this interim rule are effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

. Comments are requested, however, and will be taken into consideration when developing the final rule. This interim
rule will be scheduled for review so that a final document discussing comments received and any amendments required
can be published in the 

Federal Register

 as soon as possible. 


Background 


The 1949 Act sets forth the statutory authority for CCC price support programs. CCC price support programs are intended
to stabilize market prices and provide interim financing and assistance to producers in the orderly marketing of
eligible commodities. 
This interim rule amends regulations found at 7 CFR part 1427 to provide rules for administering CCC price support
programs for the 1994 and subsequent crop years.

Section 1427.1 (b) is amended to clarify what information is available in State and county Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service offices. 
Section 1427.3 is amended to: (a) correct a typographical error; and (b) add the definition of ``warehouse receipt''.

This interim rule amends  1427.4(b) to add references to receivers, guardians, or trustees which were inadvertently
omitted. 
This interim rule amends  1427.5(b)(1)(v)(B)(4) to clarify that certain extra long staple cotton is ineligible
for CCC price support loans. 
This interim rule amends  1427.5(c)(2)(ii) by removing the reference to incentive payments and thereby allow
purchases of cotton to make such payments to a producer without affecting the ability of the producer to obtain a price
support loan with respect to such cotton. 
This interim rule amends  1427.6(b) to clarify who may disburse loan proceeds to approved cooperative marketing
associations. 
Section 1427.11 refers to warehouse receipts that may be used as collateral for CCC price support loans. This section
has been revised to recognize the existence of electronic receipts by removing specific statements such as ``stamped''
and ``initialed''. 
Provisions for taking administrative offsets are provided in part 3 of this title and part 1403 of this chapter. Accordingly,
this interim rule removes and reserves   1427.14 and 1427.168. 
CCC has determined that the liquidated damages can be reduced without affecting the administration of the cotton
price support programs. Accordingly, this interim rule amends  1427.18 and  1427.175 to: (a) decrease
the liquidated damages amounts; and (b) add provisions that provide that any or all of the liquidated damages may be
waived under certain conditions. 
Section 1427.23 is amended by removing paragraph (f) and redesignating paragraph (g) as paragraph (f). The removed
provision was originally included to allow upland cotton producers who lost beneficial interest at the time of ginning
an opportunity to file for a LDP on the day such upland cotton was ginned. This required producers to report ginning
to the county office on a weekly basis. Since this provision was implemented, CCC developed a more workable procedure
that allows producers to request LDP's in advance of ginning with the LDP rate based on the loan repayment rate announced
and in effect on the day the upland cotton is ginned in accordance with redesignated  1427.23(f). 
Section 1427.171 is amended to clarify provisions relating to locations that are approved for the storage of CCC loan
collateral by removing the reference to commercial warehouse houses. 
Section 1427.174 is amended to correct a spelling error.

Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Processing, Packing, or Holding of Drugs; Revision of Certain
Labeling Controls; Partial Extension of Compliance Date; Reopening of Administrative Record 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS. 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; partial extension of compliance date; reopening of administrative record. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a partial extension of the compliance date of and giving interested
persons an opportunity to comment on the scope of a provision of the final rule, which published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41348), that revised the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for certain
labeling control provisions. The agency is taking this action to assess further the availability of equipment necessary
for compliance with the regulation for items of labeling (other than immediate container labels) and to address concerns
about the scope of a particular provision of that rule in partial response to two citizen petitions that were submitted
to FDA. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Partial Extension of The Compliance Date 


In the 

Federal Register

 of August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41348), FDA published a final rule that amended the CGMP regulations to require that certain
special control procedures be instituted if cut labeling is used. One of the options available under these procedures
requires the use of ``appropriate electronic or electromechanical equipment to conduct a 100-percent examination
for correct labeling during or after completion of finishing operations***.'' (21 CFR 211.122(g)(2)). 
On May 4, 1994, FDA received a citizen petition from five trade associations requesting that the agency take a number
of actions including, but not limited to, extending the August 3, 1994, effective date of this rule as it applies to
labeling (other than the immediate container labels) as defined in section 201(m) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 (m)). The petition states that additional time is needed because of the unavailability
of bar code or machine readers as well as other equipment necessary to orient the labeling codes properly, and the petition
also requests that FDA reopen its administrative record to reassess the scope of a certain provision of the regulation,
as discussed in section II. of this document. 
On May 6, 1994, the agency received an additional petition from a trade association that requested, among other things,
a 1-year stay of the effective date; the petitioner stated that additional time is needed to locate, install, and validate
scanning equipment and other necessary equipment to orient items properly for bar code scanning. 
Currently, appropriate electronic or electromechanical equipment primarily consists of systems that scan identity
codes printed on labeling. If an incorrect code is detected, the defective labeling is ejected from the labeling line.
FDA has contacted vendors of this equipment and has not found a general shortage of system hardware. The agency has
determined, however, that there may be a shortage of contract engineering firms that are employed by some drug manufacturers
to evaluate, select, purchase, install, qualify, and validate labeling verification systems. 
FDA believes that proper validation of electromechanical labeling control systems is vital to the effective operation
of such systems and the prevention of potentially dangerous labeling mixups. The agency is, therefore, as discussed
in section II. of this document, extending to August 3, 1995, the compliance date of  211.122(g) as it applies
to items of labeling other than the immediate container label in order to assess further the availability of equipment
necessary for compliance with the final rule and to evaluate adequately other issues raised by petitioners. 


II. Reopening of The Administrative Record 


The first petition also requests that the agency reopen the administrative record to receive additional comments
on the application of  211.122(g) to items of labeling (other than that of the immediate container label) as
defined in section 201(m) of the act. Both citizen petitions contend that final  211.122(g) expanded the proposed
scope of the provision from immediate container labels to all drug product labeling. 
Although FDA disagrees with these assertions, it is willing to receive comments on this issue and to evaluate those
comments in light of the existing language in  211.122(g). After assessing the comments, FDA will provide notice
in the 

Federal Register

 of the agency's decision on whether or not to retain  211.122(g) in its current state. If the agency decides to
retain the current provision, compliance will be required on August 3, 1995. FDA notes that the proposed rule is replete
with references to ``labeling;''  211.122(g), in fact, expressly addresses ``packaging and labeling operations.''
FDA notes that it expressly directed its proposal to control a method of printing, gang printing, because the cut labeling
that necessarily results from such a method has been implicated in a number of recalls. Moreover, in the proposed rule,
FDA announced its intent to ``revise certain 

labeling

 control provisions. The changes are intended to reduce the frequency of drug product mis

labeling

.'' (54 FR 26394 (emphasis added)). Immediately following, in the summary of the proposed rule, FDA focused on the
practices targeted for control, stating ``The proposal specifies conditions for the use of gang-printed or cut 

labeling

***.'' (54 FR 26394 (emphasis added)). 
Furthermore, in the proposal, FDA described the control procedures to be used by ``

labeling

 and packaging'' lines and in proposed  211.122(g)(1), referred to one of the special control features as the
``Dedication of 

labeling

 and packaging lines to each different drug product * * *.'' (54 FR 26394 at 26395 (emphasis added)). Likewise, FDA referred
to the second special control feature in proposed  211.122(g)(2), which provides for the ``use of appropriate
electronic or electromechanical equipment to conduct a 100-percent examination for correct 

labeling

***'' (54 FR 26394 at 26395 (emphasis added)). Despite such explanations in the proposal, FDA will, nonetheless,
accept and review comments addressing the scope of  211.122(g) with respect to its application to labeling,
as that term is defined in section 201(m) of the act. 
FDA also reiterates its explanation of the terms ``cut labels'' and ``cut labeling'' in the preamble to the final rule:
```Cut labels' and `cut labeling' are 

items of labeling

 that have been detached from printed stock material prior to being brought to a labeling line***'' (58 FR 41348 at 41350
(emphasis added)). 
This partial extension of the compliance date and limited reopening of the administrative record grant, in essence,
the requests of the citizen petitions to have additional time for compliance with one aspect of the final rule, while
reserving judgment on the underlying issues pending FDA's receipt and review of any comments. Compliance with the
remainder of  211.122, including  211.122(g) as it applies to labels as that term is defined in section
201 of the act, is expected on August 3, 1994. It is important to note, however, that  211.125 makes a waiver of
labeling reconciliation conditional on a 100-percent examination for correct labeling performed in accordance
with  211.122(g)(2). 
Interested persons may on or before October 4, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments on this final rule. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one
copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
This document is issued under sections 201, 501, 502, 505, 506, 507, 512, 701, 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 351, 352, 355, 356, 357, 360b, 371, 374).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Technical amendment.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 12, 1992 (57 FR 35989), NHTSA and FHWA published a final rule implementing the Drug Offender's Driver's License
Suspension Law which requires the withholding of certain Federal-aid highway funds from States that do not enact
either legislation requiring the revocation or suspension of an individual's driver's license upon conviction
for any violation of the Controlled Substances Act or any drug offense or a resolution opposing such legislation.
This final rule was codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at 23 CFR part 1212. Specifically, 23 CFR part 1212 sets
forth the manner in which States must certify that they are not subject to the withholding of funds, and the disposition
of funds that are withheld. This document corrects an error that appears in 23 CFR part 1212. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 1212.3 of 23 CFR is entitled ``Definitions''. An incorrect citation appears at the end of paragraph (d) of
this section. This technical amendment notice corrects this error by replacing ``1038.11-.15'' with ``1308.11-.15''
in  1212.3(d) of 23 CFR. Section 1212.7 of 23 CFR is entitled ``Apportionment of withheld funds after compliance''.
The incorrect section of 23 CFR is cited twice in this section. The incorrect citation appears after the words ``apportionment
under'', and after the words ``as defined in''. This technical amendment replaces `` 1212.5(a)'' with `` 1212.6(a)''
after the words ``apportionment under'' and before the words ``will be made'' and after the words ``as defined in''
in  1212.7 of 23 CFR. 



List of Subjects in 23 CFR Part 1212 



Driver licensing, Drug abuse, Grant programs_Transportation, Highway Safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.


In accordance with the foregoing, the following technical amendments are made to 23 Code of Federal Regulations Part
1212 as follows: 



PART 1212.3_DEFINITIONS 



1. The authority citation for Part 1212 continues to read as follows:

 1952.97 

Changes to approved plan.



(a) 

Legislation.

 (1) On March 29, 1994, the Assistant Secretary approved South Carolina's revised statutory penalty levels which
are the same as the revised Federal penalty levels contained in section 17 of the Act as amended on November 5, 1990.

(b) 

The Voluntary Protection Program.

 On June 24, 1994, the Assistant Secretary approved South Carolina's plan supplement, which is generally identical
to the Federal STAR Voluntary Protection Program. South Carolina's ``Palmetto'' VPP is limited to the STAR Program
in general industry, excludes the MERIT AND DEMONSTRATION Programs and excludes the construction industry. Also,
injury rates must be at or below 50 percent of the State industry average rather than the National industry average.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice amends the final rule published on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32336-32338), which amended several Domestic
Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning the deposit and delivery of mail.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The final rule added new DMM D042.1.7 to provide uniform standards for the delivery of Express Mail and accountable
mail, effective October 2, 1994. The new DMM D042.1.7f stated the period after which mail is returned to the sender
if delivery is not made and the addressee does not respond to a delivery notice. The 15-day standard generally established
included an exception for COD (30 days) but inadvertently omitted the existing 5-day standard for Express Mail, which

Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Renewable Oxygenate Requirement for Reformulated Gasoline



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA's regulations for reformulated gasoline (RFG) based on the Clean Air Act, as amended, requires that gasoline
sold in certain areas be reformulated to achieve the greatest possible reductions in vehicle emissions of toxic and
ozone-forming compounds. Among other things, EPA's regulations establish standards requiring a specified oxygen
content in reformulated gasoline. This rule promulgates additional regulations which require that 30 percent of
the oxygen required by the Clean Air Act to be used in reformulated gasoline be derived from renewable feedstocks.
This renewable oxygenate requirement will assure that implementation of the RFG program is consistent with the longstanding
federal policy of promoting renewable fuels. The renewable oxygenate requirement is expected to have a positive
energy impact by reducing the amount of fossil energy needed to meet the requirements of the reformulated gasoline
program. In addition, this program is expected to stimulate the development of new technologies which would lead
to reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and further reductions in fossil energy consumption.

I. Background 


A. Clean Air Act Requirements 


The primary purpose of the federal reformulated gasoline program is to improve air quality by reducing motor vehicle
emissions of toxic and tropospheric ozone-forming compounds, as prescribed by section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act
as amended (CAA or the Act). The Act mandates certain requirements for the reformulated gasoline program. Section
211(k)(2) requires a minimum content of 2.0 weight percent oxygen and maximum content of 1.0 volume percent benzene,
and section 211(k)(3) sets minimum performance standards for emissions of ozone forming volatile organic compounds
(VOC), oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

), and air toxics. To meet the oxygen content requirement, oxygenates must be added to gasoline. The two most common
oxygenates used today are methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethanol. MTBE is an ether derived primarily from
isobutylene, a product typically produced from natural gas or petroleum, and methanol, which in turn is also produced
primarily from natural gas. Ethanol is an alcohol produced primarily from corn, though it can be produced from other
feedstocks as well. A third oxygenate, ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), is an ether derived from ethanol and isobutylene.
A number of other oxygenates such as tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME) and tertiary amly ethyl ether (TAEE) are currently
under consideration by the industry as well. Their ultimate use will depend on their relative economics compared
to those oxygenates currently in use. 
Section 211(k)(1) of the Act directs EPA to promulgate regulations establishing requirements for reformulated
gasoline. It also provides that such regulations require the greatest reductions in VOC and toxics emissions, taking
into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, non-air-quality and other air-quality related
health and environmental impacts and energy requirements. 


B. Historical Background 


There is considerable history behind EPA's decision to promulgate a renewable oxygenate requirement. Congress
and both the past and the present Administrations have long supported the development and use of renewable fuels for
a variety of reasons, including a desire to reduce oil imports, save fossil energy, reduce global warming emissions,
and develop domestic sources of fuel. This support has taken the form of a number of legislative and policy initiatives.
For example, since 1978 renewable fuels have been eligible for an excise tax credit which today is set at 54$/gallon.
The Departments of Energy and Agriculture have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development
related to the production and commercialization of renewable fuels. As a result of these programs, the ethanol industry
developed into a significant industry which by 1990 represented roughly one percent of the nation's gasoline consumption.

The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act provided ethanol blends with a limited waiver from vapor pressure limits placed
on the volatility of conventional gasolines, in order to maintain the ease with which ethanol could be blended with
gasoline. Furthermore, the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act included several provisions which many expected
to further stimulate demand for renewable oxygenates such as ethanol. These provisions included the wintertime
oxygenated fuels program which began in 1992 and has already considerably increased the demand for ethanol, and the
year-round reformulated gasoline program which is to begin in December of 1994. EPA promulgated final regulations
for RFG on December 15, 1993 (59 FR 7716, February 16, 1994). 
In the process of developing the regulations for the RFG program, EPA entered into a regulatory negotiation with interested
parties shortly after passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Included in the negotiations were representatives
of the States, oxygenate producers, farm interests, environmental groups, the oil industry, the automobile industry,
the driving public, the EPA, and the Department of Energy. (See 56 FR 31176, July 9, 1991, for an explanation of the members
of the negotiating committee and a discussion of the process for selecting them.) After extensive discussions, an
Agreement in Principle was signed by all members of the advisory committee in August of 1991. 
The 1991 regulatory negotiation agreement formed the basis for EPA's April 1992 Supplemental Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (SNPRM) (57 FR 13416, April 16, 1992) for reformulated gasoline. In order to ensure compliance with the
minimum reductions in ozone forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) required by Congress for the RFG program,
this proposal did not extend the volatility waiver for ethanol-blended conventional gasoline to RFG. In response,
members of the ethanol industry submitted comments to EPA which expressed their concern that the proposed reformulated
gasoline rules would effectively exclude ethanol from the reformulated gasoline market. 
Ethanol, when added to gasoline in the amount needed to satisfy the oxygen content requirement of the Act, raises the
Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of the resulting blend by about 1 psi, making it more difficult for ethanol blends to meet
the mass VOC performance standards than blends using other oxygenates. For ethanol to be used in summertime RFG, a
gasoline blendstock with an RVP low enough to offset the increase resulting from adding ethanol would have to be obtained.
The contention was that obtaining such blendstocks would be both difficult and expensive, because ``sub-RVP'' blendstocks
would be more costly to refine and distribute and because blendstock production would be controlled by petroleum
refiners. The ethanol industry representatives believed that the oil industry would have a tendency to rely almost
exclusively on MTBE over ethanol because MTBE does not boost a fuel's RVP and is readily blended at the refinery and
distributed through the existing gasoline infrastructure, since, unlike ethanol, it does not raise materials compatibility
or water adsorption concerns with the existing gasoline distribution infrastructure. Thus, there would be little
incentive to make the sub-RVP blendstock necessary for ethanol blending into summertime RFG. The ethanol industry
representatives also contended that refiners would not want to switch oxygenates during the course of the year and
would therefore utilize MTBE year-round, thereby eliminating any RFG market for ethanol. 
For this reason, ethanol and farm interests sought a summer volatility waiver for ethanol-based reformulated gasolines.
Other signatories to the regulatory negotiation agreement, such as the oil industry, methanol and ether producers,
states, and environmental groups, opposed such a waiver because it could eliminate most or all of the VOC benefits
of the RFG program if ethanol was used in large volumes. At the request of ethanol and farm interests, the Agency held
a public hearing to receive testimony on this and other issues in June of 1992 in Chicago.

In an attempt to address the role of ethanol, the Agency subsequently proposed a renewable oxygenate program (ROP)
(58 FR 11722, February 26, 1993) to provide incentives for the use of ethanol and other renewable oxygenates in reformulated
gasoline. The objective of the ROP was to provide incentives for the use of renewable oxygenates in the reformulated
gasoline program in the summer while maintaining the overall environmental benefits of the program. Ethanol was
considered a renewable oxygenate because it is produced primarily from agricultural sources such as corn, which
can be regenerated. Other oxygenates such as MTBE are produced primarily from nonrenewable resources, such as petroleum
and/or natural gas. 
For a variety of reasons, as explained in section II of the preamble and section I of the Regulatory Impact Analysis
(RIA) for the reformulated gasoline final rule, EPA decided not to promulgate the ROP. First, EPA received comments
from virtually all constituencies affected by the rulemaking, including the ethanol industry, stating that the
ROP as proposed was neither feasible nor workable. While EPA believed that a feasible program could be structured,
EPA also acknowledged that it could represent a considerable burden on the industry. Second, the ROP would have reduced
the RFG program's VOC emission control benefits because it provided an incentive for the use during the summer months
of an oxygenate which exhibited commingling-related emission increases. (Combining ethanol blends and non-ethanol
blends in consumer fuel tanks, even if both have identical low RVPs, results in a mixture with significantly higher
fuel volatility and hence significantly higher VOC emissions. This effect is referred to as commingling.) The commingling
effect, along with other unique distillation effects of ethanol on evaporative emissions and other provisions of
the ROP as proposed, were estimated in the RIA for the RFG final rule to result in approximately a 6.0-7.5 percent
increase in VOC emissions compared to an RFG program without such incentives. While difficult to estimate due to uncertainty
in future ethanol and ETBE market shares and lack of sufficient data to reliably quantify the distillation effects,
such an increase in VOC emissions amounts to a loss of about 40 to 50 percent of the minimum VOC control that is required
under section 211(k)(3) for reformulated gasoline during the summer, even though the average RVP of the RFG produced
by refiners remained the same. Thus, EPA's analysis indicated that the proposal would not maintain the environmental
benefits of reformulated gasoline. A third concern with the ROP was that the program would have created an incentive
for the use of renewables but in no way assured their use. Upon consideration of these and other factors, the Agency
decided not to finalize the ROP. Other options considered did not resolve the concerns raised with the ROP as proposed.
(The reader is referred to section II of the Preamble and section I of the RIA for the reformulated gasoline final rule
for a description of the options and alternatives to the ROP considered.) 
Hence, the final rule for reformulated gasoline does not include provisions to provide incentives for the use of renewable
oxygenates. This left substantial uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the role renewable oxygenates would play
in the roughly 35 percent of the U.S. gasoline market expected to be covered by the RFG program. 


C. Renewable Oxygenate Requirement Proposal 


To address the issues discussed above, at the same time EPA issued the final rules for RFG, it also proposed (58 FR 68343)
a year-round requirement that 30 percent of the mandatory oxygen content specification for reformulated gasoline
be obtained from renewable oxygenates. To ensure that the ozone benefits from the reformulated gasoline program
are not adversely affected by that requirement, EPA proposed that during the VOC control period (i.e., the summer
months) only renewable oxygenates that do not exhibit volatility-related commingling effects when mixed with gasoline
would receive renewable oxygenate credit. All approved renewable oxygenates, including ethanol, were expected
to be acceptable during the non-summer months when commingling-related volatility increases have relatively little
effect on VOC emissions and when ozone exceedances are rare. Also included in the proposal were provisions for averaging
and credit trading in order to provide maximum flexibility to refiners and fuel importers in complying with the program.

EPA presented several justifications for proposing a renewable oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline.
The Agency concluded that expanding the use of renewable fuels produced from resources such as corn, grain, wood,
organic waste products, and municipal solid waste could help cut dependence on foreign oil and reduce primary energy
use by 20% or more as compared to nonrenewable oxygenates. The Agency also believed that renewable oxygenates offered
potential air quality advantages (such as lower emissions of VOCs and greenhouse gases) as well as jobs-creation
benefits. The Agency also stated its belief that the 30 percent requirement for renewable oxygenates was an appropriate
level to ensure that renewables were not excluded from the reformulated gasoline oxygenate market while allowing
the remaining 70 percent of the market to be open to all fuels, regardless of their renewables content.

The proposed renewable oxygenate requirement would be applied in conjunction with the reformulated gasoline program.
It did not alter the performance standards or other provisions for the reformulated gasoline outlined in the final
rulemaking for reformulated gasoline. In addition, the proposal did not mandate the use of any particular oxygenate,
but rather ensured some minimum use of the class of oxygenates deemed renewable, defined in the proposal as ethanol
and methanol from renewable sources, and their ether derivatives. This proposal was designed to supplement and not
negate the Agreement in Principle arrived at through regulatory negotiation. 
EPA received over 12,000 comments in response to the renewable oxygenate proposal. The vast majority of these comments
were letters supporting the proposal written by farmers, ethanol producers, and their supporters. Several hundred
responses containing detailed, substantive, technical comments were received from representatives of the oil
industry, the ethanol industry, corn farming and other agricultural interests, methanol producers, environmental
groups, federal agencies, and state and local governments. Some of these comments supported the proposal while others
opposed it. Detailed responses to many of the comments are provided in subsequent sections of this preamble and in
the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in the docket. 
The remainder of this preamble is organized into the following sections:

II. Overview of the Renewable Oxygenate Requirement 


EPA is hereby promulgating a renewable oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline similar to that proposed
on December 15, 1993 (58 FR 68343, December 27, 1993). EPA believes that this action will ensure that the requirements
for the reformulated gasoline program promulgated on December 15, 1993 (59 FR 7716, February 16, 1994) are consistent
with existing government programs and initiatives supporting renewable fuels. For many years, both Congress and
the Executive Branch have promoted through various actions the use of renewable fuels and the development of the renewable
fuels industry for various energy, economic, environmental, and agricultural policy objectives. Renewable fuels
have been viewed as a key element of policies to enhance domestic energy security, reduce oil imports, conserve fossil
energy resources, and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. 
Congress, along with present and past Administrations, has supported these goals through a variety of mechanisms.
The Departments of Energy (DOE) and Agriculture (USDA) have invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the past
20 years to research and develop renewable fuel feedstocks and production techniques. Congress has supported the
increased use of renewable fuels since the late 1970's through various legistative actions. The Energy Security
Act of 1980 established a number of federal policies to expand fuel ethanol production and use. The Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1987 stated the intent of Congress to expand ethanol use. Under the Alternative Motor Fuels
Act (AMFA) of 1988, the Alternative Fuels Council identified a significant role for ethanol. The National Energy
Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992 includes provisions to stimulate the use of a wide-range of alternative (nonpetroleum)
fuels, including several renewable fuels. Congress and prior Administrations have also stimulated renewable fuel
use through mechanisms such as the 1.0 psi volatility waiver in the CAAA for gasoline (other than reformulated gasoline)
blended with ethanol (the major renewable fuel in use today), the oxygen content requirements of the wintertime oxygenated
gasoline and reformulated gasoline programs, and various economic incentives such as tax credits since 1978 (currently
equal to 54 cents per gallon of renewable fuel). 
These programs, combined with additional tax incentives in many states and continued innovation in production techniques,
have helped the renewable fuels industry develop and grow. It has become economically attractive to add ethanol to
conventional gasoline in many areas of the country, primarily by splash-blending ethanol with gasoline. This process
involves mixing ethanol into finished gasoline at the terminal. (Due to materials compatibility concerns and the
hygroscopic properties of ethanol, ethanol generally is not added into the existing gasoline distibution system
at the refineries.) The resulting ethanol blend, commonly known as gasohol, has higher volatility than either the
ethanol or the original gasoline in isolation.

Until EPA's Phase I volatility controls went into effect in 1989, gasoline volatility was essentially unregulated.
EPA's volatility control program reversed the upward trend in gasoline volatility, and the resulting considerable
increase in evaporative VOC emissions, by establishing limits on the volatility of summer gasoline. In promulgating
the volatility control program, however, EPA granted a one pound per square inch (psi) volatility waiver for ethanol-containing
blends. This waiver permitted continuation of splash blending of ethanol into gasoline without regulatory impediment,
thereby avoiding what could have been a significant disruption to the existing market for fuel ethanol. For ethanol
to continue to be blended in the absense of the waiver, refiners would have had to produce and market a special low volatility
gasoline specifically for blending with ethanol. Since there was no assurance refiners would be willing to do so,
the rule could have caused a dramatic decrease in the market share for ethanol blends that had developed under the existing
Congressional and Administration programs. EPA believed it was important to avoid such a disruption to the ethanol
industry, and as a result, granted a 1.0 psi volatility waiver. 

EPA believed that such a waiver would not significantly jeopardize the rule's air quality objectives for several
reasons. First, even with the waiver the volatility of ethanol blends would be reduced considerably. In fact, the
volatility of the ethanol blends would be reduced by the same amount (though not to the same level) as that of non-ethanol
blends. Second, ethanol's market share was small, particularly in most ozone nonattainment areas, so the potential
impact on ozone levels was thought to be small. At the then existing market share for ethanol, the waiver reduced by
only about 3 percent the volatility control that otherwise would have been achieved by both phases of the volatility
control program. Third, the rulemaking neither required the use of oxygenates such as ethanol in gasoline nor was
it expected to increase their use. Were this not the case, the environmental impacts of the waiver could have been considerably
greater. Congress later incorporated a similar volatility waiver in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, when
it established statutory limits on the volatility of conventional gasoline. 

As a result of the Federal and State initiatives and with the continued blending flexibility afforded by the volatility
waiver, the market for ethanol grew from a fledgling industry in 1978 to a market which stabilized at approximately
0.8 billion gallons per year by 1990, an amount equivalent to slightly less than 1% of nationwide gasoline consumption.


With the passage of the CAAA of 1990, the industry once again began to expand considerably. The oxygenated fuels program
required by section 211(m) of the CAA requires that, during the winter months, all gasoline sold in certain cities
with a history of exceedences of EPA's national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for carbon monoxide (CO) must
contain oxygenates. Under this program (which began with the winter of 1992-93), ethanol has captured approximately
30% of the resulting oxygenate market. As a result, the demand for ethanol has grown by roughly 50% to an estimated 1.25
billion gallons in 1993. 

The oxygenate requirements of the reformulated gasoline program contained in section 211(k) of the CAA also provide
the potential to expand considerably the market for ethanol and other renewable oxygenates. RFG is required in the
nine cities with the nation's worst ozone pollution problem and has been adopted for many other ozone nonattainment
areas as well as a key component in their efforts to improve air quality. The areas which will use RFG are estimated to
represent 35% of all gasoline sold in the United States. 

The VOC emission performance standards for reformulated gasoline raised concerns in the ethanol industry that just
as under the gasoline volatility control program, they will be unable to compete in the RFG market without a volatility
waiver. However, section 211(k)(3) of the CAA establishes minimum emission performance standards that RFG must
meet, with no allowance for a volatility waiver for ethanol-blended RFG. Furthermore, as discussed in the RFG final
rule (59 FR 7716), providing such a waiver for ethanol-containing RFG would have jeopardized the emission benefits
which Congress mandated the RFG program to achieve. For these reasons, the final regulations for reformulated gasoline
do not contain such a volatility waiver for summer RFG. 

Thus, ethanol cannot be splash-blended into unmodifed gasoline blendstocks and still have the resulting blend comply
with the RFG emission performance standards. Instead, either special reduced-volatility (``sub-RVP'') blendstocks
would be necessary during the summer, or the ethanol would have to be converted into ETBE. Many in the ethanol industry
have continued to express concern that refiners would not produce such blendstocks. If that were to occur, ethanol
producers would lose access during the summer months to those current markets which will be covered by the RFG program.
This loss of access, the ethanol industry contends, could also lead to a reduced market share in RFG areas in the winter
months, even though no volatility restrictions apply during those months. EPA has received numerous letters from
various members of Congress emphasizing their belief that the RFG program was intended to provide a significant new
market for ethanol and other renewable oxygenates. EPA has also received numerous letters from members of Congress
opposing a renewable oxygenate requirement. In general, they were not opposed to the use of renewable oxygenates,
but rather to EPA requiring their use. As discussed in section III.A, there was also a considerable amount of discussion
concerning this issue during the Congressional debate over the 1990 CAAA.

As stated in the RFG final rule, EPA continues to believe that ethanol will not be excluded from the oxygenate market
under the RFG program. Rather, EPA believes that many refiners will find it economically attractive to blend ethanol
in RFG. As a result, EPA believes a market for ethanol will continue following implementation of the RFG program. The
RFG program represents a major new market for oxygenates such as ethanol. Nevertheless, EPA has received comments
stating that without promulgation of today's rulemaking or other similar measures, creation of additional ethanol
and renewable oxygenate blending capacity beyond that currently underway is in doubt. EPA recognizes that concerns
over the marketability of ethanol in RFG have created substantial uncertainty for ethanol producers and investors.


EPA believes that today's action will reduce that uncertainty and make the RFG program consistent with long-running
Congressional and Administration policies to promote renewable fuels. This program represents an attempt to harmonize
the goals of greater reliance on renewable fuels and air quality improvements through the use of RFG. Specifically,
the renewable oxygenate requirement will ensure that RFG regulations do not inappropriately limit the growth of
the renewable oxygenate industry. It will ensure that several oxygenates will be used in the RFG program and provide
the renewable oxygenates a minimum market. 

It should be noted that the program encourages the use of all renewable oxygenates, not any one renewable oxygenate
(as discussed more fully in section III). By providing market certainty the program will encourage expanded private
investment in new, more efficient and environmentally beneficial renewable fuel production technologies. Such
potential renewable oxygenates include ethanol from cellulosic plant material and waste cellulose and MTBE derived
from methanol which was produced from municipal solid waste, landfill gas, or sewage sludge. 

The program establishes a minimum 30% market share for renewable oxygenates. This level represents a market share
for renewables that EPA believes would likely have been achieved through open competition with nonrenewable oxygenates
in the absence of VOC emission restrictions, based on experience under the oxygenated fuels program. At this market
share an estimated 1.7 volume percent (on an ethanol equivalent basis) of reformulated gasoline will be derived from
renewable resources. 

EPA is promulgating the renewable oxygenate program because of the important benefits of the program. First, EPA
believes the program will help conserve fossil energy resources and minimize any detrimental effects the reformulated
gasoline program may have on energy consumption. Second, EPA believes that the program has the potential to provide
global warming benefits by providing stimulus to the market to develop new, more efficient production processes
for renewable oxygenates and their feedstocks. In addition, EPA believes that the program as structured maintains
the environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline program as promulgated on December 15, 1993, and has the
potential to increase these benefits through the incentives it provides for increased ETBE use during the summer
months. 

The reformulated gasoline program promulgated in December of 1993 is projected to cause an increase in fossil energy
consumption, as discussed in more detail in sections III.H and VI of this notice. Today's action is intended to mitigate
to some extent the increase in fossil fuel consumption that otherwise would result from implementation of the RFG
program. Today's action also provides the certainty needed to encourage private investment in more advanced and
energy-efficient production facilities and more diverse feedstock utilization. This will not only increase the
fossil energy benefits of this program, but also provide the opportunity for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.


Today's action will also create incentives to utilize ETBE during the summer months. Its use, relative to MTBE or ethanol,
has the potential to achieve slightly greater VOC emission reductions beyond those required by the final rule for
RFG. Ethanol-containing gasoline, when mixed with other gasoline, causes the mixture to produce greater VOC emissions
than the original fuels would produce. This can occur even in a vehicle fuel tank. This effect is called commingling
and is discussed in sections III.C and VI of this notice and in the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the reformulated
gasoline final rule. The effect of such commingling on VOC emissions is not controlled directly by the RFG program.
As a result, to the extent that ETBE use displaces ethanol use during the summer months, additional VOC emission benefits
are possible. In addition, ETBE possesses front-end distillation characteristics relative to both ethanol and
MTBE which are also not controlled in the reformulated gasoline final rule, and which may provide further (though
not quantifiable with any certainty at the present time) VOC emission benefits during the summer should its use increase
as a result of the incentives created by today's program. 


Finally, EPA believes that this program is designed in a way which provides maximum compliance flexibility for refiners
and minimizes their burden. The program is an annual program with provisions for a refiner to average over the course
of the year or trade credits with other refiners anywhere in the country. EPA believes that by designing the program
in such a way, the objectives can be met at a minimum cost. These provisions are especially important during the initial
startup of the program. While the renewable oxygenate program takes effect for refiners beginning December 1, 1994,
individual refiners do not need to blend any renewable oxygenate into their gasoline until later in the year or at all
if they so desire. They will just have to demonstrate that they met the requirements over the course of the entire year
through either the blending of greater than 15% renewable oxygenates in the latter part of the year, or the purchase
of credits from other refiners. As a result, the averaging and trading provisions effectively provide refiners with
additional time to meet the initial requirements of the program.

III. Renewable Oxygenate Requirement for Reformulated Gasoline 


A. Legal Authority 


1. Introduction 



The final rule adopted today is a reasonable exercise of the discretionary authority granted the agency under section
211(k)(1) of the Act. EPA interprets the first sentence of section 211(k) as broad authority to adopt reasonable requirements
for reformulated gasoline, unless otherwise prohibited by the Clean Air Act or other statutory provision. EPA interprets
the second sentence of section 211(k)(1) as authorizing EPA to adopt regulations for the reformulated gasoline program
that result in the greatest emission reductions achievable, and at the same time tend to optimize the resulting impacts
on cost, energy requirements, and other health and environmental impacts. In effect, EPA has full authority to adopt
emission reduction standards and other requirements that achieve this result.

1

 






2. Analysis of the Text of the Statute 



An analysis of EPA's authority starts with the text of the statute. Under the first sentence of that paragraph, EPA
is authorized to: 




promulgate regulations under this section establishing requirements for reformulated gasoline to be used in gasoline-fueled
vehicles in specified nonattainment areas. 




Under the second sentence of section 211(k)(1), EPA's regulations are to: 




require the greatest achievable reduction in emissions of ozone forming volatile organic compounds (during the
high ozone season) and emissions of toxic air pollutants (during the entire year) achievable through the reformulation
of conventional gasoline, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, any nonair-quality
and other air-quality related health and environmental impacts and energy requirements. 




Section 211(k)(1) provides EPA general authority to establish reasonable requirements for reformulated gasoline,
including emissions reduction requirements. Other provisions in section 211(k) address various specific elements
of the program, such as minimum requirements for various fuel parameters (section 211(k)(2)), minimum emissions
reduction requirements (section 211(k)(3)), certification requirements (section 211(k)(4)), prohibited acts
(section 211(k)(5)), state opt-ins, (section 211(k)(6)), and credit programs (section 211(k)(7)). 

This interpretation of section 211(k)(1) is supported by the plain meaning of that provision. On its own terms, the
first sentence stands as a general grant of authority to establish any reasonable requirement for reformulated gasoline,
with no explicit restriction on this authority other than a one year deadline for agency action. 

The first sentence of section 211(k)(1) both grants authority to the agency and establishes a deadline for agency
action. This structure is not at all uncommon, and was employed by Congress in several similar provisions adopted
in 1990. See, e.g., section 211(h)(1) (regulation of Reid vapor pressure), section 211(i)(2) (regulation of motor
vehicle diesel fuel), section 211(l) (regulation of gasoline detergent additives), and section 202(a)(6) (regulation
of refueling emissions from motor vehicles). The general framework of section 211(k) is also not unique_a grant of
broad general authority in (k)(1) followed by several detailed provisions that ensure certain minimum actions are
taken. This is consistent with the approach taken by Congress in various other provisions of Title II of the Clean Air
Act. For example, Congress granted EPA broad, general authority to regulate motor vehicles and their fuels, as in
section 202(a) and section 211(c)(1). These grants of broad, general authority were then supplemented by detailed
provisions providing specific actions that Congress expected in these areas. See, e.g., section 202(b), (f), (g),
(h), and (i), as well as sections 211(c)(2), 211(g), prior to the 1990 amendments, and the various paragraphs of section
211 cited above. 

The regulations adopted today are a reasonable exercise of this discretionary authority. They further Congressional
goals by fostering achievement of the important benefits that Congress expected to flow from this program. They are
not prohibited by any provision of the Act or any other law, and are well within the range of authority granted by Congress.


The plain meaning of the second sentence of section 211(k)(1) corroborates EPA's view on it authority to issue this
rule. This provision requires promulgation of regulations that require a certain result. The result desired by Congress
is clear_the greatest achievable reductions, taking into consideration cost, energy, environmental and other
impacts. There is no indication that EPA's authority is limited to establishing emissions reduction standards.
In fact, this provision would authorize EPA to adopt all reasonable requirements designed to achieve the required
result. The regulation adopted today is designed to ensure that the emissions reduction requirements for reformulated
gasoline are achieved in a manner that reasonably optimizes the energy, cost, environmental, and other impacts of
this program. The regulations adopted today, in combination with the regulations promulgated in December 1993,
act together to achieve this result.

Finally, EPA believes that section 211(k)(4) does not preclude the renewable oxygenate provisions proposed herein.
Section 211(k)(4) states that the Administrator ``shall certify a fuel formulation or slate of fuel formulations
as complying with this subsection if such fuel or fuels_(i) comply with the requirements of paragraph (2), and (ii)
achieve equivalent or greater reductions * * * than are achieved by a reformulated gasoline meeting
the applicable requirements of paragraph (3).'' This could be interpreted as requiring certification of a fuel that
met the oxygen and other requirements of paragraph (2) and the emissions requirements of paragraph (3) even if it did
not comply with the proposed renewable oxygenate requirement. Section 211(k)(1), however, authorizes EPA to establish
requirements above and beyond those required under paragraph (2) and (3), and section 211(k)(1) and (4) must be read
together to provide a meaningful interpretation to both provisions. EPA believes that a reasonable interpretation
requires certification of a fuel as reformulated as long as it complies with the requirements of paragraphs (2) and
(3), as well as any additional requirements established under paragraph (1). Since the renewable oxygenate provision
is an additional requirement established under section 211(k)(1), certification is not required under section
211(k)(4)(B) unless a fuel or slate of fuels complies with the requirement. 



3. Analysis of the Legislative History 



The legislative history of the reformulated gasoline provision supports and is consistent with EPA's interpretation
of section 211(k). Changes made to various bills during the course of congressional review, as well as floor debates
in the respective houses, indicate EPA was provided broad general authority to adopt requirements designed to achieve
the objectives for this program. EPA's renewables requirement does just that, without inappropriately impinging
on refiners' and importers' operational flexibility. 

a. 

House of Representatives_

The bill reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce included provisions on reformulated gasoline that
roughly paralleled the current provisions of section 211(k)(1). Under that provision, EPA was required to: 




promulgate regulations under section 211 establishing specifications for cleaner gasoline to be used in conventional
gasoline fueled vehicles. Such standards shall require the greatest reduction in ozone-forming volatile organic
compounds and air toxic emissions achievable through the reformulation of conventional gasoline, taking into consideration
the cost of achieving such emission reductions, and health, environmental and energy impacts.

2






This provision is similar to current section 211(k)(1) in that it provides general authority to establish ``specifications''
for reformulated gasoline, and separately requires that these regulations include requirements to obtain the greatest
achievable reductions in VOCs and air toxics. The Committee Report's description of this provision is fairly brief,
with no indication that this general authority is limited to establishing emission reduction requirements.

3

 




Certain changes were made to this provision prior to its adoption by the House, reflecting an intent to expand at least
somewhat the scope of agency authority. First, while the Committee bill authorized EPA to establish ``specifications''
for cleaner gasoline, the House bill used broader language authorizing EPA to establish ``requirements,'' as currently
found in section 211(k)(1). Likewise, the second sentence of the Committee bill provision referred to ``such standards,''
while the House bill broadened this to ``such requirements.''

4

 The House intended to broaden EPA's authority, not limit it, and these changes were eventually adopted by Congress.





The Committee bill was amended in several other significant ways prior to final passage by the House. For example,
many of the specific reformulated gasoline requirements now found in section 211(k)(2) through (10) were first debated
and adopted on the floor of the House. Nonetheless, the general structure of section 211(k)(1) stayed the same with
the exceptions noted above. This indicates that from the very beginning the House intended to provide EPA with broad
general authority to establish reasonable requirements for a reformulated gasoline program. The vast bulk of the
legislative history in the House is directed at the subsequent adoption of fairly specific minimum requirements
for reformulated gasoline, with no indication that Congress intended to otherwise limit this broad, general grant
of agency authority.

b. 

Senate_

The legislative history in the Senate likewise shows a desire to broaden EPA's authority in this area. The bill reported
out of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works started from a more restrictive position and authorizing
EPA to:

 

(1) * * * promulgate regulations establishing specifications for fuel quality which will minimize,
to the extent economically and technically achievable, emissions [of various pollutants] * * *.
(2) In order to achieve and maintain attainment of ambient air quality standards, the Administrator may promulgate
regulations * * * establishing specifications for fuels (including regulations requiring the availability
or sale of fuels meeting the specifications in a nonattainment area or areas) to reduce emissions of pollutants subject
to a standard under this title or hazardous air pollutants from motor vehicles. In establishing such specifications
and availability requirements the Administrator shall consider other environmental effects which would result
from production and use of fuels meeting the specifications.

5






This provision is much narrower than that reported out of the House Committee. The authority to establish ``specifications''
is clearly limited to specifications to reduce emissions of specified pollutants, and the specifications are limited
to those aimed at achieving and maintaining attainment of the NAAQS. It also clearly requires that such specifications
and requirements be written as performance standards. 
Most of the amendments and debate on this provision focused on a number of detailed minimum requirements that parallel
the current reformulated gasoline provisions found in section 211(k)(2) though (10). However, certain very important
changes were made to the general authority provisions. First, the second paragraph of the provision was replaced
in its entirety with broader language that more closely parallels the version adopted by the House. The Senate approved
a floor amendment by Senator Daschle requiring that:

 

The Administrator, pursuant to paragraph (1) * * * promulgate regulations establishing specifications
for reformulated gasoline to be used in conventional gasoline fueled vehicles [in specified ozone nonattainment
areas].

6

 



This amendment removed the limitation that the specifications could only be designed to reduce emissions and achieve
and maintain attainment, significantly broadening EPA's authority. Nonetheless, the provision passed by the Senate
was narrower than the House bill. Even though paragraph one of the provision was somewhat similar to the second sentence
of current section 211(k)(1), the Senate bill did not contain a general grant of authority as found in the first sentence
of section 211(k)(1). It also more narrowly authorized EPA to establish specifications, instead of requirements.

c. 

Conference Committee Bill_

The Conference Committee on the House and Senate bills rejected the Senate's narrower limits on general authority
and instead reported out the broader, more general authority provision found in the House bill.

7

 This provision was then adopted in the final bill. This legislative history indicates that both houses, to different
degrees, moved to broaden the agency's authority to implement the reformulated gasoline program. The final bill
adopted by Congress rejected the narrower approach from the Senate and instead approved the more general language
from the House. While there was little discussion of this, the textual changes described above lead to the conclusion
that Congress intended to provide EPA with broad general authority to establish regulatory requirements for reformulated
gasoline. There are no indications that Congress intended otherwise. EPA's interpretation is therefore fully consistent
and supported by this legislative history.

d. 

Floor debates in the two houses_

The legislative history does contain extensive floor debate about the reformulated gasoline provisions. While
these focus primarily on the specific requirements found in section 211(k)(2) though (10), they still provide important
insight on overall Congressional intent for this program.

8

 First, Congress expected that this motor vehicle fuel program would provide several important benefits for the nation.
Most obviously it would lead to major reductions in air pollution in the largest metropolitan areas with the worst
ozone nonattainment problems, reducing ozone forming VOCs and toxic pollutants. Reformulating the gasoline used
in conventional vehicles would constitute a significant component of the federal program to control motor vehicle
pollution. There was a clear concern that gasoline had gotten more polluting over the prior twenty years, primarily
through increased levels of aromatic compounds in gasoline, used to replace the octane previously obtained from
lead additives. Benzene and aromatics were seen as the predominant air toxic threat. 




Second, Congress emphasized that reformulated gasoline would provide benefits in the form of improving our energy
security, reducing our reliance on foreign oil, and providing a major opportunity for the agricultural sector of
our economy to market renewable alcohols and their derivatives. This would come from the use of oxygenates as gasoline
additives, including renewable oxygenates like ethanol and ETBE. In effect, Congress intentionally designed the
reformulated gasoline program to obtain emissions reductions benefits in a way that would promote these other very
important benefits.

9

 




Third, the structure developed by Congress to obtain these various benefits involved a complex balance between imposing
detailed requirements and preserving refiner flexibility.

10

 The floor debates include detailed responses by individual members of Congress to various arguments that Congress
was mandating ``government gas'' or a ``recipe,'' or was mandating use of only one oxygenate, such as ethanol.

11

 The floor debates also show there was no common understanding of terms such as ``fuel neutral,'' or ``government gas,''
or even whether certain provisions did or did not require the use of a specific oxygenate such as ethanol. These debates
do make clear, however, that Congress designed the detailed provisions in section 211(k)(2) through (10) to ensure
achievement of various benefits from this program, while retaining an appropriate degree of refiner flexibility.






Various statements were made by different members of Congress that any oxygenate could be used that met the oxygen
content and emissions reduction requirements for reformulated gasoline.

12

 These statements reflect Congress' interest in retaining appropriate refiner flexibility. However, they only
address compliance with the oxygen content requirement mandated under section 211(k)(2) and the emissions reduction
requirements mandated under section 211(k)(1) and (3), and do not address compliance with additional requirements
established under section 211(k)(1). They do not indicate an intention to preclude EPA from appropriately exercising
its authority under section 211(k)(1) to either require greater than the minimum reductions called for in section
211(k)(3) or to establish additional requirements like the renewable requirements. Given the ambiguity in the debates
on this issue and the Act's provision that the requirements of (k)(2) be issued under the (k)(1) rulemaking authority,
EPA believes this rule may also be considered a reasonable implementation of the (k)(2) oxygen content requirement.





This legislative history indicates that while Congress itself did not choose to mandate any one oxygenate or class
of oxygenate, it also did not restrict EPA's ability to require the use of a class or category of oxygenates if that would
reasonably ensure achievement of these benefits and would not inappropriately limit the operational flexibility
of refiners and importers. The renewables requirement is entirely consistent with this approach. It is designed
to achieve important goals, and includes provisions specifically designed to maximize the flexibility of refiners
in meeting the requirement.

13

Most of the congressional debate focused on the various detailed requirements of section 211(k) such as the content
requirements of section 211(k)(2), and the emissions standards of section 211(k)(3). There was relatively little
debate or discussion concerning the scope of EPA's general authority in section 211(k)(1). However, there are indications
that this was considered a reservoir of broad, general authority.

14

 There was no indication that section 211(k)(1) did not mean what its plain language indicates_that Congress provided
EPA with broad, general authority to establish the requirements for reformulated gasoline, including requirements
that tend to optimize the energy and other benefits obtained by the emission reductions requirements. 




4. Conclusion 


EPA's interpretation of its authority under section 211(k)(1) is a reasonable interpretation based on the plain
language of the provision. The legislative history supports this interpretation and fails to show a contrary intent.
The changes made in the reformulated gasoline provisions, and textual changes made in the two houses and in conference
indicate an intent to broaden EPA's general authority. The floor debates support this and fail to show a contrary intent.

EPA's exercise of authority under section 211(k)(1) also helps to obtain the important benefits identified by Congress
for reformulated gasoline. The legislative history makes it clear that in addition to emissions reductions, Congress
expected that reformulated gasoline would benefit the nation by obtaining various energy and other benefits from
the expanded use of oxygenates, including specifically the benefits from using renewable oxygenates like ethanol
and ETBE. EPA's interpretation and this rule are fully consistent with this Congressional goal. 
Congress established a complex statutory structure to ensure achievement of these various goals while retaining
an appropriate degree of refiner flexibility. EPA's final rule is carefully designed with refiner flexibility in
mind, and draws an appropriate balance between obtaining the benefits from using renewable oxygenates and retaining
refiner flexibility. For example, the rule establishes as close to a performance standard as is currently possible,
does not mandate one specific fuel or fuel additive, allows for a phase-in over two years to minimize disruption, allows
averaging over a long time period, and allows for generation, use and trading of credits to show compliance. It also
is carefully designed to minimize any adverse environmental impacts. 
EPA's interpretation of its authority is consistent with the plain language of the statute and its legislative history,
and furthers the goals identified by Congress for this program. As such it is a lawful exercise of agency authority
under section 211(k). 


B. Program Overview 


The renewable oxygenate requirement is one component of the reformulated gasoline program. It does not alter the
emission performance standards or other provisions for the reformulated gasoline program contained in the final
rule for reformulated gasoline (See 59 FR 7716; February 16, 1994). In addition, it does not mandate the use of any particular
oxygenate, but rather ensures a specified minimum use of a range of oxygenates derived from renewable resources.

As mentioned previously, EPA is requiring that 30 percent of the required 2.0 weight percent oxygen content of all
reformulated gasoline be produced using renewable oxygenates. Renewable oxygenates must meet two criteria for
them to be used to comply with the requirements of the program. First, they must be produced from non-fossil fuel feedstocks
(i.e., other than petroleum, natural gas, coal, or peat), or their oxygen content must derive from oxygenates produced
from such feedstocks, as described more fully in section III.C.1 of this notice. Second, to be considered ``renewable''
when blended into VOC-controlled RFG, the oxygenate must not cause commingling-related increases in fuel volatility
(i.e., the oxygenate must have a linear vapor pressure blending curve). In addition to the requirements of this program,
renewable oxygenates must also be approved for use in gasoline in keeping with the provisions of section 211(f) of
the Act, and must be approved for use in reformulated gasoline (i.e., certifiable under either the Simple or Complex
Model, as discussed in the final rule for the RFG program). 
The oxygenates which are expected to meet these requirements, at least in the near term include: (1) Any alcohols derived
from biomass or waste products other than untransformed fossil fuels, except when used in RFG designated as ``VOC-controlled,''
and (2) all approved ethers produced from renewable feedstocks, when used in either VOC-controlled or non-VOC-controlled
RFG. EPA recognizes that some non-ether oxygenates, including some alcohols, may not cause commingling-related
increases in fuel volatility. Upon submittal of sufficient data demonstrating that addition of a non-ether renewable
oxygenate does not cause a nonlinear increase in RVP, the Administrator may permit the oxygenate in question to receive
credit under today's renewable oxygenate program when blended into VOC-controlled RFG. However, methanol and ethanol
will not be granted such permission, since the nonlinearity of their effect on RVP is well-established at the present
time. 
The program will be phased in over the course of two years. Fifteen percent of the minimum 2.0 weight percent oxygen
content of reformulated gasoline is required in the form of renewable oxygenates, as defined above, from December
1, 1994 through December 31, 1995 (hereafter referred to as the ``first year of the program''). Thirty percent of the
minimum oxygen content in reformulated gasoline is required to be from renewable oxygenates in 1996 and each year
thereafter. As a result, on average reformulated gasoline will be required to have at least 0.30 weight percent oxygen
content (15 percent of 2.0 weight percent) provided by renewable oxygenates in the first year of the program and 0.60
weight percent oxygen content provided by renewable oxygenates in subsequent years. 
A program phase-in is necessary because the reformulated gasoline program takes effect at refineries December 1,
1994. As discussed more fully in section III.F of this notice, EPA is concerned that insufficient time is available
for ethanol producers to adjust their production schedules, for ether suppliers to set up contracts for the purchase
of renewable alcohols, for fuel producers to obtain supplies of renewable oxygenates for addition at the refinery
or for blending with refinery-produced reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB), and for terminal
operators to build and obtain permits for sufficient ethanol and ether storage and blending facilities in order to
meet the full 30 percent requirement in 1995. Reformulated gasoline producers may also have to adjust their gasoline
production plans to accommodate a different mix of oxygenates than they might have used in the absence of today's rule.
The phase-in addresses these leadtime concerns, ensures a more orderly startup of the program, and minimizes the
risk of any market disruptions.

The applicable renewable oxygenate requirement (15 percent or 30 percent) applies year-round. The requirement
is measured on an oxygen-equivalent basis (i.e., credit given according to the oxygenate content of the RFG) and is
based on a per gallon oxygen content of 2.0 weight percent which is consistent with the minimum per gallon oxygen content
standard in the RFG program. However, the renewable oxygenate requirement must be met on an annual average basis and
need not be met on a per-gallon basis. This requirement applies to all refiners or importers of reformulated gasoline
and/or RBOB. It does not apply to oxygenate blenders, pipeline operators, or terminal operators, though such parties
are required to abide by any restrictions regarding the type of oxygenate that may be blended into RBOB provided by
refiners. Specifically oxygenate blenders, pipeline operators and terminal operators will have to adhere to the
RBOB blending limitations not only of the RFG final rulemaking, but also the additional limitations resulting from
today's rulemaking. If a state exercises the option discussed in section III.G of this notice to address shoulder
season concerns, the enforcement requirements on terminal operators may be slightly altered. 
Refiners and importers of reformulated gasoline are also permitted to generate and trade, on a nationwide basis,
credits earned from use of renewable oxygenates in excess of the applicable minimum requirement to other producers
desiring to use a lesser volume of renewable oxygenates. Such credits can be used to satisfy part or all of a refiner's
renewable oxygenate requirement for the same calendar year that the credits are earned. No banking of credits between
calendar years is allowed. The averaging and trading provisions established today for the renewable oxygenate program
will have no adverse environmental impact since today's action does not alter the VOC, toxics, and NO

X

 emission performance standards for reformulated gasoline.
The effect of these averaging and trading provisions is to greatly expand the flexibility afforded refiners, particularly
during the initial startup of the program. While the renewable oxygenate program takes effect for refiners beginning
December 1, 1994, individual refiners do not need to blend any renewable oxygenate into their gasoline until later
in the year or at all if they so desire. They will just have to demonstrate that they met the requirements over the course
of the entire year through either the blending of greater than 15% renewable oxygenates in the latter part of the year,
or the purchase of sufficient credits from other refiners. As a result, the averaging and trading provisions effectively
provide refiners with additional time to meet the initial requirements of the program, and allows them to smoothly
ramp up their use of renewable oxygenates during the course of the first year to the full 30% requirement in 1996. 
The renewable oxygenate requirements are placed at the refinery level and will apply to reformulated gasoline sold
in all the covered areas, including the opt-in areas and the two covered areas in the State of California (Los Angeles
and San Diego). Details of the enforcement program are discussed in section IV of this notice. Refiners who produce
reformulated gasoline for use in California beginning in March 1996 are exempt from most federal reformulated gasoline
reporting, recordkeeping, and similar enforcement requirements. As a result, refiners producing California reformulated
gasoline are not currently required to distinguish between gasoline volumes sold in Los Angeles or San Diego and gasoline
sold in other parts of California. However, the renewable oxygenate provisions promulgated today will apply to reformulated
gasoline sold in Los Angeles and San Diego, as discussed in section IV of this notice in greater detail. 
The Agency received a number of comments concerning impacts of the program on VOC emissions during the ``shoulder
season.'' After considering the issue, EPA has decided that a limited change to the program to address the shoulder
season concerns is warranted. As discussed in section III.G, EPA has included in the final rule a provision which would
allow EPA to extend the limitations on the blending of certain renewable oxygenates which exhibit volatility-related
commingling effects to the shoulder season within individual states upon receipt of a petition from the Governors
of the states if certain requirements are met. 


C. Renewables Requirement and Definition 


1. Renewables Definition 


The definition of renewable oxygenates adopted in this final rule has been expanded from that contained in the proposal,
but nevertheless it is intended to limit credit toward the renewable oxygenate requirement to those oxygenates which
EPA expects to yield net fossil fuel savings. The final definition is structured so as to exclude from the renewables
definition oxygenates produced in their entirety from nonrenewable sources such as coal, oil, peat, and natural
gas due to their non-renewable, fossil nature. The definition includes oxygenates derived wholly from renewable
biomass sources including but not limited to corn and other grains, other food products, and cellulosic plant material.
It also includes oxygenates derived from waste products such as waste cellulose and plastics, sewage, sawdust, scrap
tires, and methane recovered from landfills. EPA recognizes that some of these waste products may have been derived
from fossil hydrocarbon sources. Including these sources in the set of permissible feedstocks will not by itself
result in increased generation of such wastes, however, and hence will not increase consumption of materials which
can be used as fossil fuels. 
The definition excludes waste products that are untransformed from their original fossil fuel form. As a result,
methane captured from landfills would qualify as a renewable feedstock but natural gas currently flared at the wellhead
or refinery would not qualify as a renewable feedstock, since it would be used in its untransformed state as an oxygenate
feedstock and is in fact a fossil fuel. 
It should be noted, however, that the definition includes oxygenates whose oxygen content comes from another renewable
oxygenate. As a result, ethers derived from renewable alcohols and isobutylene which was produced from oil or natural
gas would qualify as a renewable oxygenate, whereas ethers derived from nonrenewable alcohols would not qualify
regardless of the source of isobutylene.

<TEXT>
 

Like all gasoline additives, renewable oxygenates must meet the requirements of section 211(f) of the Clean Air Act
or be waived from those requirements. In addition, reformulated gasoline containing renewable oxygenates must
be certifiable under the appropriate RFG emission model (as set forth in  80.42 and  80.45 of the Code of
Federal Regulations). 



2. Renewable Oxygenates for Summer RFG 



Alcohols and other oxygenates which cause commingling-related volatility increases used in VOC-controlled reformulated
gasoline will not receive credit toward the 30 percent renewable oxygenate requirement for two reasons. First, EPA
does not want incentives created by the renewable oxygenate program to diminish the VOC benefits of the RFG program
during the high ozone season. As discussed in the RFG final rule and RIA and elsewhere in this notice, a program which
would encourage increased use of ethanol (and by extension any other oxygenates with a similar non-linear vapor pressure
blending curve) in summer RFG introduces a number of serious concerns related to increased VOC emissions. Second,
as discussed in the proposal, the process energy needed to offset the direct vapor pressure boost from ethanol, the
primary renewable oxygenate used in gasoline today, negates the fossil energy savings from ethanol. The vapor pressure
boost must be offset to comply with the VOC emission performance standards for summer RFG. EPA would expect a similar
situation to apply to other oxygenates that increase the vapor pressure of gasoline. 

Direct RVP increases are controlled and accounted for in summer reformulated gasoline by the RFG program. However,
alcohols such as ethanol and methanol can create commingling problems in vehicle fuel tanks which are not reflected
in the RFG emission models. Commingling can significantly increase average in-use fuel volatility which leads to
higher emissions of VOCs, an ozone precursor. EPA believes that by not granting credit toward the renewable oxygenate
requirement during the summer for commingling oxygenates, today's program will not encourage increased use of these
oxygenates during the high ozone season, thereby avoiding the VOC emission increases that would result from such
increased use. In fact, today's provision has the potential to stimulate the use of ETBE during the summer months,
which could displace ethanol use that otherwise may have existed under the RFG program, thereby reducing commingling
related emission increases during the high ozone season. 

As discussed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis
 (RIA) for the RFG Final Rule, a thirty percent ethanol blend market share in a Phase I VOC-controlled gasoline pool
in VOC Control Region 1 would increase the effective average RVP of the gasoline pool (even if the ethanol blends and
non-ethanol blends have the same RVP) and thereby increase total VOC emissions (including both exhaust and non-exhaust
VOC emissions) relative to a scenario in which ethanol blends had zero market share. EPA estimated in the RIA for the
RFG Final Rule that the commingling-related increase in VOC emissions from a thirty percent market share for ethanol-blended
RFGs would result in a VOC increase of approximately two to three percent. In other words, the commingling effect would
reduce RFG's Phase I VOC benefits by up to twenty percent. While EPA was aware of the commingling effect during the development
of the Complex Model, the effects could not be reliably estimated in time for proposal and, since adding the commingling
effect to the Complex Model would have represented a considerable change to the model, EPA deferred adding the effect
to the Complex Model at the time of the RFG final rule. 





The commingling effect does not occur when ethers are blended with gasoline. Furthermore, such blends are projected
by DOE
 to require less fossil energy than would RFG containing nonrenewable oxygenates. As a result, this program allows
renewable ethers blended into VOC-controlled RFG to receive renewable oxygenate credit during the high ozone season.
Under the final rule, the Administrator may allow renewable alcohols other than ethanol and methanol and renewable
oxygenates other than alcohols and ethers to receive such credit if sufficient information demonstrating the absence
of any commingling effects is submitted for the approval of the Administrator. As with any fuel additive, they would
also have to meet the requirements of section 211(f) of the CAA, and the RFG containing such an additive must be certifiable
under the Simple Model or Complex Model, whichever is applicable. 





Outside of the ozone season, VOC reductions are not required in reformulated gasoline for ozone control and RVP is
not controlled. At such times, renewable alcohol blends would produce the desired fossil energy savings and potential
greenhouse gas emission reductions. Therefore, EPA will give credit to renewable alcohols blended into non-VOC-controlled
RFG, the use of which is restricted to the non-high ozone season. The only exception to this, as discussed in section
III.G, is during shoulder season months where based on a request from the Governor of a State, EPA has extended the non-commingling
season beyond the VOC control season. Should that occur, oxygenates which exhibit commingling effects would not
be given credit toward the renewables requirement in that State during the shoulder season as well.

3. Performance-Based Definition of Renewable 



In its proposal, EPA solicited comments on the proposed definition of renewable oxygenates and, in particular, on
the potential for establishing a performance requirement based on energy consumption and/or greenhouse gas emissions
to define renewable oxygenates. After further consideration and evaluation of the comments received, EPA has decided
not to promulgate a numerical type of performance-based standard for renewable oxygenates for a number of reasons.
First, the degree of scientific uncertainty associated with quantifying energy consumption and emissions of different
greenhouse gases throughout the entire life cycle of various oxygenates is considerable. Second, even if life cycle
emissions could be estimated, based on comments on the proposal and discussions with EPA's Global Change Division
there is currently insufficient scientific consensus on the relative warming potential of various greenhouse gases,
notably VOC and NO

X

 (the bulk of the emissions other than CO

2

), to provide reliable comparisons. Third, EPA has concluded that at the present time it would be difficult and costly
to collect and verify the necessary data to implement a performance-based standard for renewable oxygenates, to
the point where the recordkeeping and reporting burden could discourage new, more efficient feedstock and oxygenate
production practices. Fourth, EPA believes that the definition of renewable oxygenates contained in this rule is
sufficient to provide certainty that fossil energy savings are being achieved without the establishment of a numerical
performance standard. As discussed below in section III.C.4, the group of oxygenates derived from renewable sources
are expected to achieve energy and greenhouse gas emission performance levels roughly equivalent to or better than
those achieved by ethanol alone. For these reasons, EPA does not believe it to be appropriate at the present time to
institute a performance standard for renewable oxygenates. However, the Agency reserves the right to alter its definition
of ``renewable'' to a performance-based standard in the future if a reasonable, workable, and enforceable definition
can be developed. 



4. Renewable Alcohols/Ethers Limitation 



In the December NPRM, the only oxygenates included in the proposed definition of renewable oxygenates were ethanol
and methanol produced from renewable feedstocks and their ether derivatives. However, EPA recognizes that for a
number of reasons the production of other oxygenates from renewable feedstocks is likely to produce fossil energy
savings similar to that for renewable methanol and ethanol. First, many of these other oxygenates may at times be produced
as co-products or by-products of methanol or ethanol production. As a result, they should have similar fossil energy
balances. In fact, if by including them in today's definition they are not forced to be separated out from the ethanol
and/or methanol to make them pure, it could help reduce energy expenditures. Second, even if not co-products, they
are likely to be produced from similar feedstocks using similar production practices as those currently used for
renewable ethanol and methanol. As a result, the energy balance should not be significantly different. In fact, the
energy balance could very well be better, since the energy balance of either the oxygenate production itself, or that
associated with blending it into RFG, may be the reason prompting the production of the other oxygenates in lieu of
ethanol or methanol. Third, in order for these other oxygenates to compete in the marketplace with renewable ethanol
or methanol they will need to be cost competitive. Since the energy inputs represent a significant portion of the costs
of renewable oxygenate production, these other oxygenates are unlikely to be produced (unless they are co-products
as discussed above) unless they are at least as energy efficient as the alternatives. Furthermore, if they are able
to compete, the oxygenate they are likely to displace from the marketplace will be the marginal renewable oxygenate
production which is the most costly and inefficient to produce and therefore provides the least energy savings to
begin with. Fourth, while EPA does not expect these oxygenates to represent a large portion of the renewable oxygenate
market, their exclusion from the definition might hinder their entry into the market and hinder the development of
new, energy efficient renewable oxygenate production technologies. 

As a result, EPA is including other oxygenates produced from renewable feedstocks in its definition of permitted
renewable oxygenates under today's rule. As discussed above, however, such oxygenates cannot be blended during
the high ozone season unless either they are converted to an ether form, or it can be demonstrated that they do not cause
a volatility increase when commingled with other gasoline blends. 

Although several commenters supported the petition process which EPA proposed as an optional means to respond to
future developments in oxygenate technology, the Agency is limiting this petition process to determining whether
the renewable oxygenate exhibits commingling effects which are relevant to their use under this program during the
summer months. As discussed above, EPA is extending the definition of renewable oxygenate based on its determination
that all oxygenates derived from renewable sources and expected to be used to comply with this program should exhibit
energy benefits similar to those resulting from ethanol use. 



D. Averaging and Trading 



EPA is promulgating averaging and trading provisions, as proposed, for the oxygenates in reformulated gasoline
receiving renewable credit under today's program. Refiners are allowed to average the renewable oxygen content
of reformulated gasoline over the calendar year. During the first year, however, the averaging period will run for
13 months, from December 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995, to track the time period for the other RFG requirements.
Refiners are also allowed to trade credits earned by exceeding the renewable oxygenate requirement to other refiners.
No banking of credits from one year to the next, however, is allowed, in order to keep the program as simple as possible.


Averaging and trading provide refiners many benefits. For example, averaging provides refiners with production
flexibility, since every gallon need not meet the renewable oxygenate requirement. Trading provides additional
flexibility by permitting refiners to specialize: it may be more cost-effective for some refiners than others to
produce reformulated gasoline with a renewable oxygenate content. Trading enables those refiners for whom it is
less cost-effective to buy renewable credits from those who find it more cost-effective to blend renewable oxygenates.
Averaging and trading also allow refiners to avoid any cost associated with compliance margins, since refiners will
not need to blend renewable oxygenates in excess of the 30 percent requirement to assure compliance. 

These provisions are especially important during the initial startup of the program. While the renewable oxygenate
program takes effect for refiners beginning December 1, 1994, individual refiners do not need to blend any renewable
oxygenate into their gasoline until later in the year, or at all if they so desire. They will just have to demonstrate
that they met the requirements over the course of the entire year through either the blending of greater than 15% renewable
oxygenates in the latter part of the year, or the purchase of credits from other refiners. As a result, the averaging
and trading provisions effectively provide refiners with additional time to meet the initial requirements of the
program, and allows them to smoothly ramp up their use of renewable oxygenates during the course of the first year to
the full 30% requirement in the second year (1996).

1. Averaging Period 



USDA submitted comments to the Agency encouraging a season-specific averaging program, rather than an annual averaging
program. USDA argued that requiring the renewables requirement to be met separately for VOC-controlled and non-VOC-controlled
gasoline would increase the energy and environmental benefits. Specifically, USDA suggested that a season-specific
program would provide additional incentives to convert ethanol that would otherwise have been blended directly
into summer RFG into the form of ETBE. USDA argued that the resulting reduction in summer ethanol use would further
reduce commingling effects and lead to additional VOC emission reductions due to the distillation characteristics
of ETBE. USDA suggested that a season-specific program would provide the potential for ethanol market share to expand
beyond 30 percent in future years. The reader is referred to the RIA for a detailed discussion of the seasonal averaging
program suggested by USDA. 

EPA has considered the issues raised by USDA, and has decided to retain the annual averaging period proposed in the
December NPRM, based on an analysis of the logistical, energy, environmental, and cost impacts of splitting the summer
and winter seasons. First, seasonal averaging would require ETBE use in VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline,
which presents serious capacity problems in the short-term. Although only minor modifications are necessary in
order to produce ethers from ethanol rather than methanol, it will take some time to make those ether production facility
conversions and to acquire the necessary construction and operating permits. EPA's analysis indicates that insufficient
ETBE capacity would be available to fully meet the summer requirements of a season-specific renewable program in
1995 and likely also 1996. As a result, a seasonal averaging program would have to be delayed and/or phased in. Since,
as discussed below, EPA anticipates the Phase II RFG requirements to stimulate the use of ETBE, a phased-in requirement
might have little actual impact on ETBE use. In addition, a split season program would introduce additional complexity
and expense to the renewable oxygenate and reformulated gasoline programs. ETBE is more expensive on an oxygen content
basis than either MTBE or ethanol, and ETBE provides smaller toxics emission reductions than other oxygenates included
in EPA's RFG emission models, which refiners would have to offset through other fuel controls. Thus, forcing ETBE
use in summer gasoline in order to meet a season-specific renewable oxygenate requirement could have increased the
cost of compliance with the annual toxics requirement of the reformulated gasoline rule, especially under Phase
I of the RFG program, and complicated implementation of the RFG program given the short leadtime available. This problem
would have been particularly severe during the initial years of the program, since the refinery modifications necessary
to offset the increase in toxics emissions can require several years to complete, and since the value of ETBE's RVP
benefits will increase only when the Phase II RFG standards are implemented. 

Furthermore, EPA concluded that the purposes of the program could be achieved without a season-specific program.
The renewable oxygenate program is being promulgated to provide two primary benefits: reducing the fossil energy
impact of RFG, and stimulating the development of renewable fuels which can lead to greenhouse gas emission benefits,
this would supplement the VOC and toxics emissions reduction benefits from RFG. ETBE use per se is not required to obtain
these benefits. Based on the DOE analysis, ETBE use during the summer does not provide any additional fossil energy
benefit than ethanol use in the winter, and in fact, results in a slightly smaller fossil energy savings. The program
may also achieve some marginal crude oil savings and some additional VOC emission benefits with the use of ETBE during
the summer months (due to the favorable front-end distillation characteristics of ETBE relative to ethanol and MTBE).
However, EPA does not believe a split season is necessary to stimulate the use of ETBE in the summer months, particularly
when the Phase II RFG standards take effect.

In summary, EPA believes that a season-specific program would offer minimal energy and environmental benefits,
would increase complexity and impair compliance flexibility resulting in increased costs in complying with the
program, would likely run into near-term capacity limitations, and would have no impact on the overall use of renewable
fuels. As a result, EPA considers a season-specific program to be unnecessary in order to achieve the objectives of
this program. 



E. Level of Renewables Required 



1. Existing Renewables Market Share 



During the rulemaking process, EPA considered requiring greater and lesser levels of renewable oxygenates and requested
comment on the appropriateness of the proposed 30 percent level for renewables. Under the winter oxygenated fuels
program, which began in 1992, ethanol has been used in approximately 30 percent of the oxygenated gasoline. That program
includes certain areas that will require RFG, but in general it focuses on non-RFG areas with wintertime carbon monoxide
(CO) problems. Based on this experience, it appears that splash-blended ethanol can be expected to be used in at least
thirty percent of the oxygenate market when the RVP increase resulting from the blend is not constrained, given existing
incentives for the use of ethanol and other renewable oxygenates. The 30 percent requirement for the renewable oxygenate
program helps assure that, at minimum, renewable oxygenates will be used to an extent similar to what would have occurred
in the RFG-related oxygenate market had the air quality imperatives of the RFG program not required constraints on
RVP levels. This will avoid a situation where the requirements and complexity of the RFG program limit the growth of
renewable oxygenate use. Today's renewable oxygenate requirement will in effect set a floor to avoid reduced use
of renewable oxygenates in the future. It does not set a ceiling, and should not interfere with growth of renewable
oxygenate use. There are no similar restrictions placed on the remaining 70 percent of the RFG oxygenate market. As
discussed below in section III.E.4, if MTBE dominates this portion of the RFG oxygenate market as anticipated, MTBE
use will still grow dramatically over its current demand. 



2. Renewables Production Capacity 



In the December proposal, EPA stated that given the current absence of renewable methanol capacity, ethanol and its
ether derivatives were likely to be the primary oxygenates used to meet the renewable oxygenate requirement in the
short term. Based on 1990 data, EPA estimated that the 30 percent renewable oxygenate requirement would require an
average production of roughly 630 million gallons of ethanol per year, or about 60 percent of EPA's estimate of current
ethanol production capacity of roughly one billion gallons per year. EPA has updated these estimates, as discussed
more fully in the RIA, and now estimates that approximately 670 million gallons per year of ethanol will be needed to
meet the requirements of the renewables program alone in the 1995-1996 time frame. Other analyses have reached
similar conclusions; for example, USDA's analysis indicates that the 30 percent renewable oxygenate requirement
would require an average production of 680 million gallons per year. As discussed below in section III.F, EPA believes
that this new demand can be met, provided there is a phase-in of the program in 1995. A phase-in will give oxygenate producers,
refiners, and terminals one additional year to obtain permits, construct facilities and negotiate contracts before
the full program goes into effect in 1996. 



3. Comments Regarding the Level of Renewables 



The majority of comments from ethanol suppliers and feedstock producers who addressed the appropriate level of renewable
oxygenates supported the 30 percent requirement. The primary rationale for their support was that the current market
share for ethanol in the oxygenated fuels program should be maintained. 

Comments were received recommending both higher and lower levels of renewable oxygenates. Higher levels were suggested
in the belief that the ethanol industry needed the additional encouragement through just such an incentive to grow
at a more desirable rate. At this point in time, however, the 30 percent renewables requirement in those areas covered
by the RFG program represents a considerable stimulus to the renewable oxygenate industry. EPA believes that a larger
renewable oxygenate requirement would call into question the near-term feasibility of the renewables program.
Furthermore, EPA believes that the 30 percent level is all that is necessary to overcome the ethanol blending limitations
in RFG caused by the VOC performance standard, since this is the level ethanol was able to achieve absent any blending
restrictions under the winter oxygenated fuels program. In addition, the 30 percent renewables requirement being
promulgated today is a minimum requirement. It does not prevent renewable oxygenates from increasing their share
of the gasoline oxygenate market. 

Many of those opposing the 30 percent requirement argued that it could create the potential for supply disruption
and significant cost increases in the short-term. The oil and MTBE industries objected to the necessity for a renewable
oxygenate program out-of-hand. They argued that since ethanol already has a large portion of the current wintertime
oxygenated fuel market and since the market for ethanol would likely increase when the RFG program begins in 1995,
the 30 percent renewable oxygenate program was unnecessary. Others, notably state air pollution control officials,
recommended that the 30 percent requirement be lowered to 10 percent in order to mitigate any potentially negative
environmental and energy impacts, as well as to allow the market more input in selecting the oxygenates used in the
program. EPA has considered these comments but continues to believe that the 30 percent requirement is appropriate
and feasible given the energy and environmental benefits of the renewables requirement and long-running governmental
policies to promote renewable fuels. The basis for these conclusions is discussed elsewhere in this notice and in
the RIA.

4. Implications for Non-Renewable Oxygenates 


EPA believes the 30 percent level will provide the benefits identified above and stimulate the development of a diverse
supply of oxygenates for the oxygenate market. The 30 percent requirement will ensure a strong role for renewable
oxygenates in the RFG program while still permitting the majority of the RFG oxygenate market share to be open to any
oxygenate, regardless of the feedstocks used to produce it. Even with today's rule, production of MTBE and its methanol
feedstock is projected to increase because of the increased demand for oxygenates in the United States as the RFG program
takes effect. MTBE demand would increase by 3.1 billion gallons annually if it is used in all of the remaining 70 percent
of the RFG oxygenate market. Such an expansion equals an approximate increase of 170 percent from current MTBE usage
levels. While EPA acknowledges that MTBE and methanol demand might be even greater in the absence of today's rule,
it is important to note that the RFG program is likely to result in dramatic growth in MTBE, methanol, and ethanol production.
Furthermore, MTBE producers can modify their facilities at relatively modest expense to produce ETBE if its use should
prove economically advantageous given the requirements of the RFG program and today's rule. 
Similar conclusions hold true for the natural gas industry. Natural gas is used to produce methanol and isobutylene,
which in turn are used to produce MTBE. Since MTBE production is projected to grow from current levels as a result of
the RFG program, EPA expects the demand for natural gas for oxygenate production to grow as well. Furthermore, isobutylene
derived from natural gas is expected to play a major role in ETBE production. It should also be noted that oxygenate
production represents a small portion of total demand for natural gas. 
For these reasons, EPA does not believe that today's action will result in significant adverse effects on the MTBE,
methanol, or natural gas industries, as their markets will dramatically increase with or without today's action.
This is particularly the case since a considerable amount of ethanol was likely to have been used to satisfy the RFG
program requirements absent today's rule. As discussed in section III.F, based on the expansion of ethanol production
capacity planned prior to this rule, ethanol could potentially have been used to fulfill 15 percent of the oxygenate
requirement of the RFG program. 


F. Timing and Phase-In 


1. Introduction 


In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require that renewable oxygenates be used to meet 30 percent of the 2.0 weight percent oxygen
requirement for the RFG program. However, at that time EPA was concerned whether adequate supplies of renewable oxygenates
would be available and whether the distribution infrastructure was sufficient during the initial years of the program
without disrupting existing markets for such oxygenates or incurring excessive costs. With that in mind, the proposal
requested comments concerning these issues. More specifically, comments were requested on the appropriate level
of the renewable oxygenate requirement, leadtime requirements associated with providing adequate renewable oxygenate
supplies, the potential need for a phase-in period, and any other supply-related issues. In response, EPA received
considerable information on the current and projected supply of renewable oxygenates, as well as less complete information
regarding the logistics of renewable oxygenate distribution. The detailed analysis is contained in the Regulatory
Impact Analysis (RIA), and is summarized below. Based on the projected supply of renewable oxygenates over time and
the leadtime required to establish blending and storage facilities, EPA has concluded that, while the market can
readily bear a 30 percent requirement given adequate leadtime, a phase-in of the 30 percent requirement is necessary.
Therefore, EPA is requiring that 15 percent of the RFG program's 2.0 weight percent oxygen requirement be met from
renewable oxygenate sources in 1995, and that the full 30 percent of the oxygen requirement be met from such sources
in 1996 and thereafter. 
The purpose of EPA's analysis was to determine whether sufficient renewable oxygenate supply, distribution, tankage,
and blending capacity would be available in 1995 and 1996 to meet the program requirements. Failure to have sufficient
supply, distribution, tankage, or blending capacity for the considerable increase in renewable oxygenate demand
could result in shortages or price spikes and could interfere with the orderly implementation of the reformulated
gasoline program. 
In addition, EPA considered it to be desirable for a variety of reasons to limit to the extent possible any need to displace
substantial amounts of ethanol from existing markets. First, displacing ethanol from existing markets would do
nothing to expand the use of renewable oxygenates and achieve the resulting benefits. Second, shifting ethanol from
existing markets to RFG markets would not stimulate the introduction of more advanced renewable fuels production
technology. Third, as described in sections III.H and VI of this notice, the use of ethanol from new or expanded plants
is projected to displace more fossil energy than would ethanol from existing plants. Fourth, relatively high prices
for ethanol would be needed to displace it from existing markets, leading to higher than necessary price increases
for RFG during the initial years of the program. Ethanol purchase contracts may already be established for 1995, and
breaking such agreements in order to shift ethanol from existing gasoline markets to RFG markets might be difficult
and costly. Furthermore, approximately half of current ethanol consumption occurs in states which offer substantial
tax credits for ethanol blends. These credits are equal in value to between 10 and 20 cents per gallon of ethanol. To
induce ethanol suppliers to shift ethanol from such markets to unsubsidized markets would likely require a purchase
price in excess of current market prices for ethanol equal to or greater than the value of the tax credits available
in existing markets. In addition, ethanol is currently used in many markets to provide the added octane for mid-grade
and premium gasolines. These gasoline grades enjoy a considerable retail price premium which can be reflected in
the price paid for the ethanol. These price premiums for ethanol blended mid-grade and premium gasolines may not be
available to the same extent in the new renewable oxygenate markets, particularly for the full amount of ethanol expected
to be blended under the renewable oxygenate program.

The analysis examined each element of the renewable oxygenate supply process separately. First EPA evaluated which
renewable oxygenates would be likely to be used to fulfill the program requirements during the early years of the program
and what volume of oxygenate that represented. Second, feedstocks for the production of these oxygenates were examined
to determine whether sufficient feedstock supplies would be available. Third, EPA examined the adequacy of projected
production capacity for the dominant oxygenates for the first years of the program. Fourth, EPA investigated whether
transportation and distribution networks were adequate to support the program during the initial years. Fifth,
EPA examined the projected storage and blending capability during this time frame. EPA examined the capability over
time of each link in the renewable oxygenate production and distribution chain to handle the demands of the renewable
oxygenate program, and concluded that a phase-in of the 30 percent requirement is necessary and that the phase-in
being promulgated today is an appropriate response to leadtime concerns. 


2. Likely Renewable Oxygenates 


Ethanol is likely to be the dominant renewable oxygenate used to meet the renewable oxygenate requirements, especially
during the initial years of the program, since it is the only renewable oxygenate currently produced in large quantities.
Since ethanol cannot be blended during the summer months to meet the requirements of the program, its use will be concentrated
during the winter months. ETBE, the simplest ether derived from ethanol, also is likely to be used in significant quantities
since it, unlike ethanol, can be blended during the summer months to meet the requirements of the program. As discussed
below in section III.F.6, however, ETBE production capacity is expected to be virtually non-existent in 1995 due
to construction and permitting time constraints. Its use is expected to increase by 1996 through the conversion of
existing MTBE facilities so that the requirements of the program are met by a combination of ethanol use in the winter
and ETBE use year-round. Other renewable oxygenates are not expected to be available in significant quantities before
1997 given the leadtime required to design and construct new renewable production facilities. ETBE use is expected
to increase further during the summer months once the Phase II RFG standards take effect in the year 2000, since ETBE
use will make it easier (relative to MTBE) for refiners to achieve the more stringent VOC performance standards. 


3. New Renewable Oxygenate Demand 


Before EPA could evaluate the adequacy of the renewable oxygenate supply, distribution, and blending capacity,
it was necessary to estimate the program's demand for renewable oxygenates. The estimate was derived in terms of new
ethanol demand, since as discussed above only ethanol or ETBE are expected to be used in significant quantities during
the first few years of the program, and since the use of ETBE would not alter the total amount of ethanol required by today's
rule because the oxygen in ETBE is derived solely from ethanol. The ethanol demand created by the program was estimated
by multiplying the projected 1995 volume of reformulated gasoline covered by the Federal RFG program (including
the two covered California areas) of 38.7 billion gallons per year by the volume percent of ethanol (5.76 percent)
necessary to meet to 2.0 weight percent oxygen requirement in 30 percent of RFG. As a result, today's program is estimated
to require about 670 million gallons of ethanol to meet the full 30 percent requirement. In actual practice, refiners
may blend greater or lesser amounts of ethanol in any individual gallon of RFG, depending on such factors as tax credits
and price and availability of various oxygenates. 
The actual amount of new ethanol production required by today's rule is smaller than 670 million gallons because some
ethanol is currently sold in areas covered by the RFG program. Based on the monthly reporting by Information Resources,
Inc. (IRI) for 1993, it appears that as much as 280 million gallons of ethanol is already being used in areas covered
by the reformulated gasoline program (State-wide data was weighted based on population to reflect ethanol consumption
only in the RFG areas within the State). Not all of this can be credited toward the renewable oxygenate program, however,
unless the summertime use is converted to ETBE. Based on the IRI data, as much as 180 million gallons of ethanol is currently
being used during those months of the year in which EPA would expect non-VOC-controlled gasoline to be produced (on
average September 15 through March 31). Thus, the amount of additional wintertime ethanol production required to
meet a 30 percent renewable oxygenate requirement in 1995 would be approximately 490 million gallons (390 million
gallons in new, year-round capacity in later years once ETBE production capacity can be brought on-line). A 15 percent
phase-in of the program would require approximately 155 million gallons of additional ethanol production. While
this volume of ethanol could be met using existing capacity by displacing ethanol from existing ethanol markets,
EPA believes, for reasons discussed earlier, it is desirable to minimize displacing significant amounts of ethanol
from existing markets.

4. Feedstock Capacity 


The next step in EPA's analysis was to determine whether sufficient feedstocks were available to permit this increase
in renewable oxygenate production. According to comments received from agricultural interests, corn is the feedstock
for 90 percent of current ethanol production and is expected to provide the vast bulk of the feedstock for new ethanol
capacity added in the near term. Of the total 8.7 billion bushels of corn produced in an average year,

17

 approximately 360 million bushels (approximately 4 percent of average annual corn production) was used to produce
an estimated 900 million gallons of ethanol. Therefore, the estimated 490 million gallons of new ethanol demand resulting
from today's rule would increase corn demand by approximately 195 million bushels, or about 2 percent. Based on this
analysis, EPA has concluded that the feedstock demands for this program can be satisfied solely with corn without
significant difficulty. In addition, other feedstocks can be used to produce renewable oxygenates, including waste
products from farms, dairy operations, bakeries, and the soft drink industry; from cellulosic sources such as grasses
and fast-growing energy crops, and from such sources as municipal solid waste. Based on the diversity and immense
supply of these potential feedstocks, EPA has concluded that feedstock supplies are sufficient to support the requirements
of the renewable oxygenate program being promulgated today. 




5. Ethanol Supply and Production Capacity 


Current (1993) ethanol operating production capacity nationwide has been estimated by DOE to be approximately 1.15
billion gallons. Data from IRI for 1993 estimates ethanol consumption at roughly 1.25 billion gallons, and EPA received
comments from an ethanol producer that 1994 ethanol production was projected to be 1.25 billion gallons. As a result,
current ethanol production would be more than sufficient to meet the requirements of today's rulemaking as long as
no constraints were placed on the volume of ethanol that could be diverted from existing markets. However, as discussed
above, there are several reasons why EPA considers it appropriate to minimize to the extent possible diverting ethanol
from existing markets to satisfy the renewable oxygenate program. As a result, EPA examined the amount of current
excess ethanol capacity and projected new ethanol capacity to determine the amount of renewable oxygenates that
would be available to supply the needs of the program being promulgated today during the initial years of the program.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the current ethanol production capacity is as high as 1.4 billion
gallons per year. One commenter representing the ethanol industry submitted a list of existing ethanol plants and
their operational capacity which suggested that current ethanol production capacity is also nearly 1.4 billion
gallons per year. Based on this production capacity information and on the current domestic ethanol consumption
estimates, it appears that there may be approximately 150 million gallons of excess ethanol production capacity
(some of which may currently be exported) currently available that could be used to supply the requirements of the
renewable oxygenate program. However, not all of this production could be used to supply ethanol for blending during
the winter; only approximately 80 million gallons could be supplied from current excess capacity during the winter
months. 
In addition to current excess capacity, a considerable amount of new capacity is expected to come on-line in the remainder
of 1994, 1995, and 1996, according to information supplied by the Renewable Fuels Association and USDA. This information
suggests that approximately 305 million gallons per year of additional ethanol capacity is currently under construction
and will become available in 1995. (Additional amounts are possible, but more speculative.) Furthermore, plans
were being made for another 304 million gallons of annual capacity to be brought on line in 1996, though much of that
apparently depended on the outcome of today's rulemaking. USDA estimated similar increases in ethanol capacity
over this time period. It should be noted that not all of the additional capacity available in 1995 would be available
at the beginning of the year, and not all of it could be dedicated to production only during the winter months as would
be required until ETBE production capacity comes on-line. A similar situation would occur in 1996. After considering
these factors, EPA has concluded that approximately 93 million gallons of additional ethanol production from new
capacity will be available for blending during the winter months to meet the program requirements in 1995, and an additional
157 million gallons to meet the program requirements during the winter months in 1996. 
It should be noted that additional ethanol capacity also may become available from corn processors, many of whom already
have feedstock processing facilities in operation and would only need to install the capital equipment necessary
to ferment the starch and separate the ethanol. Such processors may be able to install ethanol production capacity
relatively quickly. Based on comments received, however, EPA cannot conclude with any degree of assurance that such
additional capacity will become available. 

Based on the foregoing analysis, EPA believes that as much as 173 million gallons of new ethanol production can be made
available during the winter months to meet 1995 program requirements and 330 million gallons during the winter months
to meet the 1996 requirements. After taking into consideration the 180 million gallons of ethanol currently blended
in the RFG markets during the winter months, a total of 353 million and 510 million gallons of ethanol should be available
for blending during the winter months in both 1995 and 1996, respectively. As shown in the following table, absent
a phase-in and ETBE production capacity, 317 million gallons of ethanol would have to be diverted from existing markets
in 1995 and 160 million gallons would have to be diverted in 1996.

To the extent that existing ethanol storage capacity can be used to store ethanol produced during the summer for use
in the winter, and to the extent that ETBE can be produced from ethanol produced during the summer and be blended into
summer RFG, the amount of ethanol displaced from existing markets would be reduced. Based on comments received by
EPA, the amount of ethanol storage capacity appears to be approximately 116 million gallons. If this storage capacity
were devoted to storing summer ethanol for use in winter RFG, then ethanol displacements from existing markets would
fall to 201 million gallons in 1995 (with no phase-in) and 41 million gallons in 1996. As discussed in the next section,
EPA does not anticipate that significant amounts of ETBE can be available in 1995, though sufficient amounts to meet
the needs of the program could potentially be available in 1996. ETBE blended into VOC-controlled RFG receives credit
under today's rule, so its availability would allow the new summer ethanol production capacity to satisfy part of
the renewable oxygenate requirement and would reduce the displacement of winter ethanol from existing, non-RFG
markets. Based on this analysis, EPA believes that insufficient renewable oxygenate production capacity is likely
to be available to supply the 30 percent renewables requirement by 1995 without a considerable shift of supply from
existing markets, but that adequate capacity should exist by 1996. 


6. ETBE Capacity 


ETBE, the simplest ether derived from ethanol, offers several advantages to refiners over ethanol or MTBE. Unlike
ethanol blends, ETBE blends can be shipped through pipelines. ETBE has a higher octane value than MTBE or ethanol,
which would be valuable to refiners struggling to satisfy octane demand while simultaneously reducing high-octane
components such as aromatics and olefins in order to comply with the RFG toxics and NOx requirements. Like MTBE, ETBE
does not produce commingling-related increases in RVP levels and hence is eligible for credit year-round under today's
rule. ETBE also has a lower blending RVP than ethanol or MTBE, which in the near term would permit refiners who use ETBE
to remove less butane to reach a desired RVP level. Beginning in the year 2000, ETBE's low blending RVP should be even
more attractive when the more stringent Phase II performance requirements for RFG take effect. Finally, larger amounts
of ETBE than MTBE or ethanol are needed to satisfy RFG's oxygen requirement, and these larger amounts of ETBE would
dilute undesirable gasoline properties such as sulfur to a greater extent than would the other two oxygenates. 
However, ETBE typically costs more to produce than MTBE or ethanol per unit oxygen. Because of these cost disadvantages
current ETBE production levels are very low. EPA expects ETBE production to grow even without today's rule in order
to achieve the low RVP levels needed to meet RFG's Phase II VOC performance standards. Today's rule will make ETBE production
even more attractive, since ETBE-blended RFG can receive renewables credit throughout the year. However, EPA has
concluded that large amounts of additional ETBE capacity cannot be expected for 1995. At least one year and perhaps
longer is expected to be required before significant volumes of ETBE become available. According to current ether
producers, existing MTBE plants are likely to require one to three years to convert to ETBE production. Up to a full
year is needed to acquire construction permits and complete the requisite engineering work. Conversion of the MTBE
plant to produce ETBE is estimated to require from six months to two years, and several months of trial production may
be needed before full production of ETBE can commence. Furthermore, ETBE production is also dependent on the development
of adequate ethanol production, unless the ethanol is merely diverted from existing markets. Based on this information,
EPA does not expect significant amounts of ETBE production to be possible until the summer of 1996. 
Furthermore, ether production process licensers also indicated that plant conversion to ETBE production could
reduce throughput (relative to MTBE throughput), depending on the plant and the type of equipment installed. The
reduction is caused by differing reaction conditions and the different nature of the reactants involved. Since considerable
MTBE capacity would have to be converted to ETBE production to satisfy the full 30 percent renewables requirement,
EPA is concerned that this loss of throughput might create shortages of oxygenates during the first year of the RFG
program. EPA believes that phasing in the renewables requirement will reduce the risk of such shortages and allow
a more orderly phase-in of ethanol and ETBE production capacity. 


7. Transportation 


EPA has also analyzed whether the additional ethanol produced under today's rule can be transported from where it
would be produced to where it would be consumed. According to the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), water-based transportation
is the most economical method of shipping ethanol both within the Midwest and from the Midwest to East Coast and West
Coast markets. For plants and markets without access to water-based transportation, railway transportation is
the most likely transportation mode. EPA has analyzed each piece of the transportation network, specifically: (1)
The river barge capacity on the Mississippi River, (2) the ship or ocean barge capacity between the Gulf of Mexico and
East and West Coast markets, and (3) the transportation capacity for ethanol movement from ports to retail markets.

Based on a 1992 report by the Army Corps of Engineers regarding barge traffic on U.S rivers, it appears that transportation
by barge of all of the new ethanol production resulting from today's renewable oxygenates program would represent
less than 1 percent of U.S. river barge capacity. As a result, EPA has concluded that today's program is unlikely to
cause noticeable changes in shipping patterns or shipping prices. Based on current barge shipping prices, the cost
for shipping ethanol from the Midwest to the Gulf of Mexico is estimated to cost 4-5 cents per gallon.

<TEXT>
 

The barges used on inland waterways cannot be used on the open ocean. Hence ethanol destined for East Coast or West Coast
markets must be transferred to ocean-going freighters or tankers. Nevertheless, based on conversations with New
Orleans port officials, current shipping capacity should be more than adequate to supply the shipping requirements
demanded by today's rule. Transportation from the Gulf to either Coast is expected to cost 5-7 cents per gallon.

Not all the ethanol shipped from the Midwest to other markets would have to be shipped by ocean-going vessels, however,
since some of the ethanol could be used in ether plants located in the Gulf area to produce ETBE, which then would be blended
into gasoline and shipped by pipeline to markets in Texas, the Midwest, or the East Coast. Pipelines are considered
the most economical method of transporting liquids, and the costs of shipping ETBE to RFG markets by pipeline would
be comparable to the costs of shipping MTBE to such markets. 
Furthermore, the averaging and trading provisions incorporated into today's action can be used to limit to some extent
the amount of oxygenate transportation that is necessary. As much as 12 percentage points out of the total 30% renewable
oxygenate requirement could theoretically be met with ethanol blended in the Midwest RFG markets where transportation
constraints are limited, and the credits traded to refiners marketing RFG in more distant markets. 
Given the foregoing analysis (which is discussed more fully in the RIA), EPA does not believe that transportation
presents a bottleneck to implementation of today's rule, although there are cost implications. Furthermore, EPA
did not receive any comments suggesting that transportation would present implementation problems for the renewable
oxygenate rule. 


8. Storage and Blending Capacity 


Given sufficient production of ethanol and adequate transportation from the point of production to their final markets,
the remaining lead-time issue is that associated with adequate ethanol storage and blending capacity at the terminals
where it is blended with gasoline. When the ethanol is offloaded at its end-use market, it must be stored in large terminal
storage tanks. The capacity of these tanks must be sufficient to offload the entire shipment. Once offloaded, the
ethanol then must be blended with gasoline. Some terminals splash-blend ethanol with essentially no additional
equipment or facilities, while others use more sophisticated blending equipment. EPA did not receive comments of
a nature sufficient to evaluate the adequacy or inadequacy of current ethanol storage and blending facilities. In
order to determine whether adequate storage and blending capacity to support the renewable oxygenates program exists,
EPA estimated the storage and blending capacity being used to meet the current demand for ethanol in the RFG areas and
compared that with the storage and blending capacity that would be necessary to meet the program requirements. In
order to estimate the current storage and blending capacity, EPA examined the peak monthly ethanol blending rates
reported by IRI for each RFG market during 1993. EPA extrapolated this peak blending rate over the entire non-VOC control
season to estimate the current blending capacity available to support the renewable oxygenate program. The results
of this analysis are shown in the following table.

Based on this analysis, adequate tankage and blending equipment exists for roughly 12 percent of the oxygenate required
by the reformulated gasoline program to be supplied by ethanol during the winter months only. This is well short of
the total 30 percent required by the program, and even short of a 15 percent phase-in level. In order to implement the
program smoothly, this shortfall will have to be made up by one of three means: first, pass a greater volume of ethanol
through existing tankage and blending equipment; second, construct new ethanol storage and blending capacity at
terminals; or third, supplement ethanol blended at terminals with ETBE blended at refineries. 
It is reasonable to assume that some additional ethanol could be blended at the existing facilities by increasing
the throughput of storage tanks and blending equipment, particularly in the Midwest where the close proximity to
ethanol production facilities allows for greater flexibility in receiving and blending ethanol shipments. EPA
does not believe it unreasonable to assume that ethanol throughput could be increased by 25 percent or more in 1995,
since it is unlikely that existing facilities were all designed to operate at their current peak levels with no provisions
made for market growth. To the extent throughput can be increased by even more than 25 percent in some markets it could
be used to offset (through credit trading) any shortfall in other markets. As a result, a phase-in level of 15 percent
should be achievable in 1995 even without expanding ethanol storage and blending facilities. Even if this were not
the case, it is reasonable to assume that some additional storage and blending capacity beyond that available in 1993
may have been planned to be available in 1995 to keep up with the planned increases discussed above in ethanol production
by 1995. 
It is not reasonable, however, to assume that existing facilities could increase their throughput by the 150 percent
necessary to achieve the full 30 percent requirement of today's program. Furthermore, as discussed above, no appreciable
ETBE production capacity is expected to be available until the summer of 1996. As a result, the only way to meet the full
30 percent requirement of the program in 1995 would be through the addition of new ethanol storage and blending capacity.
Current estimates of the time necessary to obtain permits, construct new storage and blending facilities, and make
them fully operational vary, but range between approximately 6 and 18 months. Thus, sufficient time would not be available
to bring on-line additional ethanol storage and blending facilities for use until the fall of 1995. The expanded ethanol
blending capacity available by this time is unlikely to be sufficient to supply the full 30 percent requirement over
the course of the entire year. Even if it were sufficient, it would not have been available for the entire year and hence
would not be sufficient to satisfy the 30 percent requirement. In order to meet the full 30 percent requirement in 1995,
storage and blending capacity in excess of what would be needed in subsequent years would have to be built in 1995. While
it is very difficult to predict specific market responses, especially given the compliance flexibilities built
into the program, it does not appear that sufficient ethanol storage and blending capacity is likely to exist for 1995
without either a phase-in of the program or extraordinary measures to provide additional blending capacity (e.g.,
tanker truck shipments from terminals outside the RFG areas). 
The situation is different for 1996, however. It may be possible by 1996 for a considerable amount of ETBE to be blended
at the refineries during both summer and winter months. Since refinery-blended ETBE would not require specialized
blending facilities at terminals, increased ETBE use might reduce considerably the 150% increase in ethanol blending
capacity that would otherwise be necessary. Furthermore, the additional time provided by a phase-in would allow
for the construction of additional ethanol storage and blending facilities, most of which could be in place at the
beginning of the annual averaging program in January of 1996. Much of this additional ethanol blending capacity is
likely to be added in the Midwest to take advantage of lower ethanol transportation costs and State tax exemptions.
However, even if every gallon of RFG in the Midwest contained 10 volume percent ethanol, only 40% of the renewable oxygenates
required by the program could be met by Midwest ethanol usage in RFG. As a result, until a significant amount of ETBE
production comes on-line, ethanol storage and blending capacity in RFG markets outside the Midwest will have to expand
by as much as 100 percent (i.e., capacity would have to double).

9. Summary and Conclusions 


Based on the foregoing analyses, EPA believes that given the compliance flexibilities built into the program it is
feasible for sufficient feedstocks, production capacity, transportation capacity, and blending capacity to be
available to meet the full 30 percent renewables requirement by 1996. However, EPA is concerned that neither supply
nor blending capacity will be adequate in 1995 to satisfy the full 30 percent requirement. While a supply shortfall
could be filled by diverting ethanol from its current markets to RFG markets, such diversions would be costly and would
not meet any of the objectives of today's rule, as has been discussed earlier in this notice. Furthermore, even if such
diversions were to occur, EPA is concerned that insufficient blending capacity would be in place in 1995 to blend the
requisite volumes of ethanol into non-VOC-controlled RFG. The risks of this are significant and the consequences
could be dramatic with shortages, price spikes, and other market disruptions. For these reasons, EPA has decided
that a phase-in of the 30 percent renewables requirement is both necessary and prudent. During the first year of the
program (December 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995), 15 percent of the RFG program's minimum 2.0 weight percent oxygen
requirement must be met by renewable oxygenates. In 1996 and subsequent years, the minimum renewables content will
increase to 30 percent of the RFG program's minimum oxygen content. Even with such a phase-in, it is still likely that
some shifting will occur from current markets into the markets created by today's program as a result of local economic
conditions and logistical considerations. However, these shifts are likely to be small relative to the overall size
of the renewable oxygenate program and would not materially alter the benefits of today's rule. 


G. Shoulder Season/Non-commingling Season 


1. Summary of the Issue and Comments 


EPA received comment on the ozone impacts of the renewable oxygenate proposal, particularly during the ``shoulder
season'' periods of April 1 through May 31 and September 16 through October 31 when the reformulated gasoline high
ozone period is not in effect. During these periods, VOC-controlled RFG is not required at the retail level. Commenters
expressed concern that the likely increase in ethanol market share in non-VOC-controlled RFG would increase VOC
emissions both directly (since the RVP increase from splash-blended ethanol would not be constrained by vapor pressure
limits in non-VOC-controlled RFG) and indirectly (since greater commingling effects would occur as the market share
for ethanol-blended RFG increases). Commenters representing state air quality regulators (NESCAUM, STAPPA/ALAPCO,
and CARB), argued that the net result of such increases in average RVP levels during the shoulder season would be increased
VOC emissions and higher ozone levels, especially in the Northeast and California. NESCAUM suggested that EPA extend
the season in which volatility-increasing alcohols would not receive renewable credit to April 1st through October
31st in order to eliminate the risk of any potential ozone increases. 
Other commenters such as the Clean Fuels Development Coalition and the Ethanol Ad-Hoc Committee argued that the use
of ethanol-blended RFGs during the shoulder season would not cause additional ozone exceedances for two reasons.
First, the spillover of VOC-controlled RFG, primarily ether-containing RFG, would reduce shoulder season RVP levels
below current levels. Second, they believed other pollution reduction programs being implemented over the next
several years would reduce ozone precursor emissions during the shoulder season. The combined effect would reduce
such precursors by more than any increases due to increased ethanol use, thereby negating any detrimental environmental
effects. 


2. EPA Analysis of the Renewable Program's Shoulder Season Emission Impact 


Although EPA agrees that increased ethanol use in non-VOC-controlled gasoline is likely, the Agency's analysis
indicates that any detrimental environmental effects should be negligible. The reformulated gasoline program
requires VOC-controlled fuel at the terminal from May 1-September 15. Refiners have indicated that they would
begin shipping such fuel as early as March 1 in order to assure that low-volume terminals and retail stations have fully
converted to VOC-controlled RFG by May 1 and June 1, respectively, as required by the RFG program. 
Since most fuel is sold at high-turnover retail outlets, EPA's analysis shows that many vehicles will begin operating
on VOC-controlled RFG during April. Also, most vehicles will continue to operate on VOC-controlled RFG until late
September or early October, since the fuel distribution system requires some time to replace summer fuel with winter
fuel after terminals are permitted to switch to winter fuel on September 16. Experience with the federal volatility
program supports these conclusions, as discussed in the RIA.

<TEXT>
 

EPA concludes that while increased ethanol use is likely in RFG sold from mid-October through late March, increased
ethanol use resulting from this program will be essentially zero in May and will be minimal in April, late September,
and early October. Furthermore, ethanol's commingling effect changes relatively little at ethanol market shares
between 30 and 70 percent and decreases at higher market shares. As discussed in section III.F, a number of States in
the Midwest and Northeast which will participate in the RFG program already have peak ethanol market shares approaching
or even above 30 percent. In addition, experience with the winter oxygenated fuels program indicates that ethanol
blends may well have represented 30 percent or more of the winter RFG demand in some RFG markets without today's rule
(including some midwestern and northeastern RFG markets), suggesting that any increase in ethanol use which might
occur during the shoulder season would cause little if any increase in commingling effects. Both of these factors
suggest that emission impacts resulting from ethanol's vapor pressure boost and commingling effects during the
shoulder season will be less than otherwise anticipated. Since ETBE use in summer RFG would likely reduce ethanol
use in winter RFG, the extent of any ethanol-related VOC increase during the shoulder season is likely to decrease
as ETBE capacity and usage increase. Finally, it should be noted that VOC emissions are unconstrained during the non-VOC
control season under both the RFG and volatility control programs since such emissions are not associated with ozone
exceedances because they do not occur outside the summer months in most of the country. Thus, today's rule is unlikely
to result in increased VOC emissions during the period when such emissions are controlled under current EPA fuel programs.




3. EPA Analysis of the Extent of the Shoulder Season Air Quality Problem 



In examining the shoulder season issue, EPA evaluated the extent of the air quality problem during the shoulder season.
EPA has found that ozone violations outside the May 1 to September 15 period (the period during which all gasoline at
terminals, and much of the gasoline at retail stations, is expected to be VOC-controlled) are minimal for those RFG
areas outside of California and Texas. Ozone monitor exceedances during September 16-October 31 and the month
of April in the Northeast comprised fewer than 4 percent of all such exceedances recorded in RFG areas in 1986-1988.
More recent 1990-1992 data for the Northeast confirm the earlier results: less than 2 percent of all ozone monitor
exceedances recorded in RFG areas occurred in the Northeast in April, late September, and October (and none in other
winter months). Further examination of the 1990-1992 data revealed that the documented ozone violations involve
just two distinct ozone episodes. These episodes (one in late April and one in mid-September) happened very near the
time of year when much of the RFG sold at retail stations is expected to be VOC-controlled. The various control measures
that apply year-round that will be implemented to attain the ozone standard on the highest exceedance days should
reduce ozone concentrations below the National ambient air quality standard for ozone in the shoulder season. Furthermore,
given the analysis of fuel turnover discussed previously, EPA believes that the renewable oxygenate program is unlikely
to contribute to increased ozone exceedances or additional high ozone episodes in the Northeast. 

However, the 1990-1992 data also indicate that a substantial number of ozone violations occurred during the
shoulder seasons in the reformulated gasoline areas in California and Texas. Violations appear to occur throughout
the year in both states. However, the state of California has imposed additional fuel regulations within its borders
to address air quality problems, and more stringent volatility requirements go into effect throughout the state
of California in 1996. These controls will already cover the April-October time frame in southern California,
and the state of California can extend this if they believe additional volatility controls during the period are appropriate.


Although Texas did not submit comments to the Agency on this issue, the possibility does exist that the renewable oxygenate
program may increase VOC emissions outside the high ozone season in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. To address this
problem, EPA has considered further restricting the times during which ethanol would receive renewables credit
in this rule. However, the year-round nature of Texas' current ozone exceedances could make such a solution impractical.
Furthermore, EPA's analysis of ethanol production and blending capacity indicates that further restrictions on
the times when ethanol would receive renewables credit could exacerbate the supply, distribution, and blending
concerns for 1995 and 1996 discussed in section III.F. As a result, EPA does not believe at this time that revising the
design of a national program (through such means as extending the period when alcohols do not receive credit toward
the renewables requirement on a nationwide basis) is appropriate. Furthermore, EPA believes that revising the design
of the program on less than a national basis (e.g., just for Texas and/or California), would be inappropriate at this
point in time without taking into consideration the unique requirements within each State.

4. Provisions of Today's Rule Regarding the Shoulder Season 


As discussed above, EPA does not expect today's rule to result in increased ozone exceedances during the shoulder
season. However, EPA recognizes that States may wish to further restrict the times during which ethanol blended into
RFG would receive credit toward the renewable oxygenate requirement in order to address their unique air quality
problems. As a result, EPA will extend the non-commingling season, during which oxygenates such as ethanol which
demonstrate commingling-related increases in RVP will not receive credit toward the renewable oxygenate requirement,
to any or all covered areas within a State at the State's request, subject to certain limitations as discussed below.

California is not subject to the preemption of state and local fuel controls under section 211(c)(4) of the Act and,
therefore, has broad flexibility in adopting its own state fuel control programs. While other states are subject
to these provisions, they can also implement their own fuel control programs if they are approved as part of their state
implementation plan (SIP) as being necessary to attain the national ambient air quality standards. As a result, the
states could take action on their own without petitioning EPA to modify its program. However, this petition provision
allows the states the additional flexibility of having the federal fuel control program modified (in this limited
manner) to adjust to their unique air quality needs. 

The request for extension of the non-commingling season must be signed by the Governor of the State for which the extension
is to apply. The petition must include evidence demonstrating that each of four criteria have been met. First, the
petition must include data collected subsequent to the implementation of the renewable oxygenate program showing
that an increase in oxygenates which produce commingling-related RVP increases (such as ethanol) has occurred in
the fuel sold in the petitioning State during the shoulder season, and that this increase is likely to continue. Second,
the petition must include evidence demonstrating a pattern of violations during the shoulder season of the ozone
National Ambient Air Quality Standards over the previous three years, based on ozone monitoring data, which would
warrant the extension being requested. In effect, this second criterion would require that the pattern of ozone violations
extend into the shoulder season. Third, the petition must include an analysis demonstrating that the pattern of ozone
violations is likely to continue even with implementation of all other ozone air quality control measures and programs
currently planned by the State. Fourth, the petition must demonstrate that its findings were made by the Governor
through a process that was responsive to public input and that included public notice and an opportunity for a public
hearing. These provisions are intended to provide States with air quality concerns the ability to prevent any direct
or indirect increase in VOC emissions during the non-summer season, while simultaneously providing assurance that
any such extension is granted only for those areas where restrictions on blending ethanol and other commingling oxygenates
may help address a genuine air quality problem. 

Once a valid petition is received satisfying the noted criteria, EPA will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 and tentatively establish the non-commingling season as requested by the governor and the effective date for the
new restrictions on blending of commingling oxygenates. These restrictions will take effect on the first day of the
next complete non-commingling season beginning one full year after the petition is received. If a petition is received
within three months of the publication of the notice in the 

Federal Register

 which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator either that the four criteria were not met or that the
change to the non-commingling season is not feasible by the effective date in the notice, EPA retains the right to either
reject the State's request for an extension or extend the effective date by up to two additional years, based on analysis
of the information contained in both petitions (the State petition and the opposing petition). For example, a satisfactory
request to extend the non-commingling season to encompass April which is received by the Administrator on April 20
of, say, 1997 would take effect on April 1, 1999 if no opposing petitions were submitted. 

Any changes in the duration of the non-commingling season as a result of these provisions will be enforced at the terminal,
as discussed in section IV. It should be noted that the criteria discussed above imply that the non-commingling season
will not be extended prior to 1997 for any State. 



H. Program Benefits 



The reformulated gasoline program promulgated December 15, 1993 will increase fossil energy use due to the need to
reduce RVP, the increased production and use of oxygenates, and fuel economy losses resulting from fuel reformulation
(as discussed in 59 FR 7716, February 16, 1994, and the Regulatory Impact Analysis found in Public Docket No. A-92-12).
As explained below, the use of renewable oxygenates in reformulated gasoline under the renewable oxygenate program
being promulgated today should reduce the fossil energy used by the reformulated gasoline program, particularly
in the long term. Today's renewable oxygenate program also helps assure that the RFG program is compatible with long-running
national policies and programs to obtain the benefits associated with the use of renewable fuels and could, according
to the Renewable Fuels Association, result in decreased imports of MTBE. Furthermore, the renewable oxygenate requirement
will help assure that the environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline program will be achieved and has the
potential to enhance those benefits, as discussed more fully below. And finally, the renewable oxygenate program
offers the potential for reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the future as more efficient renewable oxygenate production
technologies are introduced.

1. Energy Benefits


The energy benefits of the renewable oxygenate program are strongly dependent on the oxygenates used and the timeframe
considered. Technical and economic factors suggest that in the early years of the program, the renewable oxygenate
requirement will be met primarily with ethanol. According to a study prepared by the Department of Energy,

18

 if the 30 percent renewables requirement is met by either using ethanol produced in current-technology ethanol plants
in winter RFG, or ETBE in summer RFG, the overall fossil energy consumed in RFG production and use would be smaller than
would be the case if nonrenewable MTBE (the other oxygenate currently expected to capture a large share of the RFG oxygenate
market) were the only oxygenate used in RFG.




The renewable oxygenate program will also help to diversify the country's transportation energy supply away from
fossil energy (predominantly oil and natural gas) towards renewable energy by stimulating production of renewable
fuels such as ethanol and renewable methanol. This program will have a large impact on the renewable energy industry
in general and the ethanol industry in particular because the amounts of renewable fuels involved are large relative
to historical production levels.
The energy benefits of this program become more pronounced in later years. Improvements in the energy efficiency
of ethanol production, achieved through such means as the use of cogeneration or waste products to provide process
energy, will further reduce the fossil energy required to produce ethanol. Additional gains can be achieved by reducing
energy consumption and fertilizer use in corn farming through changes in farming practices, using more energy-efficient
equipment, increasing per-acre crop yields, and decreasing fertilizer use. Comments submitted by the Department
of Agriculture and others, as well as previous studies by DOE and EPA cited in the proposal, indicate that as new feedstocks
for ethanol such as cellulose are commercialized, and as renewable methanol production becomes viable, the fossil
energy benefits of this program would increase substantially relative to nonrenewable MTBE use. By providing a secure
minimum market for renewable oxygenates, today's program will help provide the certainty needed to encourage private
investments in modern, high-efficiency agricultural practices and renewable oxygenate production technology.


2. Environmental Benefits


a. 

Summer Ozone-Related Benefits. 

In addition to the energy benefits cited above, EPA believes this program has the potential to provide environmental
benefits in the near term, with the potential for even greater environmental benefits in the future. These potential
benefits stem from the incentives this program creates for the use of ETBE in summer RFG. Short-term limitations in
ETBE capacity suggest that most of the near-term program requirements will be met through the use of ethanol blended
into winter RFG. In the short term, summer RFG will not be affected by the program except to the extent that (1) renewable
MTBE is substituted for nonrenewable MTBE, and (2) small amounts of ETBE capacity become available. Replacing nonrenewable
MTBE with renewable MTBE would not alter the emission benefits of the RFG program. However, ETBE use helps assure that
the VOC emission reductions sought by the RFG program are achieved or exceeded in-use. Since ETBE production consumes
ethanol, ETBE use in summer RFG is likely to reduce direct ethanol use in summer RFG. (Even though ethanol used in summer
RFG would not receive credit toward the 30% renewables requirement, such use is still permitted under the RFG program.)
Ethanol's commingling effect discussed in section I tends to increase VOC emissions, so conversion of summer ethanol
to ETBE (which does not have a commingling effect) should reduce VOC emissions.
Replacing summer ethanol with ETBE may yield other benefits as well. ETBE-blended fuels with a given Reid vapor pressure
(RVP) produce less vapor (and hence smaller nonexhaust VOC emissions) when heated above 100 degrees Fahrenheit than
do ethanol fuels with the same RVP. A large fraction of summer VOC emissions are generated when gasoline is heated beyond
100 degrees Fahrenheit, so replacing ethanol or MTBE with ETBE in summer reformulated gasolines may yield additional
VOC emission reductions. These reductions, which are related to the front-end distillation properties of different
oxygenated fuel blends, have not been included in EPA's Simple or Complex Models for reformulated gasoline since
sufficient data to quantify accurately the size of these reductions is not yet available. However, sufficient data
is available to confirm expectations based on scientific theory that such reductions would occur.

<TEXT>
 

The size of the commingling and distillation benefits resulting from substitution of ETBE for ethanol in summer RFG
depends on the market share of ethanol-blended gasolines in each market. As discussed above, EPA cannot quantify
such benefits with certainty; however, the Agency estimates that if a 30 percent market share for ethanol blends in
summer RFG were replaced entirely by ETBE blends, total VOC emissions could be reduced by as much as 5 percent beyond
the reductions that would have occurred without changes in the market share for ethanol blends. Thus, by encouraging
the conversion of summer ethanol into ETBE, the renewable oxygenate requirement will help assure that the RFG program
achieves the maximum possible VOC reduction.
b. 

Shoulder Season Environmental Impacts. 

EPA received comments raising the concern that the use of ethanol in the ``shoulder season'' (the months bordering
the high-ozone season) could lead to ozone violations in certain areas. The comments raise two separate mechanisms
by which ethanol use could increase emissions of ozone precursors. First, ethanol addition to gasoline causes fuel
volatility to increase by approximately 1 psi, and during the shoulder season this increase is not constrained by
the RFG program. Second, ethanol-blended fuels can produce emission increases due to the commingling and distillation
effects described in the preceding section.
EPA has considered the shoulder season issue in detail and has concluded that the emission reductions anticipated
as a result of the RFG program should in most cases more than offset any emission increases due to the increased use of
ethanol in the shoulder season. The basis for this conclusion is presented in section III.G of this notice and is discussed
in detail in the RIA. Nevertheless, EPA has decided to allow States to petition the Administrator to extend the season
during which ethanol blended into gasoline would not receive credit toward today's rule. The provisions governing
the petition process are described in detail in sections III.B and III.G of this notice.
c. 

Global Warming Benefits. 

In addition to the potential to reduce summer VOC emissions, the proposal for this rule stated that the renewable oxygenate
requirement has the potential to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (and possibly other greenhouse gases) resulting
from the production and use of reformulated gasolines. However, the study by the Department of Energy cited previously
indicates that with current technology, the use of renewable oxygenates leads to similar carbon dioxide-equivalent
emissions (global warming potential of all emissions expressed as an equivalent mass of CO

2

 emissions) as those resulting from the use of nonrenewable MTBE. Testimony from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
on behalf of the National Corn Growers Association given at the January 14, 1994 public hearing on this rule also indicated
that the use of renewable oxygenates (ethanol in particular) would have no impact on, and in some cases could lead to
a reduction in, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of gasoline. Overall, current technologies
for ethanol production and use appear to have at best minimal benefits relative to nonrenewable MTBE production and
use.
But as noted by EPA in the proposal and as supported by comments received from the Department of Agriculture (see sections
II and VI of this notice) and others, the use of new feedstocks (particularly agricultural and municipal waste products)
and new, more efficient production technologies is likely to result in reduced emissions of CO

2

 related to fuel ethanol use. In addition, improved farming techniques can reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases,
particularly N

2

O. EPA expects that expanding the market for renewable oxygenates such as ethanol will accelerate the introduction
of more efficient feedstock and oxygenate production technologies. Improved efficiencies in these processes would
result in reduced emissions of CO

2

 and other greenhouse gases. Hence, EPA believes that while the renewable oxygenate program may not provide global
warming benefits currently, it will help stimulate the implementation of more efficient agricultural and oxygenate
production practices, leading to reduced emissions of greenhouse gases than would occur with nonrenewable oxygenates.

IV. Enforcement 


A. Overview of Enforcement Scheme 


1. General Requirements 


The enforcement scheme for the renewable oxygenate requirements is similar to that used for the other reformulated
gasoline requirements. The renewable oxygenate average standard applies to importers, and to refiners separately
for each refinery,

19

 and has a calendar year averaging period.

20

 No per-gallon standard is included. Renewable oxygen credits may be created by any refiner who uses more renewable
oxygenate than is required, and renewable oxygen credits could be used by any refiner to achieve compliance with this
standard. The conditions and requirements for credit creation, transfer and use that would apply to renewable oxygen
credits are the same as the conditions and requirements that apply under reformulated gasoline for benzene and oxygen
credits. 





The renewable oxygenate standard will be subject to a phase-in schedule. Under  80.83(b)(1), reformulated
gasoline and reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB), on average, must have an oxygen content
from renewable oxygenate that is equal to or greater than 0.30 weight percent from December 1, 1994 through December
31, 1995. The 0.60 weight percent standard shall apply beginning on January 1, 1996. 
The renewable oxygenate regulation adds two types of RBOB that were not included previously in the reformulated gasoline
regulation. These two generic RBOB types are ``any renewable oxygenate,'' and ``renewable ether only'' RBOB. A third
type of RBOB, ``non VOC controlled renewable ether only'' RBOB has also been added and is appropriately used in those
areas which have been granted extended non-commingling seasons (see ``D. Shoulder Season,'' below). The proposed
renewable oxygenate rule allowed refiners to take credit for downstream blending of renewable oxygenate only if
a contractual relationship between blender and refiner exists and if the refiner conducted a quality oversight and
sampling program. EPA received several comments from parties who felt that the renewable oxygenate regulation could
contain more flexibility. EPA agrees with these comments and adopted the approach described in the following paragraphs.

Refiners are responsible for meeting the renewable oxygen standard for reformulated gasoline and RBOB and have two
options for including renewable oxygenate in the compliance calculations required by  80.83(d). Under the
first option, a refiner may claim credit for downstream renewable oxygenate blending only if there is a contractual
relationship between the refiner and blender and the refiner carries out a suitable oversight program over the blender.
The requirements for a downstream oxygenate blending oversight program are the same as those contained in   80.69
(a) (5) through (7) of the reformulated gasoline regulations. Among other requirements, the refiner must have a contractual
relationship with the oxygenate blender and must comply with sampling and testing requirements. 
Under the second option, a refiner may assume that 2.0 weight percent oxygen from ethanol is blended with ``any renewable
oxygenate'' RBOB. For ``renewable ether only'' RBOB, the refiner may assume that ETBE resulting in 2.0 oxygen by weight
is to be blended. EPA has chosen the 2.0 weight percent assumption because it is consistent with the final reformulated
gasoline RBOB provisions at  80.69(D). Additionally, a refiner may chose to produce ``any renewable oxygenate''
RBOB in lieu of ``any oxygenate'' RBOB for blending with ethanol, effectively reducing the number of RBOBs it produces
to three types.

<TEXT>
 

Under the final reformulated gasoline regulation, downstream blenders are prohibited from violating the assumptions/instructions
for RBOB used by refiners. Blenders, although not responsible for compliance with the renewable oxygenate mandate,
are still responsible for adding appropriate oxygenate of the type specified in the RBOB transfer documentation
under the final renewable oxygenate regulations. Under  80.83(c)(2)(i)-(ii), no person may combine
any oxygenate with ``any renewable oxygenate'' RBOB, ``non-VOC controlled renewable ether only'' RBOB, ``renewable
ether only'' RBOB unless the oxygenate meets the ``renewable oxygenate'' definition. The ``renewable oxygenate''
definition is discussed in greater detail in section III of this preamble. 
Sections 80.83 (d) and (e) specify compliance calculations and conditions for the creation and transfer of credits.
These criteria for creation of credits are the same as those specified in   80.67(h)(1)(i) through (iv)
and   80.67(h) (2) and (3) of the reformulated gasoline regulations. 
The renewable oxygenate rule includes recordkeeping requirements, specified in  80.83(f). Refiners are
required to maintain records demonstrating the renewable nature, volume, type, and purity of the oxygenate used
and product transfer documentation for all renewable oxygenate, reformulated gasoline, or RBOB for which the refiner
is the transferor or transferee. These same recordkeeping requirements also apply to oxygenate blenders who blend
oxygenate with RBOB designated as ``any renewable oxygenate,'' ``non-VOC controlled renewable ether only'' or
``renewable ether only.'' The records required by  80.83(f) must be retained for a period of five years and must
be delivered to the Administrator or the Administrator's designated representative upon request. 
In today's final rule, EPA is requiring that refiners maintain records showing the renewable nature of all oxygenates.
Under the proposed rule, records demonstrating the renewable nature of renewable ethanol were not required. However,
today's final rule seeks to ensure that all oxygenates claimed as renewable do, in fact, come from renewable sources.

Section 80.83(g) deals with reporting requirements. All refiners are required to submit reports related to compliance
with the renewable oxygenate standard for reformulated gasoline, compliance calculations for the renewable oxygenate
standard, and the transfer of renewable oxygen credits. These renewable oxygenate reports go beyond the reporting
requirements included in the reformulated gasoline final rule issued in December 1993. 
Refiners are required to report, on a per-batch basis, the total weight percent oxygen and weight percent oxygen attributable
to renewable oxygenates contained in the gasoline they produce. For all types of renewable RBOB, the refiner must
report the weight percent oxygen subsequent to oxygenate blending, subject to the conditions set forth in  80.83(c).
These requirements supplement the quarterly reports requirements found in existing  80.75(a) of the reformulated
gasoline regulations. 
Refiners are also required to submit, on an annual basis, a report for all reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced
during the previous calendar year averaging period. These requirements supplement the fourth quarterly report
requirements found in existing  80.75(a). The fourth quarterly report must include (among other specified
items) information regarding the total volume of reformulated gasoline and RBOB, the compliance total for renewable
oxygen, the actual total for renewable oxygen, information about credits generated and transferred, and information
about the party to whom (or from whom) credits were transferred. 
EPA intends that the attest engagement requirements for reformulated gasoline will apply to the renewable oxygenate
standard. Sections 80.128 and 80.129 contain agreed upon procedures for refiners and importers and downstream blenders,
respectively. These new provisions supplement the reformulated gasoline attest engagement requirements found
in subpart F of that regulation. Furthermore, other provisions contained in the reformulated gasoline regulations,
and not specifically discussed in this preamble, would apply to the renewable oxygenate standard in the same manner
as they apply to other reformulated gasoline standards. These include, among other things, the definitions of parties;
the designation requirements; testing requirements, including sampling and testing; and controls, prohibitions,
liabilities, and defenses. 
There are no gasoline survey requirements associated with the renewable oxygenate requirement, because there is
no covered area-specific standard associated with this program. 


2. Requirements Specific to the State of California 


Today's renewable oxygenate rule also applies to all gasoline that is sold in the Federal reformulated gasoline areas
of Los Angeles and San Diego. Refiners of California gasoline, as defined in  80.81 of the reformulated gasoline
regulation, are responsible for all renewable oxygenate provisions (including recordkeeping and reporting),
except where a specific enforcement exemption has been granted under  80.81 of the reformulated gasoline regulation.
Today's regulation specifically provides that California gasoline must meet, to the extent the requirements relate
to the renewable oxygenate rule, the designation of gasoline requirements for the two types of renewable RBOB; the
annual attest engagement requirements; and downstream blending requirements of  80.69. Section 80.84(h)
of the renewable oxygenate regulation includes specific provisions for California gasoline sold within reformulated
gasoline covered areas as specified in  80.70. Under  80.83(h)(2), California gasoline is presumed
to be used in the Los Angeles or San Diego covered area if the gasoline is produced by a refinery located within Los Angeles
or San Diego. Gasoline is also presumed to be used in the Los Angeles or San Diego covered area if the gasoline is transported
to a facility within one of these areas or to a facility from which gasoline is transported within one of these areas.
Refiners may refute these presumptions through the production of appropriate documentation showing that the gasoline,
in fact, is transported for use outside of the Los Angeles or San Diego reformulated gasoline areas. These areas are
specified in  80.70. 
Under  80.83(h)(3), California gasoline is considered to be designated as VOC-controlled if the Reid Vapor
Pressure (RVP) of the gasoline, or RBOB subsequent to oxygenate blending, is or is intended to meet a standard of 7.8
pounds per square inch (psi) or less in the case of gasoline intended for use before March 1, 1996, or 7.0 psi or less in
the case of gasoline intended for use on or after March 1, 1996.

B. Blendstock Issues 



EPA's proposed oxygenate rule would have only allowed refiners to include in renewable oxygenate compliance calculations
the renewable oxygenate that is added by downstream oxygenate blenders where the refiner carried out an appropriate
quality assurance program over downstream oxygenate blenders. A quality assurance program is intended to ensure
that when refiners claim credit for downstream blending of renewable oxygenate that the oxygenate added is renewable,
that the renewable oxygenate is added to the RBOB produced by the refiner, and that the volume of renewable oxygenate
claimed is correct. 
EPA received several comments from refiners regarding renewable oxygenate blendstocks in response to this proposal.
Some commenters felt that the proposed renewable oxygenate requirement would be difficult, if not impossible, to
implement as it would force refiners and importers to implement costly oversight programs over independent blenders.

A commenter also stated that the proposed renewable oxygenate rule's reliance on RBOB availability is ``at odds with''
the reformulated gasoline program requirements for RBOB production and handling. Under the final reformulated
gasoline rule, the commenter notes, RBOBs having different oxygenate requirements are segregated to the point of
oxygenate blending. For example, the commenter points out, ``any oxygenate'' RBOB must be segregated from ``ether-only''
RBOB. The segregation requirements, combined with the renewable oxygenate mandate, will (according to the commenter)
exacerbate the problems associated with supplying the needed amount of RBOB. 
EPA agrees for the most part with these comments and has provided for greater downstream oxygenate blending of renewables
similar to the final reformulated gasoline rule. As explained in greater detail in the general overview section (``A,''
above), the final renewable oxygenate regulations allow for two compliance options. The first option permits the
refiner to claim the actual amount of renewable oxygenate added by the downstream blender and requires that both a
contractual relationship and a testing and oversight program exist. The second option allows the refiner to designate
RBOB as one of two generic renewable types

22

 and to claim credit for downstream blending of renewable oxygenate based on specified assumptions. 




Under  80.83(f), oxygenate blenders are required to maintain and, upon request, deliver to the EPA Administrator,
or the Adminstrator's designated representative, records demonstrating the renewable nature and source of the
oxygenate used; characteristics in terms of volume, type, and purity; and product transfer documentation for renewable
oxygenate, reformulated gasoline, or RBOB for which the blender acts as transferor or transferee. Although these
blender recordkeeping requirements vary from the renewable oxygenate proposal, they are consistent with recordkeeping
requirements associated with other reformulated gasoline requirements and will not impose a significant additional
recordkeeping burden. As discussed in greater detail in ``A. Overview of the Enforcement Scheme,'' above, EPA has
created new categories of renewable RBOB to allow greater refiner flexibility in the renewable oxygenate requirement.



C. The Renewable Oxygenate Requirement for California Areas 


The renewable oxygenate requirements apply to Federal reformulated gasoline sold in the two covered areas in the
State of California, Los Angeles and San Diego. However, refiners who produce reformulated gasoline for use in California
are exempt from most reformulated gasoline enforcement mechanisms beginning in 1995. 

See

  80.81. This California exemption is based on the fact that beginning in March 1996, all gasoline used in California
will be subject to the California Phase II reformulated gasoline standards (``California gasoline''), which EPA
has concluded are at least as stringent as the federal Phase I reformulated gasoline emissions standards. As a result,
refiners who produce California gasoline are exempt from most federal reformulated gasoline enforcement requirements,
including designating gasoline as either reformulated or conventional gasoline, recordkeeping

23

 and reporting. Refiners of California gasoline are not exempt, however, from meeting the federal reformulated gasoline
standards, including the renewable oxygenate standard. 




In the proposed rule, EPA suggested a simple method to ensure that an appropriate volume of California gasoline meets
the renewable oxygenate requirement. Specifically, EPA proposed that each refiner who produces California gasoline
be required to meet the renewable oxygen standard for 54% of its volume California gasoline. The 54% figure was derived
from the historical volume of gasoline used in the Los Angeles and San Diego markets as a portion of the entire state's
market. 
EPA received several comments with respect to the ``54% proposal.'' Some commenters, including industry and trade
associations, felt that EPA has no legal authority under  211(k) of the Clean Air Act to require all California
refiners to meet the renewable oxygenate standard for 54% of their entire volume of California gasoline. These commenters
argued that imposing the renewable oxygenate requirement in this manner would amount to requiring renewable oxygenate
in Federal non-reformulated as well as reformulated gasoline. Two other commenters expressed support for EPA's
54% proposal, however, as a simple solution to a difficult program issue.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940802-0-00048 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940802-0-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

EPA also received comments indicating that the Northern and Southern California markets are truly distinct and that
the burden on refiners to account for gasoline they market in the Los Angeles and San Diego area would not be great. One
commenter stated that EPA may be able to make a rebuttable presumption that all gasoline produced in the Los Angeles
and San Diego areas or imported into those areas is reformulated gasoline for the purpose of the renewable oxygenate
mandate. However, this commenter also stated that refiners should be able to rebut the presumption with respect to
gasoline exported out of the Los Angeles and San Diego area. 
After consideration of the comments received, and as discussed above, EPA has decided to impose the renewable oxygenate
requirement only for gasoline used in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas. EPA believes that it is possible to have an
effective renewable oxygenate program for the two Federal reformulated gasoline program areas, and recognizes
that its authority under section 211(k)(1) is limited to reformulated gasoline areas. 
EPA received comments from a California state agency which recommended a change in the proposed implementation date
of January 1, 1995 to coincide with the March 1, 1996 refinery production deadline for California reformulated gasoline.
Combined with this was a request to phase in the proposal over a 22 month period as follows: 10% on March 1, 1996, 20 percent
on January 1, 1997, and 30% on January 1, 1998. EPA does not believe that a three year phase-in or delay is necessary and
has received no compelling evidence that California refiners would be particularly disadvantaged with respect
to lead time. EPA has included a phase-in schedule in today's rule for all covered areas. 
Various comments related to California's air quality outside of the Federal VOC-controlled gasoline season are
discussed elsewhere in this preamble. One commenter suggested that, since California has been allowed to develop
its own reformulated gasoline regulations ``it might make sense'' to let California decide which renewable oxygenates
qualify for the renewable oxygenate requirement and when they qualify. The commenter felt that California officials
might conclude, after modeling air quality effects, to allow ethanol even during the summer months. 
EPA responds that California is subject to the reformulated gasoline requirements of  211(k) of the Clean Air
Act, although an exemption from certain recordkeeping and enforcement requirements has been granted for purposes
of the California program. To ensure that the objectives of the renewable oxygenate program are met, EPA believes
that it is important that the Federal reformulated gasoline areas located within the State of California to be subject
to this program. EPA has a strong interest in consistent application of the renewable oxygenate requirements across
all reformulated gasoline areas and does not believe that it is appropriate for state officials to decide which oxygenates
satisfy the Federal requirement. 
EPA received other comments specifically related to application of the renewable oxygenate rule to California.
A few commenters felt that California should be exempt from the renewable oxygenate requirement as an outgrowth of
California's exemption from most reformulated gasoline enforcement mechanisms. EPA does not agree. Although refiners
of California gasoline have been exempted from many enforcement requirements, they are not exempt from the requirement
that their gasoline meet Federal reformulated gasoline standards. Likewise, EPA believes that Federal reformulated
gasoline in California should be subject to the renewable oxygenate standard, with appropriate exemption from certain
enforcement procedures. 
Comments received from a California state agency indicated that oversight should rest with the California Air Resources
Board (CARB). EPA responds that there is currently no state mandate to correspond to the renewable oxygenate mandate
contained in these regulations, thus, this appears to be a moot issue. 


D. Shoulder Season 


EPA received some comments from parties concerned that the renewable oxygenate requirement might lead to exceedances
of the ozone standard during the ``shoulder season'' (i.e. the time period immediately before and after the Federal
VOC control season) due to increased use of ethanol. These comments, and EPA's response, i.e., a petition process
which would allow the Governor of any state affected by the reformulated gasoline program to request an extension
of the non-commingling season beyond the VOC control season, are addressed elsewhere in section III.G of this preamble.

To ensure that the state shoulder season petitions are implemented effectively,  80.83(i) creates a category
of RBOB, called ``non VOC controlled renewable ether only'' which may be blended with ETBE or another oxygenate that
does not exhibit commingling effects when blended with other gasolines. If a Governor's petition for an extended
non-commingling season is granted, terminals will be required to keep ``non VOC controlled renewable ether only''
RBOB on hand for blending with appropriate oxygenates during the extended non-commingling season. 


E. Other Issues 


Some commenters asserted that EPA should allow temporary ``good faith exemptions'' to refiners that make a showing
that complying with this proposal would ``result in extraordinary economic hardship.'' The reformulated gasoline
rule contains an exemption for ``inability to produce conforming gasoline in extraordinary circumstances.'' See
 80.73 of the reformulated gasoline regulations. This exemption does cover extreme and unusual circumstances
outside of the control of the refiner and would encompass such circumstances as ``Acts of God'' or natural disasters.
EPA recognizes that this exemption may apply to the renewable oxygenate mandate. EPA does not believe that an additional
exemption for purely economic reasons is appropriate, particularly given that the renewable oxygenate mandate
is a year 'round credit program. 


V. Federal Preemption 


This program is based on section 211(k) of the CAA. The provisions for the prohibition of state and local controls under
section 211(c)(4) therefore do not apply.

VI. Environmental, Energy, and Economic Impacts 


A. Environmental Impacts 


1. Overview 


Today's renewable oxygenate rule is projected to have a number of direct and indirect environmental impacts resulting
from changes in the type of oxygenates that likely would have been used to fulfill the requirements of the RFG program.
Determining the precise nature of these impacts is difficult because the renewables program provides considerable
flexibility in meeting the 30 percent renewables requirement. In the case of VOC, NOx and air toxics, however, the
impact of today's rule is constrained because the renewables program will take place within the context of the reformulated
gasoline program. Today's rule may also have effects on carbon monoxide, global warming, and non-air quality aspects
of the environment since these effects are not constrained by the RFG emission models or performance standards. 
Today's rule does not alter the VOC, NOx, or toxics emission performance standards for reformulated gasoline. Therefore,
the emission performance of reformulated gasoline as measured using the relevant RFG emission model (the Simple
Model in 1995-1997 or the Complex Model in 1998 and beyond) will remain essentially unchanged. Today's rule
will affect VOC, NOx, or toxics emissions only to the extent that the effects of fuel changes resulting from today's
rule are not included in the applicable RFG certification models. These effects (predominantly the commingling
and front-end distillation effects of adding oxygenates to gasoline) should be beneficial for VOC emissions to the
extent that ETBE displaces either ethanol or MTBE use during the summer months. Exact quantification of these benefits
is difficult because the changes in ETBE use and the quantification methodology are both uncertain. 
Health studies of ETBE are being initiated, since virtually no health data exist at present. These studies in conjunction
with studies of potential ETBE related exposures would contribute to our understanding of potential public health
risk. This work is designed to resolve existing uncertainties as to whether unique concerns may exist with ETBE as
compared to the ethanol, MTBE, and/or other compounds it could displace. 
Concerns with respect to potential VOC emission increases outside of the VOC control season were raised in the comments
on the proposal. However, VOC emissions are not directly controlled outside of the VOC-control season under the RFG
program (although some control due to early compliance with the requirements is expected based on past experience
with other programs). The issue of VOC emission increases during the ``shoulder season'' is addressed in detail in
section III.G. 
The remainder of this section is divided into four parts. First, the air quality effects of the renewable oxygenate
rule in 1998 and later years (when the Complex Model is in effect) are discussed. Second, the air quality effects of
today's rule during the Simple Model years (1995-1997) are discussed. Third, the global warming impact of today's
rule is discussed. Fourth, the non-air quality effects of today's rule is discussed. 


2. Air Quality Impacts Under the Complex Model 


As discussed in section III, the renewable oxygenate program is expected to stimulate the use of ETBE during the summer
months and increase the use of ethanol during the winter months. According to the Complex Model, these oxygenates
provide smaller toxics benefits than do MTBE or TAME when used at identical oxygen content levels. Any changes in oxygenate
type resulting from today's rule will have no effect on overall air toxics emission performance, however, since the
Complex Model will account for the effects of changes in oxygenate type and the emission performance standards are
unchanged by today's rule. As discussed in section VI.C of this notice, however, the increase in ethanol and ETBE use
may increase the cost of complying with the RFG toxics emission performance standards.

<TEXT>
 

In addition to impacts on toxics compliance, any shifts in oxygenate use resulting from today's program will also
cause changes in the concentrations of other fuel parameters in the final gasoline blend, since different oxygenates
require different volumes to meet the same oxygen content requirement. Changes in these other fuel parameters (referred
to as the dilution effect) can affect VOC, NO

, and air toxics performance. However, the RFG performance standards remain unchanged by today's rule, and the Complex
Model will account for the VOC, NO

X

, and toxics emission effects of any dilution-related changes in the level of aromatics, olefins, sulfur, E200, E300,
or benzene. As a result, EPA has concluded that today's rule will not alter the VOC, NO

X

, and toxics emission benefits of the RFG program. As discussed in section VI.C of this notice, however, refiners may
experience positive or negative economic impacts in maintaining the required emission performance of their reformulated
gasoline as a result of today's rule. 
Two other effects of today's rule are not reflected in the Complex Model and may affect summer nonexhaust VOC and toxics
emissions, however. First, commingling-related emissions during the VOC control season would be reduced to the
extent that ETBE replaces ethanol in summer RFG. 
Second, increased summer ETBE use (and reduced summer ethanol use) would improve the front-end distillation characteristics
of summer RFG, thereby potentially reducing summer nonexhaust VOC and toxics emissions to some degree. These effects,
however, are contingent upon changes in the amounts of ETBE and ethanol that are blended into RFG during the summer
months as a result of this rulemaking. Since it is uncertain how much ETBE and ethanol would have been used during the
summer months absent today's rulemaking, and is still uncertain how much of each oxygenate will be used as a result
of today's rulemaking, it is not possible to quantify these benefits. Furthermore, even if the volumes of oxygenate
use were known, the effect of front-end distillation changes (other than RVP) on nonexhaust VOC emissions is not yet
quantifiable with a sufficient degree of certainty. Limited data and scientific theory suggest it is a real effect,
as discussed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the RFG final rule, but reliable quantification is not yet possible.

Carbon monoxide emissions are not regulated directly by either the RFG program or today's rule. However, carbon monoxide
emissions can be affected by gasoline properties. Higher oxygen levels are known to result in large reductions in
carbon monoxide emissions, and lower RVP levels are known to result in small reductions in carbon monoxide at temperatures
above 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Both of these effects are currently incorporated in EPA's MOBILE5a in-use emission
model. 
Since the oxygen content requirements of the RFG program are not altered by today's rule and since summer RVP levels
are controlled by the RFG performance standards, no change in CO emission levels is anticipated during the summer
months. Furthermore, based on EPA's MOBILE5.a emission factor model, there would be no effect on CO emissions of an
increase in RVP levels during the winter months (when RVP is not constrained by the RFG program) due to increased ethanol
use on the colder days when most carbon monoxide exceedances occur, since the model does not show an effect of RVP on
CO emissions below 45 degrees Fahrenheit. The only effect of today's rule on CO emissions would be a potential small
increase due to increased RVP levels resulting from increased ethanol use on those winter days with temperatures
above 45 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Other fuel parameters may also affect carbon monoxide emissions. However, a model for CO incorporating other fuel
parameters is not yet available. Any such effects would be limited by the constraints placed on these fuel parameters
by the VOC, NO

X

, and air toxics RFG emission performance standards.

3. Air Quality Impacts Under the Simple Model 


The air quality effects of today's rule under the Simple Model are, for the most part, expected to be similar to those
under the Complex Model, since the effects on fuel composition are expected to be similar with two main exceptions.
First, significant ETBE use is not expected to be possible before the summer of 1996. Second, EPA anticipates that
in order to meet the requirements of today's program and the existing RFG program, refiners may find it necessary for
the first few years to blend additional oxygenates into their RFG beyond the level necessary to meet the 2.0 weight
percent oxygen requirement. In particular, refiners may find it necessary to blend up to 10 percent ethanol by volume
during the winter months in RFG markets with the supply, distribution, and blending capacity to do so. Until the distribution
and blending infrastructure for ethanol use is expanded, it is unlikely that this increase in ethanol use will be offset
through oxygenate trading given the limitations of the RFG program. Since ETBE use will be limited, and since the volume
of ethanol used will be similar to the volume of MTBE displaced during the winter (10 vs. 11 volume percent), dilution
effects may be small during the first few years of the program. 
While the effects of dilution on emission performance may not be reflected fully in Simple Model compliance calculations
since it does not account for all the fuel effects included in the Complex Model, EPA would expect any resulting air
quality effects to be minimal for several reasons. First, as discussed above, EPA expects the dilution effects to
be minimal during the first years of the program. Second, RFG producers are required under the Simple Model to not exceed
their 1990 baseline levels of sulfur, T90, and olefins. These caps limit the risk of any detrimental air quality effects
related to differences in dilution. Furthermore, the economic incentives of gasoline production may result in refiners
producing at or near these caps, regardless of the type or volume of oxygenate used. Third, refiners are unlikely to
invest in processing equipment to produce gasoline during 1995-1997 which will make it more difficult for them
to comply with the 1998 requirements under the Complex Model. Fourth, any remaining risks are limited to the three-year
period during which the Simple Model is in effect. Fifth, some refiners may opt to use the Complex Model prior to 1998,
which would have the effect of controlling any detrimental environmental effects related to changes in dilution
or oxygenate type. 
As discussed above with regard to the impacts on air toxics emissions resulting from changes in oxygenate type, today's
rule does not alter the performance standards under the Simple Model. Nevertheless, EPA does recognize that the reduced
toxics emission benefits of ethanol and ETBE relative to MTBE under the Simple Model (as under the Complex Model) may
increase toxics compliance costs, as discussed in section III.C. In addition, depending on how refiners chose to
adjust their fuels to offset the loss in air toxics performance, the complex model may suggest some degradation in
in-use (as opposed to certification) air toxics emissions performance with the use of ethanol or ETBE instead of MTBE
which is not accounted for by the Simple Model. As explained in more detail in the RIA, this situation arises due to differences
between how the Simple Model and Complex model predict air toxics emission performance. If some refiners choose to
maintain air toxics emission performance by reducing aromatics instead of benzene, then the complex model suggests
less in-use emission performance is achieved in-use with ethanol or ETBE than with MTBE. However, EPA expects few
refiners to choose to maintain air toxics emission performance by reducing aromatics for two reasons. First, aromatics
control is, in general, believed to be the more costly of the two approaches. Second, refiners are unlikely to invest
in processing equipment to comply with the simple model for 1995-1997 which will not also provide compliance
under the complex model in 1998. Regardless of which approach refiners take, however, this issue does not exist for
that fuel certified under early use of the complex model, and disappears entirely in 1998 with mandatory use of the
complex model.

EPA also believes the commingling and distillation-related emission effects of today's rule to be minimal under
the first few years of the program. The renewable oxygenate program does not provide incentives to increase summer
ethanol, so commingling- and distillation-related nonexhaust VOC and toxics emissions from summer RFG should be
unaffected. 
As discussed previously, today's rule is not expected to significantly increase carbon monoxide emissions in the
long term. In the short term, however, today's rule may reduce carbon monoxide emissions as refiners blend additional
oxygenates during the first few years of the renewable oxygenate program (as discussed above). This increase in oxygenate
content would reduce carbon monoxide emissions, and such reductions would occur during the winter months when carbon
monoxide exceedances are most common. 


4. Global Warming Impacts 


According to the DOE report, today's rule is unlikely to result in global warming benefits in the near term. In the longer
term, however, today's rule is expected to stimulate investment in higher-efficiency renewable oxygenate production
processes which could offer significant global warming benefits. Additional discussion of the potential global
warming benefits of today's program is contained in section III.H of this notice. 


5. Non-Air Quality Impacts 


The Agency is concerned about other environmental impacts of the renewables requirement such as water pollution
and soil erosion. Comments were submitted to the Agency stipulating that, as a result of the renewables program, corn
may be grown in place of soybeans and hay plant rotations which could result in decreased soil quality including compaction,
salination, acidification, and loss of biological activity. New corn production to support increased ethanol demand
in response to today's rule could also increase soil erosion and affect water quality and water flow. Corn farming
was alleged to be the primary cause of agro-chemical contamination of groundwater. In addition, the increased barge
shipments of ethanol resulting from this program were alleged to increase the environmental risks and clean-up costs
associated with potential ethanol spills. 
As discussed in section III.F, EPA has concluded that the renewable oxygenate program is unlikely to have a significant
impact on total corn output in the near term. The expected 490 million gallons of new ethanol demand resulting from
today's rule would require an increase in corn production of only approximately 2 percent. Thus, the environmental
impacts associated with increased corn production are also expected to be small. In addition, future farming efficiency
improvements are expected to reduce the environmental impact of corn production. Furthermore, the commercialization
of ethanol production techniques which rely on agricultural wastes or cellulosic feedstocks would eliminate the
need to increase corn production to support this program. As mentioned previously, EPA expects the renewables requirement
to help stimulate development and commercialization of such technologies. 
EPA also believes that any adverse soil and water impacts from today's rule will be adequately addressed through means
other than the renewable oxygenate program. Concerns related to the water impacts of ethanol production will be controlled
under the provisions of the Clean Water Act. USDA has several programs in place to address soil erosion, and the Coastal
Zone Act of 1990, which requires a nutrient management plan for covered areas, has helped increase farm efficiency
and reduce nutrient and agrochemical runoff.

B. Energy Impacts 


The energy benefits of the renewable oxygenate program depend on the oxygenates used and the production processes
used to produce them, which can vary depending on the timeframe of interest. As described above, in the early years
of the program the renewable oxygenate requirement is expected to be met primarily with ethanol blended into winter
RFG. For at least the first two years, this ethanol would be produced in existing plants or new plants equipped with
current technology. Some diversion of ethanol currently being blended into conventional gasoline may also occur.
Small additional quantities of ETBE may be used in summer RFG and ethanol use in summer RFG may decrease, but these shifts
and their energy impacts will be very small relative to the effects of the increase in wintertime ethanol use. According
to a study prepared by the Department of Energy,

24

 if the 30 percent renewables requirement is met by blending ethanol produced from new ethanol plants and ethanol plant
expansions (as opposed to ethanol produced in existing facilities and displaced from its current markets) into winter
RFG, the overall fossil energy consumed in RFG production and use would be 0.7 percent lower than would be the case if
MTBE produced from natural gas were the only oxygenate used in RFG. This estimate by DOE was reduced to as low as 0.5 percent
when more conservative energy input assumptions were incorporated into their calculational methodology, and was
increased to as high as 0.9% when energy input assumptions from USDA were incorporated. The even greater reduction
in natural gas use would be partially offset by a 2.0 percent increase in crude oil use. It should be noted that even with
this increase in crude oil use, the total amount of crude oil used to produce RFG under today's rule would still be 8.6
percent lower than if conventional gasoline were produced instead. 




DOE projected that as ETBE capacity becomes available, its use in summer RFG would reduce fossil energy use by 1.7 percent
relative to MTBE used in summer RFG. The DOE study indicates that if ETBE is blended into VOC-controlled RFG to meet
the 30 percent requirement in the summer, and ethanol is still used to meet the requirement during the winter, the fossil
energy benefits of the program being promulgated today program would be approximately 0.6 percent (0.4 to 0.8 using
the range of input assumptions evaluated in their final report) lower than would be the case if MTBE produced from natural
gas were the only oxygenate used in RFG. 
The energy benefits of this program are expected to become more pronounced in later years. Improvements in the energy
efficiency of ethanol production will further reduce the fossil energy required to produce ethanol. Further gains
can be achieved by reducing energy consumption in corn farming through changes in farming practices, using more energy-efficient
equipment, increasing per-acre crop yields, and decreasing fertilizer use. Comments submitted by USDA and others,
as well as previous studies by DOE and EPA cited in the proposal, indicate that as new feedstocks for ethanol such as
cellulose are commercialized, and as renewable methanol production becomes viable, the fossil energy benefits
of this program would increase substantially relative to nonrenewable MTBE use. Using current estimates of the energy
inputs relative to the energy outputs for ethanol from cellulose (approximately 1:5), the fossil energy benefits
of the program being promulgated today program would increase to approximately 1.3 percent relative to the case if
MTBE produced from natural gas were the only oxygenate used in RFG. By providing a secure market for renewable oxygenates,
today's program will help provide the certainty needed to encourage private investments in modern, high-efficiency
renewable oxygenate production technology.

1. Oxygenate and Blending Costs of the Program 


The renewable oxygenate program is projected to add $4 million to $60 million in cost to the RFG program annually prior
to the year 2000 and $16 million to $60 million in cost to the RFG program annually in 2000 and beyond. These costs involve
three major components: the cost of renewable oxygenates relative to nonrenewable oxygenates, transportation
and blending costs, and toxics compliance costs. The cost estimates include the impact of this rule on fuel economy.
These costs also assume that ethanol is blended at a concentration of 6.04 volume percent (2.1 weight percent oxygen);
to the extent that ethanol is blended at higher concentrations, costs (particularly the toxics compliance costs)
would be reduced. In addition, the renewable oxygenate program is projected to add one-time costs of $17.6 million
for additional tankage, storage, and blending capacity. The derivation of the various components of the cost for
the renewable oxygenate program are described below and in more detail in section IV of the Regulatory Impact Analysis
for this rule. 
Before estimating the costs for the renewable oxygenate program, however, it is necessary to estimate how much additional
ethanol will be used in RFG compared to the amount of ethanol that would have been used in the absence of today's rule.
Only those costs resulting from the new ethanol demand required by the renewable oxygenate program alone are included
in the cost estimates determined here. Deriving estimates for that amount of ethanol that would have been used under
the RFG program in the absence of the renewables requirement is extremely difficult. However, the amount of new ethanol
capacity planned or under construction prior to the December proposal, combined with the ethanol currently blended
in the winter months in RFG areas would have enabled ethanol to be used in up to 15 percent of the RFG oxygenate market
without displacing ethanol from existing markets. Based on this information, EPA estimates that today's rule is
likely to increase ethanol's share of the total oxygenate market by approximately 15 percentage points, which amounts
to 335 million gallons of ethanol. 
With regard to the first component of the cost analysis, renewable oxygenate costs, ethanol used in winter RFG is projected
to be the low-cost oxygenate on a per unit oxygen basis (based on EPA's cost analysis for the RFG final rule and excluding
any additional transportation and blending costs as discussed below). Hence EPA expects that if winter ethanol is
used to meet the the renewable oxygenate requirement, today's rule will not impose additional direct costs for oxygenates
on the RFG program. In fact, assuming 335 million gallons of new ethanol demand, today's rule will reduce direct oxygenate
costs by $22-72 million annually.

<TEXT>
 

To the extent that ETBE is used to meet part of the renewable oxygenate requirement, however, today's rule could increase
the cost of the program. EPA projects that ETBE-blended RFG would cost 0 to 0.8 cents per gallon more than ethanol-blended
or MTBE-blended RFG. This estimate, which is highly sensitive to MTBE and ethanol costs, includes ETBE's value in
reducing RVP and increasing octane but does not fully reflect its value in diluting the levels of aromatics and sulfur
in gasoline. It also assumes that ETBE producers can take advantage of the reduced gasoline excise tax for fuels containing
ethanol. Without this tax reduction, the cost of ETBE-blended RFG would be 3.1 to 3.9 cents per gallon higher than MTBE-blended
RFG. 
With regard to the second component of the cost analysis, ethanol is produced primarily in the Midwest, but RFG will
be required in California, the Northeast, and Texas in addition to several Midwestern markets. As a result, additional
transportation costs may be incurred. EPA estimates the cost of transporting ethanol to range from 3 to 11 cents per
gallon of ethanol, depending on the markets to which it is being shipped. As discussed in detail in the RIA, EPA estimates
the average cost of transporting a gallon of ethanol to RFG markets to be 6-8 cents per gallon. Based on the estimate
that the renewable oxygenate program will increase ethanol demand by 335 million gallons per year, the total transportation-related
cost due to today's rule would range from $20 million to $27 million annually. 
In many parts of the nation, facilities to store and blend ethanol have already been constructed. However, adequate
facilities are not currently in place in many RFG markets. Based on information obtained from a draft DOE report,

25

 EPA estimates the cost of building sufficient storage and blending capacity to meet the renewable oxygenate requirement
to be approximately $17.6 million. This represents a one-time cost for additional tankage, storage, and blending
capacity, however, and not a continuous cost. There may be some additional cost for blending beyond the costs of the
facilities and equipment, however, that is believed to be small. 




With regard to the third component of the cost analysis, under both the Simple and Complex reformulated gasoline emission
models, ethanol and ETBE provide smaller toxics emission reduction benefits than do MTBE and TAME, the primary nonrenewable
oxygenates expected to participate in the RFG program. To offset the increase in toxics emissions, refiners will
have to alter other gasoline properties such as aromatics, benzene, or sulfur. Assuming that refiners lower benzene
levels to offset any worsening in toxics performance, EPA estimates that the additional cost could range as high as
0.89 cents per gallon of RFG blended with ethanol in 1995-1999 and from 0.32 to 0.88 cents per gallon of RFG blended
with ethanol in 2000 and beyond. The higher minimum costs in 2000 and beyond stem from the more stringent toxics standards
and the larger contribution of exhaust toxics to total toxics; see the RIA for further details. These increased costs
would be incurred only for the volume of RFG blended with ethanol in excess of the volume that would have been blended
with these two oxygenates in the absence of today's rule. Assuming that ethanol volume increases by 335 million gallons
(as discussed previously and in the RIA) and that ethanol is blended at 6.04 volume percent (or 2.1 weight percent oxygen),
the total volume of RFG involved would be approximately 5.55 billion gallons. This translates into an annual cost
for the program of up to $49 million in 1996-1999 and $18 million to $49 million in 2000 and beyond. 
According to EPA's fuel economy analysis (as discussed in the RIA for the RFG final rule), ethanol-blended RFGs provide
slightly poorer fuel economy than otherwise-identical RFGs which use MTBE or ETBE as the oxygenate. The fuel economy
penalty amounts to approximately 0.2 percent for the additional 5.55 billion gallons of RFG that would be blended
with ethanol as a result of the renewable oxygenate program. Based on current wholesale gasoline prices, this reduction
in fuel economy would add approximately $5.55 million in annual costs to the RFG program. 


2. Impact on Renewable Fuels Industry 


As discussed in section III of this notice, the renewables program will require blending approximately 490 million
additional gallons of ethanol (or its equivalent) in RFG over and above the amount of ethanol blended into gasoline
in RFG areas in 1993. This increase represents a growth of approximately 40 to 50 percent in renewable fuel demand from
current levels. EPA is phasing in the renewable oxygenate requirement in order to avoid disrupting existing ethanol
markets and the RFG program. If the renewable oxygenate program causes ethanol to shift out of its current markets
into RFG markets, the benefits to the renewable fuels industry would be reduced and the long-term growth prospects
for the industry would be jeopardized. Phasing the program in over two years permits a more orderly expansion of renewable
oxygenate production capacity and helps assure that the additional demand created by today's rule will occur without
causing undesirable logistical problems, which could result in supply problems and price spikes and might not help
stimulate the use of renewable fuels in the United States.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, the certainty provided by today's rule is expected to stimulate considerable private investment in
renewable fuel production technology and capacity. EPA expects this investment to accelerate the development and
implementation of advanced, high-efficiency production processes, which in turn are expected to provide global
warming benefits and larger fossil fuel energy savings than can be provided by existing ethanol production facilities.



3. Impact on Farm Economy 


According to comments submitted by USDA, the renewable oxygenate program is expected to increase farm incomes by
increasing demand for farm products and creating a market for agricultural waste products. Based on USDA estimates,
the renewable oxygenate program will increase corn prices by approximately 4.0-6.7 cents per bushel when fully
implemented. Based on average annual corn production of 8.7 billion bushels, such a price increase would increase
farm income by approximately $348-583 million.

26

 However, USDA projects a decrease in farm deficiency payments as a result of the increase in corn prices of $220-369
million, so the net increase in farm income would be $128-214 million per year.

27

 The reader is referred to the RIA for a more detailed discussion of this estimate. 





To the extent that this increase in farm incomes results from higher prices for corn and other crops, some of the farm
income benefits may be lost as feed costs for livestock producers increase. However, it is unlikely that price increases
will account for the entire increase in farm incomes. Utilization of agricultural waste products and increased crop
production are also expected to increase farm incomes without increasing the price per bushel for corn and other ethanol
feedstocks. Hence the impact of the renewable oxygenate program is expected to have a net beneficial effect on the
farm economy. 


4. Impact on Natural Gas, Methanol, and MTBE Sectors 


EPA recognizes that the renewable oxygenate program may affect the growth prospects for the natural gas, methanol,
and MTBE sectors. To the extent that today's rule leads to larger market shares for ethanol and other renewable oxygenates
than otherwise would occur, the market share for nonrenewable oxygenates would be smaller than otherwise would occur.

<TEXT>
 

However, EPA does not believe that today's rule will have a significant adverse impact on the natural gas, methanol,
and MTBE industries for several reasons. First, EPA always has expected ethanol and its derivatives to play a role
in the RFG program even in the absence of today's rule. Second, the advent of the Phase II RFG standards in 2000 will create
powerful incentives to reduce the RVP of summer reformulated gasoline to very low levels. As a result, EPA had expected
that ETBE and ETAE would be used beginning in 2000 even without the promulgation of today's rule. EPA considers it unlikely
that MTBE, methanol, and natural gas producers would install expensive capital equipment to satisfy demand only
for Phase I of the program; instead, EPA has expected these industries to build capacity to satisfy the long-term demand
for their product. Since such long-term demand would be limited by the growth in ETBE and ETAE demand for Phase II RFG,
it is not clear to EPA that today's rule will reduce the growth of the methanol, MTBE, and natural gas industries below
what it otherwise would have been. 
Third, even with today's rule, methanol and MTBE production is projected to grow quite rapidly. If MTBE captures 70
percent of the RFG oxygenate market, annual MTBE demand will grow from 2.3 billion gallons in 1993 to 4.1 billion gallons
in 1995 and to 4.8 billion gallons by 1997 (when the Phase II California RFG program takes full effect), an increase
of approximately 110 percent. As a result, annual methanol production is projected to grow by 600 million gallons
in 1995 and 1996 and an additional 200 million gallons by 1997. The demand for natural gas will grow even more dramatically
in absolute terms, since natural gas is an economically attractive source of the isobutylene used to produce ETBE
and is also used as an energy source in ethanol production, according to USDA. 


5. Impact on Highway Trust Fund and General Fund 


Renewable fuels blended directly into gasoline qualify either for income tax credit or reduced excise tax rates.
The reduced excise tax rate is the form of the tax subsidy used most frequently and effectively reduces the flow of revenue
into the Federal Highway Trust Fund. The income tax credits reduce the General Fund. At present, renewable ethanol
and methanol derived from sources other than oil, natural gas, coal, and peat qualify for the reduced excise tax rates
if they are blended into finished gasoline. Renewable ethers may also qualify for the reduced excise tax rates, although
the mechanism by which the tax reduction is received makes it difficult and often uneconomical to obtain for potential
blenders. 
To the extent that today's rule increases ethanol use in non-VOC-controlled RFG, it will reduce highway trust fund
revenues. As discussed above, the amount of new ethanol capacity planned or under construction prior to the December
proposal, combined with the ethanol currently blended in the winter months in RFG areas, would have enabled ethanol
to be used in up to 15 percent of the RFG oxygenate market without displacing ethanol from existing markets. Based on
this information, EPA estimates that today's rule is likely to increase ethanol's share of the total oxygenate market
by approximately 15 percentage points, which amounts to 335 million gallons of ethanol. With a $0.54 per gallon tax
subsidy for ethanol, EPA has concluded that today's rule will result in a loss of highway trust fund revenues of approximately
$181 million annually once the program is fully implemented. In addition, up to 176 million gallons of the currently-planned
additions to ethanol capacity will be eligible for an additional tax credit of $0.10/gallon under the small ethanol
producer credit, which could reduce General Fund revenues by as much as $17.6 million. Finally, if ethanol is blended
at 10 volume percent to meet the requirements of the renewable oxygenate program (which is especially possible in
the early years of the program, as discussed elsewhere in this Preamble), then an additional $0.06 per gallon of ethanol
would be diverted from the highway trust fund to to the General Fund. Hence the total loss in annual tax revenues resulting
from the renewable oxygenate program would be as large as $199 million, while the loss in annual highway trust fund
revenues is expected to range from $181 million to $201 million. These values could change as the level of ETBE use changes;
depending on the extent to which the renewable oxygenate requirement is met via ETBE use, today's rule may have less
of an impact on highway trust fund revenues. Beginning in 2000, EPA expects the Phase II RFG requirements to stimulate
expanded use of ETBE in VOC-controlled gasoline to take advantage of its RVP-lowering properties. EPA believes this
would have happened to some extent regardless of the renewable oxygenate requirement. Hence, EPA anticipates that
beginning in 2000, the reduction in highway trust fund revenues resulting from the renewable oxygenate requirement
itself could decrease significantly below the estimates cited above. A more detailed discussion of the highway trust
fund impact of today's rule can be found in the RIA. 


6. Impact on Farm Support Payments 


EPA received comments from farm interests and USDA claiming that the renewable oxygenate program would reduce government
expenditures on farm income and farm price support payments. To the extent that this program increases crop prices,
it should reduce farm program payments. As discussed in section VI.C.3, USDA projects that farm deficiency payments
will decrease by $220-369 million per year.

VII. Public Participation 


In its NPRM for this rule, EPA requested comment on all aspects of the proposal. In addition, EPA specifically invited
public comment on the following issues: (1) EPA's statutory authority to promulgate this rule; (2) the extent to which
renewable oxygenates would be used in reformulated gasoline absent the proposal; (3) the economic, energy, and crude
oil import benefits to the nation resulting from the proposal; (4) any other approaches which could be used to achieve
the same objectives; (5) the likelihood that the renewable oxygenate requirement would be met with domestically
produced oxygenates absent a requirement to this effect, whether such a requirement would be desirable and legally
permissible, and any other suggested approaches to ensure the domestic employment benefits of this program; (6)
the climate change aspects of the proposal; (7) the definition of renewable oxygenates; (8) the need for performance-based
standards for renewable oxygenates based on fossil energy impact or greenhouse gas emissions; (9) health effects
data regarding renewable oxygenates whose use may be encouraged as a result of the program; (10) the appropriate level
for the renewable oxygenate requirement, the feasibility of the requirement, lead-time requirements, the need
for a phase-in period, and any other supply-related issues; (11) the need and justification for a year-round program
in lieu of a summer-only program; (12) the allowance for year-round averaging of renewable oxygenate content; (13)
the applicability of the program only to producers of reformulated gasoline rather than including downstream blenders;
(14) the enforcement-related provisions; (15) the impact of the program on the already-promulgated reformulated
gasoline program, and (16) a petition process to include additional renewable oxygenates. 
During the comment period and at the January 1994 public hearing, EPA received comments and testimony on various aspects
of the proposal from numerous parties such as environmental organizations, states, environmental regulatory associations,
corn growers, and farmers, as well as the petroleum, ethanol, and oxygenated fuels industries. The Agency has diligently
reviewed and considered all written and oral comments on the renewable oxygenate proposal. 

For those readers interested in reviewing the comments related to the renewable oxygenate proposal for reformulated
gasoline, all comments received by the Agency are located in the EPA Air Docket, Docket A-93-49 (See ``

ADDRESSES

''). All significant comments were considered in revising the provisions in the proposal and/or are responded to
in the Regulatory Impact Analysis and Response to Comments document contained in Docket A-93-49. 




VIII. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires federal agencies to examine the effects of regulations and
to identify significant adverse impacts of federal regulations on a substantial number of small entities. Because
the RFA does not provide concrete definitions of ``small entity,'' ``significant impact,'' or ``substantial number,''
EPA has established guidelines setting the standards to be used in evaluating impacts on small businesses

28

. For purposes of the renewable oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline, a small entity is any business which
is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field as defined by SBA regulations under section 3 of the
Small Business Act. 









Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The renewable oxygenate
program will secure a market for oxygenate producers while simultaneously allowing refiners flexibility for small
refiners to comply with the program's requirements. In addition, EPA decided against applying the renewable oxygenate
requirement to downstream oxygenate blenders (except as discussed below), many of which are small entities. As discussed
in the proposal, this would have required each blender to maintain at least two sources of oxygenate, one renewable
and one not. Such an approach would have proven either uneconomical or to involve significant transaction costs related
to averaging and trading. 
However, today's program will require additional reporting requirements of blenders (beyond the reformulated
gasoline requirements). The renewable oxygenate program requires that blenders maintain records on two additional
RBOB categories: any renewable oxygenate and renewable ethers. The additional reporting requirements, however,
are economically insignificant and will not unduly burden small entities such as blenders.

IX. Statutory Authority 


EPA believes that the final rule adopted today is a reasonable exercise of the discretionary authority granted the
Agency under sections 211(k) and 301 of the Act. EPA interprets the first sentence of section 211(k)(1) as broad authority
to adopt reasonable requirements for reformulated gasoline, unless otherwise prohibited by the Clean Air Act or
other statutory provision. EPA interprets the second sentence of section 211(k)(1) as authorizing EPA to adopt regulations
for the reformulated gasoline program that result in the greatest emission reductions achievable, and at the same
time tend to optimize the resulting impacts on cost, energy requirements, and other health and environmental impacts.
In effect, EPA has full authority to adopt emission reduction standards and other requirements that achieve this
result. For further discussion of the statutory authority for the renewable oxygenate program the reader is referred
to section III.A. 


X. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 


Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51,735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, the Administrator has determined that this rule is a ``significant
regulatory action'' based on the above criteria. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made
in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations have been documented in the public record: EPA Air Docket A-93-49.

A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the reformulated gasoline program has been prepared and placed in Public Docket
No. A-93-49 to accompany this EPA notice of final rulemaking. A draft version of the Regulatory Impact
Analysis was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12866.
Any written comments from OMB and EPA response to those comments have also been placed in the public docket for this
rulemaking. A final version of the analysis is available in the docket cited above. 


XI. Compliance With the Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements in this rule were submitted for approval to the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 

These requirements are not effective until OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect is published
in the 

Federal Register

. An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1591.05) and a copy may be obtained from
Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch; EPA, 401 M Street, SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling
(202) 260-2740. 

This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 0.64 hours per response and an estimated
annual recordkeeping burden averaging 3.44 hours per respondent. If the burden associated with quality assurance
testing is included these estimates increase to 22.44 and 5.44, respectively. These estimates include time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information. 
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC
20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503,
marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' EPA will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection
requirements prior to OMB issuing approval.

 80.83

Renewable oxygenate requirements. 


(a) 

Definition of renewable oxygenate. 

For purposes of subparts D and F of this part, renewable oxygenate is defined as provided in this paragraph (a). 
(1) In the case of oxygenate added to reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is not designated as VOC-controlled or that
is not subject to the additional requirements associated with an extended non-commingling season pursuant to  80.83(i),
renewable oxygenate shall be: 
(i) An oxygenate that is derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks; or 
(ii) An ether that is produced using an oxygenate that is derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks. 
(2) In the case of oxygenate added to reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is designated as VOC-controlled or that is
subject to the additional requirements associated with an extended non-commingling season pursuant to  80.83(i),
renewable oxygenate shall be an ether that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(3) of this section.

(3) An oxygenate other than those ethers specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be considered
a renewable oxygenate if the Administrator approves a petition to that effect. The Administrator may approve such
a petition if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the oxygenate does not cause volatility
increases in gasoline that are non-linear in nature (i.e., a non-linear vapor pressure blending curve). The Administrator
may approve a petition subject to any appropriate conditions or limitations. 
(4)(i) Oxygenate shall be renewable only if the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender who uses the oxygenate is
able to establish in the form of documentation that the oxygenate was produced from a non-fossil fuel feedstock. 
(ii)(A) Any person who produces renewable oxygenate, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or who stores,
transports, transfers, or sells such renewable oxygenate, and where such renewable oxygenate is intended to be used
in the production of gasoline, shall maintain documents that state the renewable source of the oxygenate, and shall
supply to any transferee of the oxygenate documents which state the oxygenate is from a renewable source. 
(B) Any person who imports oxygenate that is represented by the importer to be renewable oxygenate, as defined in paragraph
(a) of this section, shall maintain documents, obtained from the person who produced the oxygenate, that include
a certification signed by the owner or chief executive officer of the company that produced the oxygenate that states:

(

1

) The nature of the feedstock for the oxygenate; and 
(

2

) A description of the manner in which the oxygenate meets the renewable definition under paragraph (a) of this section.

(iii) No person may represent any oxygenate as renewable unless the oxygenate meets the renewable definition under
paragraph (a) of this section. 
(5) For purposes of this section, an oxygenate shall be considered to be derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks only
if the oxygenate is: 
(i) Derived from a source other than petroleum, coal, natural gas, or peat; or 
(ii) Derived from a product: 
(A) That was produced using petroleum, coal, natural gas, or peat through a substantial transformation of the fossil
fuel;

(B) When the product was initially produced, it was not commonly used to generate energy (e.g. automobile tires);
and 

(C) The product was sold or transferred for a use other than energy generation, and was later treated as a waste product.


(b) 

Renewable oxygenate standard.

 (1) The reformulated gasoline and reformulated gasoline produced using RBOB that is produced by any refiner at each
refinery, or is imported by any importer, shall contain a volume of renewable oxygenate such that the reformulated
gasoline and reformulated gasoline produced using RBOB, on average, has an oxygen content from such renewable oxygenate
that is equal to or greater than 0.30 wt% for the period of December 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995, and 0.60 wt% beginning
on January 1, 1996. 


(2) The averaging period for the renewable oxygenate standard specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall
be: 

(i) Each calendar year; except that 

(ii)Any reformulated gasoline and RBOB that is produced or imported prior to January 1, 1995 shall be averaged with
reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced or imported during 1995. 

(3) (i) The oxygenate used to meet the standard under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may also be used to meet any oxygen
standard under  80.41; except that 

(ii) The renewable oxygenate added by a downstream oxygenate blender shall not be used by any refiner or importer to
meet the oxygen standard under  80.41, except through the transfer of oxygen credits. 

(c) 

Downstream oxygenate blending using renewable oxygenate. 

(1) In the case of any refiner that produces RBOB, or any importer that imports RBOB, the oxygenate that is blended with
the RBOB may be included with the refiner's or importer's compliance calculations under paragraph (d) of this section
only if: 

(i) The oxygenate meets the applicable renewable oxygenate definition under paragraph (a) of this section; and 

(ii) The refiner or importer meets the downstream oxygenate blending oversight requirements specified in   80.69(a)(6)
and (7); or 

(iii) (A) In the case of RBOB designated for ``any renewable oxygenate'' the refiner or importer assumes that ethanol
will be blended with the RBOB; 

(B) In the case of RBOB designated for ``renewable ether only'' or ``non-VOC controlled renewable ether only ``, the
refiner or importer assumes that ETBE will be blended with the RBOB; and 

(C) In the case of ``any renewable oxygenate,'' ``non-VOC controlled renewable ether only'' and ``renewable ether
only RBOB,'' the refiner or importer assumes that the volume of oxygenate added will be such that the resulting reformulated
gasoline will have an oxygen content of 2.0 wt%. 

(2) (i) No person may combine any oxygenate with RBOB designated as ``any renewable oxygenate'' unless the oxygenate
meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. 

(ii) No person may combine any oxygenate with RBOB designated as ``renewable ether only'' or ``non-VOC controlled
renewable ether only'' unless the oxygenate meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. 

(d) 

Compliance calculation. 

(1) Any refiner for each of its refineries, and any importer shall, for each averaging period, determine compliance
with the renewable oxygenate standard by calculating:

n=the number of batches of gasoline or RBOB produced or imported during the averaging period




(iv) Compare the renewable oxygen actual total with the renewable oxygen compliance total. 

(2) (i) The actual total must be equal to or greater than the compliance totals to achieve compliance, subject to the
credit transfer provisions of paragraph (e) of this section. 

(ii) If the renewable oxygen actual total is less than the renewable oxygen compliance total, renewable oxygen credits
must be obtained from another refinery or importer in order to achieve compliance. 

(iii) The total number of renewable oxygen credits required to achieve compliance is calculated by subtracting the
renewable oxygen actual total from the renewable oxygen compliance total.

(iv) If the renewable oxygen actual total is greater than the renewable oxygen compliance total, renewable oxygen
credits are generated. 

(v) The total number of renewable oxygen credits which may be traded to a refiner for a refinery, or to another importer,
is calculated by subtracting the renewable oxygen compliance total from the renewable oxygen actual total. 

 (e) 

Credit transfers. 

Compliance with the renewable oxygenate standard specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be achieved through
the transfer of renewable oxygen credits, provided that the credits meet the criteria specified in   80.67(h)(1)
(i) through (iv) and   80.67(h) (2) and (3). 

(f) 

Record keeping. 

Any refiner or importer, or any oxygenate blender who blends oxygenate with any RBOB designated as 

``any renewable oxygenate,''

 ``non VOC controlled renewable ether only'' or ``renewable ether only'' shall for a period of five years maintain
the records specified in this paragraph (f) in a manner consistent with the requirements under  80.74, and deliver
such records to the Administrator upon request. The records shall contain the following information:

party is the transferor or transferee.

(2) The requirements of this paragraph (f) shall apply in addition to the recordkeeping requirements specified in
 80.74(e).

(g) 

Reporting requirements.

 (1) Any refiner for each refinery, or any importer, shall for each batch of reformulated gasoline and RBOB include
in the quarterly reports for reformulated gasoline required by  80.75(a) the total weight percent oxygen and
the weight percent oxygen attributable to renewable oxygenate contained in the gasoline, or contained in the RBOB
subsequent to oxygenate blending if allowed under paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) Any refiner for each refinery, or any importer, shall submit to the Administrator, with the fourth quarterly report
required by  80.75(a), a report for all reformulated gasoline and RBOB that was produced or imported during
the previous calendar year averaging period, that includes the following information:

 (1) Any refiner or importer of California gasoline, as defined in  80.81, shall meet the renewable oxygenate
standard specified in paragraph (a) of this section for all reformulated gasoline or RBOB used in any reformulated
gasoline covered area as specified in  80.70.

(2) Any California gasoline shall be presumed to be used in a reformulated gasoline covered area:

(i) (A) If the gasoline is produced at a refinery that is located within a reformulated gasoline covered area; or

(B) If the gasoline is transported to a facility that is located within a reformulated gasoline covered area, or to
a facility from which gasoline is transported by truck into a reformulated gasoline covered area; unless

(ii) The refiner or importer is able to establish with documentation that the gasoline was used outside any reformulated
gasoline covered area.

(3) Any California gasoline shall be considered to be designated as VOC-controlled (for purposes of paragraph (a)(1)
of this section) if the Reid vapor pressure of the gasoline, or RBOB subsequent to oxygenate blending, is intended

(ii) 7.0 psi or less in the case of gasoline intended for use on or after March 1, 1996.

(i) 

Special provisions for shoulder season.

 (1) The Governor of any state may petition for an extension of the non-commingling season for any or all reformulated
gasoline covered areas within the state pursuant to  80.70.

(i) Such petition must satisfy the following criteria:

(A) Evidence showing an increase in the market share and/or use of oxygenates which produce commingling-related
RVP increases in the area(s) that are covered by the petition;

(B) Evidence demonstrating a pattern of exceedances for the period for which the extension is sought, including ozone
monitoring data for the preceding three(3) years of the reformulated gasoline program;

(C) An analysis showing that the pattern of ozone exceedances is likely to continue even with implementation of other
ozone air quality control measures and/or programs currently planned by the State; and

(D) Evidence that the responsible State agency or authority has given the public an opportunity for a public hearing
and the submission of written comments with respect to the petition.

(ii) Effective data and publication of decision.

(A) If the Administrator determines that the petition meets the requirements of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section,
to the satisfaction of the Administrator, then EPA shall publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing its intention to establish the non-commingling season as requested by the Governor, and specifying a
tentative effective date.



(1)

 The Administrator shall provide the public with an opportunity for a hearing and the submission of written comments.



(2)

 The tentative effective date will correspond with the first day of the next complete non-commingling season beginning
not less than one year after receipt of the petition.

(B) If the Administrator receives adverse comments or information demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator
that the criteria of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section have not been met, that the tentative effective date is not
reasonable, or that other good reasons exist to deny the petition, then the Administrator may reject the Governor's
request for an extended non-commingling season, in whole or in part, or may delay the effective date by up to two (2)
additional years. Absent receipt of such adverse comments or information, EPA shall publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing its approval of the petition and specifying an effective date for the extended non-commingling season.

(2) In the case of any refiner that produces RBOB, or any importer that imports RBOB, the oxygenate that is blended with
the RBOB may be included with the refiner's or importer's compliance calculations under paragraph (d) of this section
only if:

(i) The oxygenate meets the applicable renewable oxygenate definition under paragraph (a) of this section; and

(ii) In the case of RBOB designated for ``non VOC controlled ether only'' the refiner or importer assumes that ETBE
or other oxygenate that does not exhibit volatility-related commingling effects when mixed with other gasolines
and approved by the EPA Administrator under subparagraph (a)(3) of this section will be blended with the RBOB and so
labels the transfer documentation.

6. Section 80.128 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (e)(2); removing ``and'' at the end of paragraph (e)(4);
removing the period at the end of paragraph (e)(5) and adding ``; and'' in its place; and adding paragraph (e)(6) to

Ethane, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoro-; Modification of a Significant New Use Rule 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is modifying a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for ethane, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoro- based on a request to modify the SNUR and EPA's previous response to
comments for a similar situation in a proposed SNUR. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of April 17, 1991 (56 FR 15784), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for ethane, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoro-
(P-88-1303, P-88-2177, and P-90-212). Based on a request to modify the SNUR and
EPA's previous response to comments for a similar situation in a proposed SNUR, EPA is modifying this SNUR. 


I. Background 


The Agency proposed the modification of the SNUR for ethane, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoro- in the 

Federal Register

 of September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48347). The background and reasons for the modification of the SNUR are set forth in the
preamble to the proposed modification. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed modification.
As a result EPA is modifying this SNUR. 


II. Objectives and Rationale for Modification of the Rule 


During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this modification, EPA concluded
that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make
a reasoned evaluation of the health or environmental effects of the substance, and EPA identified recordkeeping
requirements necessary to enforce the rule. The basis for such findings is discussed in the rulemaking record referenced
in Unit III. of this preamble. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter
and a SNUR was promulgated. In light of the petition to modify the SNUR and EPA's response to a similar situation, EPA
has determined that the recordkeeping requirement of  721.125(c) is unnecessary to enforce this rule. The
proposed modification of SNUR provisions for this substance designated herein is consistent with that determination.



III. Rulemaking Record 


The record for the rule which EPA is modifying was established at OPPTS-50589. This record includes information
considered by the Agency in developing this rule.



IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


EPA is modifying the requirements of this rule by eliminating one of the recordkeeping requirements. Any costs or
burdens associated with this rule will be reduced when the rule is modified. Therefore, EPA finds that no additional
assessments of costs or burdens are necessary under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).

Polymer of Substituted Aryl Olefin; Significant New Use Rule 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is issuing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for
the chemical substance described generically as a polymer of substituted aryl olefin which is the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P-85-612, and which is subject to a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA. This rule
would require persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process this substance for a significant new use to notify
EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing, importing, or processing activities for a use designated
by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended
use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it can occur. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing
of a polymer of substituted aryl olefin (P-85-612) for the significant new uses designated herein. The
required notice would provide EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated activities.



I. Authority



Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances.

Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters
of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information
submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3),
and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under
section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it has received a SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action,
section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the 

Federal Register

 its reasons for not taking action.

Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification
provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. 


II. Applicability of General Provisions



General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. On July 27, 1988 (53 FR
28354), and July 27, 1989 (54 FR 31298), EPA promulgated amendments to the general provisions which apply to this SNUR.
In the 

Federal Register

 of August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31252), EPA promulgated a ``User Fee Rule'' (40 CFR part 700) under the authority of TSCA section
26(b). Provisions requiring persons submitting significant new use notices to submit certain fees to EPA are discussed
in detail in that 

Federal Register

 document. Interested persons should refer to these documents for further information. 


III. Background



EPA published a direct final SNUR for polymer of substituted aryl olefin, which was the subject of PMN P-85-612
and a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA, in the 

Federal Register

 of July 20, 1992 (57 FR 31963). EPA received adverse comments following publication. Therefore, as required by  721.160,
the direct final SNUR for P-85-612 was withdrawn on August 31, 1993 (58 FR 45842). A proposed rule on the
substance was issued on August 31, 1993 (58 FR 45871), that responded to the adverse comments. 
The background and reasons for the SNUR are set forth in the preamble to the proposed rule. The Agency received no public
comment concerning the proposed SNUR. As a result EPA is issuing the final SNUR as proposed. 


IV. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 


EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of the 

Federal Register

 notice that first identifies the new use rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Because this SNUR was first
published on July 20, 1992, as a direct final rule, that date will serve as the date after which uses will be considered
to be new uses. If uses which had commenced between that date and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered
ongoing, rather than new, any person could defeat the SNUR by initiating a significant new use before the effective
date. This would make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial
manufacture, import, or processing of the substance for uses regulated through this SNUR after July 20, 1992, will
have to cease any such activity before the effective date of this rule. To resume their activities, such persons would
have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all
extensions, expires. EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing for a proposed significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions
to allow such persons to comply with this SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions of advance
compliance as codified at  721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements of the final
SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance between
proposal and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they must cease that activity
before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable
SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires.



V. Economic Analysis 


EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers,
importers, and processors of the chemical substance at the time of the direct final rule. The analysis is unchanged
for the substance in this rule. The Agency's complete economic analysis is available in the public record for this
rule (OPPTS-50603). 


VI. Rulemaking Record



EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (OPPTS-50603C). The record includes basic information considered
by the Agency in developing this rule. EPA will supplement the record with additional information as it is received.
EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation. 



A public version of the record, without any confidential business information (CBI), is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential
Information Center (NCIC), also known as, TSCA Public Docket Office, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,
except legal holidays. NCIC is located in Rm. NE-B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 



VII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA
has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this rule would not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected by this rule would
likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substance. Therefore, EPA believes
that the number of small businesses affected by this rule would not be substantial, even if all of the SNUR notice submitters
were small firms. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act



OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this rule under the provisions of the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0012.

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response,
with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Methane, bromodifluoro-; Modification of a Significant New Use Rule 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is modifying a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for methane, bromodifluoro- based on a modification to the TSCA section 5(e) consent order regulating
that substance. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of April 25, 1991 (56 FR 19228), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for methane, bromodifluoro- (P-89-1093).
Because of the modification to the consent order for this substance, EPA is modifying this SNUR. 


I. Background 


The Agency proposed the modification of the SNUR for this substance in the 

Federal Register

 of September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48348). The background and reasons for the modification of the SNUR are set forth in the
preamble to the proposed modification. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed modification.
As a result EPA is modifying this SNUR as proposed. 


II. Objectives and Rationale for Modification of the Rule 


During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this modification, EPA concluded
that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make
a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of the substance, and EPA identified the tests considered
necessary to evaluate the risks of the substance. The basis for such findings is referenced in Unit III. of this preamble.
Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated.
In light of data received for the substance and data received for an analogous substance, which indicate that a 90-day
study with functional observational battery, motor activity, and neuropathology is no longer necessary, the submitter
petitioned, and EPA determined that the test trigger requirement and use restriction was no longer appropriate and
hence, was unnecessary to protect human health. The section 5(e) order modification eliminated the testing requirement
and allowed additional uses. The modification of SNUR provisions for this substance designated herein is consistent
with the modification of the section 5(e) order. 


III. Rulemaking Record 


The record for the rule which EPA is modifying was established at OPPTS-50591. This record includes information
considered by the Agency in developing this rule and includes the modification to the consent order that forms the
basis for this proposal.



IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements



A. Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA
has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this rule would not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected by this rule would

 Final rule with comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule updates our display of approved control numbers for the collection of information that have been assigned
to HCFA by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB regulations require each agency to include the approval numbers
in the agency's rules.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (PRA '80), Public Law 90-620, Title 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, requires Federal
agencies to minimize burden and costs associated with information collection. The Director of OMB promulgated regulations
to implement the provisions of PRA '80 at 5 CFR Part 1320. The OMB regulations include a requirement that Federal agencies
obtain OMB approval of collection of information requirements that are contained in any regulations published by
the agencies in the 

Federal Register

. After approval of the requirement by OMB, Federal agencies are further required to publish the control number assigned
by OMB as part of the agency's regulations text. 

To comply with the OMB requirement and as a means of notifying the public that HCFA's information collection requirements
have been approved, we have established a general regulation under 42 CFR 400.310 to display the valid OMB control
numbers and the applicable regulation sections. We routinely update our regulation to add the most recent assignment
of OMB control numbers or to delete entries that are no longer in effect. 



II. Provisions of the Rule 



Our display of valid OMB numbers was last updated on December 2, 1992 (57 FR 56997). We are revising our table at  400.310
to add the following approved sections.

In addition, we are deleting from the table   405.1221 and 405.1229, which were approved under OMB control
number 0938-0365.






(

Note: 

On August 14, 1989 (54 FR 33367),  405.1221 was redesignated as  484.12, and  405.1229 was redesignated
as  484.52. The approved information collections for the redesignated sections are already included in the
table.) 






For the convenience to the reader the entire updated table is being presented in this final rule. 



III. Regulatory Impact Statement 



We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. 

In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 

As noted above, this regulation is technical in nature and merely updates the display of currently valid control numbers
assigned by the Office of Management and Budget to collections of information contained in HCFA regulations. Therefore,
we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial
number of small rural hospitals. Accordingly, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b)
of the Act. 



IV. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay in Effective Date 



We ordinarily publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

, and invite prior public comment on the proposed rule. The proposed rule includes a reference to the legal authority
under which the rule is proposed, and the terms of substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and
issues involved. In addition, section 1871 of the Social Security Act (the Act) generally requires a 60-day public
comment period. However, this procedure can be waived when an agency finds good cause that a notice-and-comment procedure
is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and incorporates a statement of the finding and
its reasons in the rule issued. 

We routinely publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 when an information collection requirement clearance request that is identified in a rule or notice is submitted
to OMB and the public is offered an opportunity to comment. This regulation is technical in nature and merely updates
the display of OMB-assigned control numbers of approved collection of information requirements contained in HCFA
regulations text. Therefore, it would be redundant and provide an unnecessary delay to solicit comments on this display
of the approved OMB control numbers. 

For the above reasons, we find good cause to waive both proposed notice and comment rulemaking procedure and a delay
in the effective date as impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. Under these circumstances
publication of the correct up-to-date rules without further delay best serves those governed by these regulations.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rules.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Communications Commission has revised certain rules governing the conduct of comparative renewal proceedings
in the cellular radio service. The revisions are needed to establish and explain several procedural aspects of comparative
renewal proceedings in the cellular radio service. The intent of these revisions is to promote efficiency and fairness
in the licensing of the cellular radio service.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the Commission's Memorandum Opinion and Order on Further Reconsideration, adopted
June 13, 1994, and released July 7, 1994. The full text of this Commission decision is available for inspection and
copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch, (Room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554.
The complete text of this decision may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc.; (202) 857-3800; 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140; Washington, DC 20037.



Summary of the Memorandum Opinion and Order on Further Reconsideration



1. This Order amends and clarifies certain rules governing the conduct of comparative renewal proceedings in the
Domestic Public Cellular Radio Telecommunications Service. Such proceedings are initiated when a cellular radio
licensee seeks renewal of its license at the end of its 10-year license period and challengers file competing applications.
The Report and Order, 57 FR 3027 (January 27, 1992), which first established standards for conducting cellular radio
comparative renewal proceedings, also created standards for awarding a renewal expectancy, which is a major comparative
preference awarded to a licensee for its substantial performance during its license term. A renewal expectancy would
be more significant than any other preference awarded in a comparative renewal proceeding. The Memorandum Opinion
and Order on Reconsideration (Reconsideration Order) in this proceeding, 58 FR 21928 (April 26, 1993), created a
two-step procedure for cellular license renewal hearings and also modified the renewal expectancy standards.

2. Pursuant to the two-step procedure, the Presiding Judge will conduct a threshold (step one) hearing to determine
whether the renewal applicant deserves a renewal expectancy for providing ``substantial'' service during its license
term. If the renewal applicant is awarded a renewal expectancy, the renewal application would be granted. If the renewal
applicant does not receive a renewal expectancy in the threshold hearing, the Presiding Judge would then conduct
a full (step two) hearing comparing the applicants pursuant to the evaluation criteria described in the Rules. Further,
a challenging applicant which proposes to provide service which far exceeds that presently being provided by the
incumbent licensee may request a waiver of step one of the two-step procedure. The two-step procedure is described
in revised Section 22.942 of the Rules, which was stayed until the Reconsideration Order became final and was no longer
subject to judicial review. The revised version of Section 22.942 adopted in the referenced Reconsideration Order
will become effective thirty days after the publication of this summary in the 

Federal Register

.

3. The 

Further Reconsideration Order

 revises  22.942 of the Commission's Rules in several respects. First, it amends  22.942(d) to explicitly
state that if a waiver of the step one hearing is granted, a renewal expectancy issue will be designated as part of the
step two hearing and will be the most important comparative factor in deciding the case. Second, it revises  22.942(a)
of the Rules to provide that renewal applicants will have sixty (60) days after the issuance of the Public Notice announcing
the filing of competing applications to file their renewal expectancy showing, rather than the thirty (30) days now
specified in the Rules. Third, it amends  22.942(f) of the Rules to state specifically that the expedited hearing
procedures of   22.916(b) (5)-(8) of the Rules apply to step one hearings as well as to step two hearings.
Fourth, it revises Section 22.942(d) to require challenging applicants to file requests for waiver of step one hearings
at the time they file their applications and to allow other parties to respond to those requests at the same time that
petitions to deny any of the applications are filed, 

i.e.,

 thirty days after the renewal applicant files its renewal expectancy showing.

4. In addition, the 

Further Reconsideration Order

 explained that unserved area applications or authorizations would play no role in the cellular renewal process,
including the comparison of the proposed service areas of competing applicants. Further, since the Reconsideration
Order ruled that relevant non-FCC misconduct will no longer be considered as part of a licensee's renewal expectancy
showing, the Commission eliminated the language of Section 22.941(b)(4) of the Rules which required the disclosure
of non-FCC misconduct as part of a licensee's renewal expectancy showing. Lastly, the Commission vacated the character
reporting requirements set forth in footnote six of the Reconsideration Order, observing that the issue of what character
reporting requirements should be imposed on cellular renewal applicants and other Part 22 applicants can best be
resolved in a broad rulemaking proceeding and not on reconsideration of the cellular renewal rules.



Ordering Clauses



Accordingly, 

It Is Ordered

 that the rule changes made herein 

Will Become Effective sixty

 (60) days after publication in the 

Federal Register

, and that the stay imposed by the Reconsideration Order on the effectiveness of  22.942 of the Rules is vacated.

Rule Changes


Part 22 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:


PART 22_PUBLIC MOBILE SERVICES


1. The authority citation for Part 22 continues to read as follows:





Authority: 

Sections 4, 303, 48 Stat. 1066, 1083, as amended; 47 U.S.C. Sections 154, 303.



2. Section 22.941 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(4) to read as follows:


 22.941 

Criteria for comparative cellular renewal proceedings.


* * * * *


(b) * * *
(4) Copies of all Commission orders finding the licensee to have violated the Communications Act or any Commission
rule or policy, and a list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in paragraphs (b) (1) through
(3) of this section.


* * * * *


3. Section 22.942 is revised to read as follows:


 22.942 

Procedures for comparative renewal proceedings.


The following procedures shall apply to comparative renewal proceedings in the Domestic Public Cellular Radio Telecommunications
Service:
(a) Within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the Public Notice announcing the filing of a renewal application and applications
competing with that renewal application, the renewal applicant must file an original and four copies of its renewal
expectancy showing with the Commission.
(b) Interested parties have thirty (30) days from the date that the renewal applicant submits its renewal expectancy
showing to file petitions to deny any of the mutually exclusive applications. Applicants have fifteen (15) days to
file replies; no further pleadings will be accepted.
(c) In most instances, the renewal application and any competing application(s) will be designated for a two-step
hearing procedure. An Administrative Law Judge will conduct a threshold (step one) hearing, in which both the licensee
and the competing applicants will be parties, to determine whether the renewal applicant deserves a renewal expectancy.
If the order designating the applications for hearing specifies any basic qualifying issues against the licensee,
those issues will be tried in this threshold (step one) hearing. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal
applicant is basically qualified and due a renewal expectancy, the competing applicants will be found ineligible
for further consideration and their applications will be denied. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal
applicant does not merit a renewal expectancy but is otherwise qualified, then all the applications filed for that
market will be considered in a comparative hearing (step two) which follows the expedited procedures described in
  22.916 (b)(5) through (b)(8).
(d) If a competing applicant demonstrates that its proposal so far exceeds the services presently being provided
that there would be no purpose in making a threshold determination as to whether the renewal applicant deserved a renewal
expectancy vis-a-vis such a competing applicant, such a competing applicant may request a waiver of the threshold
hearing (step one) of the two-step hearing procedure. Such a waiver request must be filed at the time the requestor's
application is filed. Petitions opposing such waiver requests must be filed within thirty (30) days after the renewal
applicant has filed its renewal expectancy showing. Replies to such petitions must be filed within 15 days of the petitions;
no further pleadings will be accepted. If a request to waive the step one hearing is granted, the renewal expectancy
issue will be designated as part of the step two hearing and will remain the most important comparative factor in deciding
the case, as provided in  22.941(a).
(e) If the Presiding Judge issues a ruling in the step one hearing which denies the licensee a renewal expectancy, all
the applicants involved in the proceeding will be allowed 90 days after the release of the Judge's ruling in step one
to file their direct cases. Rebuttal cases must be filed within 30 days after the filing of the direct cases.
(f) The Presiding Judge shall use the expedited hearing procedures delineated in   22.916 (b)(5) through
(b)(8) in both step one and step two hearings conducted in comparative cellular radio renewal proceedings.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; extension of time.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission grants a request for extension of time of the period for filing responses to opposition petitions for
reconsideration concerning federal policies for interstate transmission of calling party number identification.
This action was taken as a result of a motion filed by the People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission
for the State of California. The action is taken to allow time for complete responsive comments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Order Granting Motion for Extension of Time To File Comments



Adopted: July 15, 1994.




Released: July 15, 1994.





By the Chief, Domestic Facilities Division:

1. On March 8, 1994, the Commission adopted a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 94-59,
released March 28, 1994, adopting rules to establish a federal policy regarding calling number identification.
Public notice of this action appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on April 18, 1994, 59 FR 18318. Petitions for reconsideration of the Report and Order were filed May 18, 1994, and notice
of the filing of these petitions appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on June 23, 1994, 59 FR 32430.

2. On July 11, 1994, the People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission for the State of California
(``petitioner'') filed a motion requesting that the time for filing replies in the above-captioned proceedings
be extended from July 18, 1994, to August 17, 1994. In support of its request, the State of California and the California
Public Utilities Commission states that due to the voluminous record on reconsideration and the complexity of the
issues involved in the proceeding, a grant of the requested extension is likely to improve the quality of the replies
filed and assist the Commission in its consideration of pending petitions for reconsideration.

3. As set forth in Section 1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. Section 1.46, it is our policy that extensions of
time not be routinely granted. We find, however, that the State of California and the California Public Utilities
Commission have shown good cause for the requested extension. In reviewing the record to date in this proceeding,
we agree with the State of California and the California Public Utilities Commission that the public interest will
be best served by granting a 30 day extension of time to file replies to oppositions to petitions for reconsideration
in this proceeding. Accordingly, we will grant the requested relief.

4. Accordingly, 

It Is Ordered

 that the Request for Extension of Time filed by Petitioners 

Is Granted

.

5. 

It Is Therefore Ordered

 that the date for filing replies to oppositions to petitions for reconsideration in this proceeding IS EXTENDED to
August 17, 1994.

6. This action is taken pursuant to authority found in Sections 4 (i) and (r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
47 U.S.C. Sections 4(i) and 303(r) and Sections 0.204(b), 0.283 and 1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. Sections
0.204(b), 0.283 and 1.46.

Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule and notice of OMB control number. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the
Gulf of Mexico (FMP). Amendment 9 extends the current reef fish permit moratorium from its scheduled expiration on
May 8, 1995, through as late as December 31, 1995. For the red snapper segment of the reef fish fishery, Amendment 9 authorizes
the collection of commercial landings data for the years 1990 through 1992 and the collection of information to identify
certain participants. It also extends the red snapper endorsement system and its associated trip and landing limits
from their scheduled expiration on December 31, 1994, through as late as December 31, 1995. The intended effects of
this rule are to collect information needed to evaluate red snapper effort management alternatives, to identify
individuals who may qualify for initial participation in a red snapper effort management regime, and to continue
interim management measures until the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) has an opportunity to
implement longer-term measures. This rule also informs the public of the approval by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) of two new collection-of-information requirements contained in this rule and publishes the OMB control
number for those collections. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The reef fish fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the FMP, which was prepared by the Council, and is implemented
through regulations at 50 CFR part 641 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act
(Magnuson Act). 


The rationale for the measures in Amendment 9 and for the additional changes to the regulations proposed by NMFS was
included in the proposed rule (59 FR 27258, May 26, 1994) and is not repeated here.

Comments and Responses 


Comments on Amendment 9 and the proposed rule were received from three individuals. Two of the commenters objected
to Amendment 9 and the proposed rule and the third supported them. Specific comments and responses follow. 


Comment:

 One person stated that the red snapper endorsement and trip limit provisions and the reef fish permit moratorium are
not cost effective and should not be extended. The commenter's objections are based on the contention that a red snapper
individual transferable quota (ITQ) system will not be implemented. The commenter also stated that the trip limit
provisions and moratorium are based on erroneous and unverifiable data indicating overfishing of red snapper. 


Response:

 The reef fish permit moratorium was implemented on May 8, 1992, for three years, to prevent continued speculative
entry into the fishery while the Council considers other reef fish effort management alternatives, including an
ITQ system. The red snapper endorsement and trip limit provisions, first established by emergency action, were continued
through 1994 under Amendment 6 to prevent the occurrence of an extremely short season and a ``derby'' fishery as occurred
in 1992. 
The Council has not yet determined if an ITQ system should be implemented. The proposed voluntary landings data collection
was suggested by vessel owners, operators whose earned income qualified for the vessel permit, and historical captains
who were interested in learning of their possible preliminary shares for planning purposes. This information will
help fishermen determine their most likely level of participation in an ITQ system, if adopted for the fishery. The
Council, upon receipt of the data collected and analyzed under Amendment 9 and after receipt of public comments from
affected parties, will decide whether to proceed with an ITQ or other effort management system and the current target
date for implementation of January 1, 1996. 
The conditions in the fishery that led to implementation of the permit moratorium and the red snapper endorsement
system will remain until a more comprehensive program is in place to limit fishing effort in the red snapper fishery.
The Council anticipates that the reef fish fishery, particularly for red snapper, would be unnecessarily disrupted
if the moratorium and red snapper endorsement provisions expire before implementation of an effort management system.
The Council also recognized that such provisions should not be continued indefinitely. Accordingly, the Council
determined that the permit moratorium and red snapper endorsement system should be extended through December 31,
1995, or until such an effort management system can be implemented, if before that date. 
Concerning the validity of the scientific data that indicates that red snapper are overfished, all such data undergo
extensive scientific review and verification prior to NMFS's assessment of the status of the resource. The best available
information continues to indicate that red snapper are overfished. 


Comment:

 The first commenter also objected to the proposed data collection as duplicative and wasteful. The commenter believes
that: (1) NMFS already has obtained landings data as part of the red snapper endorsement process, and (2) the requested
submittal would allow fraudulent landings records to be used to increase a person's share if an ITQ system is implemented.



Response:

 Applicants for a red snapper endorsement on their reef fish vessel permits submitted data only to document the specified
landing threshold of 5,000 pounds in any 2 of 3 qualifying years. In contrast, the data collection proposed under Amendment
9 covers all red snapper landings information for the period when data are readily available (1990-1992). This
collection will provide the Council with a complete data base upon which to establish any effort management system;
because this collection covers the full three years for which good data exists, it will avoid the need for additional
collections. 
Concerning fraudulent reporting, the data collection provisions are designed to minimize that possibility. Dealer
records and trip receipts must definitively show the species known as red snapper and the vessel's name, official
number, or other reference that provides a way of clearly identifying the vessel. Dealer records must contain a sworn
affidavit by the dealer confirming the accuracy and authenticity of the records, under penalty of law. Accordingly,
NMFS disagrees with the comment and supports collection of data under these safeguards. 


Comment:

 The first commenter also objected to the proposed submittal of data by persons who believe they are historical captains.
The commenter characterized those persons as employees who do not share in the losses sustained by the vessel owner
and therefore should not be entitled to participate in an ITQ system. 


Response:

 After review of testimony and recommendations of the Council's Ad Hoc Allocation Advisory Panel, the Council determined
that historical captains should be considered for fishing privileges under a red snapper effort management system,
as well as vessel owners and operators whose earned income qualified for the vessel permit. NMFS believes that collection
of these data will provide the Council with the information needed to determine if those persons warrant inclusion
in an effort management system as being developed under Amendment 8. However, comments on allocation to historical
captains are outside of the scope of Amendment 9 and therefore are not addressed here. 


Comment:

 The second commenter objected to the share agreement time period specified in  641.10(a)(2)(i). That section
specifies that a share agreement must have been in effect from at least November 6, 1989, through 1993. The commenter
claimed that the Council intended that a historical captain fish solely under a share agreement only through 1992,
and that the final rule should be revised accordingly.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940802-0-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940802-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 NMFS has reviewed the administrative record in regard to the referenced share agreement criterion, and concluded
that the Council intended that historical captains must document a share agreement in effect up to the present time.
At its March 1994 meeting, the Council specifically rejected an alternative that would have required share agreements
only in 1990, 1991, and 1992. Since the final rule will be implemented in mid-1994, 1993 is the most recent calendar
year with readily available records for a full year. NMFS therefore disagrees with the commenter and supports the
time period for share agreements, as specified in Amendment 9 and the rule. 


Comment:

 The second commenter also suggested that  641.10(a)(2) include in the criteria to qualify as a historical captain
the requirement that a person must have landed red snapper at least once prior to November 7, 1989. 


Response:

 Section 641.10(d)(iv) requires an applicant for historical captain status to submit documentation of a landing
of red snapper prior to November 7, 1989. NMFS agrees that, for consistency, the requirement for such a landing should
also be included in the criteria for historical captain status, and it is added in this final rule at  641.10(a)(2)(iv).



Comment:

 The second commenter also objected to the use of the word ``lease'' in one of the criteria for historical captain status,
primarily because of the present use of that term in the fishing industry. 


Response: 

NMFS agrees with the commenter and has removed the phrase containing the word ``lease'' from  641.10(a)(2)(i).



Comment:

 The second commenter also objected to the statement in  641.10(a)(2)(i) that the share agreement must have
provided for the operator to be responsible for hiring the crew, ``who were paid from his or her share.'' The commenter
suggested replacement text to reflect the standard practice in the fishery for the ``buyer'' to write the checks to
the crew_after the captain determines shares and payment to the crew. 


Response:

 Neither the Council nor NMFS intended to establish as a criterion for status as a historical captain that such person
must have written paychecks to his or her crew. The intent was that the share agreement provide for proceeds to be divided
between the owner and the historical captain. Crew shares or payments would not be contained in such share agreement.
Rather, the historical captain would determine payments to the crew, such payments coming from the share under the
control of the historical captain_without regard to who wrote the checks. For clarity, the above quoted language
is revised to read, ``who were paid from the share under his or her control.'' 


Comment:

 A third commenter provided various comments in support of Amendment 9, noting the need to continue the effectiveness
of the reef fish permit moratorium and to then establish an ITQ system. 


Response:

 NMFS agrees with this comment in support of Amendment 9. However, remarks on an allocation system such as an ITQ system
or other effort management option are outside the scope of Amendment 9 and are not included here. 


Approval of Amendment 9 


On July 20, 1994, the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), approved Amendment 9. 


Changes From the Proposed Rule 


In  641.2, the address in the definition of ``Regional Director'' is corrected. 
As noted above under Comments and Responses,  641.10(a)(2)(i) is revised and  641.10(a)(2)(iv) is added.
An additional change is made to  641.10(a)(2)(i) to clarify that a historical captain may have fished under
more than one share agreement during the required period. 
A new  641.10(b)(3) is added to clarify the procedures whereby owners/operators will receive printouts of
existing NMFS data on landings of red snapper during 1990 through 1992. The provisions for owners/operators to submit
records of landings they believe were omitted from NMFS data are moved to  641.10(c)(1). 


Classification 


This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The reasons were published in the preamble to the proposed rule (59 FR 27258, May 26, 1994). As a result, a regulatory
flexibility analysis was not prepared. 
This final rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act_specifically,
information on landings of red snapper and documentation of status as a historical captain in the red snapper fishery.
These collections of information have been approved by OMB under OMB control number 0648-0281. The public reporting
burdens for these collections of information are estimated to average 2 and 5 hours per response, respectively, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collections of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or
any other aspect of the collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burdens, to Edward E.
Burgess, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702 and to the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, OMB, Washington, DC 20503 (Attention: NOAA Desk Officer). 
The data to be collected under this final rule are needed by fishermen and the Council to evaluate the effects of potential
effort management systems for the red snapper segment of the reef fish fishery. That segment is managed under measures
that expire December 31, 1995. To provide ample time to collect the data, present it to the fishermen and the Council,
evaluate its effects, and develop, approve, and implement additional management measures prior to December 31,
1995, it is necessary that the data collection under this rule commence as soon as possible. To that end, information
regarding the proposed data collection has been broadly disseminated to the fishing community prior to this final
rule. The other measures in this final rule are extensions of effectiveness or clarifications of measures that are
currently in effect and, thus, do not affect current fishing practices. Accordingly, the Assistant Administrator
for Fisheries, NOAA, finds for good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act that the effectiveness
of this final rule should not be delayed.

 641.10



Red snapper data collection. 



(a) 

General.

 (1) To evaluate red snapper effort management alternatives, including individual transferable quota (ITQ) systems
and license limitations, it is necessary to obtain commercial red snapper landings data for the years 1990 through
1992. To identify individuals who may qualify for initial participation in a red snapper effort management regime,
it is necessary to identify certain participants in the red snapper fishery, specifically, operators of vessels
who were the earned income qualifiers for the vessels' reef fish permits and those who are ``historical captains.''
In the latter case, determination of a historical captain's share agreement with the vessel's owner is also required.


(2) For the purpose of the red snapper effort limitation alternatives, a historical captain means an operator who_

(i) From November 6, 1989, through 1993, fished solely under verbal or written share agreements with an owner, such
agreements provided for the operator to be responsible for hiring the crew, who were paid from the share under his or
her control; 

(ii) Landed from that vessel at least 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of red snapper per year in 2 of the 3 years 1990, 1991, and 1992;


(iii) Derived more than 50 percent of his or her earned income from commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch, in
each of the years 1989 through 1993; and 

(iv) Landed red snapper prior to November 7, 1989. 

(3) The data collection described in this section will be the only collection for the effort management alternatives
currently being considered by the Council. Accordingly, failure to submit requested data may result in failure to
be included among the initial participants in the red snapper fishery under an effort management system and/or failure
to obtain the full initial share of red snapper to which a person may be entitled under an ITQ regime. 

(b) 

Existing data.

 (1) NMFS has records of all red snapper landings reported by vessel logbook forms submitted pursuant to  641.5
(a) or (b) and has access to records of red snapper landings reported under Florida's trip ticket system. NMFS also
has records of the earned income qualifier for each vessel permit issued for reef fish. Data duplicating these records
are not needed. 

(2) Landings of red snapper reported by vessel logbook forms and received by the Science and Research Director prior
to September 16, 1992, are conclusive as to red snapper landed during the months that such logbook forms were required
of, or voluntarily submitted by, a vessel_landings data from other sources will not be considered for such months.
In the absence of landings data from such logbook forms, landings of red snapper reported under Florida's trip ticket
system and received by the State prior to September 16, 1992, are conclusive as to landings in Florida_landings data
from other sources will not be considered for landings in Florida. 

(3) On or about August 1, 1994, vessel owners, and operators whose earned income was used to qualify for a vessel permit,
will be mailed printouts of their logbook/trip ticket records of landings of red snapper during 1990 through 1992
and forms for the reporting of additional landings. An owner, or such operator, who had such landings and who does not
receive a printout by August 8, 1994, must contact the Regulations and Permits Branch, Southeast Region, NMFS, telephone
(813) 893-3722, for such printout and forms.

(c) 

Additional landings data. 

(1) An owner or operator who wishes to be considered for initial participation in the red snapper fishery under an effort
management system may submit documentation of red snapper landings not covered by vessel logbook forms or the Florida
trip ticket system or documentation of landings that he or she believes were erroneously omitted from the logbook/trip
ticket records. 
(i) Such documentation may consist of copies of trip receipts that show dates and amounts of landings of red snapper.
Trip receipts must definitively show the species known as red snapper and the vessel's name, official number, or other
reference that provides a way of clearly identifying the vessel. 
(ii) Such documentation may also consist of dealer records that show dates and amounts of landings of red snapper.
As with trip receipts, dealer records must definitively show the species known as red snapper and the vessel's name,
official number, or other reference that provides a way of clearly identifying the vessel. Dealer records must contain
a sworn affidavit by the dealer confirming the accuracy and authenticity of the records. A sworn affidavit is an official
written statement wherein the individual signing the affidavit affirms that the information presented is accurate
and can be substantiated, under penalty of law. 
(iii) Documentation by a combination of trip receipts and dealer records is acceptable, but duplicate records for
the same landings are not acceptable. 
(2) Red snapper landings data will not be accepted_
(i) For a period during which the harvesting vessel did not have a permit, provided a permit was required during such
period. Permits were not required from January 1 through April 22, 1990, and from January 1 through 31, 1992. 
(ii) For a period during which the commercial red snapper fishery in the EEZ was closed. The commercial red snapper
fishery was closed in the EEZ from August 24 through December 31, 1991, from February 22 through April 2, 1992, and from
May 15 through December 31, 1992. 
(3) Additional landings data submitted under this paragraph (c) must be attached to a Red Snapper Landings Data form,
which is available from the Regional Director, and must be postmarked not later than September 30, 1994. 
(d) 

Historical captains. 

(1) An operator who wishes to be considered for status as a historical captain in the red snapper fishery under an effort
management system may submit documentation of such status by providing the following: 
(i) A Historical Captain Status form, available from the Regional Director, which requests information necessary
to determine such status and information to establish the share agreement of a historical captain with the vessel's
owner; 
(ii) A Red Snapper Landings Data form and accompanying additional landings data pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
section, if such form and data have not been submitted by a vessel owner; 
(iii) Copies of forms and schedules from the applicant's income tax returns for the years 1989 through 1993 that show
total earned income and that part of earned income derived from commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch (generally,
pages 1 and 2 of Form 1040, W-2's, and Schedule C); and 
(iv) Documentation of a landing of red snapper prior to November 7, 1989. 
(2) Forms and information submitted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be postmarked not later than September
30, 1994. 
(e) 

Verification. 

Documentation of red snapper landings, documentation of status as a historical captain, and other information submitted
under this section are subject to verification by comparison with state, Federal, and other records and information.
Submission of false documentation or information may disqualify a person from initial participation under a red
snapper effort management system. 




8. In  641.23, paragraphs (b)(1) introductory text and (d)(2) introductory text are revised to read as follows:

* * * * * 


(b) * * * 
(1) Longline and buoy gear may not be used to fish for reef fish in the longline and buoy gear restricted area. For the
purpose of this paragraph (b), ``for reef fish'' means possessing or landing reef fish_ 


* * * * * 


(d) * * * 
(2) In the SMZ specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, fishing for reef fish is limited to hook-and-line gear
with three or fewer hooks per line and spearfishing gear. For the purpose of this paragraph (d), ``for reef fish'' means
possessing reef fish aboard or landing reef fish from_

Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is closing the directed fishery for Atka mackerel in the Central Aleutian District (CAD) of the Bering Sea and
Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the Atka mackerel total allowable
catch (TAC) in the CAD.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.


In accordance with  675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Atka mackerel TAC for the CAD was established by the final 1994 initial
specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 37,846 metric tons (mt). The directed fishery for
Atka mackerel was closed on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29964, June 10, 1994). That prohibition was rescinded on July 4, 1994
(59FR 33920, July 1, 1994), upon determination that the 1994 TAC for Atka mackerel in the CAD had not been reached.
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with  675.20(a)(8),
that the Atka mackerel TAC in the CAD soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed
fishing allowance of 37,346 mt with consideration that 500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing
for other species in the CAD. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached.
Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the CAD, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t.,
July 28, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at  675.20(h).

Public and Indian Housing Exemption From Eligibility Requirements for Police Officers and Security Personnel



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This regulation implements section 519 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) by amending
24 CFR parts 905 and 960 to permit public housing agencies (PHAs) and Indian housing authorities (IHAs) (hereinafter,
both public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities will be referred to as HAs, unless a specific reference
to a PHA or IHA is applicable) to allow police officers and other security personnel not otherwise eligible for occupancy
to reside in public or Indian housing dwelling units under a plan that will increase security for housing residents
while minimizing both the reduction of available public and Indian housing dwelling units for eligible families
and the loss of income to HAs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement



The information collection requirements contained in this final rule have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), and assigned
OMB control number 2577-0185.



I. Background_Proposed Rule



On June 7, 1993 (58 FR 32006), the Department published a proposed rule that would implement section 519 of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) by amending existing regulations to permit public housing agencies (PHAs)
and Indian housing authorities (IHAs) to allow police officers and other security personnel not otherwise eligible
for occupancy to reside in public and Indian housing dwelling units under a plan that will increase security for housing
residents while minimizing both the reduction of available public and Indian housing dwelling units for eligible
families and the loss of income to housing agencies (HAs).

Under this final rule, eligibility for use of units as provided by section 519 of the NAHA requires that an HA submit
a plan to the Department that identifies the total number of units under management by the HA; the specific housing
developments, and the number of units they contain, where the HA intends to place Officers; and the particular units
(stating number of bedrooms) within each development that would be allocated to Officers. This plan is required by
  905.308(c)(1)(ii) and 960.505(a)(2) of the rule. Since the Department intends that each plan will
be reviewed and approved by the local HUD Field Office or Office of Native American Programs,   905.308(c)(2)
and 960.505(b) of the rule call for submission of the plan directly to these offices.

<TEXT>
 

Section 519 of the NAHA requires that the Department notify each HA submitting a plan of HUD's approval or disapproval
of the plan not later than thirty days after the Department receives the plan. This requirement is set forth in   905.308(c)(3)
and 960.505(c) of the rule. Plan approval by the Department constitutes granting of the exemption from eligibility
requirements that would otherwise apply.



II. Public Comment



The Department received 11 comments on the proposed rule. The commenters consisted of housing agencies and one professional
association. All commenters expressed general support for the Department's proposed implementation of section
519 of NAHA.

The main criticism of the proposed rule focused on loss of income due to the exclusion of units occupied by police officers
from the Performance Funding System (PFS) formula. The proposed rule stated that dwelling units allocated to police
officers in accordance with this subpart would be excluded from the total unit months available, as defined in 24 CFR
905.102 for IHAs and 24 CFR 990.102 for PHAs. For purposes of the operating subsidy under the PFS, the full amount of
any rent paid by Officers in accordance with this rule is included in other income, as defined in   905.102
and 990.102.

To make the most of its resources, the Department has consistently limited funding under the PFS to units that house
low income families. Units used for other purposes, such as day care facilities or resident organization offices,
are excluded from PFS. The Department currently permits the payment of operating subsidy for one non-dwelling unit
per development that is used to promote economic self-sufficiency services or anti-drug programs. Anti-drug activities
directly related to ridding developments of illegal drugs and drug-related activities include housing police and
security officers. HA requests to allow consideration for the continued payment of operating subsidy for one unit
per housing development used to support these activities may be submitted to the local HUD Field Office for review
and approval. Operating subsidy for additional sites per housing development can only be approved by HUD Headquarters.
This provision is added in   905.308(f) and 960.511(b) of the rule.

Comments were also directed at the Allocation Table, which set forth a formula for determining number of units within
each housing development for residency by police officers. The comments indicated that the table was too rigid and
failed to take into consideration local conditions. Since the local HUD Field Office is responsible for final decision-making
in this area, local public safety factors must be evaluated by Field Office staff in making decisions regarding unit
allocation. An HA must certify, however, that any additional units proposed to be allocated for Officers are vacant
units for which there are no Eligible Families. No resident may be moved from a unit to make it available for occupancy
by an Officer under the plan.

The balance of comments concerned issues on HUD Field Office approval of HA rents, alternative lease arrangements,
and police responsibilities in lieu of rental payment. These are addressed as follows:

One comment questioned why the local HUD Field Office should have the discretion to approve or deny the amount of rent
to be paid by police officers. While the rule provides latitude to impose a ``reasonable rent'' on police officers,
the Field Office is familiar with local market conditions and can make a prudent determination regarding rent to be
charged. In addition, the Field Office has major oversight responsibility for the day-to-day operation of HAs, and
should provide guidance in this area.

One comment questioned why a ``memorandum of understanding'' cannot be used in lieu of a lease since the agreement
could be considered a special service contract between the HA and the Officer. The overall intent of the rule focuses
on police visability in HA developments. Since police officers will occupy units operated and managed by an HA as residents,
a formal lease should be utilized. It may, however, be modified to meet special needs of the HA and the police officer.

<PARENT> FR940802-0-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Several comments questioned the definition of ``Reasonable Rent'' as contained in the rule. As a substitute for rental
payment, it was proposed that officers provide specific services equal to the value of the unit. This is not the intent
of the rule. Reasonable rent may be a flat amount not related to an officer's income, but it must be consistent with the
limited loss of income requirements of this part. 

Finally, the terminology used in the proposed rule was that the rule implemented a ``waiver'' of the eligibility requirements.
This rule implements a statutory waiver, but the term used is ``exemption'' from the eligibility requirements, in
order to avoid administrative problems that may result because the Department follows additional processing requirements
for actions, also called ``waivers,'' that suspend non-statutory requirements on a case-by-case basis. 



Other Matters 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that the rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule is limited to exempting from the public and Indian housing admissibility criteria
for certain police and security personnel. By its terms, the rule limits the number of units that would be subject to
such exemptions, thereby limiting the economic impact on all PHAs and IHAs, including any that may be small entities.




Environmental Review 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made on the proposed rule in accordance with
HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50 which implements Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,
42 U.S.C. 4332. That Finding is available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Office of the
Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh
Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Since the environmental provisions of this final rule are unchanged from those
published in the proposed rule, the original Finding of No Significant Impact is still valid. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. The rule will
effect a minor exception to a previously existing scheme of federal assistance to programs run by state and local government,
but it will not alter the existing division of responsibility among federal, state and local governments. 



Executive Order 12606, the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and
thus the rule is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will
result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. 



Regulatory Agenda 



This rule was listed as sequence number 1702 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April
25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20473) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

2. 24 CFR part 905 is amended by adding a new  905.308 to read as follows: 



 905.308 



Exemption from eligibility requirements for police officers and other security personnel. 



(a) 

Purpose and scope. 

The purpose of this section is to permit the admission to Indian housing of police officers and other security personnel,
who are not otherwise eligible for such housing under any other admission requirements or procedures, under a plan
submitted by an Indian housing authority (HA) and approved by the Department, and to set forth standards and criteria
for the approval of such plans. The Department's objective in granting the exemption allowed by this section is to
permit long term residence in Indian housing developments by police officers and security personnel, whose visible
presence is expected to serve as a deterrent to criminal activity in and around Indian housing. 

(b) 

Definitions. 

For the purposes of this section: 



Department

 means the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). For purposes of plan submission and approval, Department
refers to the local HUD Office of Native American Programs. 



Eligible families

 means families that are eligible for residence in Indian housing assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937.




Officer

 means a professional police officer or other professional security provider. Police officers and other security
personnel are considered professional if they are employed full time, i.e., not less than 35 hours per week, by a governmental
unit or a private employer and compensated expressly for providing police or security services. As used in this section,
``Officer'' may refer to the Officer as so defined or to the Officer and his or her family taken together, depending
on the context. 



Plan

 means the written plan submitted by an HA to the Department, under which, if approved, the Department will exempt Officers
from the normal eligibility requirements for residence in Indian housing developments and allow Officers, who are
otherwise not eligible, to reside in Indian housing units. An HA may have only one plan in effect at any one time, which
will govern exemptions under this section for all housing developments managed by that HA. 

(c)

(ii) The exemption is given under a properly submitted plan that satisfies the standards and criteria set forth in

 905.308(d) of this part and, accordingly, has been approved by the Department. 

(2) 

Plan submission.

 A plan is properly submitted when it is received by the local HUD Office of Native American Programs with jurisdiction
over the HA. 

(3) 

Notification of plan approval or disapproval.

 The Department will notify an HA of the approval or disapproval of its plan within thirty days of its submission. Plan
approval by the Department constitutes granting of the exemption for the purposes of this section. 

(d) 

Plan standards and criteria. 

(1) Minimum requirements.

 To be approved, a plan must satisfy the following requirements: 

(i) The plan must identify the total number of units under management by the HA; the specific housing developments,
and the number of units they contain, where the HA intends to place Officers; and the particular units (stating number
of bedrooms) within each development that would be allocated to Officers. For each unit identified, the plan must
state the amount of rent that the Officer will pay and facts and circumstances (such as, the rent that would ordinarily
be charged for the unit, the HA's annual maintenance cost for the unit, the degree of difficulty in attracting Officers
to reside in the unit, the extent of the crime problem in the development, and the anticipated benefits of the Officer's
presence) that demonstrate the reasonableness of that amount, as required under  905.308(e)(i) of this part.


(ii) The plan must identify specifically the benefits to the community and to the HA that will result from the presence
of Officers in each affected development. 

(iii) The plan must describe the existing physical and social conditions in and around each affected development,
providing specific evidence of criminal activity (such as, frequency of telephone calls to local police, number
of arrests and types of offenses involved, and data on drug abuse in the community) in order to permit the Department
to make an informed assessment of the level of need for increased security. 

(iv) The plan must afford the Department a reasonable basis, which necessarily includes the certifications required
under  905.308(d)(2) of this part, for determining that the use by Officers of the identified dwelling units
will: 

(A) Increase security for other Indian housing residents;

(B) Result in a limited loss of income to the HA; and 
(C) Not result in a significant reduction of units available for residence by Eligible Families. 
(2) 

Certifications by HA.

 Only upon making the determination described in  905.308(d)(1)(iv) of this part will the Department approve
a plan. Further, the Department will not make this determination unless the plan contains a written statement, signed
by an authorized officer or other agent of the HA, certifying that: 
(i) The dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers are situated so as to place the Officers in close physical
proximity to other residents; 
(ii) No resident families will have to be transferred to other dwelling units in order to make available the units proposed
to be allocated to Officers; 
(iii) The dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers will be rented under a lease that contains the terms described
in  905.308(e) of this part; and 
(iv) The number of dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers under the plan does not exceed the limits set
forth in  905.308(d)(3) of this part or, in the alternative, any units so allocated in excess of the applicable
maximum number are vacant units for which there are no Eligible Families. This certification on the part of the HA satisfies
the requirements of   905.308(d)(1)(iv) (B) and (C) of this part. 
(3) 

Unit allocation table.

 For purposes of the certification required by  905.308(d)(2) of this part, the following table sets forth the
maximum number of units to be allocated to Officers as a function of the total number of units under management by the
HA: 





The maximum number of units to be allocated by HAs with less than 500 units under management will be determined by the
Office of Native American Programs on a case by case basis.




(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 2577-0185.) 




(e) 

Special rent requirements and other terms and conditions.

 The HA shall lease units to Officers under a lease agreement, which must be submitted as a part of the plan, containing
terms that provide as follows: 
(1) 

Reasonable rent.

 The lease shall provide for a reasonable rent, which may be a flat amount not related to the Officer's income. The HA
should attempt to establish a rent that will provide an incentive to Officers to reside in the units but that is also
consistent with the limited loss of income requirement of  905.308(d)(1)(iv)(B) of this part. As required
in  905.308(d)(1)(i) of this part, the plan must state facts and circumstances (such as, the rent that would
ordinarily be charged for the unit, the HA's annual maintenance cost for the unit, the degree of difficulty in attracting
Officers to reside in the unit, the extent of the crime problem in the development, and the anticipated benefits of
the Officer's presence) that demonstrate the reasonableness of the rent amount. 
(2) 

Responsibility for damage and overall condition.

 The Officer shall be responsible for physical damage to the interior of the leased unit, hallway and entrance, if any,
and exterior area bordering the unit. The lease also shall require the Officer to maintain the overall condition of
the leased unit, including control of litter in the area of the development immediately around the unit. 
(3) 

Responsibility for normal facility management.

 The lease shall impose on the HA responsibility for routine facility management relating to the leased unit, including
ongoing maintenance and repair of equipment, trash collection and similar areas of responsibility. 
(4) 

Continued employment.

 The lease shall provide that the Officer's right of occupancy is dependent on the continuation of employment as an
Officer. The lease also shall provide that the Officer will move out of the leased unit within a reasonably prompt time,
to be established by the lease, after termination of employment as an Officer. 
(5) 

Prohibition on subletting.

 The lease shall prohibit the Officer from subletting the unit, and provide that the unit must be the Officer's primary
residence. 
(f) 

Applicability of the annual contributions contract; effect on the performance funding system. 
(1) Annual contributions contract.

 Except to the extent that an exemption from eligibility requirements is provided under  905.308(c) of this
part, Indian housing units occupied by Officers in accordance with a plan submitted and approved under this section
will be subject to the terms and conditions of the annual contributions contract (ACC) between the HA and the United
States of America. This section does not override any of the terms and conditions of the ACC except insofar as they are
inconsistent with the provisions of this section. 
(2) 

Performance funding system.

 For purposes of the operating subsidy under the Performance Funding System (PFS) described in subpart J of this part,
dwelling units allocated to Officers in accordance with this section are excluded from the total unit months available,
as defined in  905.102 of this part. Also for purposes of the operating subsidy under the PFS, the full amount
of any rent paid by Officers in accordance with this section is included in other income, as defined in  905.102
of this part. HAs may receive operating subsidy for one unit per housing development to promote economic self-sufficiency
services or anti-drug programs, including housing police officers and security personnel. An HA may request consideration
of such units in its calculation of operating subsidy eligibility through the appropriate local HUD Office of Native
American Programs.

Subpart E_Exemption From Eligibility Requirements for Police Officers and Other Security Personnel 


 960.501


Purpose and scope. 


The purpose of this subpart is to permit the admission to public housing of police officers and other security personnel,
who are not otherwise eligible for such housing under any other admission requirements or procedures, under a plan
submitted by a public housing agency (HA) and approved by the Department, and to set forth standards and criteria for
the approval of such plans. The Department's objective in granting the exemption allowed by this subpart is to permit
long term residence in public housing developments by police officers and security personnel, whose visible presence
is expected to serve as a deterrent to criminal activity in and around public housing. 


 960.503


Definitions. 




Department 

means the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). For purposes of plan submission and approval, Department
refers to the local HUD Field Office. 


Eligible families

 means families that are eligible for residence in public housing assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937.



Officer

 means a professional police officer or other professional security provider. Police officers and other security
personnel are considered professional if they are employed full time, i.e., not less than 35 hours per week, by a governmental
unit or a private employer and compensated expressly for providing police or security services. As used in this subpart,
``Officer'' may refer to the Officer as so defined or to the Officer and his or her family taken together, depending
on the context. 


Plan

 means the written plan submitted by a public housing agency (PHA) to the Department, under which, if approved, the
Department will exempt Officers from the normal eligibility requirements for residence in public housing and allow
Officers, who are otherwise not eligible, to reside in public housing units. An HA may have only one plan in effect at
any one time, which will govern exemptions under this subpart for all public housing managed by that HA. 


 960.505


Exemption from eligibility requirements; plan submission; plan approval or disapproval. 


(a) 

Conditions for exemption.

 The Department may exempt Officers from the eligibility requirements for admission to public housing, provided
that: 
(1) The Officers would not be eligible, under any other admission requirements or procedures, for admission to the
public housing development without such an exemption; and 
(2) The exemption is given under a properly submitted plan that satisfies the standards and criteria set forth in  960.507
of this part and, accordingly, has been approved by the Department. 
(b) 

Plan submission.

 A plan is properly submitted when it is received by the local HUD Field Office with jurisdiction over the HA. 
(c) 

Notification of plan approval or disapproval.

 The Department will notify an HA of the approval or disapproval of its plan within thirty days of its submission. Plan
approval by the Department constitutes granting of the exemption for the purposes of this subpart. 


 960.507


Plan standards and criteria. 


(a) 

Minimum requirements.

 To be approved, a plan must satisfy the following requirements: 
(1) The plan must identify the total number of units under management by the HA; the specific housing developments,
and the number of units they contain, where the HA intends to place Officers; and the particular units (stating number
of bedrooms) within each development that would be allocated to Officers. For each unit identified, the plan must
state the amount of rent that the Officer will pay and facts and circumstances (such as, the rent that would ordinarily
be charged for the unit, the HA's annual maintenance cost for the unit, the degree of difficulty in attracting Officers
to reside in the unit, the extent of the crime problem in the development, and the anticipated benefits of the Officer's
presence) that demonstrate the reasonableness of that amount, as required under  960.509(a) of this subpart.

(2) The plan must identify specifically the benefits to the community and to the HA that will result from the presence
of Officers in each affected development. 
(3) The plan must describe the existing physical and social conditions in and around each affected development, providing
specific evidence of criminal activity (such as, frequency of telephone calls to local police, number of arrests
and types of offenses involved, and data on drug abuse in the community) in order to permit the Department to make an
informed assessment of the level of need for increased security. 
(4) The plan must afford the Department a reasonable basis, which necessarily includes the certifications required
under  960.507(b) of this part, for determining that the use by Officers of the identified dwelling units will:

(i) Increase security for other public housing residents; 
(ii) Result in a limited loss of income to the HA; and 
(iii) Not result in a significant reduction of units available for residence by Eligible Families.

Further, the Department will not make such a determination unless the plan contains a written statement, signed by
an authorized officer or other agent of the HA, certifying that: 
(1) The dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers are situated so as to place the Officers in close physical
proximity to other residents; 
(2) No resident families will have to be transferred to other dwelling units in order to make available the units proposed
to be allocated to Officers; 
(3) The dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers will be rented under a lease that contains the terms described
in  960.509 of this part; and 
(4) The number of dwelling units proposed to be allocated to Officers under the plan does not exceed the limits set forth
in  960.507(c) of this part or, in the alternative, any units so allocated in excess of the applicable maximum
number are vacant units for which there are no Eligible Families. This certification on the part of the HA satisfies
the requirements of   960.507(a)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this part. 
(c) 

Unit allocation table. 

For purposes of the certification required by  960.507(b)(4) of this part, the following table sets forth the
maximum number of units to be allocated to Officers as a function of the total number of units under management by the
HA: 




The maximum number of units to be allocated by HAs with less than 500 units under management will be determined by the
Field Office on a case by case basis. 



(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 2577-0185.) 


 960.509 

Special rent requirements and other terms and conditions. 


The HA shall lease units to Officers under a lease agreement that is consistent with the requirements of this section
and 24 CFR part 966. The requirements of this section shall take precedence if there is any inconsistency between them
and 24 CFR part 966. 
(a) 

Reasonable rent. 

The lease shall provide for a reasonable rent, which may be a flat amount not related to the Officer's income. The HA
should attempt to establish a rent that will provide an incentive to Officers to reside in the units but that is also
consistent with the limited loss of income requirement of  960.507(a)(4)(ii) of this part. As required in  960.507(a)(1)
of this part, the plan must state facts and circumstances (such as, the rent that would ordinarily be charged for the
unit, the HA's annual maintenance cost for the unit, the degree of difficulty in attracting Officers to reside in the
unit, the extent of the crime problem in the development, and the anticipated benefits of the Officer's presence)
that demonstrate the reasonableness of the rent amount. 
(b) 

Continued employment. 

The lease shall provide that the Officer's right of occupancy is dependent on the continuation of the employment that
qualified the Officer for residency in the development under the plan. The lease also shall provide that the Officer
will move out of the leased unit within a reasonably prompt time, to be established by the lease, after termination
of employment. 


 960.511 

Applicability of the annual contributions contract; effect on the Performance Funding System. 


(a) 

Annual contributions contract. 

Except to the extent that eligibility requirements are exempted under  960.505 of this part, public housing
units occupied by Officers in accordance with a plan submitted and approved under this subpart will be subject to the
terms and conditions of the annual contributions contract (ACC) between the HA and the United States of America. This
subpart does not override any of the terms and conditions of the ACC except insofar as they are inconsistent with the
provisions of this subpart.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule prohibits trappers and hunters from shooting free ranging wolves and wolverines in national wildlife refuges
(refuges) in Alaska on the same day in which the person is airborne, except that trappers may use firearms to dispatch
wolves or wolverines that are legally trapped or snared on the same day in which flying occurred. The prohibition does
not apply to trappers and hunters transported on regularly scheduled commercial flights between public airports.
Hunting and trapping will continue to be allowed on Alaska refuges pursuant to applicable, non-conflicting State
of Alaska (State) and Federal laws and regulations, as specifically authorized by the Alaska National Interest Lands
Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980. Aircraft access to and within Alaska refuges for sport or subsistence hunting,
trapping, fishing and other traditional activities, and for travel to and from villages and homesites will continue
to be allowed subject to reasonable regulations to protect refuge resources and ensure that uses are compatible with
refuge purposes. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The National Wildlife Refuge Administration Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89-669; 16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee) provides
guidelines and directives for the use of the National Wildlife Refuge System and authorizes the Secretary of the Interior
to allow uses within any area of the refuge system provided ``such uses are compatible with the major purposes for which
such areas were established.'' 
In 1980, Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA; Pub. L. 96-487) which
established new, and added to existing, national wildlife refuges in Alaska. Sections 302 and 303 of ANILCA established
purposes for which each refuge shall be managed. Section 304 of ANILCA prohibits the Secretary, subject to valid existing
rights, from permitting any use for any purpose unless such use or purpose is compatible with the purposes of the refuge.
Section 304 also requires the Secretary to prescribe such regulations and impose such terms and conditions as may
be necessary and appropriate to ensure that activities carried out under any use granted under any authority are so
compatible. Section 1110 of ANILCA directs the Secretary to permit use of airplanes on Alaska refuges for traditional
activities and that such access shall be subject to reasonable regulation to protect the natural and other values
of the refuge. The intent of Congress to allow hunting and trapping on Alaska refuges is reflected in the special regulations
for Alaska National Wildlife Refuges contained in Title 50, Part 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). 
In 1992, after many years of controversy, the State prohibited the land and shoot method of taking wolves by making
it illegal to shoot a wolf until 3:00 a.m. on the day following the day the hunter or trapper was airborne (i.e., ``same-day-airborne''
prohibition). Prohibition of taking wildlife during the same-day-airborne allows adequate access to wildlife
resources but prevents abuses that could result from hunters or trappers being able to spot and drive or track wildlife
from the air and then land and immediately shoot the animal. However, in July 1993, the Alaska Board of Game (Board)
reconsidered the same-day-airborne prohibition and adopted a new regulation that allows trappers to shoot wolves
and certain other furbearers the same-day-airborne. The new State trapping regulation is more restrictive than
the pre-1992 land and shoot allowances in that it requires the trapper to be at least 300 feet from the airplane before
shooting the furbearer. As of October 1, 1993, any person who purchases a trapping license can shoot free ranging wolves
same-day-airborne if at least 300 feet from the airplane. State hunting regulations continue to prohibit hunters
from shooting wolves and wolverines until 3:00 a.m. on the day after the hunter flew. 
In response to the State's regulation, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 on December 22, 1993, which is intended to accomplish the following: 
1. Prohibit same-day-airborne taking of wolves and wolverines with firearms except that trappers could use firearms
to dispatch legally caught wolves or wolverines in a trap or snare on the same-day-airborne, and this prohibition
would not apply to people transported on regularly scheduled commercial airlines between public airports; 
2. Satisfy legal mandates to provide for hunting and trapping on Alaska refuges and adequately provide for aircraft
access to refuge resources; 
3. Maintain compatibility between hunting and trapping and legislative purposes, the mission of the National Wildlife
Refuge System, and established Service policies; and 
4. Provide more effective enforcement of hunting and trapping laws and regulations.

The proposed rule had a 60-day public comment period and public hearings were held in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska.




Summary of Public Comments 


Twenty-four persons presented oral comments at public hearings in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska. The Service
also received approximately 2100 letters and cards from the public commenting specifically on the proposed rule.
The Service also received several hundred letters that do not specifically address the proposed rule, but express
concerns related to same-day-airborne or land and shoot taking of wolves. The Service also considered comments received
from the Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils and the administrative record of those Council meetings where the
issue of same-day-airborne taking of wolves was addressed. After considering all public comments, the Service has
decided to proceed with this final rule and found no compelling reason to change the regulatory language from that
provided in the proposed rule. 


Analysis of Public Comments 


(a) Opinions of the Alaska Public not Seriously Considered 


Several commenters, who objected to the proposed regulation, expressed their belief that the Service ignores opinions
of Alaska residents and inappropriately relies on ``Lower 48'' opinions. 
The Service considered all public opinions and views on the proposed rule and did not disregard opinions of Alaskan
residents. In fact, the Service provided special attention to comments and concerns received from Alaskans. Comments
from Alaskan residents were mixed, but the majority of Alaskans apparently do not support same-day-airborne shooting
of wolves. A 1992 public opinion survey of Alaskans (by Dittman Research Corporation) indicated that 66 percent of
the survey participants felt that the public should not be allowed to shoot wolves that are located with use of aircraft.
The proposed rule received strong support from several individuals and organizations associated with the Alaska
tourism industry who objected to allowing same-day-airborne shooting of wolves and noted that it portrays a bad image
of Alaskans. 


(b) Support of the Proposed Regulations or Stronger or Broader Provisions to Extend Prohibition to Other Areas or
Other Species 


The Service received over 2100 public comments in direct response to the proposed rule. The Service and the Department
of Interior also received, and continue to receive, several hundred other letters expressing opposition to same-day-airborne
taking of wolves and requesting action to prohibit such activities. The overwhelming majority of the comments supported
the proposed regulation. Numerous commenters also stated their preference for stronger or broader regulations
against same-day-airborne methods of taking wildlife. Many people advocated elimination of all hunting and trapping
of wolves and many others advocated extending the applicability of same-day-airborne shooting prohibitions to
other species and/or other areas. 
Adoption of this final rule does not foreclose additional regulatory measures by the Service to address same-day-airborne
shooting of wildlife in areas outside the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Service has the authority to take such
action pursuant to the Airborne Hunting Act if warranted. The Service acknowledges some of the justification or rationale
for prohibiting same-day-airborne take of wolves and wolverines would apply to other wildlife species as well. In
fact, the Service strongly considered extending the same-day-airborne prohibitions to other game and furbearer
species. However, in order to minimize the preemptive effect of this regulation on traditional State management
authorities and responsibilities, the Service limited applicability to the species most subjected or most vulnerable
to the problems associated with same-day-airborne take. Wolves and wolverines receive relatively high interest
and demand by hunters and trappers who use airplanes in Alaska, from both a recreational standpoint as a game species
and from an economic standpoint as furbearers that generally bring a good price for their furs. Other species not already
protected by State same-day-airborne regulations are far less vulnerable to abuse of same-day-airborne methods
and/or less desirable to hunters and trappers who use airplanes. Therefore, the Service decided that there was not
sufficient justification to include other species. 
Several commenters who supported the proposed rule requested emergency closure actions to immediately eliminate
such activities on refuges. Emergency closure authority is generally limited to more immediate threats or problems.
The same-day-airborne shooting of wolves involves long-term and chronic problems, but poses no immediate threat
to wolf populations or other Alaska refuge resources. 


(c) Non-Compliance With Access Provisions of Section 1110 of ANILCA 


Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed rule violates access provisions in Section 1110 of ANILCA
and applicable regulations (43 CFR 36.11) and that the Service did not comply with administrative procedures for
restricting access. Section 1110 of ANILCA permits use of airplanes on Alaska refuges for traditional activities
(subject to reasonable regulations to protect natural and other values) and provides that such access may only be
closed by the Service following a determination that such access is detrimental to refuge resource values.

The regulation does not restrict aircraft access to or within national wildlife refuges. Aircraft access to and within
Alaska refuges for hunting, trapping, fishing and other traditional activities will continue to be allowed. It provides
reasonable restriction against shooting free ranging wolves and wolverines immediately after a person has flown
in an aircraft, as necessary to alleviate law enforcement problems and protect values associated with ethical and
fair chase standards. These regulations are not solely dependent on a determination that same-day-airborne hunting
or trapping is detrimental to wolf populations. Even if construed as an access restriction, the Service believes
the same-day-airborne prohibition is a reasonable regulation needed to protect natural and other values of Alaska
refuges. The Service reviewed the administrative procedures related to the promulgation of these regulations and
determined the process used does fulfill the legal public participation and closure requirements (50 CFR 36.42)
related to the restriction of an otherwise allowed activity. 



(d) Legal Authority to Regulate the Taking of Fish and Wildlife 


The most prevalent objection to the proposed rule involved the Service's authority to regulate methods and means
of harvesting resident game species. The State of Alaska and many Alaskans argued the sole authority to regulate hunting
and trapping of resident wildlife in Alaska rests with the State. As such, they claimed the proposed rule constitutes
an unauthorized and unwarranted extension of Federal jurisdiction that intrudes into the State's responsibilities
to manage resident fish and wildlife. Associated arguments were presented that the proposed regulations violate
Section 1314 of ANILCA by attempting to regulate harvest methods and contradicts Department of the Interior policy
concerning State and Federal relationships, and the Master Memorandum of Understanding between the Alaska Department
of Fish and Game and the Service.

Our review found that the regulation is in compliance with Section 1314 of ANILCA and there is ample legal precedent
supporting the Service's authority to regulate uses on national wildlife refuges as needed to ensure compatibility
with refuge purposes and legal mandates, and to protect refuge resources and other values. Section 1314 of ANILCA
does not diminish this authority. 

The Service remains committed to administering our mandates and responsibilities in a way that avoids unnecessary
interference with the State of Alaska's ability to manage resident wildlife. However, the Service feels the regulation
is needed because the State's revised regulation authorizing same-day-airborne shooting of wolves allows, and
even invites, excessive reliance on aircraft to pursue and take wolves, which inevitably results in abuse and violations
of the Airborne Hunting Act and exacerbates enforcement problems. The significant diversion of resource management
funds needed to reasonably ensure compliance with the Airborne Hunting Act and other applicable laws and regulations,
when State regulations allow same-day-airborne shooting of wolves, contravenes the Refuge Recreation Act. Though
airplanes serve an important role as a vehicle for access in Alaska, it is evident from public comments received that
most of the American public objects to the heavy and direct reliance on aircraft to locate and take wolves, and strongly
supports prohibition of such activities on refuge lands. The Service repeatedly advised the State of our concerns
and initiated promulgation of these regulations only after the State failed to adequately address Service concerns.




(e) The Proposed Rule Is Not Based on a Biological Problem 



Many commenters stated that there is not a biological basis for the regulations since wolf and wolverine populations
in Alaska are healthy; these species are managed by the State to ensure continued viability of populations; Service
concerns about impacts to the species are speculative; and there is no data to indicate that same-day-airborne shooting
of wolves constitutes a threat to wolf populations in Alaska. 

The need for this regulation is not based on immediate threats to wolf or wolverine populations on Alaskan refuges.
The Service does not expect a significant increase in the legal harvest of wolves to result from the State regulatory
allowance for same-day-airborne shooting of wolves. Only a very small portion of Alaskans participate in or benefit
from whatever same-day-airborne wolf hunting and trapping opportunities the State allows. The Service is more concerned
about the associated enforcement problems that will provide additional incentive and opportunity for illegal harvests
and ethical problems. Furthermore, there is potential for localized impacts on refuge wolf populations, if trappers
or hunters are allowed and it becomes more popular to shoot wolves the same-day-airborne. 

State officials indicated that same-day-airborne shooting of wolves is not intended to manage or control wolf populations,
but only to provide harvest opportunity. Thus there is no biological or resource management need to allow such activities.
In deciding to proceed with this regulation, the Service found, after consideration of all substantive public comment,
that all problems associated with same-day-airborne shooting of wolves far outweigh the limited benefits or additional
opportunity it provides, particularly when there is no biological or management need to continue such practices.

(f) Law Enforcement Concerns and Justification are Speculative and Misleading 



Several commenters expressed their belief that the Service's concerns related to law enforcement problems were
unfounded or exaggerated and that the regulations would mislead or confuse hunters who are trying to comply with State
regulations. 

The Service's law enforcement concerns and justifications are based on professional opinions and extensive experiences
of Service law enforcement agents in Alaska. Testimony provided by defendants during cases involving prosecution
for violations of the Airborne Hunting Act corroborate the Service's law enforcement concerns. 

In addition, the Service's law enforcement concerns and justifications for the proposed rule were reinforced by
comments received from some Alaskan residents who have personally witnessed or observed that same-day-airborne
take commonly entails abusive and illegal practices of chasing, herding and harassing wolves with airplanes. Some
wolf hunters and aircraft owners/operators indicated that it is all but impossible or rare to take wolves same-day-airborne
without violating the Airborne Hunting Act. Some commenters made the point that the only effective means to take wolves
same-day-airborne is to drive a wolf to exhaustion and/or to a place where a hunter can safely land and shoot it.



(g) Ethics and Fair Chase for Hunting Do Not Apply to Trapping 



Some commenters stated same-day-airborne taking of wolves is done under a State trapping license and, therefore,
the practice does not conflict with Service policy in the Refuge Manual or other fair chase principles and ethics associated
with sport hunting. 

Based on the overwhelming majority of comments received, this belief is not shared by the large majority of the public,
including most other sportsmen. The Service does not believe that it should ignore ethical and fair chase considerations
that strongly affect public perceptions of hunting and trapping on refuges. To disregard or fail to consider and respond
to ethical considerations of fair chase and other perceptions and views shared by the majority of the general public
may ultimately jeopardize the future of hunting and trapping opportunities on national wildlife refuges. 

Alaska regulations allow trappers to shoot wolves and other furbearers with firearms or any other legal weapon as
a lawful method of trapping. Thus, a person can shoot wolves with a trapping license as well as with a hunting license.
The Service disagrees with the argument tha
