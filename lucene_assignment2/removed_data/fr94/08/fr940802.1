CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION 





Baby Walkers; Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; Request for Comments and Information 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Consumer Product Safety Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Based on currently available information, the Commission 
has reason to believe that unreasonable risks of injury and death 
may be associated with baby walkers. The Commission knows of 11 
deaths involving baby walkers since January 1989. One of these 
deaths involved a failure of the walker's seat. In the others, 
the walker may have provided the child with the mobility to 
access the hazard. In 1993, there were approximately 25,000 baby 
walker-related injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms in 
the United States. 


The rate of walker-related injuries has increased 
significantly over the period 1984-1993. Almost all of the 
injuries during that period involved children under 15 months of 
age. About 79 percent of the incidents involved children who fell 
down stairs or between levels in a baby walker. Other injuries 
occurred when a walker tipped over or from burns when a child in 
a walker contacted a hot oven, heater, or radiator or when a 
child upset a container of hot liquid that the child was able to 
reach because he or she was supported by a walker. 
This advance notice of proposed rulemaking (``ANPR'') 
initiates a rulemaking proceeding under the authority of the 
Federal Hazardous Substances Act (``FHSA''). One result of the 
proceeding could be the promulgation of a rule mandating 
performance or design requirements or additional labeling for 
baby walkers. Such requirements might, for example, result in 
walkers that are less mobile, that will not pass through standard 
door openings at the head of stairs, or that will be immobilized 
if part of the walker crosses the edge of a step. If there is no 
feasible performance or design requirement that will adequately 
reduce the risks associated with baby walkers, the Commission can 
consider other alternatives. 
The Commission solicits written comments from interested 
persons concerning the risks of injury and death associated with 
baby walkers, the regulatory alternatives discussed in this 
notice, other possible means to address these risks, and the 
economic impacts of the various regulatory alternatives. The 
Commission also invites interested persons to submit an existing 
standard, or a statement of intent to modify or develop a 
voluntary standard, to address the risks of injury described in 
this notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


For the reasons discussed in this notice, the U. S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission (``CPSC'' or ``Commission'') is 
beginning a rulemaking proceeding to address risks associated 
with baby walkers.
 A baby walker is a device that supports a 
child so that the child can use its feet to move around before or 
while learning to walk. A baby walker generally consists of a 
fabric seat with leg openings mounted to a rigid plastic deck. 
The deck is attached to a base that usually has wheels to make it 
mobile. Walkers generally can be folded for storage, and may have 
a feeding tray, adjustable seat height, and a bouncing mechanism. 
Activity toys may be attached to the trays, and some walkers have 
wheel lock mechanisms. 




The Commission has long recognized that hazards are 
associated with baby walkers. The Commission's regulations 
establish mandatory requirements for ``baby walkers,'' ``baby 
bouncers,'' and ``bouncer-walkers.'' These products are banned under 
16 CFR 1500.18(a)(6) unless they meet the criteria described in 
16 CFR 1500.86 (a)(4). These criteria specify that baby walkers 
must be designed to prevent injury from any scissoring, shearing, 
or pinching when the frame or other components rotate or move 
relative to one another; cover coil springs that have spaces 
greater than 0.125 inches when fully extended; guard any holes, 
slots, or cracks greater than 0.125 inches in diameter or width; 
and prevent accidental collapse. The product also must be labeled 
with the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, 
distributor, or seller and with a code mark indicating the model 
number of the walker. 
In 1986, a voluntary standard (ASTM F977) was published 
which contains performance requirements addressing some of the 
baby walker hazards addressed by the CPSC mandatory standard. In 
addition, the voluntary standard included six warnings that 
address the risk of falls down stairs and other hazards. In 1989, 
the ASTM voluntary standard was changed to require a permanent 
stairs-warning label in a place that will be seen by the consumer 
when placing a child in a walker. This new label states, 
``WARNING: Avoid serious injury. NEVER use near stairs.''

The Commission's staff has recommended revisions to the 
current ASTM warning labels, including a warning label to tell 
consumers to block stairway openings, rather than to tell them 
never to use walkers near stairs. The staff also suggested that 
the stair warning label be redesigned according to the ANSI 
Z535.4-1991 Standard for Product Safety Signs and Labels. In 
addition, the staff suggested that the ASTM baby walker standard 
state specifically several options of where the stair warning 
label should be placed to assure that it is conspicuous. 
As the Commission's staff continued to monitor data 
submitted from hospital emergency rooms through the National 
Electronic Injury Surveillance System (``NEISS''), it became 
apparent that falls down stairs were a major cause of injuries 
associated with baby walkers. While the staff was considering 
what action to recommend for this hazard, the Commission was 
petitioned, in August of 1992, to ban wheeled baby walkers. The 
petitioners were the Consumer Federation of America (``CFA''), the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, the Washington Chapter of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Safe Kids Campaign, 
and Consumers Union. The petition asked that the Commission 
declare baby walkers to be a mechanical hazard under the FHSA. As 
discussed in section G of this notice, such a declaration would 
ban the product. 
After considering the available information on deaths and 
injuries associated with walkers, and other available 
information, the Commission unanimously voted to deny the 
petition on April 15, 1993.
 The petition was denied because the 
available information did not establish a reasonable probability 
that the Commission would be able to make the necessary statutory 
findings if a rulemaking proceeding were commenced at that time. 
It appeared that several potential design modifications to 
existing baby walkers were feasible to address the major hazard 
scenario with walkers_that of falls down stairs. These 
modifications included a device without wheels with a treadmill 
to simulate walking, a walker with a ``wheel-stop'' mechanism 
(which would resist motion of the walker if a wheel or feeler 
went over the edge of a step), or a walker that is too wide to 
fit through most door openings at the top of stairs. Given these 
possible alternatives to a total ban, the Commission could not 
conclude that it would likely be able to make the requisite 
statutory finding that the requested total ban was the least 
burdensome alternative that would adequately reduce the risks 
from baby walkers. In addition, not enough was known about the 
costs and benefits of a total ban to conclude that the Commission 
would likely be able to make the statutory findings that the ban 
was reasonably necessary to reduce an unreasonable risk of injury 
and that the benefits of the ban would bear a reasonable 
relationship to its costs. 




Although the Commission denied the petition for a total 
ban, at the same time it directed the staff to develop a proposed 
project that would produce recommendations to address the hazards 
associated with baby walkers.
 Shortly thereafter, the Commission 
approved a project to determine the feasibility of developing a 
standard to effectively reduce the risk of injury associated with 
baby walkers, particularly the risk of falling down stairs. The 
project included a special study of emergency-room-treated 
injuries related to walkers that were reported through NEISS. 
This data-gathering activity is discussed in section D of this 
notice. 




During fiscal year 1993, the Commission's Office of 
Compliance and Enforcement conducted a field program to assess 
the compliance level of certain juvenile products with the 
mandatory small parts regulations (Juvenile Products Small Parts 
Compliance Survey, FPC 93-010). Baby walkers were one of the 
products included in the survey. As part of the survey, baby 
walkers were also screened for compliance with the mandatory 
requirements regarding scissoring, shearing, and pinching (16 CFR 
1500.86(a)(4)), and for conformance with the warning label 
requirements in the voluntary standard (ASTM F977-89). The survey 
covered 74 major juvenile product manufacturers or importers that 
were randomly selected for inspection. Eleven of these firms 
manufactured or imported baby walkers. Thirty-four styles of baby 
walkers were screened. All walkers complied with the mandatory 
requirements regarding scissoring, shearing, and pinching, and 
all but two styles of one manufacturer conformed with the 
voluntary labeling requirements. This manufacturer agreed to 
label its current inventory and future production. 
A status report on the baby walker project was submitted to 
the Commission in June 1994. After considering the status report, 
the Commission decided to commence a rulemaking proceeding by 
publishing this ANPR. 


B. The Product 


The products that are the subject of this proceeding are 
baby walkers, as described in section A of this notice. The 
Commission's staff does not expect this proceeding to result in 
additional features to prevent falls down stairs for stationary 
walkers and other walkers which a young child cannot move. 
However, performance requirements may have to be developed to 
determine which walkers have the requisite degree of immobility. 
Most traditional walkers range in price from $25 to $60, 
with the average price about $32. The Commission's staff 
estimates that there were approximately 4 million new and used 
walkers in use in the U.S. in 1991. Consumers spend about $115 
million per year on baby walkers. This represents sales of at 
least 3 million units. 
Staff has conducted a number of interviews of caregivers in 
connection with the ongoing baby walker project. Caregivers were 
asked to evaluate the most useful functions of walkers. 
Caregivers believed most often that the walker, ``Keeps the child 
happy or quiet,'' ``Helps the child exercise,'' ``Gives the child 
freedom and independence,'' and ``Is a place to put the child while 
the caregiver is occupied.''

Sixty-two percent of the parents in the follow-up 
investigations reported that the child used the walker more than 
once a day. For each use, 37 percent reported that the child 
typically was in the walker for less than 30 minutes; 45 percent 
reported that for each use the child typically was in the walker 
for about 30-60 minutes. 


C. The Industry 


The Commission knows of 18 manufacturers or importers of 
baby walkers and jumpers. The leading manufacturer sells several 
times as many walkers as the next largest, and the top 9 brands 
or private labels are thought to account for about 60 percent of 
the market. 


D. Risks of Injury and Death 




Deaths.

 The Commission is aware of 11 deaths related to 
baby walkers that have occurred between 1989 and 1993. Of these, 
four children drowned, four suffocated, two fell down stairs, and 
one fell out of a walker and received a fatal head injury. In one 
of these incidents, the seat loosened, allowing the child to slip 
downward and suffocate when his trachea was compressed against 
the walker's tray. In all the other incidents, the walker may 
have provided the child with the mobility to access the hazard. 
The deaths reported to CPSC are not statistically 
representative, and may not include all the deaths associated 
with baby walkers during this time period. Also, with the 
exception of 1991, CPSC received death certificates from deaths 
classified as ``falls'' from only one or two states. Thus, the 
number of fall-related baby walker deaths known to CPSC is 
probably an undercount. 


Injuries.

 In 1993, there were an estimated 25,000 baby 
walker-related injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms in 
the United States. Baby walkers account for higher numbers of 
injuries annually than does any other type of nursery product. 
For example, in 1991, there were an estimated 10,400 injuries 
related to strollers and carriages, the nursery product category 
with the next highest number of estimated injuries. 
Based on an estimated 27,000 emergency-room-treated 
injuries to children under 15 months of age in 1991 and an 
estimated 4 million walkers in use, the estimated annual rate of 
injury is 6.75 injuries per 1,000 walkers in use. The most 
current data show a 12 percent increase in baby walker-related 
injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms for January through 
April 1994, compared to the same period in 1993.

In order to find out more about how baby walker injuries 
are occurring, the Commission's staff is identifying a sample of 
300-400 cases through NEISS for the period beginning August 15, 
1993, with data collection to continue through September 1994. 
These cases are being followed up by telephone to obtain 
additional information about the incident. In addition, incidents 
involving falls down stairs or steps, and other incidents where 
more detail is needed, are being assigned for on-site 
investigations. The data collected through February 1994 have 
been analyzed and are discussed below. 
Of the baby walker incidents reported through NEISS between 
August 15, 1993, and February 1994, 79 percent were falls down 
stairs or between levels. About half of the stair fall incidents 
involved a fall down basement stairs. About 3 percent of the 
incidents were due to walker tipovers, 3 percent to burns, and 15 
percent to other hazard patterns (for instance, babies hitting 
their heads on walker trays, climbing on walkers, etc.). In about 
10 percent of all baby walker incidents, another child appeared 
to be directly involved in causing the accident. In stair fall 
incidents, approximately 5 percent involved other children. 
The ages of the children injured ranged from 4 months to 2 
years, with a median age of 8 months. About 95 percent of the 
victims were 15 months of age or younger. 


Severity of injury.

 The majority of children involved in 
baby walker incidents (75 percent) received injuries classified 
as ``less severe,'' even though the head and face were often the 
injured body parts. Less severe injuries include lacerations, 
contusions, abrasions, hematomas, dental injuries, punctures, and 
strains or sprains. 
About one-fourth of the children (23 percent) received 
injuries classified as potentially ``more severe,'' such as 
concussions, burns, fractures, and internal organ injuries. 
Incidents that resulted in severe injuries occurred even when 
parents were in the same room or area as the child in the walker. 
The majority of potentially severe injuries were head injuries 
resulting from children in walkers falling down a flight of 
basement stairs onto either a covered or uncovered cement floor. 
The remaining potentially severe injuries were burns and limb 
fractures. The injuries were of varying severity, ranging from 
children who were treated and released to injuries that resulted 
in hospitalizations up to 7 days. At the time of the telephone 
investigations, all of the 128 parents contacted through February 
1994 reported that the children had ``fully recovered.'' 
In 1991, the proportion of ``more severe'' to ``less severe'' 
injuries related to walkers was similar to that of cribs, high 
chairs, playpens, and changing tables. There was a significantly 
higher proportion of ``more severe'' injuries related to baby 
walkers than to strollers and carriages. 
During 1991, 7 percent of the children involved in walker- 
related incidents were hospitalized for observation or more 
extensive treatment. There were no significant differences 
between the proportions of hospitalizations to non- 
hospitalizations for baby walkers and cribs, high chairs, 
playpens, and changing tables. There was a significantly higher 
proportion of hospitalizations related to baby walkers than for 
strollers and carriages. 
The mechanism of general stair-related injuries differs in 
some respects from the mechanism of stair-related injuries 
involving baby walkers. Falls down stairs without walkers involve 
a series of impacts; an initial mild to severe impact, followed 
by a series of mild impacts (tumbling). The bouncing of a walker 
down steps, however, may result in an initial backward thrust of 
the head as the walker descends down the steps followed by a 
forward head thrust. One author suggests that ``[s]uch a sequence 
could add additional impact energy and thus more severe injury.'' 
(DiMario F: Chronic Subdural Hematoma_Another Babywalker-Stairs 
Related Injury. Clinical Pediatrics 1990; 29:405-8.) 


E. Other Factors Related to Baby Walker Incidents 




Step falls and doorway width.

 For the stair or step fall 
incidents, 82 percent of the respondents who agreed to take 
measurements reported the width of the narrowest dimension of the 
opening at the top of the stairs or step as 36 inches or less 
(approximately the size of a normal door opening). 


Supervision of the Child and Precautions Taken.

 At the time 
of the incident, about half of the caregivers were in the same 
room or area as the child in the walker. For those caregivers who 
were in the same room or area with the child when the incident 
happened, 43 percent reported that they witnessed the incident. 
Some parents who did not witness the incident said they had 
looked away momentarily or were distracted by another child when 
the incident occurred. In some incidents where the caregivers 
were in another room or area than the child in the walker at the 
time of the incident, the child was in the caregiver's view. 
Over half of the respondents (61 percent) for the stair and 
step fall incidents reported a closed door, gate, or some other 
barrier in use prior to, or around, the time of walker use 
(doors-78 percent, gates-16 percent, other barriers-6 percent.) 
In 90 percent of the stair and step fall incidents where a 
barrier was in use, the door, gate, or other barrier had been 
moved, left ajar, or not latched properly. Seven percent of the 
respondents for these incidents who reported a gate in use 
suggested that the gate may have failed; this was reported solely 
as ``the walker pushed the gate open.'' Other stair and step fall 
incidents included cases where children bypassed a barrier or 
safety precaution or moved too quickly for a nearby adult to 
prevent the incident. 
Ten percent of the respondents reported a baby walker 
incident prior to the incident in the study. Three percent 
reported a previous stair fall incident. Seventy-six percent of 
the respondents reported using the walker again after an injury 
occurred, including over half of those whose child was diagnosed 
as having a potentially serious injury. For the stair fall 
incidents where the walker was still available, 57 percent of the 
respondents who agreed to look for labeling information reported 
a label with a stair warning.

E. Existing Standards 


As explained in section A of this notice, ASTM has a 
voluntary standard for baby walkers, ASTM F977. This standard has 
performance requirements that address walker tipover and 
structural failure. Falls down stairs are addressed by a warning 
label. The CPSC staff's compliance program, also discussed in 
section A of this notice, indicated a high level of conformance 
with the stair warning label requirement of the voluntary 
standard. 
At this time, ASTM is not considering performance 
requirements to address the hazard of children falling down 
stairs in walkers. ASTM members are waiting for completion of the 
CPSC data collection, discussed above, to determine the 
appropriate direction for any new requirements. 
A voluntary safety standard published by the Canadian 
Juvenile Products Association, effective June 1, 1989, requires 
walkers to be constructed to preclude their passage through a 
simulated door opening 900 mm (35.4 inches) in width. In Canada, 
this standard had the same effect as a ban of the sale of 
walkers. Walker manufacturers apparently believed that the low 
market sales of walkers in Canada (about 150,000 annually as 
compared to 4 million in the U.S.) did not justify redesigning 
their products. However, due to the much larger market in the 
United States, and the fact that this alternative retains much of 
the mobility of a traditional walker, the Commission has no 
reason to believe that a standard similar to the Canadian one 
would eliminate the U.S. market for baby walkers. 


F. Statutory Authority 


The FHSA is the appropriate act for regulating risks 
associated with baby walkers or other articles intended for use 
by children that present a mechanical hazard. 15 
U.S.C. 1261(F)(1)(D). Section 2(s) of the FHSA provides: 



An article may be determined (by rule) to present a 
mechanical hazard if, in normal use or when 
subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or 
abuse, its design or manufacture presents an 
unreasonable risk of personal injury or illness 
. . . (4) from moving parts, (5) from lack or 
insufficiency of controls to reduce or stop motion, 
. . . (8) because of instability, or (9) because of 
any other aspect of the article's design or 
manufacture. 



15 U.S.C. 1261(s). The Commission's current regulations for baby 
walkers were issued under the FHSA. 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(6), 
1500.86(a)(4). 


Section 2(s) of the FHSA provides CPSC with jurisdiction 
over unreasonable risks of children tipping over in walkers, 
being injured by a walker's moving or collapsible parts, or 
falling down stairs in walkers. However, the primary risk 
associated with walkers is that of children falling down stairs. 
The design features that may be implicated by this particular 
risk include, for example, the absence of an effective way to 
limit or stop the product's motion and its ability to fit through 
a standard doorway. 
Declaring that all walkers, or walkers that fail to meet 
specified criteria, are a hazardous substance because they 
present a mechanical hazard would trigger the banning provision 
of FHSA  2(q)(1)(A). This section of the act provides that the 
term ``banned hazardous substance'' includes ``any toy, or other 
article intended for use by children, which is a hazardous 
substance. . . .'' 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(A). 
This proceeding under the FHSA to determine whether baby 
walkers present a mechanical hazard is being conducted under 
sections 3(f)-(i) of the FHSA. This involves a three-stage 
rulemaking, commenced by the publication of this ANPR. 
The next stage in the rulemaking proceeding will be a 
decision either to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking 
(``NPR'') or to terminate the proceeding. If the Commission decides 
to continue the rulemaking proceeding after considering responses 
to the ANPR, the Commission must publish the text of the proposed 
rule, along with a preliminary regulatory analysis, in accordance 
with FHSA section 3(h). 15 U.S.C. 1262(h). If the Commission then 
wishes to issue a final rule, it must publish the text of the 
final rule and a final regulatory analysis that includes the 
elements stated in section 3(i)(1) of the FHSA. 15 U.S.C. 
1262(i)(1). Before the Commission may issue a final regulation, 
it must make statutory findings concerning voluntary standards; 
the relationship of the costs and benefits of the rule; and the 
burden imposed by the regulation. FHSA sec. 3(i)(2), 15 U.S.C. 
1262(i)(2). 


G. Regulatory Alternatives Under Consideration 


The Commission is considering alternatives to reduce the 
number of injuries and deaths related to baby walkers. 
1. Performance or design requirement. For the reasons 
discussed above, it appears possible that a performance or design 
requirement can be developed that will reduce the risk of 
children falling down stairs in baby walkers. The staff is aware 
of the following product designs intended to address the hazard 
of falls down stairs: 
1. Walkers with a diameter larger than the normal door 
opening to prevent access to stairs. 
2. Walkers with a ``wheel-stop'' mechanism. 
3. Walkers with mobility limited to a confined space. 
4. Stationary alternatives. 
The Commission concludes that it is possible to develop a 
performance or design requirement that will allow the use of one 
or more of these designs to address the risk of falls down 
stairs. These alternatives are discussed separately below. 
Wide walkers. The results of the analysis of the current 
CPSC special study indicate that walkers with a 36-inch-diameter 
base theoretically could address 82 percent of the stair and step 
fall incidents, including almost all of the severe incidents 
(falls down basement stairs). A 36-inch requirement would add 
approximately 6 to 10 inches to the diameter of walkers currently 
on the market. There may be a perceived or actual loss of utility 
of such a product in terms of actual use by a child if it will 
not fit between furniture in most households. Also, there would 
be a loss of convenience if the walker is too large for 
convenient storage or for transporting to other locations by car.

<PARENT> FR940802-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If the product is unacceptable to consumers, they may 
choose to purchase used, traditional walkers. In this event, the 
percentage of incidents addressed by a larger diameter walker 
could be significantly less than 82 percent_at least for the 
period of time that used, traditional walkers are available. 
Wheel-Stop Mechanisms. One manufacturer is marketing a 
walker with a wheel-stop mechanism which retails for around $55. 
The consumer can use the wheel-stop mechanism to manually retract 
all eight wheels so that the walker is stationary. Another 
manufacturer marketed a walker with an automatic wheel-stop 
mechanism, which retailed for $60-$80. This product had the 
wheels arranged so that if one wheel passed over a step, a second 
wheel would retract, causing the base ring to drop, grip the 
floor surface, and restrict further mobility of the walker. This 
product was discontinued due to limited sales. 
Products with wheel-stop mechanisms provide all the utility 
and features of a traditional walker. The staff does not know how 
effective passive or automatically retracting wheels can be in 
addressing stair and step fall injuries. 
Walkers with Mobility Limited to a Confined Space. One 
manufacturer plans to introduce a new walker with limited 
mobility in September 1994. This product is expected to retail 
for $80-$90 initially, with a goal of lowering the retail price 
to $69 with a higher sales volume. With this walker, a child can 
walk, clockwise or counter-clockwise, around the circumference of 
a 36 inch stationary base. The child can also rotate the seat 
360
 . 
There is a patent pending on a walker with a pivot point 
and control arm that converts a traditional walker into a 
tethered walker. A child can travel in a circle, clockwise or 
counterclockwise, around the weighted central pivot point. The 
control arm can be adjusted to increase or decrease the 
circumference of the walker's path. 
Stationary Alternatives. A nonmobile product is being 
marketed that retails for around $50. This product has a 28-inch 
diameter saucer base and a seat that the child can bounce up and 
down and rotate 360
 . Three legs can be lowered to stop the 
rocking motion. 
Another nonmobile product is marketed that retails for 
around $70. This product has a seat that the child can bounce up 
and down and rotate 360
 . 
Theoretically, walkers with limited mobility or stationary 
alternative products could address almost all deaths and injuries 
associated with walkers. With restricted mobility, a child would 
not have access to stairs, steps, hot surfaces, uneven floor 
surfaces, or other hazards. However, mobility is a unique 
characteristic of a walker that is attractive to consumers and 
toddlers. Sales of traditional mobile walkers have always 
substantially exceeded sales of stationary products such as 
jumpers and bouncers. 
The staff does not know whether stationary alternative 
products or walkers with limited mobility can provide levels of 
stimulation comparable to mobile walkers. If such products are 
unacceptable to consumers, they may choose to purchase used 
traditional walkers. In this event, the percentage of incidents 
addressed could be significantly less than expected_at least 
for the period of time that used traditional walkers are 
available. 
2. Labeling and instructions. Another alternative is 
labeling the product to warn against its hazards and providing 
information on the risks in the product's instructions. The 
Commission's staff is working with members of the ASTM Section 
for Infant Walkers to revise the current labeling on baby 
walkers. However, labeling and instructions alone are not likely 
to adequately reduce the risk and should be used in conjunction 
with product modifications, where possible. 
3. Voluntary standards. As noted above, there is no 
voluntary standard in existence that would adequately reduce the 
risk of injury from stair falls in walkers. Even if a voluntary 
standard were developed, the Commission has no basis for 
concluding that the standard would be conformed with generally by 
walker manufacturers. 


H. Solicitation of Information and Comments 


This ANPR is the first step of a proceeding which could 
result in a mandatory performance, design, or labeling 
requirement for baby walkers that present an unreasonable risk of 
falling down stairs. 
All interested persons are invited to submit to the 
Commission their comments on any aspect of the alternatives 
discussed above. The Commission is interested in any information

Custody of Investment Company Assets With Futures Commission Merchants and Commodity Clearing Organizations_Extension
of Comment Period


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule and request for comment; extension of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission is extending from August 1, 1994 to September 30, 1994 the comment period for Investment Company Release
No. 20313, which proposed rule 17f-6 under the Investment Company Act of 1940.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On May 24, 1994, the Commission issued Investment Company Act Release No. 20313 [59 FR 28286 (June 1, 1994)] (``Release
No. 20313''), which proposed rule 17f-6 [17 CFR 270.17f-6] under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15
U.S.C. 80a]. The proposed rule would permit registered management investment companies to use futures commission
merchants and commodity clearing organizations as custodians of their assets in connection with futures contracts
and commodity options regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 1-25].


Since Release No. 20313 was issued, the Commission has received a request from an interested person for an extension
of the comment period. In light of the importance of the safekeeping of investment company assets and the benefit to
the Commission of receiving carefully considered comments, the Commission believes a 60-day extension is appropriate.
The comment period for responding to Release No. 20313 is extended to September 30, 1994.



Dated: July 28, 1994.

Substituted Triazine Isocyanurate; Revocation of a Significant New Use Rule 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to revoke a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances
Control Act (TSCA) for substituted triazine isocyanurate based on receipt of new data. The data indicate that, for
purposes of section 5 of TSCA, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk to the environment. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 9, 1990 (55 FR 32406), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for substituted triazine isocyanurate.
Because of additional data EPA has received for this substance, EPA is proposing to revoke this SNUR. 


I. Proposed Revocation 


EPA is proposing to revoke the significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for substituted triazine isocyanurate
under 40 CFR part 721 subpart E. In this unit, EPA provides a brief description for the substance, including its PMN
number, chemical name (generic name if the specific name is claimed as CBI), CAS number (if assigned), basis for the
revocation of the section 5(e) consent order for the substance, and the CFR citation removed in the regulatory text
section of this proposed rule. Further background information for the substance is contained in the rulemaking record
referenced in Unit IV. of this preamble. 


PMN Number P-86-66 




Chemical name:

 (generic) Substituted triazine isocyanurate. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Effective date of revocation of section 5(e) consent order:

 December 13, 1993. 


Basis for revocation of section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was revoked based on test data submitted under the terms of the consent order. Based on the Agency's analysis
of the submitted data, EPA has sufficient information to determine for purposes of TSCA section 5, that the manufacture,
processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the PMN substance will not present an unreasonable risk
to the human health. Accordingly, EPA has determined that further regulation under section 5(e) is not warranted
at this time. 


Toxicity testing results:

 An acute oral gavage study of rats with a 14-day observation and neurotoxicity functional observational battery
demonstrated a no observed adverse effect level of 1,000 mg/kg and a low observed adverse effect level of 2,000 mg/kg
for decreased forelimb and hindlimb grip strength. 


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.9760. 


II. Objectives and Rationale for Proposed Revocation of the Rule 


During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this proposed revocation, EPA
concluded that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient
to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance, and that the substance may present an unreasonable
risk of injury to human health. EPA identified the tests considered necessary to make a reasoned evaluation of the
risks posed by the substance to human health. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated
with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated. EPA reviewed testing which was conducted by the PMN submitter pursuant
to the 5(e) consent order for the substance and determined that the information available was sufficient to make a
reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance. EPA concluded that, for the purposes of TSCA section 5,
the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and consequently revoked the section 5(e) consent order. The
proposed revocation of SNUR provisions for the substance designated herein is consistent with the revocation of
the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is proposing a revocation of SNUR provisions for this chemical substance.
EPA will no longer require notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process this substance. In addition,
export notification under section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required. 




III. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information 


Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other
appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public
file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party
submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a public version of the comments that EPA can
place in the public file. 


IV. Rulemaking Record 


The record for the rule which EPA is proposing to revoke was established at OPPTS-50583 (P-86-66).
This record includes information considered by the Agency in developing the rule and includes the test data that formed
the basis for this proposal.



V. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


EPA is proposing to revoke the requirements of the rule. Any costs or burdens associated with the rule will also be eliminated
when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866,
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).

Grants for Research Projects



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposes to revise regulations governing Public Health Service (PHS) grants
for research projects to: accommodate changes necessitated by enactment of various statutes governing research
project grant programs administered by the PHS; update references to statutes and regulations; and cover all research
project grant programs administered by the PHS, so the regulations will not have to be amended each time a new research
project grant program is established by statute or administrative action.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The regulations at 42 CFR part 52 governing PHS grants for research projects were last amended on September 27, 1984
(49 FR 38110). Since the, Congress has enacted a number of statutes establishing research grant programs similar
to those listed in  52.1 of the regulation. In the past, new statutory authority would have been implemented
by adding the new programs to the list of programs in  52.1.




However, after considering the long list of programs to be added and the very limited number of substantive changes
necessitated by the new statues, we have decided to propose deletion of the listing of research project grant programs
in  52.1, and references to that listing in other sections. The regulations would be amended to apply to all research
project grant programs administered by the PHS. Thus, it will not be necessary to include a long list of programs in
the regulations or to go through the lengthy process of amending the regulations in order for them to apply to a newly
established program.

The PHS and/or its components that award research project grants will, as stated in proposed  52.1, periodically
publish a list of all the research project grant programs to which the regulations apply and the applicability of the
regulations to new programs will be announced as PHS components initiate those programs. Under  52.1, the regulations
clearly apply to all research project grants administered by the PHS; thus, the lists described above are provided
for the convenience of interested members of the public, rather than serving as a substantive notice of the applicability
of the regulations. A list of the current research project grant authorities implemented by the regulations follows:

(1) Research into the cause, diagnosis, treatment, control, or prevention of the physical or mental diseases, injuries,
or impairments to human life, as authorized by sections 301 and 303 related provisions of the Public Health Service

In addition to the actions noted above, NIH proposes to limit the citation of authority for issuance of the regulations
to the Secretary's general statutory authority for the issuance of regulations set forth in section 215 of the PHS
Act, rather than citing the statutory authority for each research project grant program. The latter provisions do
not require or explicitly authorize the issuance of regulations and thus 1 CFR part 21, subpart B, does not require
inclusion of those statutes in the authority citation. It is also proposed to make minor changes required by new statutory
authority, simplify the language in   52.2-4 and 52.6, update PHS Act section numbers referenced
in part 52 as necessitated by enactment of legislation, and update the listing of HHS policies and regulations in  52.8.
The purpose of this notice is to invite public comment on these proposed changes. The following statements are provided
for the information of the public.



Regulatory Impact Statement



The Secretary has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory
Planning and Review, and has determined that it will not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs,
the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the
budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in Executive Order No. 12866. Therefore, the Secretary has determined that the proposed rule
does not require: (1) An assessment of benefits anticipated from the proposed amendments; (2) an assessment of costs
anticipated from the proposed amendments; or (3) an assessment of costs and benefits of potentially effective and
reasonably feasible alternative to the proposed amendments.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



Because of the nonsubstantive nature of the proposed amendments, the Secretary certifies that the proposed regulations
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and therefore, a regulatory
flexibility analysis, as defined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. chapter 6), is not required.



Paperwork Reduction Act



The proposed regulations do not contain information collection requirements subject to review and approval by the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).

Central Valley Project_Purposes, Uses, and Allocation of Water Supplies



AGENCIES: 

Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Fish and Wildlife Service.




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Announcement of public meetings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) intend to assess the need
for rules and regulations addressing implementation of certain provisions of the Central Valley Project Improvement
Act (the Act). The Act applies to the Central Valley Project (CVP), California, and to the use and allocation of CVP
water.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Act provides for a number of changes in the purposes and operation of the CVP, and in the use and allocation of CVP
water. Subsection 3408(a) of the Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate ``* * *
such regulations * * * as may be necessary to implement the intent, purposes, and provisions * * *''
of the Act. Reclamation and the Service have been authorized by the Secretary to act on his behalf in implementing the
Act.





Reclamation and the Service have tentatively concluded that the following provisions of the Act should be considered
for rulemaking:






Public comment is invited on the questions of: (1) whether there are appropriate provisions of the Act to address through
rulemaking, and (2) whether there are other provisions of the Act that should be addressed. The comments received
will be evaluated as part of the process for finally determining which provisions of the Act to address in rulemaking
actions.

The development of any proposed rules and regulations shall be scheduled to benefit from ongoing analyses in the Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) which is being prepared pursuant to Section 3409 of the Act. To the extent,
if any, that the rulemaking requires compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), such compliance
will be coordinated with processes associated with completion and issuance of the PEIS and through such other NEPA
compliance activities, if any, as may need to be completed subsequent to the finalization of the PEIS. Any final rulemaking
documentation shall occur no earlier than the preparation and dissemination of the Record of Decision associated
with the PEIS to fully encompass and ensure benefits from all aspects of this process.

<DOCTITLE>Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Government Supply Sources</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Defense (DoD).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Defense is proposing to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to clarify
its policy concerning contractor payments for materials purchased from Government supply sources.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




A. Background








The DoD Office of the Inspector General issued an audit report on June 3, 1994, (Report No. 94-119, Accounts Receivable
for DoD Material) which addressed problems with contractors which were delinquent in making payments for materials
purchased from the DoD supply system. The proposed rule, which is intended to address the problems identified in the
Inspector General's report, revises the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) at 251.102(e) to require the contracting
officer's authorization for the contractor to purchase from Government supply sources to specifically state the
terms of the purchase; adds 251.105 and revises 252.251-7000(d)(4) to clarify that contractor payments for
such purchases are due within 30 days of the Government's invoice; revises 252.251-7000(d)(4) to clarify that
contractors must pay interest on late payments and that failure to pay may result in loss of the authorization to use
Government supply sources; and adds 252.251-7000(f) to provide for identification of the contractor's billing
and the Government's remittance address.








B. Regulatory Flexibility Act





The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the proposed rule clarifies that the Government
terms for contractor payments for purchases from Government supply sources is the same as the standard commercial
terms of payment in ``net 30 days.'' The rule will only impact those small entities which fail to meet their payment
obligations thereby incurring interest on the overdue amount, which also reflects acceptable commercial practice.







C. Paperwork Reduction Act







The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) does not apply because the proposed rule does not impose any additional
reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
