National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board, Committee on Scientific Evaluation
of WIC Nutrition Risk Criteria; Opportunity To Provide Written Comments, Public Meeting 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Nutrition Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) Institute of Medicine (IOM), through its Food
and Nutrition Board (FNB), will conduct the second of two public meetings to obtain additional perspectives about
the scientific basis for the nutrition risk criteria used in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants,
and Children (WIC). Eligibility for WIC is based in part on nutrition risk. Through a grant from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), the NAS is reviewing the scientific basis for nutrition
risk criteria used in WIC. At the end of the 30-month study, the NAS will publish a report and provide copies to the FNS
containing its findings and recommendations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NAS, through the IOM's FNB, formed the Committee on Scientific Evaluation of WIC Nutrition Risk Criteria (committee)
in October 1993 to examine the scientific basis for determining nutrition risk criteria used in the WIC program. The
WIC program operates through a preventive approach to health care by providing supplemental foods and nutrition
assessment and education to improve nutrition status and thus to improve pregnancy outcome and growth and development
of infants and children (up to 5 years of age). The program links food assistance and health programs by its goal of improving
nutritional status through food delivery and by serving as a gateway to the public health system principally through
Medicaid-delivered health services for pregnant and lactating women, for infants, and for children. Eligibility
for the WIC program is based on income (185 percent of poverty level); status as a pregnant or lactating woman, an infant,
or a child; and nutrition risk. 



Nutrition risk criteria include biochemical and anthropometric measurements, nutritionally related medical
conditions, dietary deficiencies that impair or endanger health, and conditions that predispose persons to inadequate
nutrition patterns or nutritionally related medical conditions. The appropriateness of nutrition risk criteria
is an issue of major interest to the WIC community and of great significance to the future direction of the program.
The committee deliberations will address these issues, thereby providing a basis for establishing appropriate
guidance for nutrition risk criteria used to establish program eligibility. 

The committee will review all WIC nutrition risk factors currently covered by the program. The committee's deliberations
will begin with those risk criteria for which there is substantial scientific literature and move to those for which
there is little or no scientific literature, that are most difficult to quantify, or that are not likely to be affected
by the supplemental food package delivered through the program. The NAS plans to identify gaps in scientific knowledge,
to examine specific segments of the WIC population identified to be at risk for each criterion, and if applicable,
to report its findings regarding how to determine who is at risk for each criterion, including numerical values. 

Public meetings will solicit information from WIC program administrators, staff, and participants as well as from
researchers in the fields related to the nutrition risk criteria under study. Two public meetings are being conducted
during the course of the committee's work, both in 1994. The first public meeting was held at the National Academy of
Sciences, Washington, DC, on May 19, 1994. This second public meeting is scheduled to be held during the third committee
meeting in September 1994 at the NAS west-coast meeting facility_the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center, Irvine, California.
A report of the committee's findings and recommendations will be published by the end of the study in April 1996.

<DOCTITLE>Two Joe Timber Sales; Superior Ranger District, Lolo National Forest; Mineral County, MT; Intent To Prepare Environmental
Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for timber harvesting, prescribed burning,
road access changes, and watershed rehabilitation in a 40,000-acre area near St. Regis, Montana. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The responsible official who will make decisions based on this EIS is Richard P. Kramer, Acting District Ranger, Superior
Ranger District, Box 460, Superior, MT, 59872. He will decide on this proposal after considering comments and responses,
environmental consequences discussed in the Final EIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The decision
and reasons for the decision will be documented in a Record of Decision.



The Forest Service proposes to harvest about 24.3 million board feet of timber from about 2,600 acres (about 2,200
of those acres to be burned after harvest), prescribed-burn about 400 additional acres for ecosystem and big game
habitat improvements, reconstruct about 19.4 miles of road (primarily to mitigate existing water quality/fish
impacts), and add new yearlong road closures to about 21.3 miles of currently open roads. New road construction would
be limited to 0.4 miles of temporary road plus 0.2 miles of permanent road for helicopter landings. The proposed action
also includes some experimental treatment of areas containing small portions of larger populations of an orchid
(

Cypripedium fasciculatum

) listed as a sensitive species by the USDA Forest Service Northern Region.

Lands affected are within the Two Mile Creek and Little Joe Creek drainages, tributary to the St. Regis River, immediately
southwest of the town of St. Regis, Montana. The project area is bounded by the Montana-Idaho state line to the south
and west, and Interstate 90 to the north.

The purpose of this proposal is to carry out the goals and direction given in the Lolo National Forest Land and Resource
Management Plan with ecosystem management principles. Key elements of the purpose and need are:




_maintain or enhance ecosystem health and productivity by manipulating vegetation (timber cutting and underburning)
to increase age, structure, and composition diversity of biotic communities, by maintaining ecological disturbance
processes in this fire-dominated ecosystem, and by removing some insect-infested, diseased, or high-risk trees
from sites allocated by the forest plan to timber management;

_reduce existing sediment impacts to water and fish resources caused by existing roads;

_improve and maintain big game winter range and elk security conditions which are declining with current plant succession
trends and existing open road access;

_contribute to short-term output goals and long-term forest plan expectations for timber production; and

_conduct some experimental treatments to learn about 

Cypripedium fasciculatum

's habitat requirements and tolerance for environmental disturbance.




The decision to be made is to what extent, if at all, the Forest Service should conduct timber harvest, prescribed burning,
road construction or reconstruction, and road closures in the Two mile and Little Joe drainages, given the above purpose
and need. This is a site-specific project decision, 

not

 a general management plan nor a programmatic analysis.

Public scoping has been conducted on most elements of this proposal under earlier proposals called Tujo-Recoyle
and Sunset timber sales. This proposed action is a refinement of those proposals.

While quite a number of issues have been identified for environmental effects analysis, the following issues are
the ones which so far have been found significant enough to guide alternative development and provide focus for the
EIS:




_Timber harvest methods, primarily opposition to clearcutting and other forms of even-age management and concern
over the size and extent of harvest openings.

_Road-related effects, including sediment production, fish habitat impacts, wildlife disturbance, and recreation
opportunities (some people feel the area has too many roads or that too many roads are open during hunting season, while
others are opposed to additional road closures because they limit some forms of recreation and forest use).

_Water quality and fish habitat are affected by existing roads and the proposed actions may have both beneficial and
adverse effects on these resources.

_Elk security and big game winter range quality are declining due to existing open roads, harvest openings and plant
succession trends, and the proposed actions could have both beneficial and adverse effects on these issues.

_

Cypripedium fasciculatum

 may be regionally rare but large numbers are found in this vicinity. Ecologists view this as an opportunity to begin
learning more about this plant's habitat needs and response to disturbances as an aid in developing conservation
guidelines for the plant while others believe that the plant should be protected from all management-caused disturbances.




In addition to the proposed action, a range of alternatives will be developed in response to issues identified during
scoping. Other alternatives planned for detailed study are:




_no action;

_no even-aged timber harvest and more road closures for increased elk security;

_the proposed action except no new road closures;

_watershed rehabilitation but no timber harvest in the Little Joe drainage and no experimental treatment of sensitive
plants.




Public participation is important to the analysis. People may visit with Forest Service officials at any time during
the analysis and prior to the decision. No formal scoping meetings are planned. However, two periods are specifically
designated for comments on the analysis: (1) during this scoping process and (2) during the draft EIS comment period.

During the scoping process, the Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State, and local
agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. A scoping
document will be prepared and mailed to parties known to be interested in the proposed action. The agency invites written
comments and suggestions on this action, particularly in terms of issues and alternatives.

The Forest Service will continue to involve the public and will inform interested and affected parties as to how they
may participate and contribute to the final decision. Another formal opportunity for response will be provided following
completion of a draft EIS.

The draft EIS should be available for review in January, 1995. The final EIS is scheduled for completion in June, 1995.

The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the
notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes it is important, at this early stage, to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so it is meaningful and
alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC

, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact
statement stage but are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived
or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon v. Hodel

, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris

, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important those interested in
this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

Foreign-Trade Zone 104_Savannah, GA; Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.; Distribution and Processing Facility; Application
for Subzone Bulloch County, GA



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones 
Board (the Board) by the Savannah Airport Commission, grantee of FTZ 104, requesting special-purpose subzone status
for a new distribution and processing facility of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., located in Bulloch County, Georgia, in the
Savannah Customs port of entry area. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade
Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally
filed on July 15, 1994. 

Wal-Mart is a nationwide discount merchandiser, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company employs 520,000
people and its total sales exceed $67 billion. 

Wal-Mart is constructing a new distribution/processing facility (1.5 mil. sq. ft. on 163-acre site) at County Road
204 and Highway 301, Statesboro, Georgia, some 45 miles northwest of Savannah. The facility will be used to store,
test, and distribute a wide range of consumer products, some of which are of foreign origin. There will be processing
activity for some products. The application contains requests for authority to assemble stereo systems (duty rate
3.7%) and camera kits (duty rate 3.0%) under zone procedures. Items sourced from abroad for the stereo assembly operations
include: tuners, amplifiers, and turntables (duty rate range 4.4%-6.0%). Items sourced abroad for the camera
kit assembly operations include: camera cases (plastic, leather, and other), lenses, and film (duty rate range 3.7%-20.0%).


Zone procedures would exempt Wal-Mart from Customs duty payments on the foreign products that are reexported. It
would be able to defer Customs duty payments on domestic sales, and choose the finished product duty rates on the above
noted items processed at the facility. The application indicates that zone savings would help improve the international
competitiveness of the distribution/processing facility. 

In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate
the application and report to the Board. 

Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is October
3, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during
the subsequent 15-day period (to October 17, 1994). 


A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations:

Marine Mammals: Pinniped Removal Authority


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of receipt of application to establish a Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the receipt of, and requests comments and information on, an application under section 120 of the Marine
Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). This application requests
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to establish a Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force (Task Force) and initiate
the process provided by the MMPA to authorize the intentional lethal taking of individually identifiable California
sea lions that prey on wild winter-run steelhead that migrate through the Ballard Locks in Seattle, WA. This authorization
is requested in order to protect the 1994-95 Lake Washington winter-run of steelhead.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background


Section 120 of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 

et

 

seq

.) as amended in 1994, provides the Secretary the discretion to authorize the intentional lethal taking of individually
identifiable pinnipeds which are having a significant negative impact on salmonids that are either: (1) Listed under
the Endangered Species Act (ESA); (2) approaching a threatened or endangered status; or (3) migrate through the Ballard
Locks in Seattle. The authorization applies only to pinnipeds that are not: (1) Listed under the ESA; (2) designated
as depleted; or (3) designated a strategic stock. The process for determining whether to implement the authority
in section 120 commences with a state developing and submitting an application that provides a detailed description
of the interaction problem, the means of identifying the individual pinnipeds, and expected benefits of the taking.
Within 15 days of receiving an application, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) must determine
whether the applicant has produced sufficient evidence to warrant establishing a Pinniped-Fishery Interaction
Task Force (Task Force) to address the situation described in the application. If the application provides sufficient
evidence, NMFS must publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 requesting public comment on the application, and establish a Task Force consisting of: (1) NMFS/NOAA staff; (2)
scientists who are knowledgeable about the pinniped interaction; (3) representatives of affected conservation
and fishing community organizations; (4) treaty Indian tribes; (5) the States; and (6) such other organizations
as NMFS deems appropriate. The Task Force must, to the maximum extent practicable, consist of an equitable balance
among representatives of resource user interests and nonuser interests. Meetings of the Task Force must be open to
the public. Within 60 days after establishment, and after reviewing public comments in response to the 

Federal Register

 notice, the Task Force is to recommend to NMFS approval or denial of the proposed intentional lethal taking along with
recommendations on the proposed location, time, and method of such taking, criteria for evaluating the success of
the action, and the duration of the intentional lethal taking authority. The Task Force must also suggest non-lethal
alternatives, if available and practicable, including a recommended course of action. Within 30 days after receipt
of the Task Force's recommendations, NMFS must either approve or deny the application. If such application is approved,
NMFS must immediately take steps to implement the intentional lethal taking. The intentional lethal taking is to
be performed by Federal or state agencies, or qualified individuals under contract to such agencies.


Notice of Request


On July 12, 1994, NMFS received an application, dated June 30, 1994, from the WDFW, to authorize the intentional lethal
taking of individually identifiable California sea lions (

Zalophus

 

californianus

) that prey on wild winter-run steelhead (

Oncorhynchus

 

mykiss

) that migrate through the Ballard Locks in Seattle, WA. The WDFW requested that the Secretary establish a Task Force
and initiate the process provided by section 120 of the MMPA so that authorization for lethal removal, if approved,
is authorized in time for protection of the 1994-95 winter-run of steelhead that will migrate through the Ballard
Locks from December 1994 through the end of March 1995.
The AA has determined that the WDFW's application does provide sufficient evidence to warrant establishment of a
Task Force. The NMFS Northwest Regional Office will take the lead in establishing the Task Force and making arrangements
for the meetings of the Task Force. These meetings will be open to the public.
The WDFW's application references several studies and documents prepared by NMFS and the WDFW which provide scientific
information that California sea lions are negatively affecting the wild winter-run of steelhead migrating through
the Ballard Locks through predation and obstruction of fish passage. Although other factors may have contributed
to the decline of this wild steelhead population, extensive studies by NMFS and WDFW have documented that predation
by California sea lions has been a principal factor since 1985 affecting the status of this steelhead run. Studies
at the Ballard Locks have documented that California sea lions have consumed over 50 percent of the adult returns in
recent years. This winter-run steelhead population has declined dramatically in recent years, and NMFS is currently
undertaking a status review to determine whether this population should be proposed for listing under the ESA. Non-lethal
means of controlling sea lion predation have not been successful in reducing predation and allowing increased passage
through the Ballard Locks facility. Although the sea lion predation problem may involve as many as 40 animals, an average
of only three to six animals have been responsible for much of the predation each year. Wild steelhead spawning escapement
into the Lake Washington drainage has declined from about 2,500 fish in the mid-1980's to a 1993-94 spawning
escapement of only 70 steelhead. The WDFW's application indicates that lethal removal is a short-term solution for
an emergency situation in preventing extirpation of a wild salmonid stock. Their expected immediate benefit of selective
lethal removal of depredating sea lions at the Ballard Locks will be to enhance steelhead escapement levels, thereby
enhancing spawning success to maintain the stock.


Information Solicited


Public comments and information on the WDFW's application are requested and will be considered by the Task Force and
NMFS in determining whether lethal removal should be authorized. A copy of the WDFW's application is available from
NMFS (see 

ADDRESSES

). In addition, NMFS and the WDFW are making available to the public copies of Environmental Assessments (EAs) published
in 1989, 1992 and 1994 under the National Environmental Policy Act on the situation at Ballard Locks (see 

ADDRESSES

). These EAs provide extensive background information on the problem and non-lethal efforts to address the problem.
NMFS also has available limited copies of a recent report prepared for the Marine Mammal Commission entitled ``A Description
and Assessment of the Interaction Between California Sea Lions and Steelhead Trout at the Chittenden Locks, Seattle,
Washington.''

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Renewal of an experimental fishing permit.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the renewal of experimental fishing permit (EFP) #93-1 to Terra Marine Research and Education,
Inc. (TMRE), and participating vessels and shoreside processors. Under the renewal process, a new EFP #94-2
will be issued to authorize vessel operators, shoreside processors, and TMRE to retain voluntarily Pacific salmon
caught as bycatch that would otherwise be required to be discarded at sea as prohibited species. This EFP was designed
and modified to develop qualifying criteria for vessels and processors that may wish to participate in a voluntary
salmon bycatch donation program being considered by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council). Activities
authorized under this EFP are intended to provide information not otherwise available through research or commercial
fishing operations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Issuance of EFPs to authorize fishing that would otherwise be prohibited are authorized by the Fishery Management
Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and its implementing regulations
at 50 CFR part 675. The procedures for renewing EFPs are contained in the regulations at  675.6.


An EFP was issued to TMRE to test the feasibility of mandatory retention of Pacific salmon caught as bycatch in directed
BSAI groundfish fisheries that would be processed and distributed to economically disadvantaged individuals (58
FR 42947, August 12, 1993). This EFP covered the period during: (1) The 1993 directed pollock non-roe season; (2) the
1994 directed pollock roe season; and (3) the 1994 directed Pacific cod season. However, NMFS lacks the authority
to require mandatory retention of salmon for this purpose.
NMFS announced the receipt of an application for an EFP from TMRE in the 

Federal Register

 on May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23054). The application requested authorization for voluntary retention and processing of Pacific
salmon caught as bycatch in the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod trawl fisheries for donation to economically disadvantaged
individuals via foodbanks. The Council reviewed the EFP application at its April 18-24, 1994, meeting and recommended
to the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), that the EFP be approved.
The Regional Director has approved the EFP application and has issued an EFP to TMRE and the participating vessels
and shoreside processors. The EFP authorizes these vessel operators, shoreside processors, and TMRE to retain Pacific
salmon caught as bycatch during: (1) The 1994 BSAI directed pollock non-roe or ``B'' season fishery; (2) the 1995 BSAI
directed pollock roe or ``A'' season fishery; and (3) the 1995 BSAI directed Pacific cod fishery, for the purpose of
producing salmon products to be distributed to economically disadvantaged individuals via foodbanks. The objective
of this EFP is to provide a framework for voluntary retention and processing of salmon bycatch, which is currently
required to be discarded at sea, and to develop standards and criteria for vessel operators and processors who may
wish to participate in a voluntary salmon donation program being considered by the Council.


Classification


Based on the EA prepared for this EFP, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, determined that no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment will result from this EFP. The Regional Director determined that this
experiment will not affect species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act in a way that
was not already considered in previous formal and informal section 7 consultations. Additional information, including
gear restrictions, scientific sampling procedures, project design, and disposition of harvested fish, is contained
in the EFP.
This notice is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.

<DOCTITLE>Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI) and Environmental Assessment for Realignment of Fort Jackson, SC</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Army, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Finding of no significant impact.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with procedures established by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (BRAC), the 1993
Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommended that the Chaplain Center and School (CHCS) be relocated
from Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, to Fort Jackson, South Carolina. The proposed action is necessary to implement this
recommendation. Facility requirements of the CHCS include general and applied instructional facilities, administrative
and operations area, historical property storage, and a library, as well as Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Moslem
chapels.


Realigning the CHCS and associated activities will involve approximately 100 permanent party soldiers, 50 civilian
employees, and an average daily student load of 165. To accomplish the increased mission at Fort Jackson, construction
of a new CHCS administrative and instructional facility will be required.
The construction of a 136-unit Unaccompanied Officers Quarters (UOQ) is also included as part of this environmental
assessment. However, the UOQ is not a BRAC 93 project, neither is it a result of the BRAC 93 realignment. The increase
in unaccompanied officers due to the BRAC 91 realignment of the Soldier Support Institute (SSI) to Fort Jackson from
Fort Benjamin Harrison has created a shortage of UOQ spaces. The construction of a new UOQ facility at Fort Jackson
would reduce this deficit, requiring fewer unaccompanied officers to be housed off base. The UOQ was added to the BRAC
91 construction program after the Environmental Assessment prepared for the SSI was completed.


Alternatives Considered: Alternatives considered in the Environmental Assessment (EA) include the following:
the preferred alternative, which is to construct a CHCS facility near the Soldier Support Institute building currently
under construction, and to construct a 136-unit Unaccompanied Officers Personnel Housing facility, which would
provide housing for officer basic course student on temporary duty attending the Adjutant General, Finance, and
Recruiting and Retention schools at the SSI; the No-Action Alternative; and various siting alternatives at the installation
for both the CHCS and UOQ.
Feasibility criteria were based on such factors as operational impacts, environmental constraints, future expansion
capability, base vehicular traffic flow, ease of accessibility from on and off post, heating and air conditioning
requirements, proximity to dining facilities and billets, demolition requirements, and conduciveness to a campus
atmosphere. This latter criteria responds to a desire to have academic training areas set apart from other military
training activities.
Factors Considered in Determining that No Environmental Impact Statement is Required: Implementation of the proposed
action would not significantly alter baseline environmental conditions at Fort Jackson. During construction there
would be short-term increases in dust and particulate levels associated with construction activities. Mitigation
measures are in place to minimize temporary impacts related to construction.
Construction will have no significant impact on ground water or on any wild and scenic rivers in South Carolina; however,
it may have short-term impacts on some surface waters. These impacts will be negligible, since proper erosion and
siltation control measures, as well as building designs that minimize erosion and flooding potential, will be utilized.
Combustion by-product emissions from construction equipment will be a short-term impact. Long-term increases
in non-commercial vehicular emissions can be expected because of the additional personnel at Fort Jackson. Projected
traffic increases are minor relative to the number of vehicles already on-post, and will not affect regional air quality
attainment status; therefore, this impact is not considered significant.
The City of Columbia's water supply system and water treatment system is easily capable of absorbing the very minor
increase in water usage and wastewater generation that will accompany the proposed realignment. Therefore, this
expected increase in water usage and sewer discharge is not considered significant. Increased demand for electricity
and heating fuels is considered to be negligible.
After coordinating with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department,
it was determined that BRAC 93 activities have no negative impacts on federally listed or proposed threatened and
endangered species, including the red-cockaded woodpecker population at Fort Jackson. Coordination with the Charleston
District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers revealed that there are no jurisdictional wetlands that will be impacted by
construction of BRAC 93 CHCS facilities and the UOQ at Fort Jackson. The proposed construction will not have any adverse
affect on any historic or cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.
The realignment action will have a positive impact on Richland and Lexington counties with respect to employment,
population, business volume, and personal income. However, these increases will not significantly alter the socioeconomic
characteristics of the Fort Jackson region.
Conclusion: It has been determined that implementation of the proposed action would not have significant individual
or cumulative impacts on the quality of the natural or human environment. Because there would be no significant environmental
impacts resulting from the implementation of the proposed action, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required
and will not be prepared.

<DOCTITLE>Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Safe Interim Storage of Hanford Tank Wastes at the Hanford Site, Richland,
WA, and Announcement of Public Hearings </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of the Safe Interim Storage of Hanford Tank Wastes Draft
Environmental Impact Statement (DOE/EIS-0212), prepared jointly with the Washington Department of Ecology
(Ecology). The draft EIS was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, and
its implementing regulations and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) guidelines. DOE and Ecology
have identified the need to resolve near-term tank safety issues associated with Watchlist tanks identified pursuant
to Section 3137 of P.L. 101-510, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, ``Safety Measures
for Waste Tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation,'' while continuing to provide safe storage for other Hanford wastes.
This would be an interim action pending other actions that could be taken to convert waste to a more stable form based
on decisions resulting from the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The
purpose for this action is to resolve safety issues concerning the generation of unacceptable levels of hydrogen
in two Watchlist tanks, 101-SY and 103-SY. Current planning considers retrieval in dilute form of waste
from Tanks 101-SY and 103-SY, hydrogen-generating Watchlist double shell tanks (DSTs) in the 200 West
area, to be the highest priority action. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background, Purpose and Need for the Proposed Action 


DOE has instituted numerous actions directed toward resolving safety concerns regarding the Watchlist tanks. In
addition to tank-specific safety evaluations, DOE is currently mitigating near-term risk of fire or explosion involving
hydrogen gas generation from Tank 101-SY by operating a mixer pump which modifies the rate and mechanism of hydrogen
releases. Mixer pump installations in other hydrogen-generating Watchlist tanks may also mitigate the near-term
risks of accidents. However, DOE has identified retrieval and dilution of the wastes in flammable gas-generating
Watchlist tanks as the primary mechanism for resolving safety issues which would assure safe storage of these wastes
during the interim time frame prior to implementing decisions based on the TWRS EIS that might change the form of the
waste. Retrieval of the waste and storage in a dilute form would be considered remediation, the final step in safety
issue resolution of the hydrogen under this strategy, while installation and operation of mixer pumps would be considered
mitigation. Dilution would eliminate the generation of unacceptable levels of hydrogen by altering the reactions
that result in hydrogen build up. Mitigation by mixer pumps would eliminate the mechanisms by which hydrogen gas concentrates
to unacceptable levels. 
Because most of the Watchlist tanks are at or near capacity, dilution can best be accommodated through the use of other
tank space rather than dilution in place. Upon review of available tank space and considering the potential for chemical
incompatibility if existing DSTs were to be used as receiver tanks for Watchlist wastes, DOE is proposing to construct
additional tank space to meet the need in the near term for storage of diluted wastes that would be retrieved from Watchlist
Tanks 101-SY and 103-SY. 


Environmental Impact Statement Preparation 


The Draft Statement has been prepared in accordance with Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA), as implemented in regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508)
and by the Department's Implementing Procedures (10 CFR Part 1021). The Draft Statement has been prepared to assess
the potential impacts of both the proposed action, and reasonable alternatives to the proposed action, on the human
and natural environment.

A Notice of Intent (Notice) to prepare the Environmental Impact Statement and hold public scoping meetings in Spokane,
Richland, and Seattle, Washington, Hood River and Portland, Oregon, was published by the Department in the 

Federal Register

 on January 28, 1994. The Notice invited oral and written comments and suggestions on the proposed scope of the Environmental
Impact Statement, including environmental issues and alternatives, and invited pubic participation in the NEPA
process. Overall, scoping comments were received that assisted in identifying major issues for subsequent in-depth
analysis in the Draft Statement. As a result of the scoping process, an Environmental Impact Statement Implementation
Plan was developed to define the scope and provide further guidance for preparing the Environmental Impact Statement.


The Draft Statement considers the proposed action and the no-action alternative, which includes a scenario that
reasonably could be expected to result as a consequence of the no-action alternative. Impacts to the affected environment,
geologic resources, seismology, water resources and hydrology, physical environment, radiation, sound level
and noise, ecology including threatened and endangered species (plant and animal), and socioeconomic resources
(including environmental justice) from construction of the proposed new tanks have been analyzed. 

The Draft Statement provides an analysis of information prepared to evaluate the potential environmental impacts
of the proposed construction and operation of six new tanks, an initial tank retrieval system and cross-site transfer
system, and associated facilities. 



Comment Procedures

<DOCTITLE>Florida Gas Transmission Co., Notice of Tariff Filing</DOCTITLE>



July 27, 1994.


Take notice that on July 25, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of its
FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets:




First Revised Sheet No. 166
First Revised Sheet No. 177A

Second Revised Sheet No. 178




In its restructuring orders, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) has indicated that capacity
release programs should be designed so as to promote the maximum use of such programs, thus making the maximum amount
of unused/excess capacity available to potential shippers. FGT states that it is filing the above tariff sheets to
reflect certain revisions to the permanent release provisions of its capacity relinquishment mechanism which are
necessary in order to continue to promote the Commission's desire to allow the maximum amount of participation in
the capacity relinquishment program while at the same time not degrading FGT's standing in the financial community.


FGT notes that in recently issued orders, the Commission has stated that FGT must follow an ``industry standard''
of allowing a party to acquire transportation service upon the tendering of a three-month prepayment regardless
of the term of the underlying service agreement. Specifically, pursuant to the Commission's ``Order Granting Clarification''
(``May 31 Order''), FGT states that any party apparently may now acquire relinquished capacity on a permanent basis
on the FGT system by providing an escrow account in an amount equal to the charge for only three (3) months' service.
Thereafter, the Relinquishing Shipper would not be liable for any further obligations. FGT believes that an unintended
result of the May 31 Order is that a creditworthy shipper may now permanently relinquish capacity to an uncreditworthy
shipper. Since the creditworthy Relinquishing Shipper would have no further liability, FGT states that its financial
standing would be adversely affected because FGT could only look to the uncreditworthy Acquiring Shipper with potentially
no assets for payment.


In view of the potential consequences of the May 31 Order, FGT, by this filing, is responding to the Commission's prior
express invitation for FGT to propose an alternative, reasonable means to assure payment. The instant tariff filing
proposes a reasonable alternative method to assure payment to FGT with very limited tariff changes. The instant proposal
would apply only to permanent relinquishments.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
August 3, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken,
but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

Decision and Order of the Department of Energy



July 25, 1994.



Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 



Name of Firm: Telum, Inc. 

Date of Filing: October 7, 1993 

Case Number: LEF-0114 




In accordance with the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V, the
Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the DOE filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures
with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on October 7, 1993. The petition requests that OHA formulate and implement
procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant to a consent order entered into by the DOE and Telum, Inc.
(Telum). 



I. Background 



Telum was a ``reseller-retailer'' of ``covered products'' as those terms were defined in 6 CFR 150.352 and 10 CFR 212.31.
Therefore, Telum was required to price middle distillate fuel in accordance with the price rule of the Mandatory Petroleum
Price Regulations set forth at 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart F, and antecedent regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 150, Subpart
L. As a result of an audit, the ERA alleged that Telum and entities under Telum's direction violated the price regulations
in sales of middle distillate fuel to Salt River Project (Salt River) during a five month period from December 1, 1973,
through April 30, 1974 (the audit period).* The auditors determined that during this period Telum made sales of middle
distillates to Salt River at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price (MLSP) permitted by the regulations.
Consequently, the ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Telum on May 28, 1980, alleging pricing violations
in the sale of middle distillate fuel to Salt River. After revising its selection of the ``nearest comparable outlet''
with regard to the ``new market'' determination under 10 CFR 212.111(b), the ERA issued an Amended PRO on September
15, 1986, alleging that Telum had overcharged Salt River in its sales of middle distillate fuel in the amount of $357,587.
On April 7, 1988, that Amended PRO was remanded by OHA to the ERA for a new determination regarding Telum's nearest comparable
outlet and a recalculation of MLSPs and any overcharges in sales to Salt River. Telum, Inc., 17 DOE  83,010 (1988).






The ERA did not issue a second Amended PRO. Instead, on May 30, 1990, the DOE entered into a consent order (No. 820H00020Z)
with Telum to resolve all administrative and civil claims related to Telum's compliance with the Federal petroleum
price and allocation regulations in its resale transactions of petroleum products during the period December 1,
1973 through April 30, 1974. Specifically, Telum agreed to remit $60,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in
an interest-bearing escrow account. Telum has remitted $56,149.35 to the DOE, consisting of $51,626.18 toward payment
of the $60,000 principal amount due and $4,523.17 toward payment of interest due on principal. The DOE has authorized
a write-off of the remainder of the amount due for reasons of uncollectability. Telum is no longer in business, and
Earl K. Cook, the former president of Telum, has indicated that he is unable to pay the remainder of the amount due. As
of June 30, 1994, $9,615 in interest had accrued in the DOE escrow account on the amount paid by Telum. 

On May 31, 1994, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order in which we determined that it was appropriate to establish
a special refund proceeding with respect to the Telum consent order fund. In that Proposed Decision, we tentatively
set forth procedures to distribute a refund to the party that was injured by Telum's alleged pricing violations in
sales of middle distillates during the consent order period. Specifically, we proposed that Salt River, the party
injured by Telum's alleged pricing violations, be eligible for the entire consent order fund plus accrued interest.
The Proposed Decision was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 6, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 29289), and comments on the proposed refund mechanism were to be submitted within 30 days
of that date. No comments regarding the Proposed Decision and Order were received. Accordingly, we have determined
that the proposed procedures should be adopted. 

The purpose of this Decision and Order is to establish procedures to be used for filing and processing Salt River's
claim to a refund in this matter. This Decision sets forth the information that Salt River should submit in order to
receive the entire Telum consent order fund.

I. Jurisdiction 



The procedural regulations of the DOE set forth general guidelines by which the Office of Hearings and Appeals may
formulate and implement a plan of distribution for funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. 10 C.F.R.
Part 205, Subpart V. It is the DOE policy to use the Subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion
of Subpart V and the authority of the Office of Hearings and Appeals to fashion procedures to distribute refunds obtained
as part of consent orders, 

see Office of Enforcement

, 9 DOE  82,553 (1982); 

Office of Enforcement

, 9 DOE  82,508 (1981); 

Office of Enforcement

, 8 DOE  82,597 (1981). As we stated in the Proposed Decision, we have determined that a Subpart V proceeding is
an appropriate method for distributing the Telum consent order fund. Therefore, we will grant the ERA's petition
and assume jurisdiction over distribution of the fund. 



III. Refund Procedures 

A. Refund Claimant 



In the Proposed Decision, we determined that insofar as possible the consent order fund should be distributed to the
customer of Telum who was injured by the alleged overcharges. Salt River, the only Telum customer who made purchases
during the consent order period that were covered by the PRO and Amended PRO, is the only Telum customer we identified
as likely to have been injured by the alleged overcharges. Although the Telum consent order covers 

all 

sales of ``covered products'' by Telum for the period December 1, 1973 through April 30, 1974, the ERA audit files,
the PRO, and the Amended PRO are all based only on sales by Telum to Salt River. The consent order, while lacking in specificity,
was clearly arrived at in order to settle this one outstanding enforcement issue. We are thus able to use the information
contained in the audit files for guidance as to the identity of Telum's injured customer and the extent of the alleged
overcharges, as we have done in some prior refund proceedings. 

See, e.g.

, 

Howard Oil Co.

, 15 DOE  85,072 (1986). Consequently, we are establishing a claims procedure in which Salt River may apply for
a refund equal to the entire consent order fund. Limiting the universe of applicants to Salt River allows us to fashion
a refund plan that will correspond most closely to the alleged overcharges settled by the consent order. 

See Consumers Oil Co.

, 13 DOE  85,226 (1985); 

Marion Corp.

, 12 DOE  85,014 (1984). 

In prior refund proceedings, in order to receive a full refund, claimants whose prices for goods and services are regulated
by a governmental body, e.g., a public utility, have not been required to provide a detailed showing of injury. 

See, e.g.

, 

Dorchester Gas Corp.

, 14 DOE  85,240 at 88,451 (1986). Instead, regulated firms have been required to (i) Certify that they will pass
any refund received through to their customers, (ii) provide us with a full explanation of how they plan to accomplish
the restitution, and (iii) certify that they will notify the appropriate regulatory body of the receipt of the refund.


Id. 

These requirements are based on the presumption that, with respect to a regulated firm, any overcharges would have
been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received should be passed through to its customers.


We have been informed by Salt River that the nature of its business is that of a municipal public power utility whose
rates for electricity are set by a publicly-elected Board of Directors (i.e., a governmental body). 

See 

Memorandum of April 29, 1994 Telephone Conversation between John Egan, Spokesperson for Salt River, and Andrew Beckwith,
OHA Staff Analyst. We have determined, therefore, that Salt River is a regulated firm as that category is defined above.


See City of Lubbock

, 18 DOE  85,116 (1988). Accordingly, we have determined that Salt River, as a regulated firm, need not make a
showing that it was injured by the alleged overcharges. However, Salt River will be required to comply with the stipulations
outlined above that are incumbent upon regulated firms when submitting an Application for Refund. 



B. Calculation of Refund Amount 



As stated above, the ERA audit files identify Salt River as the Telum customer injured by the alleged overcharges that
were the subject of the consent order. In the Proposed Decision, we indicated our intention to find Salt River eligible
for the entire amount of the consent order fund as restitution for the alleged overcharges. We received no comments
in opposition to this proposal and therefore shall adopt it. In addition, Salt River will be eligible to receive all
of the interest that has accrued on the consent order fund. 



C. Application for Refund Procedures 



An Application for Refund may now be filed by Salt River. Salt River's Application must be postmarked within 90 days
after publication of this Decision and Order in the 

Federal Register

. 

See 

10 C.F.R.  205.286. The application must be in writing, signed by an authorized representative of Salt River,
and specify that it pertains to the Telum, Inc. consent order fund, Case No. LEF-0114. 

Salt River's Application for Refund must be filed in duplicate. A copy of the application will be available for public
inspection in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, Room 1E-234, 1000 Independence
Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC. If Salt River believes that its application contains confidential information, it
must so indicate on the first page of its application and submit two additional copies of its application from which
the information that it claims is confidential has been deleted, together with a statement specifying why any such
information is privileged or confidential. 

The application must also indicate whether the applicant or any person acting on its instructions has filed or intends
to file any other application or claim of whatever nature regarding the matters at issue in the underlying Telum enforcement
proceeding. Salt River must also certify that it is not related to Telum, the consent order firm. The application must
include the following statement: ``I swear (or affirm) that the information submitted is true and accurate to the
best of my knowledge and belief.'' 

See

 10 CFR 205.283(c); 18 USC 1001. Furthermore, Salt River should furnish us with the name, title, and telephone number
of a person who may be contacted by the OHA for additional information concerning the application. In addition, Salt
River's employer identification number and current address must be listed in the application. The application should
be sent to: Telum, Inc. Consent Order Refund Proceeding, Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of Energy,
Washington, DC 20585. 

As indicated above, Salt River should also: (i) Certify that it will pass any refund received through to its customers,
(ii) provide us with a full explanation of how it plans to accomplish the restitution, and (iii) certify that it will
notify the appropriate regulatory body of the receipt of the refund. 

In the event that Salt River does not file a refund application that meets the requirements set forth in this Decision
and Order, the funds in the Telum consent order account shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the
Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501-07. PODRA requires
that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be required to refund
monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments for use in four
energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA, and any refined product
pool funds in the Telum consent order escrow account that the OHA determines will not be used to effect direct restitution
to Salt River will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of PODRA.

 




It Is Therefore Ordered That:

 


(1) An Application for Refund from the funds remitted to the Department of Energy by Telum, Inc. pursuant to the consent
order executed on May 30, 1990, may now be filed. 

(2) The application must be postmarked no later than 90 days after publication of this Decision and Order in the 

Federal Register

.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics





Title: 

National Survey of Management Accounting Professionals (EPA ICR 

# 

1705.01). This ICR requests approval of a new information collection activity.



Abstract: 

EPA's Design for the Environment (DfE) Program encourages industry to identify and adopt product and process designs
and production operations that pose the least possible risk to the environment. A part of these efforts is to determine
whether and how the true costs of environmental protection and pollution prevention are factored into industry's
corporate cost accounting and capital budgeting activities, and to encourage the consideration of such costs when
and if they are not currently reflected in corporate financial calculations.

The information collected in this ICR will assist DfE's Accounting and Capital Budgeting Program to baseline typical
and best accounting and budgeting practices among management accountants, measure the effectiveness of its various
program elements, and set priorities for future DfE initiatives aimed at the professional accounting community.
The information collection will describe the practices and perspectives of management accountants in U.S. manufacturing
firms concerning pollution prevention project investments.

The survey contains five sections: Section 1 requests background information on the respondent and his/her firm;
Section 2 looks at the firm's capital budgeting process, focusing on how, when, and by whom requests for capital appropriations
for environmental projects are developed and approved; Section 3 asks for information on cost inventory to identify
the scope of direct and indirect costs typically included in project financial analysis, and whether such costs are
assessed quantitatively or qualitatively; Section 4 requests information on approaches to cost allocation_if
and how costs are assigned to specific processes and/or products, versus lumped into overhead accounts; finally,
Section 5 examines the firm's choice of financial indicators and time horizons for project profitability analysis.

The raw data will be analyzed for statistical purposes only, and will be presented in summary form without identifying
individual respondents. OPPT, in cooperation with the Institute for Management Accountants, a professional society
that is cooperating in the project, will determine the use and disposition of the final report.



Burden Statement: 

The estimated public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to require 1 hour per respondent.
This estimate includes time to review the instructions, gather existing information, and prepare and submit the
survey form. There are no recordkeeping requirements.



Respondents: 

A subset of the Institute for Management Accountants membership who identify their job function as either budgeting/planning
or cost accounting, and who are associated with manufacturing firms included in SIC codes 20_39.






Estimated Number of Respondents: 

900.


Estimated Number of Responses Per Respondent: 

1.


Frequency of Collection: 

One time survey response.


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

Title:

 Application for Reimbursement to Local Government (EPA ICR 

#

1425.03; OMB 

#

2050-0077). This ICR requests renewal of the existing clearance.



Abstract

: Section 123 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended
by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, allows any general purpose unit of local government
to apply to EPA for reimbursements for costs incurred in carrying out temporary emergency measures necessary to prevent
or mitigate injury to human health or the environment associated with the release or threatened release of any hazardous
substance contaminant. The intent of the local government reimbursement program is to alleviate significant financial
burden in carrying out temporary emergency measures.

This information collection requires applicants for reimbursement to submit an application package demonstrating
the financial burden, and the consistency of the response with program eligibility criteria. The package contains
four sections: Section 1 identifies the name and location of the local governmental unit; Section 2 describes the
date and time of the incident, the location, source and cause of the release, identify of the hazardous substance involved,
and the threats to human health and the environment; Section 3 asks for specifics on the response action, response
participants, contacts with EPA, and the temporary measures for which reimbursement is sought; Section 4 contains
the cost information (e.g., invoices, sales receipts, rental agreements) needed to determine the amount of potential
reimbursement, as well as evidence of attempts to recover costs from the responsible parties, insurance, or the State.



Burden Statement:

 The estimated public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is 20 hours per reimbursement
application. This estimate includes time to review the instructions, gather existing information, and prepare
and submit the form.



Respondents:

 Local governments carrying out temporary emergency measures resulting from the release, or threat of release, of
a hazardous substance.



Estimated Number of Respondents:

 90 local government units.



Estimated Number of Responses Per Respondent: 

1.




Frequency of Collection:

 On occasion, when needed for response reimbursement.



Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 1,800 hours.

<DOCTITLE>Acid Rain Program: Final Permits </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of permits. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing, as a direct final action, 5-year Phase I Acid Rain Permits
to 57 utility plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72).

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by
promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated
final rules implementing the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On November 18, 1993, EPA published a notice of proposed
revisions to rules regarding Phase I substitution and reduced utilization plans (sections 404(b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B)
of the Act). On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced
utilization issues. 



In today's action, EPA is issuing permits that are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement. Except as noted below,
EPA approves for 1995-1999 all compliance options for which EPA deferred action for 1996-1999 in the draft
permits. In addition, except as noted below, the numbers of substitution and compensating unit allowances allocated
to each unit for 1995-1999 are identical to the numbers of allowances allocated to each unit for 1995 in the draft
permits. The additional allowances discussed below, according to the settlement, are a one-time allocation and
entail a simultaneous deduction of an equal number of allowances in a future year. Upon activation of conditionally-approved
plans, substitution or compensating unit allowances are allocated for the remaining years the plan is in effect.
EPA issues the following permits:

Commission Requirements for Cost Support Material To Be Filed With Virtual Collocation Tariffs for Special Access
and Switched Transport



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On July 25, 1994, the Commission adopted a separate Memorandum Opinion and Order modifying its rules governing provision
of expanded interconnection service. Specifically, the Commission lifted the requirement that local exchange
carriers provide physical collocation, but required certain local exchange carriers to provide virtual collocation.
In this Order, the Common Carrier Bureau (Bureau), under delegated authority, establishes specific requirements
for the cost support information that must accompany the local exchange carriers' virtual collocation tariffs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Bureau's Tariff Review Plan Order adopted July 25, 1994, and released July 25, 1994. The full
text of this Commission decision is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Public
Reference Room (Room 230), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision may also be purchased
from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Suite 140, 2100 M Street NW., Washington,
DC 20037. The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirement
to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3507. Persons wishing to comment
on this information should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10236, New Executive Office
Building, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561. For further information, contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications
Commission, (202) 418-0214.






Please note: 

The Commission has requested expedited review of this collection by August 1, 1994 under the provisions of 5 CFR 1320.18.







Title: 

Commission Requirements for Cost Support Material to be Filed with Virtual Collocation Tariffs for Special Access
and Switched Transport.



Respondents: 

Business or other for profit.



Frequency of Response: 

One time collection.



Estimated Annual Burden: 

16 respondents; 1 response per respondent; 194 hours per response; 3104 hours total annual burden.



Needs and Uses: 

The information required is necessary for efficient review of the required revisions of the local telephone companies'
expanded interconnection tariffs. The information collected will be used to determine whether the charges offered
are just and reasonable as the Act requires.



Regulatory Flexibility Analysis: 

The Commission has determined that Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), does
not apply to these rules because they do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The definition of a ``small entity'' in Section 3 of the Small Business Act excludes any business that is dominant in
its field of operation. Although some of the local exchange carriers that will be affected are very small, local exchange
carriers do not qualify as small entities because each of them has a monopoly on ubiquitous access to the subscribers
in their service area. The Commission has also found all exchange carriers to be dominant in its competitive carrier
proceeding. See 85 FCC 2d 1, 23-24 (1980). To the extent that small telephone companies will be affected by these
rules, the Commission hereby certifies that these rules will not have a significant effect on a substantial number
of ``small entities.''



Summary of Report and Order: 

In Memorandum Opinion and Order in this Docket adopted on July 14, 1994, the Commission required all Tier 1 local exchange
carriers (LECs) other than participants in National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) pools to offer virtual
collocation. Those tariffs must be filed on or before September 1, 1994, to become effective on December 15, 1994.
In the Tariff Review Plan Order released concurrently with the Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Common Carrier Bureau,
under delegated authority, adopted requirements for cost support information which LECs must submit with their
virtual collocation tariffs.

The Tariff Review Plan (TRP) disaggregates expanded interconnection service, by basic service function, into the
following seven categories: (1) Provisioning Function, (2) Entrance Function, (3) Termination Function, (4) Cross-Connection
Function, (5) Equipment Installation Function, (6) Maintenance and Repair Function, and (7) Technician Training
Function. The Bureau recognized that the Commission did not mandate a detailed rate structure, but required LECs
to categorize their rate elements into these functions for purposes of the TRP. For each function, the TRP requires
a complete list of plant and equipment, including the name of the plant or equipment item, the associated Part 32 account
numbers, gross investment amounts, and estimated depreciable lives. The TRP also requires detailed expense and
tax information, including the name of the expense or tax, the Part 32 account numbers, and the expense or tax amount.

In addition to the TRP, LECs must provide documentation supporting their entries in the TRP form, submit cost support
information for the overhead loading factors used to develop their expanded interconnection rates, and overhead
loading factors on a service-by-service basis for all point-to-point special access services they offer. Finally,
LECs are also required to provide a sample price out for the provision of 100 DS1s, assuming that nonrecurring costs
will be amortized over a five year period at an 11.25 percent discount rate.

See below for information regarding public burden estimate.
NOTICE: This tariff review plan (TRP) contains requirements for summary cost support material that certain local
exchange carriers (LECs) must file to support their tariff filings in partial fulfillment of Section 61.38 or Sections
61.44 through 61.49 of the Commission's Rules. TRPs specify basic cost and demand information in a consistent format
and are essential components of the Commission's access tariff review process. The information in the TRPs is used
by the FCC to evaluate rates. Your response is mandatory. Public reporting burden for this collection of information
is estimated to average 194 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing the burden, to the Federal Communications Commission, Office of the Managing Director, Washington,
DC 20554, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC
20503.

Findings of Scientific Misconduct

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has made final findings of scientific misconduct
in the following case:





Annmarie Surprenant, Ph.D., Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology.

 An inquiry and investigation conducted by the Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) found that Annmarie Surprenant,
Ph.D., had misrepresented her academic credentials in a grant application for Public Health Service (PHS) research
funds. The OHSU found that Dr. Surprenant had falsely stated that she had earned an M.K. degree from the University
of Illinois at Chicago in 1976. As a result of the OHSU investigation, Dr. Surprenant resigned from the OHSU faculty.
During its oversight review of the OHSU report, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) discovered that Dr. Surprenant
had also falsely claimed to have earned an M.D. on two additional PHS research grant applications. Based upon the OHSU
report, as well as the information obtained by ORI during its oversight review, ORI found that Dr. Surprenant engaged
in scientific misconduct by falsely claiming to have earned an M.D. in three PHS research grant applications. Dr.
Surprenant accepted the ORI finding and agreed to a Voluntary Exclusion and Settlement Agreement under which she
will not apply for Federal grant or contract funds and will not serve on PHS advisory committees, boards, or peer review
groups for a three year period beginning June 8, 1994.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has made final findings of scientific misconduct
in the following case:





Anand Tewari, M.D., Stanford University. 

The Division of Research Investigations (DRI) of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) conducted an investigation
into possible scientific misconduct on the part of Dr. Tewari while a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Surgery,
Stanford University School of Medicine. ORI concluded that Dr. Tewari committed scientific misconduct in clinical
research supported by an NIH grant by fabricating ophthalmologic examination results; fabricating and falsifying
blood gas data; fabricating and falsifying values for glycerol determinations; falsifying standard errors and
including fabricated data on platelet counts in a published article, ``Effects of interleukin-1 on platlet counts''
(

The Lancet

 336:712-714 (1990)), and related abstracts; and providing to his supervisors summaries of data that included
falsified and fabricated data which were used in a PHS grant application. The published article containing the falsified
and fabricated data was retracted on August 22, 1992. 

The Lancet

 340:496. Dr. Tewari accepted the ORI findings and agreed to a Voluntary Exclusion and Settlement Agreement under
which he may not apply for Federal grant or contract funds except for the non-research training or practice of clinical
medicine, and may not serve on PHS advisory committees, boards, or peer review groups for a five-year period beginning
March 1, 1994.

Notice of environmental scoping meetings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and agency policy, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation),
in cooperation with the Public Service Company of New Mexico, will conduct two environmental scoping meetings on
the proposal to renew/extend Public Service Company of New Mexico's water service contract. The two meetings will
be held to obtain information for use in determining the scope of environmental issues and impacts related to the proposal.
The results of the meetings will help Reclamation determine whether an environmental impact statement will be prepared
on the proposed action.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Public Service Company of New Mexico currently has a water service contract (USBR Contract No. 14-06-400-4831)
with Reclamation for an annual use of 16,200 acre-feet of water from Navajo Reservoir, in San Juan County, New Mexico.
The contract water is diverted from the San Juan River near Waterflow, New Mexico, via a weir and backwater pumping
system. Water is stored in a small reservoir at the San Juan Generating Station. The existing water service contract
was executed in 1968, amended in 1977, and expires in 2005.



Reclamation is the lead Federal agency to ensure compliance with the NEPA for the proposed action. The Public Service
Company of New Mexico has requested Reclamation to initiate the environmental scoping process and prepare the environmental
document. Reclamation is initiating the scoping process now to allow sufficient time to identify and resolve environmental
concerns relevant to the proposed water service contract renewal and extension.

<DOCTITLE>The Elk River Railroad, Inc._Exemption_Construction and Operation of a Line of Railroad in Clay and Kanawha Counties,
WV </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final scope of study for environmental impact statement. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the final scope of study prepared in response to written comments, as well as oral comments given
at public meetings, for the environmental impact statement to be prepared for the above proceeding. Written comments
on the final scope are requested.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Elk River Railroad (TERRI) has filed a petition for exemption with the Commission seeking authority to construct
and operate a 30 mile line from Hartland to Falling Rock, West Virginia. The proposed line would connect TERRI's existing
line with a Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) line near Blue Creek, West Virginia, thus allowing TERRI to interchange
traffic with either CSXT or Conrail. 


We believe that if the Commission approves the construction and operation, this action would constitute a major Federal
action having the potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore, we will prepare
an environmental impact statement (EIS). A notice of intent to prepare an EIS and to hold public scoping meetings for
this proceeding was published on May 6, 1994. The notice requested comments in writing or orally at public scoping
meetings that were held in Clendenin, West Virginia and Clay, West Virginia on May 31 and June 1, 1994, respectively.
Over 100 parties provided comments and/or attended the scoping meetings. In accordance with the Commission's environmental
rules at 49 CFR 1105, the final scope of study is summarized below.

 
</SUPPLEM>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF THE SCOPE OF STUDY:

 Construction and operation activities may significantly affect the environment in the project area. Based on the
comments and our initial evaluation, the proposed construction and operation may result in a number of environmental
impacts. These impacts may include:

 

Land Use Impacts 
Socioeconomic Impacts from Physical Environmental Changes 
Impacts to Water Resources 
Impacts to Wildlife 
Transportation and Safety Impacts 
Energy Impacts 
Air Quality Impacts Noise Impacts 
Impacts to Historic and Cultural Resources 
Impacts to Recreational Resources.

 

Copies of the complete scope of study have been served on all the parties to this proceeding. A copy of the scoping document
may be obtained by contacting Michael Dalton at (202) 927-6202 or Victoria Dettmar at (202) 927-6211.

A notice of availability of the draft EIS will be announced in the 

Federal Register

 and served on parties to the proceeding.

Issuance of Final Design Approval System 80+ Design; ASEA-Brown Boveri-Combustion Engineering 




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued a final design approval (FDA) to Asea-Brown Boveri-Combustion
Engineering (ABB-CE) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52, Appendix O, for the System 80+ standard design. This FDA allows
the System 80+ standard design to be referenced in an application for a construction permit or operating license pursuant
to 10 CFR Part 50, or in an application for a combined license pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52.


In addition, ABB-CE has completed the technical review stage of design certification pursuant to the applicable
requirements of Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 52. The staff performed its technical review of the ABB-CE Standard Safety
Analysis Report-Design Certification (CESSAR-DC), certified design material, and technical specifications
in accordance with the standards for review of design certification applications stated in 10 CFR Section 52.48 that
are applicable and technically relevant to the System 80+ standard design, including the exemptions and applicable
regulations identified in Section 1.6 of the final safety evaluation report (FSER).





On the basis of its evaluation and independent analyses, as discussed in the FSER, the staff concludes that, subject
to satisfactory completion of the System 80+ design control document (DCD), ABB-CE's application for design
certification compiles with those portions of 10 CFR Section 52.47 that are applicable and technically relevant
to the System 80+ standard design. Therefore, the staff and the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards will use
the System 80+ design and will rely on it in the administrative review phase of the design certification rulemaking
process in accordance with 10 CFR 52.51.




A copy of the FDA has been placed in the NRC's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
D.C. 20037, for review by interested persons.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Amended Proposed Rule Change by National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. Relating to the Eligibility of Disputes for Arbitration</DOCTITLE>



July 26, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on July 15, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing to amend Part I, Section 3, and Part III, Section 15 of the Code of Arbitration Procedure (``Code'')
to permit the Director to delegate the duties and responsibilities of the Director and to permit the Director of Arbitration
to make final determinations regarding the eligibility of claims for arbitration under the Code. Below is the text
of the proposed rule change. Proposed new language is italicized; proposed deletions are in brackets.



Code of Arbitration Procedure



Director of Arbitration



Sec. 3. The Board of Governors of the Association shall appoint a Director of Arbitration (

hereinafter ``Director''

) who shall be charged with the performance of all administrative duties and functions in connection with matters
submitted for arbitration pursuant to this Code. 

The Director

 [He] shall be directly responsible to the National Arbitration Committee and shall report to it at periodic intervals
established by the Committee and at such other times as called upon by the Committee to do so. 

The duties and functions of the Director may be delegated as appropriate by the Director. In the event of the incapacitation,
resignation, removal, or other permanent or indefinite inability of the Director to perform the duties and responsibilities
of the Director, the President or an Executive Vice President of the Association may appoint an interim Director.



* * * * *



[Time Limitation on Submission] Eligibility



Sec. 15 (a

) No dispute, claim or controversy shall be eligible for submission to arbitration under this Code where six (6) years
have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise to the [act or] dispute, claim or controversy. This section shall
not extend or limit applicable statutes of limitations [nor shall it apply to any case which is directed to arbitration
by a court of competent jurisdiction].



(b) After the filing of a statement of claim, counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party claim (hereinafter ``claim'')
pursuant to Section 13 or 25 of the Code, the Director of Arbitration shall determine if the claim is eligible for submission
to arbitration by determining if the claim alleges that less than six (6) years have elapsed between the occurrence
or event giving rise to the dispute, claim or controversy and filing of the claim. If the claim does not state clearly,
that less than six (6) years have elapsed between the occurrence or event giving rise to the dispute, claim or controversy
and filing, the Director may ask the claimant to modify the claim, within a time period set by the Director, to so state.
The Director will determine the eligibility of the claim for submission to arbitration either on the basis of the claim
as stated in the original claim or, if modified, on the basis of the modified claim.

(c) Following service of a claim, but prior to the earlier of (1) the date the parties are notified of the appointment
of the arbitrators pursuant to Sections 13 or 19 of the Code, or (2) the date the Director appoints an arbitrator to consider
prehearing issues pursuant to Section 32(e) of the Code, a responding party disputing the eligibility of a claim shall,
along with, or after, submitting an executed Uniform Submission Agreement and any fees or deposits required under
the Code, submit a notice of objection to the Director of Arbitration supported by statements of fact and documentary
evidence asserting that more than six (6) years have elapsed between the occurrence or event giving rise to the dispute,
claim or controversy and filing. The claimant and any other party may respond to the notice of objection within the
time period set by the Director. The Director shall promptly determine on the basis of the written record only, after
considering any responses timely submitted, if the claim is eligible for submission to arbitration by determining
if the disputing party's objections and assertions regarding eligibility:

(i) contradict the allegations in the claim relating to eligibility;

(ii) are supported by documentary evidence; and,

(iii) are not contradicted by other allegations which, if true, would prevail.

(d) Any determination by the Director pursuant to subparagraph (b) or (c) is final.

(e) Any determination by the Director pursuant to subparagraph (b) or (c) that a claim is ineligible:

(i) shall not limit the right of any party to offer evidence concerning the event or occurrence which was the basis of
the eligibility determination at any other stage of the proceeding on the claim for any purpose other than contesting
the eligibility of the claim determined to be ineligible;

(ii) shall not bar a claimant from bringing the claim before a judicial forum, notwithstanding any existing predispute
arbitration agreement;

(iii) shall not affect the rights and remedies of the claimant with respect to such claim, notwithstanding any existing
predispute arbitration agreement; and,

(iv) shall mean that the limitation period on eligibility set forth in Subsection (a) shall continue to run as though
the claim had never been filed.

(f) Any determination by the Director relating to eligibility shall set forth in writing the occurrence or event that
was the basis for the determination.

(g) No party shall seek to enforce any agreement to arbitrate if the claim has been determined to be ineligible under
this Section.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Amendment to Section 3 of the Code



The current provisions of Section 3 of the Code provide for the appointment of a Director of Arbitration by the NASD
Board of Governors to perform all administrative duties and functions in connection with matters submitted to the
NASD for arbitration. The Director has, on occasion, found it necessary to delegate certain functions of the Director
to other senior management employees of the NASD's Arbitration Department, especially as a result of the significant
growth in the Department's staff and workload. The NASD believes this delegation power is inherent in the authority
of the Director to manage the functions of the NASD's Arbitration Department. Nevertheless, the NASD is proposing
to amend Section 3 of the Code to expressly provide for such delegation.

The proposed rule change to Section 3 provides that the duties and functions of the Director may be delegated as appropriate
by the Director. Further, in the event that the Director has been incapacitated, resigned, removed or has been permanently
or indefinitely disabled from the performance of the duties and functions of the Director, the proposed rule change
provides that the President of the Association or an Executive Vice President may appoint an interim Director to perform
the functions and responsibilities of the Director.

The purpose of this rule change is to clarify the lines of authority and delegation powers of the Director under the
Code. The amendment also specifies that the power to delegate functions resides with the Director unless circumstances
occur which render the Director permanently or indefinitely unable to perform the duties and functions of the Director.



Amendment to Section 15 of the Code



The current provisions of Section 15 of the Code specify that claims or controversies are not eligible for submission
to arbitration where 6 years have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise to the matter. Section 15 does not
specify the party responsible for determining whether 6 years have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise
to the matter. As a result, there have been conflicting decisions over who possesses such authority; the Director,
the courts or arbitrators. In addition, the current provisions of Section 15 do not provide a procedure for a respondent
to challenge the eligibility of a claim, and there is no requirement that the event or occurrence establishing the
eligibility of a claim be identified.



Express Grant of Authority to Director to Determine Eligibility



The NASD is proposing to amend Section 15 to add six new subsections giving the Director the authority to determine
whether the claim alleges that less than six (6) years have elapsed between the occurrence or event giving rise to the
dispute, claim or controversy and filing of the claim. Under the proposed rule change the Director's eligibility
determination will be final and will not be subject to review by the arbitrators under Section 35 of the Code. Further,
by placing the authority to make final eligibility determinations, as a matter of the contract to arbitrate, in the
hands of the Director, the proposed rule change is intended to foreclose attempts by parties to an arbitration to seek
different eligibility rulings from the courts or arbitrators. The NASD believes that this amendment is consistent
with recent court decisions on the question of arbitrability. It is beyond dispute that, unless the parties have agreed
otherwise, the courts, not the arbitrators, determine if a contract to arbitrate exists between the parties. See
AT&T Technologies, Inc.

 v. 

Communications Workers of America,

 475 U.S. 643, 649 (1986). Thus, 

unless the parties have agreed otherwise,

 the courts determine the scope of the agreement to arbitrate, including whether a matter is eligible for arbitration
on subject matter, timeliness or other grounds. 

Id.

 (emphasis added). The NASD expressly intends that the proposed amendment to Section 15 will constitute the agreement
of the parties to have the issue of eligibility decided by the Director of Arbitration.

Arbitration agreements are contractual obligations which are governed by general principles of contract interpretation.


Haviland

 v. 

Goldman Sachs & Co.,

 736 F.Supp. 507 (S.D.N.Y. 1990); 

Nilson

 v. 

Prudential-Bache Securities,

 761 F.Supp. 279 (S.D.N.Y. 1991). Therefore, unless the purpose or provisions of the agreement to arbitrate run counter
to the Federal Arbitration Act or public policy, parties may agree to any terms they desire (

See, e.g., Apollo Computer, Inc.

 v. 

Berg,

 886 F.2d 469, 473 (1st Cir. 1989) (``Parties may . . . agree to allow the arbitrator to decide both whether
a particular dispute is arbitrable as well as the merits of the dispute.''), and the courts must give effect to such
freely negotiated terms. 

See Snyder

 v. 

Smith,

 736 F.2d 409, 419 (7th Cir. 1984).

Because Section 15 does not specify who has the authority to determine if a claim is eligible for submission to arbitration,
the courts have construed that term of the agreement and have routinely held that it is a question of fact relating to
the scope of the agreement to arbitrate and that such questions of fact are for the courts to decide. 

See, e.g., Edward D. Jones & Co.

 v. 

Sorrells,

 957 F.2d 509, 514 (7th Cir. 1992), 

citing as controlling, AT&T, supra,

 at 649. The NASD, however, is expressly intending that under amended Section 15 the Director will make eligibility
determinations; the effect of the amendment being that the parties to an agreement to arbitrate before the NASD will
have agreed that the Director alone will determine if the claim is eligible for submission to arbitration before the
NASD.

In addition, current Section 15, entitled ``Time Limitation on Eligibility,'' is proposed to be retitled ``Eligibility''
and renumbered Subsection 15(a). The language of current Section 15 (proposed new Subsection 15(a)) is also being
amended to eliminate the provision that states that the six year eligibility limitation does not apply to cases directed
to arbitration by a court. Therefore, a court order directing the parties to arbitration is not a determination that
the matter is eligible for arbitration under the rules of the NASD. These changes are intended to further clarify the
distinction between issues related to eligibility, which the forum is entitled to control, and statutes of limitations,
which are governed by applicable law. The relationship is discussed in more detail below.

Determination of Eligibility Upon Filing of a Claim



New Subsection 15(b) provides that when a claim is filed pursuant to Section 13 or 25 of the Code (i.e., when the Statement
of Claim, Uniform Submission Agreement, each properly executed, and required fees have been received by the Arbitration
Department and the Statement of Claim is ready to be served), the Director of Abritration will examine each claim for
relief to determine if it alleges less than six (6) years have elapsed between the occurrence or event giving rise to
the dispute, claim or controversy and filing of the claim. For example, if a claim seeks recovery of the purchase price
of an investment on the basis of misstatements or lack of suitability 

at the time of purchase,

 and the purchase occurred nine (9) years before the claim was filed, it will be ineligible for arbitration. If, however,
the same claim seeks recovery for loss of the value of the investment on the basis of misstatements or omissions which
caused the claimant to refrain from selling the investment, and the misstatements or omissions occurred five (5)
years ago, the claim will be eligible for arbitration.






In each example, the Director of Arbitration will not be making eligibility determinations on the basis of subjective
evaluations of whether the eligibility of the claim is proven, but, rather, solely on an objective determination
of whether the claim has stated that the occurrence or event giving rise to the claim took place within six (6) years.






In addition, proposed Subsection 15(b) provides that if the Statement of Claim fails to clearly state that less than
six (6) years have elapsed between the occurrence or event giving rise to the dispute, claim or controversy and filing,
the Director may ask the claimant to modify the Statement of Claim to do so.
 The time limit for a response will be set in communications with the claimant. If the claimant fails or refuses to respond,
the Director of Arbitration will determine the eligibility of the claim for submission to arbitration on the basis
of the Statement of Claim then on file. Thus, while the Director will give the claimant a chance to correct any deficiencies
to permit the claimant to establish the eligibility of the claim, the opportunity will not be open-ended.





Determination of Disputed Eligibility



Proposed new Subsection 15(c) provides that a responding party, after service of the Statement of Claim, but prior
to the date the parties are notified of the appointment of the arbitrators for the hearing or the appointment of an arbitrator
to consider prehearing issues, may file a notice of objection to dispute the determination of the Director of Arbitration
that the Statement of Claim alleges that less than six (6) years have elapsed between the event or occurrence giving
rise to the dispute, claim or controversy giving rise to the claim and filing. The notice must be supported by statements
of fact and documentary evidence and may only be submitted along with or after the responding party submits an executed
Uniform Submission Agreement and pays any fees or deposits required under the Code.






Following submission of the notice of objection, the Director of Arbitration must notify the other parties that one
of the responding parties has disputed the eligibility of the claim.
 The Director will then permit the claimant and any other party to respond to the allegations of the responding party
with respect to eligibility within such time period as the Director of Arbitration establishes in communications
with the parties.

<PARENT> FR940802-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

After considering the written record only, and any responses timely submitted, the Director will determine if the
disputing party's allegations with respect to eligibility: (1) contradict the allegations in the Statement of Claim
relating to eligibility; (2) are supported by documentary evidence; and (3) are not contradicted by other allegations
which, if true, would prevail over the contradictory allegations of the disputing responding party. If the Director
makes affirmative determinations on all of these matters, the claim will be ineligible.

For example, if in the scenario cited above, the claimant had stated that the transaction had occurred within five
(5) years of filing, that would have been enough to make it eligible. If the respondent objected and in turn asserted
as a statement of fact, in contradiction of the claimant's allegation, that the transaction had occurred nine (9)
years before filing and attached a copy of the claimant's account statement in support of the allegation, the claimant
would have to come forward with an allegation further disputing the account statement in order to prevent a determination
that the claim is ineligible. An allegation that the account statement is fraudulent would be sufficient to overcome
the disputing party's allegation, as would production of an account statement supporting the transaction date alleged
by the claimant.
 Therefore, the proposed rule establishes a presumption in favor of the eligibility of a claim which can only be overcome
by an undisputed showing to the contrary.







Proposed Subsection 15(f) requires the Director's determination be in writing and set forth the occurrence or event
that is the basis for the eligibility determination.



Finality and Effect of an Eligibility Determination



Proposed Subsections 15(d) and (e) resolve several issues relating to eligibility determinations. First, under
proposed subsection 15(d) any determination by the Director will be final. This provision is intended to foreclose
relitigation of eligibility before the arbitrators. Because the terms of the proposed rule provide that the Director
will determine if a claim is eligible for submission to arbitration, the finality of the determination precludes
an arbitrator from revisiting the issue under any circumstances.






Second, a determination that a claim is ineligible will not: (1) limit the right of any party to offer evidence concerning
the event or occurrence which was the basis of the eligibility determination at any other stage of the proceeding on
the claim for any purpose other than contesting the eligibility of the claim determined to be ineligible; (2) bar a
claimant from bringing the substantive claim before a judicial forum, notwithstanding the fact that the parties
have an arbitration agreement; or (3) affect the rights and remedies of the claimant with respect to such claim provided
by applicable law. The eligibility rule never was intended to serve as an election of remedy provision that would eviscerate
any surviving causes of action under applicable law after six years have elapsed. The intent of this proposed provision
is to ensure that the effect of the eligibility determination is limited solely to the issue of access to the NASD's
arbitration forum.

Finally, proposed Subsection (e)(iv) provides that if a claim is ineligible for arbitration, the limitation period
on eligibility set forth in Subsection (a) shall continue to run as though the claim had never been filed. This is a relation
back provision that is intended to prevent the filing of an ineligible claim from tolling the running of the eligibility
provision while the NASD determines that the claim is ineligible. Thus, for example, if a claim is filed and the claimant
fails to modify the claim pursuant to the Director's request under Subsection (b), or the claimant fails to overcome
the respondent's notice of objection under Subsection (c), the Director may determine that the claim is ineligible.
If the claimant later resubmits the claim pleading facts showing the claim would have been eligible when it was originally
submitted, but the time period has subsequently run, the claim will not be eligible.



Avoidance of Vexatious Litigation



Proposed new Subsection 15(g) prohibits parties from seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate a claim which has
been determined to be ineligible for arbitration by the NASD. This provision is intended to prevent collateral attacks
and vexatious litigation over eligibility determinations. Its effect is to bar a respondent (or a claimant) from
seeking a court order either to compel the NASD to accept the case for arbitration, or to compel a claimant (or respondent)
into arbitration in another forum, after the Director has determined the claim to be ineligible. Thus, members would
be prohibited from moving to compel arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (``AAA'') or another
self regulatory organization (``SRO''), for instance, if AAA or the SRO is an alternative forum choice in arbitration
agreements, after the NASD's Director of Arbitration has declared the claim to be ineligible for arbitration before
the NASD. Under this provision members could be subject to disciplinary action for seeking to enforce an agreement
to arbitrate.



Relationship of Eligibility to Statute of Limitations Defenses



As discussed above with respect to tolling, the NASD intends that the proposed rule change will sharpen the distinction
between eligibility and statutes of limitation. The Director's determination that a claim is eligible for arbitration
has no effect on whether a relevant statute of limitations operates as a defense to a claim.

For example, a claim which is based on an event which occurred five years ago would be eligible for arbitration; however,
if the claim were based on a private right of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the respondent
could still plead the 1 year/3 year statute of limitations on such actions as a defense before the arbitrators. Similarly,
if the claim were based on an event which occurred seven (7) years ago, and which was based on a breach of fiduciary duty
for which tolling might apply under applicable state law, the fact that it was ineligible for arbitration would not
affect the ability of the claimant to bring the claim for relief in court and to assert equitable tolling as a counterdefense
to the respondent's statute of limitations defense. Thus, the Director's eligibility determination will not affect
the substantive claim or defenses.

<TEXT>
 

Finally, the NASD is aware that under New York law, which is often applicable to an arbitration or to one or more parties
to a proceeding, a respondent in an arbitration case must file an application for an order enjoining the arbitration
of a claim on statute of limitations grounds within twenty days of service of the claim in order to preserve any statute
of limitations defense for use in a subsequent court proceeding. The filing of such an application will have no effect
on the Director's eligibility determination; if the claim is eligible, the respondent can raise his statute of limitations
defense before the arbitrator, if it is ineligible, he can raise the defense in court.

The NASD intends to make the proposed amendments to Section 15 applicable to all claims filed after the effective date
of the amendments without regard to when the cause of action accrued or arose, or the timing of the event or occurrence
giving rise to the dispute. The NASD will advise its members that the proposed amendment will apply retroactively
to all claims brought after the effective date of the amendment. The NASD will also advise its members and associated
persons that they have expressly agreed that under the NASD's rules all agreements currently in effect are subject
to the amendment to the Code. Although one court has recently held that amendments to the Code do not apply to claims
which have already accrued to require arbitration of the claim,
 the NASD believes that case was a decision about the scope of the agreement to arbitrate_

i.e., 

whether the parties had agreed to arbitrate the particular claim_a subject which courts have virtually always held
is for the courts to decide.







The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act in
that the proposed rule change will protect investors and the public interest by facilitating the arbitration process
through expeditious resolution of eligibility issues arising under Section 15 of the Code by authorizing the Director
to determine whether a claim or controversy occurred less than 6 years prior to filing in the event eligibility is disputed
by a responding party. Moreover, in order to protect investors and the public interest by avoiding disruptions and
uncertainty about the authority to act under the Code, the NASD is proposing to amend Section 3 of the Code to permit
the duties and functions of the Director to be delegated by the Director or the Executive Vice President, Member Services.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.



(C

) 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



The original proposed rule change was published for comment by the SEC on October 26, 1993 in Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 33108. The SEC received three comment letters in response.
 In addition, the SEC, in letters dated January 31, 1994
 and February 4, 1994,
 requested responses from the NASD on certain issues raised by the commenters and on other questions related to the
proposed rule change.







Responses to SEC Questions and Comments



With respect to the first question in the SEC's January 31, 1994 letter, and those of two of the commenters, relating
to the perception that the proposed rule change would permit the Arbitration Department staff to exercise ``significant
case-related [discretion on] eligibility determination[s],'' the NASD responds in two parts. First, any arbitration
forum has the inherent right to limit access to its forum in order to preserve and direct resources to the disposition
of cases in the manner it deems most efficient. The Code currently limits access to the forum to those cases where the
dispute, claim or controversy occurred within six years of submission of the claim. Second, the Arbitration Department
currently determines the eligibility of a claim for arbitration as a matter of the sufficiency of the allegations
in a statement of claim. The Department examines the statement of claim to determine if it alleges events or occurrences
on which the claim is based and which, on their face, are within six years of the filing of the claim. If it does, the claim
is eligible for arbitration. If the respondent contests the eligibility of a claim, the issue is currently resolved
by the courts or the arbitrators, depending on where the respondent pursued resolution of the issue.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940802-2-00095 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940802-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed rule change brings the issue of eligibility, both as a threshold matter and with respect to disputes among
the parties over eligibility, within the authority of the Director of Arbitration to decide. The threshold test will
remain the sufficiency of the allegations in a claim. Sufficiency in this context does not require the claimant to
sustain the burden of proof of eligibility to any level, it is merely an inquiry into whether the claim on its face states
when the events or occurrences giving rise to the claim occurred. If the facts alleged in a claim are ambiguous or are
not sufficient on their face to determine if a claim is eligible for arbitration, the staff will advise the claimant
and request modification of the statement of claim. If the claimant does not modify the statement of claim to permit
a determination of eligibility, the Director will determine if the claim is eligible on the basis of the claim as stated.
 If the modification discloses facts which show that the claim is ineligible, it will be rejected as ineligible. The
inquiry to be made by the Director in these instances is objective and goes to the existence of statements of facts in
the claim, not subjective weighing of evidence.





Under the proposed rule change, in the event a respondent disputes the facts alleged by the claimant as supporting
the eligibility of the claim following the threshold determination that the claim is eligible, the respondent carries
a heavy burden of showing that the timing of the events or occurrences giving rise to the claim are other than those alleged
by the claimant. In the absence of proof that is not subject to reasonable dispute that the claim is ineligible, the
Director will presume that the claim is eligible.

Paragraph 2(a) of the Commission's January 31, 1994 letter identified a distinction between then-proposed Subsections
15(a) and 15(b) in that the latter sets forth a procedure for determining eligibility, while the former does not. The
NASD agrees with the Commission's concerns and has amended the proposed rule change pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to
clarify the procedures. Amendment No. 1 also addresses the concern set forth in paragraph 2(b) of the January 31, 1994,
letter about the effect of a threshold determination of eligibility on the claimant's right to seek a judicial remedy.

With respect to the question in paragraph 3 of the January 31, 1994 letter, the proposed rule contemplates that eligibility
will be determined prior to the appointment of the arbitrators, whether as a threshold matter only, as a result of a
challenge by a respondent or both. The NASD believes that the amendments described herein contemplate that eligibility
determinations made by the Director are final and that such determinations resolve the question of whether a claim
can be submitted to arbitration. Once submitted, the issue cannot be revisited.
 Disputes over eligibility must be raised and resolved within the context of the process described in proposed new
Section 15, or they are waived. The NASD does not believe an amendment is required to address this issue.





Responses to Commenters



With respect to the arguments of the commenters that the proposed rule change contradicts the holdings of various
courts on the issue of eligibility determinations,
 the NASD does not agree. Arbitration is a creature of contract, 

AT&T Technologies, supra,

 and it is for the parties, through the choice of a forum, to determine the terms of the contract. 

See, e.g., U.S. Steelworkers

 v. 

Warrior Gulf Navigation Co.,

 363 U.S. 574 (1960). There is, therefore, no impediment erected by the courts which would prevent the NASD from adopting
a rule which permits the Director of Arbitration to decide issues affecting access to the NASD's arbitration forum.
further, the proposed rule, by its terms, does not affect the substance of a claim_an eligibility determination by
the Director does not bar a party from asserting the claim in court.





Another commenter asserted that under the proposed rule the Director of Arbitration would be conducting fact-finding
hearings to determine eligibility.
 The proposed rule will not produce such a result. As discussed in more detail above, eligibility will be determined
as a matter of the sufficiency of the allegations in a statement of claim, not as a subjective decision regarding disputed
facts.





Finally, a third commenter
 raised four issues: (1) whether the time limit for filing a claim under the proposed eligibility rule can be tolled;
(2) whether the proposed rule will permit the Director of Arbitration to bifurcate claims by declining to take jurisdiction
over ineligible portions of a claim; (3) how bifurcated claims will proceed; and (4) whether it is fair to bar a party
from seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate where the claim has been ruled ineligible.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940802-2-00096 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940802-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

On the first issue, the courts have said that the time limits in an eligibility rule such as Section 15 of the Code are
contractual, they do not operate like a statute of limitations, and, therefore, they are generally not subject to
tolling. 

See, e.g., AT&T Technologies, supra; Paine Webber Inc.

 v. 

Hofmann,

 984 F.2d 1372 (3d Cir. 1993). The NASD has not applied tolling to eligibility issues historically, and does not plan
to apply tolling under the proposed rule.
 Contrary to the assertion of the commenter, application of the eligibility limit without tolling will not deprive
investors of their right to recourse. An ineligible claimant will retain his right to seek relief in the courts to the
same extent as it existed prior to filing the claim in arbitration.





On the second issue, also raised in the February 4, 1994 letter from the SEC, the proposed rule change will require bifurcation
of claims to the extent claims which are based on events or occurrences more than six years prior to the filing of the
claim will be ineligible for arbitration. Thus, where a statement of claim sets forth events or occurrences as the
basis for claims for relief, those which occurred less than six years ago will be eligible for arbitration, while the
claimant would be required to pursue his remedies in court for claims based on events or occurrences more than six years
old. In the NASD's view, bifurcation is an acceptable result in such cases. 

See Pompano-Windy City Partners

 v. 

Bear Stearns & Co.,

 698 F.Supp. 504 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), citing 

Dean Witter Reynolds

 v. 

Byrd,

 470 U.S. 213, 225 (1985) (White, J. concurring).

With respect to the third issue, the NASD takes no position on how such bifurcated claims should proceed. The NASD's
Arbitration Department manages its docket without regard to issues facing participants in other forums. To the extent
a court permits or requires the ineligible portion of a bifurcated matter to proceed, it is entirely within its power
to do so.

Finally, on the fourth issue, it is not only fair, but essential for public arbitration claimants, for the proposed
rule change to bar parties from seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate where the claim has been determined to
be ineligible. For example, if a claim is ruled ineligible, the proposed rule will bar the respondent from seeking
an order from a court compelling the arbitration of the case. This will relieve the claimant of defending against such
collateral attacks on the eligibility determination while pursuing his remedies in court, a situation which would
be vexatious and expensive for claimants.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or 

B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



The NASD's proposed rule change addresses an important issue increasingly common in arbitration proceedings, namely,
the use of contentious litigation tactics to determine whether claims are eligible for arbitration under NASD rules.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. The Commission
requests that, in addition to any general comments concerning whether the proposed rule change is consistent with
Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act, commentators address the following:



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940802-2-00097 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940802-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. The proposed rule change would permit respondents to challenge the eligibility of a claim at any time before the
parties are notified of the appointment of the arbitrators for the hearing or the appointment of an arbitrator to consider
prehearing issues. Should respondents be required to raise their objections at an earlier point in the process, for
instance, not later than the time by which they file their answer to the Statement of Claim?
2. The proposed rule change is based upon a rule approved by the Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration (``SICA'')
at its regular meeting on April 21, 1993. The form of the rule approved by SICA provided, in pertinent part:



(c) A determination by the Director of Arbitration pursuant to subparagraph (b) that a claim is ineligible shall not
constitute a bar to asserting the underlying claim in a judicial forum. With respect to any such ineligible claims,
the parties will have available to them the rights and remedies provided by applicable law, notwithstanding, any
(i) existing predispute arbitration agreement or (ii) decisions on eligibility. No party shall seek to enforce any
agreement to arbitrate where the claim has been determined to be ineligible under this section.



Do the pertinent provisions of proposed sections 15(d) and 15(e) differ substantively from the rule approved by SICA?
If not, does the proposed rule change set forth the consequences of a determination of ineligibility in a manner that
will be more readily understandable to all parties, including 

pro se

 claimants, than the form of the rule approved by SICA?
3. The Commission understands that proposed Section 15(e)(iv) is intended to address claims that are filed with the
NASD more than once. For those claims that previously have been submitted, and have been determined to be ineligible
under Section 15, there would be no tolling of time periods for purposes of the eligibility rule with respect to the
time period during which the NASD previously considered the claim. Accordingly, a claimant who resubmits a matter
in revised form a second time would have to calculate the eligibility time period from the date of occurrence or event
giving rise to the dispute. Is this understanding fairly implied from Section 15(e)(iv)?
Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to File Number SR-NASD-93-51 and should be submitted by
August 23, 1994.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Order Adjusting the Standard Foreign Fare Level Index</DOCTITLE>




The International Air Transportation Competition Act (IATCA), P.L. 96-192, requires that the Department,
as successor to the Civil Aeronautics Board, establish a Standard Foreign Fare Level (SFFL) by adjusting the SFFL
base periodically by percentage changes in actual operating costs per available seat- mile (ASM). Order 80-2-69
established the first interim SFFL, and Order 
94-5-40 established the currently effective two-month SFFL applicable through July 31, 1994. 
In establishing the SFFL for the two-month period beginning August 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based
on the year ended March 31, 1994 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced
monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. 
By Order 94-7-36 fares may be increased by the following adjustment factors over the October 1979 level:

 

Atlantic 
1.3099 
Latin America 
1.3538 
Pacific 
2.0087 
Canada 
1.4405

<DOCTITLE>Order Adjusting International Cargo Rate Flexibility Level</DOCTITLE>



Policy Statement PS-109, implemented by Regulation ER-1322 of the Civil Aeronautics Board and adopted
by the Department, established geographic zones of cargo pricing flexibility within which certain cargo rate tariffs
filed by carriers would be subject to suspension only in extraordinary circumstances.

The Standard Foreign Rate Level (SFRL) for a particular market is the rate in effect on April 1, 1982, adjusted for the
cost experience of the carriers in the applicable ratemaking entity. The first adjustment was effective April 1,
1983. By Order 94-5-41, the Department established the currently effective SFRL adjustments.

In establishing the SFRL for the two-month period beginning August 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based
on the year ended March 31, 1994 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced
monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department.

By Order 94-7-37 cargo rates may be adjusted by the following adjustment factors over the April 1, 1982
level:




Atlantic
1.0995

Western Hemisphere
1.1360

Pacific

Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for Screening Devices To Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice establishes Model Specifications for the performance and testing of alcohol screening devices. These
devices test for the presence of alcohol, and may use breath or other bodily fluids, such as saliva, to do so. NHTSA is
establishing these specifications to support State laws that target youthful offenders (i.e., ``zero tolerance''
laws) and the Department of Transportation's regulations on Alcohol Misuse Prevention, and in recognition of industry
efforts to develop new technologies (e.g., non-breath devices) that measure alcohol content from bodily fluids.



A Conforming Products List (CPL) will be published identifying the devices that meet NHTSA's Model Specifications.
The CPL can serve as a guide for those interested in purchasing devices that screen for the presence of alcohol.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 15, 1992 (57 FR 59382), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) published a notice of proposed rulemaking
(NPRM) to implement the ``Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991,'' which requires alcohol testing
programs in the aviation, motor carrier, rail, and mass transit industries. The Research and Special Programs Administration
(RSPA) proposed similar regulations for the pipeline industry. In general, the NPRM proposed to prohibit covered
employees from performing safety-sensitive functions when test results indicate alcohol concentration levels
of 0.04 or greater. The NPRM proposed to apply slightly different consequences to employees having alcohol concentration
levels of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04.



To determine alcohol concentration, the NPRM proposed to use breath as measured by those evidential breath testing
devices (EBTs) listed on NHTSA's Conforming Products List (CPL) which are capable of providing a printed result,
sequentially numbering the tests conducted, and distinguishing alcohol from acetone at the 0.02 BAC level. EBT's
listed on NHTSA's CPL have been tested and determined to meet the agency's Model Specifications for EBTs, which were
last amended on September 17, 1993 (58 FR 48705).

In a final rule published on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7340), DOT amended its regulations and added procedures for conducting
alcohol testing in transportation workplaces (49 CFR Part 40). This final rule differed from the NPRM in a number of
respects. The final rule required the use of breath testing devices listed on the CPL for EBTs. For screening devices,
it permitted the use of EBTs on the CPL that do not print the result, but only if confirmation tests are conducted using
EBTs listed on the CPL which are capable of providing a printed result. (These devices must also be capable of distinguishing
alcohol from acetone at the 0.02 BAC level and sequentially numbering the tests conducted.)

NHTSA published a separate notice in the same issue of the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 7372) proposing to adopt Model Specifications and a CPL that would permit additional alcohol testing devices
to be used for screening purposes. In its notice, NHTSA proposed to establish Model Specifications for alcohol screening
devices, which differ from the Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing devices in a number of important
respects. It stated that the proposed Model Specifications are designed to test whether devices are suitable for
screening, not evidential, purposes and that they are designed to test the performance of devices that may use bodily
fluids other than breath (such as saliva) to determine the presence of alcohol.

NHTSA requested comments on these proposed Model Specifications.

Comments Received



The agency received twenty comments in response to the notice. Comments were received from manufacturers of screening
devices and related equipment, persons representing sectors of the transportation industry subject to the DOT regulations
(including rail, transit, motor carriers and pipelines) and substance abuse program administrators, an interested
individual and a health professional.



General Comments



The comments, in general, were supportive of the agency's proposed Model Specifications. Some of the comments praised
the notice for proposing to increase flexibility, stimulate development and reduce barriers and cost for those charged
with implementing DOT's new alcohol testing rules.

A number of commenters raised concerns about the schedule NHTSA would following publishing the final Model Specifications.
DOT's final rule becomes effective for large employers (in general, with 50 or more safety-sensitive employees)
on January 1, 1995. The commenters, therefore, urged the agency to issue the Model Specifications and approve conforming
devices prior to that date. Two commenters recommended that if final rules and product evaluations are not completed
within a specified period of time (one commenter suggested August 1 1994, another mid-1994), the effective date of
DOT's final rule should be delayed.

In response to these comments, NHTSA has sought to publish the final Model Specifications as quickly as possible.
As described further below, we intend to begin testing immediately, and hope to publish within 30 days from today's
date a Conforming Products List (CPL) of screening devices that have been tested to date and conform to these Model
Specifications. The CPL will be updated and published periodically, as further testing is completed.

A number of commenters raised issues that pertain to other notices that were published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 15, 1994, such as DOT's final rule (59 FR 7340) on Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol
Testing Programs (49 CFR Part 40) or the final rules and common preamble (59 FR 7302) on the Limitation on Alcohol Use
by Transportation Workers. Others raised issues that are also outside the scope of NHTSA's notice and request for
comments. For example, one respondent commented that all alcohol testing should be performed by law enforcement
representatives. Another respondent urged the Department to permit testing to be conducted only using evidential
breath testing devices. Other commenters suggested that the use of non-breath alcohol tests (which use blood, saliva
or urine samples) as a condition for employment is an invasion of privacy and a violation of individual rights.

NHTSA's Model Specifications contain the performance criteria and methods for the testing of alcohol screening
devices. It does not address whether such devices are permitted to be used to perform screening tests, who is authorized
to administer such tests or who is subject to them. These issues are addressed instead in DOT's final rules.

Other commenters raised questions or concerns regarding the Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing
Devices, last revised on September 17, 1993 (58 F.R. 48705), or the Model Specifications for Breath Alcohol Ignition
Interlock Devices (BAIIDs), published on April 7, 1992 (57 F.R. 11772).
Issues such as these are outside the scope of the notice published in February proposing Model Specifications for
alcohol screening devices, and therefore have not been addressed in this notice adopting Model Specifications.


Specific Comments on Model Specifications


No comments were received regarding some portions of the proposed Model Specifications. These portions have been
adopted without change. For further discussion regarding these portions, interested persons should review the
February notice. Portions of the proposed Model Specifications that generated comment, and the issues raised in
the comments, are discussed below.


1. Purpose, Scope, Classification and Definitions


In its February 15, 1994 notice, NHTSA proposed to define an alcohol screening device as a device that is used to detect
the presence of 0.020 or more BAC, and that indicates the test result by numerical read-out or by other means, such as
by the use of lights or color changes. All comments addressing these aspects of the Model Specifications supported
the definition. They have been adopted without change.
The notice proposed that the Model Specifications would provide that devices may measure any bodily fluid (including
blood, breath or saliva), but that the output must be in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) units. It explains that
NHTSA believes the relationship between BAC and the bodily fluid being measured be properly established so that a
means for evaluating the device can be devised, and that NHTSA considers use of a one-to-one conversion factor between
blood and saliva to be appropriate. NHTSA requested comments in the February 15 notice on the proposed use of a one-to-one
conversion factor for saliva, and on what may constitute acceptable criteria for bodily fluids other than saliva,
blood and breath.
All comments regarding the one-to-one conversion factor and the applicability of the proposed Model Specifications
to blood, breath and saliva were supportive of NHTSA's proposal. These aspects of the Model Specifications have been
adopted without change.
Comments were received from the manufacturer of an alcohol screening device that uses ocular vapor analysis. The
type of analysis used by this device measures alcohol using vapors from the surface of the eye. The commenter requested
that the model specifications include the ocular vapor analysis technique as an acceptable and recognized method.
The Model Specifications, as proposed in the agency's February 15 notice and as finally adopted in today's 

Federal Register

 notice, define an alcohol screening device as a device that may measure ``any bodily fluid'' for the purpose of detecting
the presence of 0.020 or more BAC. This definition is clearly broad enough to include use of the ocular vapor analysis
technology.
NHTSA did not include in its proposal, however, testing procedures for all conceivable types of screening technologies.
Rather, it proposed testing procedures for the types of screening technologies currently most commonly available.
The notice explained that the agency would modify and improve the Model Specifications as new data and test procedures
become available, and that it would alter the test procedures, if necessary, to meet unique design features of specific
devices. If the test procedures need to be altered to test the ocular vapor analysis technology, NHTSA would make such
alterations. Any needed alterations would be published in the 

Federal Register

.
One commenter, a manufacturer of alcohol breath testing devices, raised concerns about devices that are not capable
of detecting ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol. The commenter stated that if devices cannot identify all three
of these alcohols, they will produce false negative alcohol readings.
The definition of alcohol included in the proposed Model Specifications permits alcohol screening devices to detect
different types of alcohol (including ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol), but does not require
that devices must be capable of distinguishing between each type. To determine compliance with the Model Specifications,
the agency proposed that it would conduct tests using ethanol.

NHTSA does not disagree that the potential for false negative results may exist should be a technology be employed
in a screening device that is specific to ethanol only and an individual has consumed methyl or isopropyl alcohol.
However, the agency is aware of no screening devices using such a technology. Rather, the screening devices available
today on the market generally employ technologies that are not specific to any single type of alcohol, and, therefore,
are capable of detecting (but not distinguishing between) ethanol and the other alcohols. 
As a result, and since ethanol is the alcohol most often consumed, we believe that the probability of obtaining false
negative results by screeners that conform to these Model Specifications is extremely low. The proposed definition
has been adopted without change. 


2. Statistical Accuracy


In its February 15 notice, NHTSA proposed to test alcohol screening devices at 0.008 and 0.032 BAC under normal laboratory
conditions to determine their precision and accuracy at detecting the presence of 0.020 or more BAC (Test 1), and at
0.000 BAC to determine the performance of these devices when providing blank readings (Test 2). 
The notice explained that the .008 and .032 BAC levels were selected based on criteria for precision and accuracy that
are equivalent to those used for EBTs. The criteria require that devices perform at a level of accuracy within 

#

0.005 of 0.020 BAC (thereby establishing target valves within 0.015 and 0.025 BAC), and a level of precision which
yields a standard deviation not greater than 0.0042. To achieve a confidence rate of approximately 95% in the results
of these 20 tests, we proposed to establish measurement points at 1.73 standard deviations (or 0.007 BAC) below and
above the lower and upper values, respectively (i.e., 0.015-0.007=0.008 BAC and 0.025+0.007=0.032 BAC).

One commenter expressed the opinion that the proposed method of testing does not truly reflect the accuracy standard
of 

#

0.005 BAC with standard deviation not to exceed .0042 BAC. This commenter recommended that instruments should be
tested instead at the .020 BAC level, that results should fall within the 0.15 and .025 BAC range, and that a deviation
of not more than .0042 should be maintained. The commenter's response further stated that, to achieve a confidence
rate of 95%, only 5% of the tests conducted should be outside the .015 to .025 BAC range. 
The method proposed by this commenter would require that devices identify the precise BAC level detected by the instrument.
The Model Specifications do not include such a requirement. Rather, they simply require that devices are capable
of detecting the presence of alcoholic at the 0.020 or greater BAC level. To accommodate the use of non-numerical as
well as numerical alcohol screening devices, the Model Specifications use two test points which are 1.73 times the
maximum allowed standard deviation on either side of 0.020 

#

0.005 BAC (0.008 and 0.032). The number of false positives and false negative allowed were obtained based on the use
of Student's distribution (a small sample approximation to the normal distribution). 
One commenter illustrated a range of error that would be permitted under the proposed Model Specifications, and suggested
that the Model Specifications be amended to permit a smaller range of error. Another commenter, addressing the same
concern, proposed that the Model Specifications be amended to provide for the adjustment of the test at .032. This
commenter recommends that we conduct 20 tests at .025 with no more than one false negative result and 20 tests at .015
with no more than two false positives. NHTSA believes these proposals would require that screening devices perform
at a higher level of precision than is required for EBTs. The procedures contained in the proposed Model Specifications
have been adopted without change. 


3. Test Methods 


NHTSA proposed to use a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), non-alcoholic human breath, and a calibrating unit
to test breath devices. For non-breath devices, the agency proposed to use preparations of bodily fluids or scientifically
acceptable substitutes. For example, the agency proposed to use aqueous alcohol test solutions equivalent to blood
or saliva on a one-to-one basis to test saliva devices. 
One commenter, a manufacturer of a saliva device, expressed its view that there are no fluids that are scientifically
acceptable equivalents to bodily fluids. The commenter asserted that aqueous alcohol test solutions lack the viscosity,
solid content and inhibitors that are present in bodily fluids such as saliva, and recommended that the agency instead
collect saliva specimens from individuals known to be alcohol-free. According to the commenter, the non-alcohol
saliva pool could then be spiked with various alcohol solutions for device evaluation. 
NHTSA disagrees with this respondent's comment. The agency has data finding that aqueous alcohol test solutions
are acceptable substitutes for saliva-alcohol testing purposes.
 In addition, while we agree that aqueous solutions and saliva do have different characteristics, we have no reason
to believe that these difference would interfere with the agency's ability to test the capability of saliva screening
devices to detect alcohol content. The final Model Specifications continue to provide that aqueous alcohol test
solutions will be used. 




Two commenters recommended that NHTSA use alcohol reference material 1828, obtained from the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST), to prepare all standard solutions. One of these commenters also suggested that,
following preparation, these solutions should themselves be analyzed against a referee method (enzymatic or gas
chromatography) which has been calibrated using NIST standards.

NHTSA does not plant to use NIST 1828 material in its standard solutions. However, the agency presently uses the material
for the purpose for which it was intended, as a reference material for calibration purposes, and will continue to do
so.

The agency proposed to conduct 40 trials under Test 1 (20 at .008 BAC and 20 at .032 BAC) and 20 trials under Test 2 (at .000
BAC). For reusable devices, these 60 trials would be conducted using a single unit. For disposable devices, these
60 trials would be conducted using 60 separate units.

NHTSA's notice explained that some alcohol screening devices indicate the presence of alcohol in a manner that is
unambiguous and requires no interpretation, such as by the use of a light or numerical reading. For these devices,
NHTSA proposed that Tests 1 and 2 (at .008, .032 and .000 BAC) would be performed by an investigator at the DOT Volpe National
Transportation Systems Center (VNTSC). To conform with the Model Specifications, the notice stated that the device
must perform with no positive results at .000 BAC, not more than one positive result at .008 BAC and not more than one
non-positive result at .032 BAC. If the device is capable of providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than
0.020 BAC, the device must perform with not more than one such result at .000 BAC.

NHTSA's notice explained that other devices indicate the presence of alcohol in a manner that requires interpretation
and may involve some ambiguity, such as by the use of color changes. For these devices, NHTSA proposed that Tests 1 and
2 (at .008, .032 and .000 BAC) would be performed by ten individuals who have no knowledge of test BACs and qualify as
test interpreters. VNTSC would select these individuals using manufacturer's restrictions, if any. These individuals
would be asked to read the manufacturer's instructions for the interpretation of the device's read-out, and interpret
the test results independently.

To conform with the Model Specifications, the notice proposed that the device must perform, with each interpreter,
with no positive results at .000 BAC, not more than one positive result at .008 BAC and not more than one non-positive
result at .032 BAC. If the device is capable to providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC,
the notice proposed that the device must perform, with each interpreter, with not more than one such result at .000
BAC. These aspects of the Model Specifications have been adopted without change.

An organization that represents substance abuse program administrators suggested that, if practical, the ten individuals
select to interpret the devices should have no medical training since it is likely that the persons who will be administering
the tests in the field will have no such training. The agency plans to select individuals with varying backgrounds
and experience. While we do not believe there is justification for imposing a restriction on the selection of individuals
who have medical training, it is likely that few if any of the individuals selected will have such training.

A manufacturer of saliva screening devices suggested that the Model Specifications should provide for a familiarization
period, to ensure that investigators and individuals who will be evaluating these devices are familiar with the manner
in which the devices should operate.

The preamble to the proposed Model Specifications explained that individual evaluators will be asked to read the
manufacturer's instructions before they perform their evaluations. These individuals will be provided sufficient
time to become familiar with these instructions, and will also be given instructions for conducting the evaluations.
Investigators will also provide themselves with sufficient time to read the manufacturer's instructions and become
familiar with the devices they are testing, as well as the evaluation procedures.

NHTSA stated in the February 15 notice that, through the independent interpretation of ten individuals, it believed
the Model Specifications would ensure that the results of tested devices are visible and will remain so for a reasonable
period of time and area likely to be interpreted in a consistent manner. The notice indicated that the tests would require
approximately two hours to run. The agency requested comments on these aspects of the proposed Model and Specifications.

The comments were supportive of these aspects of the proposed Model Specifications, except that two commenters objected
to the requirement that screening results remain visible for two hours. One of the commenters considered this to be
an unreasonable requirement, particularly when (according to the commenter) the primary basis for the requirement
is the convenience of the testing facility that will be evaluating the device. The other commenter was concerned that
this two-hour period could invalidate the results, since some devices require that the user read and record the test
result within a specific period of time (such as two minutes).

Upon further consideration based on these comments, NHTSA has decided to modify the requirement that results must
remain visible for two hours. It is not feasible, however, for the agency to eliminate the requirement altogether.
In part to facilitate the evaluation of these devices, and also to be consistent with the DOT Alcohol Testing Procedures
(49 CFR Part 40), which provide that the waiting period between screening and confirmation tests must be at least 15
minutes but should be no longer than 20 minutes, NHTSA will modify its testing methods so that the interpretation of
results will be accomplished within 20 minutes of dosing. Accordingly, the results of disposable interpretive devices
will need to remain visible for a period of only 20 minutes.

The notice explained that, to NHTSA's knowledge, no reusable devices currently use interpretive readings and the
agency believes it is unlikely that manufacturers would begin to use such readings in reusable devices. Accordingly,
NHTSA proposed that the Model Specifications would not include a methodology for testing reusable interpretive
devices. We requested comments on this aspect of the proposed Model Specifications. The commenters that addressed
this issue agreed with the agency's proposal.

For disposable devices that use interpretive readings, NHTSA proposed to combine Tests 1 and 2, and number the units
and expose them to the three BAC levels using a methodology that would not reveal to the person interpreting the test
the dosage received by any particular unit. NHTSA requested comments on this proposed methodology. No comments were
received. The proposed methodology has been adopted without change.

The February notice proposed to test devices to determine whether acetone or, in the case of breath or saliva devices,
cigarette smoke affects the functioning of the instruments. The notice also requested comments on whether devices
should be tested for interference from other substances.
With regard to the test for acetone interference, one commenter agreed that there is a need for such a test. Another
commenter strongly recommended that the test be deleted from the Model Specifications. The commenter argued that
acetone is unlikely to interfere with the measurement of breath alcohol and, if persons have levels of acetone that
are sufficiently high to cause interference, such persons should not be performing safety sensitive functions.
In addition, the commenter stated that requiring devices to distinguish between alcohol and acetone would greatly
increase instrument cost and restrict participation for certain instruments.
NHSTA has reconsidered its position on this issue, and decided that alcohol screening devices should not be required
to distinguish between alcohol and acetone, particularly since the instruments used for confirmation testing are
capable of distinguishing between these substances. Based on existing data,
 we do not expect a high incidence of acetone interference and, in the unlikely event that a device indicates a positive
result due to the presence of acetone, this will be detected in the confirmation test. The Model Specifications have
therefore been amended to eliminate the acetone test.




With regard to cigarette smoke and other interfering substances, we received only one comment, which stated that
non-interference from smoking, eating and drinking should not be a conformance requirement since these activities
can be avoided before a test is performed. If the evaluation of cigarette smoke is retained in the Model Specifications,
this commenter recommended that it be performed for information purposes only.
NHTSA expects the likelihood of cigarette smoke interference will be much greater than acetone interference, and
has decided to retain the cigarette smoke test. As provided in the Model Specifications, the test will be performed
in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Any waiting period specified in the manufacturer's instructions
will be strictly observed. The test will be performed within one minute after the person smokes the cigarette where
no waiting period is specified in the manufacturer's instructions. NHTSA did not propose to conduct a test for interference
from eating and drinking, and we have not added any such test in the final Model Specifications.
The commenter also suggested that, if the Model Specifications continue to include a cigarette smoke test, that the
method used for conducting this test on saliva screening devices should be similar to that used for breath screening
devices. NHTSA concurs that this comment, and has revised the Model Specifications to clarify its application to
both saliva and breath devices.
The agency also proposes to conduct high (40
 C) and low (10
 C) ambient temperature and vibration tests for alcohol screening devices to determine their ability to function
under a range of environmental conditions. NHTSA proposes that these tests would be performed by an investigator
at VNTSC. Five trials would be conducted at .000 BAC under Test 3.2. Forty trials (including 20 at .008 and 20 at .032
BAC) would be conducted under each of these other tests.
One commenter, a manufacturer of a passive alcohol sensor, noted that the proposed temperature range for testing
is more severe than that for EBT testers. This commenter is correct. The temperature range is more severe because it
is anticipated that screening tests may be performed outside in widely varying temperature conditions. Tests performed
with EBTs are generally performed indoors where temperatures are controlled. The proposed temperature range has
been adopted without change.
Another commenter, a manufacturer of a saliva test device, suggested that the specimens for saliva testing should
be held at body temperature (37
 C) while performing the two ambient temperature evaluations ``to stimulate real-life situations.'' NHTSA
disagrees with this comment. When saliva tests are being conducted in the field, the temperature of the saliva will
change soon after the sample is taken from the person's mouth. NHTSA therefore believes the procedures contained
in its proposed Model Specifications more accurately simulate the conditions under which actual testing will be
conducted. This portion of the Model Specifications has been adopted without change.
The manufacturer of an alcohol breath testing device commented that disposable devices, which cannot be checked
for calibration on a periodic basis, should be evaluated throughout their useful life. This manufacturer also recommended
that devices which require that results be checked through a visual inspection should be tested under a variety of
light conditions, such as fluorescent, mercury vapor, sodium vapor and daylight.
NHTSA disagrees that the Model Specifications should provide for the evaluation of disposal devices throughout
their useful life. As explained in the February 15 notice, manufacturers of alcohol screening devices must meet the
requirements contained in FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices regulations for devices used for medical purposes
(21 CFR Part 820), and they must include labels on their devices that meet the requirements contained in FDA's Labeling
regulations for devices used for medical purposes (21 CFR 809.10), even if the devices are not to be used for medical
purposes.
The Labeling Instructions for Alcohol Screening Devices included as an Appendix to the February notice instructed,
among other things, that the label ``Provide the reagent's shelf life and opened expiration dating, if applicable.''
In addition, manufacturers must determine shelf life and expiration dating in accordance with FDA's regulations
on Good Manufacturing Practices.

NHTSA has asked users of alcohol screening devices to provide both acceptance and field performance data to the agency's
Office of Alcohol and State Programs (OASP) when such data are available. As we explained in the February notice, if
information gathered indicates that a device on the CPL is not performing in accordance with the Model Specifications,
that a manufacturer is not complying with FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices, or that a device's label does not comply
with FDA's Labeling regulations, an investigation would be conducted and appropriate measures would be taken. For
these reasons, the Model Specifications have not been amended to provide for the evaluation of disposable devices
throughout their useful life.

NHTSA accepts the recommendation that certain devices should be tested under a variety of light conditions. The Model
Specifications have been amended to provide that interpretive devices which require that results be checked through
a visual inspection should be tested under incandescent, mercury vapor, sodium vapor and daylight as well as fluorescent
conditions.

To conform with the Model Specifications, the notice proposed that the device must perform with no positive results
at each test performed at .000 BAC, not more than one positive result at each test performed at .008 BAC and not more than
one non-positive result at each test performed at .032 BAC. If the device is capable of providing a reading of greater
than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, the notice proposed that the device must perform with not more than one such result
at .000 BAC. No comments were received regarding this aspect of the proposal. It has been adopted without change, except
that the final Model Specifications clarify that there can be no more than one ``can't tell'' result for disposable
interpretive devices.



4. FDA Involvement



When alcohol screening devices are used for medical purposes, the manufacturers of the devices are required to obtain
marketing clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in accordance with FDA regulations that address
issues such as quality assurance in manufacturing, shelf-life and labeling. Currently, FDA does not assert jurisdiction
(provide marketing clearance) for alcohol screening devices used for law enforcement purposes and workplace testing.

However, because of the nature of alcohol screening devices and the conditions under which they are to be used, NHTSA
stated in its February 15 notice that it is important for manufacturers of these devices to conform with certain requirements,
imposed by FDA on devices used for medical purposes, prior to the inclusion of the devices on NHTSA's CPL.

Accordingly, NHTSA proposed to require that each device submitted for testing under the Model Specifications be
accompanied by a self-certification from the manufacturer, certifying that it meets the requirements contained
in FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices regulations for devices used for medical purposes (21 CFR Part 820), and that
the device's label meets the requirements contained in FDA's Labeling regulations for devices used for medical purposes
(21 CFR Part 809.10), even if the devices are not to be used for medical purposes.

NHTSA received a number of comments regarding this aspect of its proposal. One commenter favored direct FDA regulation
of all workplace alcohol testing products and, if necessary, FDA enforcement. This commenter encouraged DOT and
NHTSA to continue their discussions with FDA. Another commenter agreed that the guidelines written in FDA's Good
Manufacturing Practices regulation could be useful as a basis for labeling and manufacturing requirements, but
this and other commenters recommended that FDA not get involved. According to one commenter, ``FDA is already overloaded,
and long delays could result from their involvement in this project.'' Another commenter recommended that, ``if
an instrument is not to be used in the medical field . . . FDA [should] not assert jurisdiction.''

By requiring a self-certification, NHTSA was not proposing to require that manufacturers obtain FDA marketing clearance,
but simply that the manufacturers self-certify that they meet the above-referenced requirements. NHTSA stands
by this aspect of its proposal.

For technical assistance or a copy of the Device Good Manufacturing Practices Manual for Medical Devices, manufacturers
should contact FDA's Division of Small Manufacturers by calling toll free at 1-800-638-2041.

NHTSA's February notice included, as an Appendix, a proposed set of Labeling Instructions for Alcohol Screening
Devices that had been prepared in consultation with FDA to assist manufacturers of alcohol screening devices in developing
a label that conforms to 21 CFR Part 809.10. The labeling instructions addressed issues such as restrictions that
may apply to operators of the device and conditions under which the device should or should not be operated.

One respondent commented on certain aspects of the labeling instructions. The commenter supported the inclusion
of details on calibration, calibration frequency, and the manufacturer's name, address, and telephone and fax numbers,
but disagreed that an ``800'' number is necessary. In addition, the commenter stated that frequency is subject to
use, and some users will prefer to return a unit to the manufacturer rather than engage in its calibration.

For the convenience of users, many of whom will be conducting alcohol screening tests in the field, the Labeling Instructions
for Alcohol Screening Devices, which are included as an Appendix to today's notice, continue to provide that manufacturers
list an 800 number the user may contact for further information or technical assistance. With regard to the calibration
of devices, the Labeling Instructions continue to provide that disposable devices are pre-calibrated, and need
no additional calibration. They also continue to provide that reusable devices require calibration, and instruct
that the labels on such devices provide information regarding how calibrations are to be conducted, instructions
for calibration and recalibration and the criteria for acceptability of calibration.

These Model Specifications are not regulations. Organizations and agencies may adopt these Model Specifications
and rely on NHTSA's test results or may conduct their own tests according to their own procedures and specifications.
It should be noted, however, that transportation employers covered by 49 CFR Part 40, Procedures for Transportation
Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs, are required to use only alcohol testing devices that meet the criteria
established by that regulation. 

NHTSA intends to begin testing of alcohol screening devices immediately, and hopes to publish a CPL of devices that
have been tested to date and conform to these Model Specifications within 30 days from today's date. The CPL will be
updated and published periodically, as further testing is completed. Once the first CPL is published, DOT will develop
and issue procedural rules for using approved alcohol screening devices in transportation workplaces, including
provisions for how and where such devices can be used and the steps that must be taken to collect bodily fluids. Employers
are reminded that these screening devices are not authorized for use under 49 CFR Part 40 until that regulation is amended.




Procedures 



The procedures proposed in the February 15 notice have been adopted without change. Testing of products submitted
by manufacturers to these Model Specifications will be conducted by the DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems
Center (VNTSC), DTS-75, Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 02142. Tests will be conducted semiannually, or as necessary.
Manufacturers are required to apply to NHTSA for a test date by writing to the Office of Alcohol and State Programs (OASP),
NTS-21, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Normally, at least 30 days will be required
from the date of notification until the test can be scheduled. 

One week prior to the scheduled initiation of the test program, manufacturers will be required to deliver their devices
to VNTSC. If the devices are disposable, the manufacturer must deliver 300 such devices; if the devices are disposable,
interpretive and require that results be checked through a visual inspection (and therefore must be tested under
various light conditions), the manufacturer must deliver 600 such devices; if the devices are reusable, the manufacturer
must submit only a single device. If a manufacturer of a reusable device wishes to submit a duplicate, backup instrument,
it may do so. The manufacturer shall be responsible for ensuring that the devices operate properly and are packaged
correctly. The manufacturer must also deliver the operator's manual (or instructions) and the maintenance manual
(if any) normally supplied with the purchase of the device, as well as specifications and drawings which fully describe
these devices. Proprietary information will be respected. (See 49 CFR Part 512, regarding the procedure by which
NHTSA will consider claims of confidentiality.) 

In addition, the manufacturer must submit a self-certification, certifying that the manufacturer meets the requirements
in FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices regulations for devices used for medical purposes (21 CFR Part 820), and that
the device's label meets the requirements in FDA's Labeling regulations for devices used for medical purposes (21
CFR Part 809.10), even if the devices are not to be used for medical purposes. See the Appendix to this notice. 

The manufacturer has the right to check its devices between the time of their arrival at VNTSC and the start of the tests,
but will have no access to the devices during the tests. Any malfunction of a device which results in failure to complete
any of the tests satisfactorily will result in a determination that the device does not conform to the Model Specifications.
If a device is found not to conform, it may be resubmitted for the next testing series after appropriate corrections
have been made. 

NHTSA plans to begin testing of alcohol screening devices immediately to determine whether they comply with the performance
criteria included in the Model Specifications.

A Conforming Products List (CPL) will be updated and published periodically. It will include a list of alcohol screening
devices that were submitted with the proper certifications and found to meet or exceed the Model Specifications.


One commenter requested that manufacturers should be permitted to commercialize their products as soon as they receive
notification from NHTSA that their product has been found to meet or exceed the Model Specifications, rather than
wait until the CPL listing their device is published. NTSHA intends to notify manufacturers that their devices meet
the Model Specifications, and manufacturers may receive such notices and an evaluation report prior to the publication
of a CPL listing their instrument. A decision about the point at which it would be appropriate for manufacturers to
commercialize their instruments, however, is outside the scope of this notice. 

NHTSA intends to modify and improve these Model Specifications as new data and test procedures become available and
to alter the test procedures, if necessary, to meet unique design features of a specific device. For each such modification,
NHTSA would provide notification in the 

Federal Register

 and would retest devices when necessary. 

OASP is the point of contact for information about acceptance testing and field performance of devices. NHTSA requests
that users of these devices provide both acceptance and field performance data to OASP when such data are available.
Information from users will help NHTSA monitor whether alcohol screening devices are performing according to the
NHTSA Model Specifications. 

If information gathered indicates that a device on the CPL is not performing in accordance with the Model Specifications,
NHTSA will direct VNTSC to conduct a special investigation. An investigation may include visits to users and additional
tests of the device obtained from the open market. If the investigation indicates that the devices actually sold on
the market are not meeting the Model Specifications, the manufacturer will be notified that the device may be removed
from the list. In this event, the manufacturer will have 30 days from the date of notification to reply. Based on the
VNTSC investigation and any data provided by the manufacturer, NHTSA will decide whether the device should remain
on the list. If the device is removed from the list, the manufacturer will be permitted to resubmit an improved device
to VNTSC for testing when it believes the problems causing its failure have been resolved. Upon resubmission, the
manufacturer must submit a statement describing what has been done to overcome the problems which led to failure of
the device. 

If information gathered indicates that the manufacturer of a device on the CPL does not comply with the requirements
in FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices regulations for devices used for medical purposes or that the device's label
does not comply with the requirements in FDA's Labeling regulations for devices used for medical purposes, NHTSA
will investigate the matter in consultation with FDA and will notify the manufacturer that the device may be removed
from the list. The manufacturer will have 30 days from the date of notification to reply. Based on any data provided
by the manufacturer and investigative findings, NHTSA will decide whether the device should remain on the list. If
the device is removed from the list, the manufacturer will be permitted to resubmit a self-certification, certifying
that the manufacturer complies with these FDA requirements when it believes the problems causing its non-compliance
have been resolved. Upon resubmission, the manufacturer must submit a statement describing what has been done to
overcome the problems which led to non-compliance. 

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and
it has been determined that it has no federalism implication that warrants the preparation of a federalism assessment.


In accordance with the foregoing, the Model Specifications for performance testing of alcohol screening devices
are set forth below.

Model Specifications for Alcohol Screening Devices 



1. Purpose and Scope 



These specifications establish performance criteria and methods for testing of alcohol screening devices. Alcohol
screening devices use bodily fluids to detect the presence of 0.020 or more BAC with sufficient accuracy for screening
purposes. These specifications are intended primarily for use in the conformance testing of alcohol screening devices.




2. Classification 



2.1 Disposable Alcohol Screening Devices 



Alcohol screening devices designed for a single use. 



2.2 Reusable Alcohol Screening Devices 



Alcohol screening devices designed to be reused. 



3. Definitions. 



3.1 Alcohol 



The intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol or other low molecular weight alcohols including methyl
or isopropyl alcohol. 



3.2 Alcohol Screening Device 



A device that is used to detect the presence of 0.020 or more BAC. The device may measure any bodily fluid for this purpose,
but shall provide output in BAC units. Test results may be indicated by numerical read-out or by other means, such as
by the use of lights or color changes. 



3.3 Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) 



Grams alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams alcohol per 210 liters of breath in accordance with the Uniform
Vehicle Code, Section 11-903(a)(5)
 (BrAC is often used to indicate that the measurement is a breath measurement); or grams alcohol per 100 milliliters
of saliva. 




3.4 Calibrating Unit 



A device that produces an alcohol-in-air test sample of known concentration that meets the NHTSA Model Specifications
for Calibrating Units (49 FR 48865). 



3.5 Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS) 



A device that provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known and adjustable alcohol concentration profile, flow
rate, and air composition at 34
  centigrade. (See NBS Special Publication 480-41, July 1981
 for a description of a BASS unit suitable for use in the required testing.) 




3.6 Bodily Fluid 



Any bodily fluid capable of being used to estimate alcohol concentration, provided the relationship between such
bodily fluid and BAC has been established according to scientifically acceptable standards. Such fluids include
but are not limited to blood, exhaled deep lung breath and saliva. 



3.7 Scientifically Acceptable Substitutes 

 




Fluids that have been scientifically accepted as equivalent to bodily fluids for testing purposes, such as aqueous
alcohol test solutions on a one-to-one basis for blood or saliva. 



4. Test Methods and Requirements 



Testing will be performed according to the instructions which normally accompany the submitted device and under
the conditions specified in the tests below. 



4.1 Test 1. Precision and Accuracy



Perform 40 trials under normal laboratory conditions using fluorescent light, including 20 trials at 0.008 BAC and
20 trials at 0.032 BAC. Use the BASS device for breath devices and preparations of bodily fluids or scientifically
acceptable substitutes for non-breath devices. 

For disposable alcohol screening devices that indicate the presence of alcohol in a manner that requires interpretation,
combine Tests 1 and 2, in accordance with 4.3 below. 

For alcohol screening devices that indicate the presence of alcohol in a manner that does not require interpretation,
perform the test using a VNTSC investigator. To conform at 0.008 BAC, not more than one positive result. To conform
at 0.032 BAC, not more than one non-positive result. 



4.2 Test 2. Blank Reading



Perform 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions using fluorescent light at 0.000 BAC. Use non-alcoholic human
breath for breath devices and preparations of non-alcoholic bodily fluids or scientifically acceptable substitutes
for non-breath devices. 

For disposable alcohol screening devices that indicate the presence of alcohol in a manner that requires interpretation,
combine Tests 1 and 2, in accordance with 4.3 below. 

For alcohol screening devices that indicate the presence of alcohol in a manner that does not require interpretation,
perform the test using a VNTSC investigator. To conform, no positive results. If the device is capable of providing
a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, not more than one such result. 



4.3 Methodology for Combining Tests 1 and 2 for Disposable Interpretive Devices



Perform the test under normal laboratory conditions using fluorescent light using ten individuals who qualify as
test interpreters (according to the manufacturer's restrictions, if any) and who have no knowledge of test BACs.
Ask each individual to read the manufacturer's instructions for interpretation of the device's read-out. 

Label sixty devices from 1 to 60 and randomly separate them into three groups of twenty. Record the numbers in each group.
Use two of the groups of devices for Test 1 and the remaining group for Test 2. Dose each group at the BAC levels specified
in Tests 1 and 2. Order the sixty devices into a single set from 1 to 60 and ask each individual to independently interpret
the results of these trials.

<TEXT>
 

Ask each individual to record each result as being one of the following: ``at .00 BAC''; ``above .00 and below. 02 BAC'';
``at or above .02 BAC''; or ``can't tell''. Dosing of devices and interpretation of results will be accomplished within
a twenty minute period.

To conform, with each interpreter, no positive results at .000 BAC, not more than one positive result at .008 BAC, not
more than one non-positive result at .032 BAC and not more than one ``can't tell'' result. If the device is capable of
providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, with each interpreter, not more than one such
result at .000 BAC.



4.4 Test 3. Light Conditions (only interpretive devices which require that results be checked through a visual
inspection)



Perform Tests 1 and 2, in accordance with 4.3, under each of the following light conditions: incandescent light; mercury
vapor light; sodium vapor light; and daylight.

Under each light condition, the device must meet the criteria established in 4.3: To conform, with each interpreter,
no positive results at .000 BAC, not more than one positive result at .008 BAC, not more than one non-positive result
at .032 BAC and not more than one ``can't tell'' result. If the device is capable of providing a reading of greater than
0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, with each interpreter, not more than one such result at .000 BAC.



4.5 Test 4. Cigarette smoke interference (only breath and saliva test devices)



Perform five trials at 0.000 BAC. Select an alcohol-free person who smokes cigarettes for this test. Ask the person
selected to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute after smoking, or after a waiting period
specified in the manufacturer's instructions, administer the alcohol screening device test according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Then ask the person to smoke another inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total of five trials.

To conform, no positive results.



4.6 Temperature



Test at low and high ambient temperature.



4.6.1 Test 5.1 Low Ambient Temperature



Perform 40 trials at 10 
 C, including 20 trials at 0.008 BAC and 20 trials at 0.032 BAC. Use a calibrating unit for this test for breath devices
and preparations of bodily fluids or scientifically acceptable substitutes for non-breath devices.

To conform at 0.008 BAC, not more than one positive result. To conform at 0.032 BAC, not more than one non-positive result.



4.6.2 Test 5.2 High Ambient Temperature



Perform trials of 40 devices at 40 
 C, including 20 trials at 0.008 BAC and 20 trials at 0.032 BAC. Use a calibrating unit for this test for breath devices
and preparations of bodily fluids or scientifically acceptable substitutes for non-breath devices.

To conform at 0.008 BAC, not more than one positive result. To conform at 0.032 BAC, not more than one non-positive result.



4.7. Test 6. Vibration



Perform 40 trials, including 20 trials at 0.008 BAC and 20 trials at 0.032 BAC. Use a calibrating unit for this test for
breath devices and preparations of bodily fluids or scientifically acceptable substitutes for non-breath devices.

Mount the screening device on a shake table and vibrate the table in simple harmonic motion through each of its three
major axes, as specified below. Sweep through each frequency range in 2.5 minutes, then reverse the sweep to the starting
frequency in 2.5 minutes. The 40 disposable testers may be placed in a suitable box mounted on the shake table. Test
after vibration.






To conform at 0.008 BAC, not more than one positive result. To conform at 0.032 BAC, not more than one non-positive result.

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is publishing a final guideline entitled ``Studies in Support of Special Populations:
Geriatrics.'' The guideline was prepared by the Efficacy Expert Working Group of the International Conference on
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The guideline
is intended to reflect sound scientific principles for testing drugs in geriatric populations. The guideline provides
useful information for sponsors submitting applications to both the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)
and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations
to promote international harmonization of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed
to enhance harmonization and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for
pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of harmonization is to identify and then reduce differences in technical
requirements for drug development.



ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite harmonization initiatives to be developed with input
from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and others.
ICH is concerned with harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products
among three regions: The European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Commission,
the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare,
the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, FDA, and the U.S. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by the International Federation
of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA).

The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the ICH sponsors and the IFPMA, as well as observers
from the World Health Organization, the Canadian Health Protection Branch, and the European Free Trade Area.

At a meeting held on September 16, 1992, the ICH Steering Committee agreed that the draft tripartite guideline entitled
``Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics'' should be made available for comment. Subsequently,
the draft guideline which published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 16, 1993 (58 FR 21082), was made available for comment by the European Commission and the Japanese Ministry
of Health and Welfare, as well as by FDA, in accordance with their consultation procedures. At a meeting held on June
24, 1993, the comments were analyzed and the guideline was revised as necessary. 

With this notice, FDA is publishing in final form a guideline entitled ``Studies in Support of Special Populations:
Geriatrics.'' This guideline has been endorsed by all ICH sponsors. The guideline provides useful information to
sponsors submitting applications to both CDER and CBER. The guideline addresses harmonization in relation to clinical
testing programs for drugs intended for use in medicines for the geriatric population, which is expected to increase
significantly in the near future in Europe, Japan, and the United States. The use of drugs in the geriatric population
requires special consideration due to the frequent occurrence of underlying diseases, concomitant drug therapy,
and the consequent risks of drug interaction. The recommendations of this guideline do not materially differ from
the recommendations of a 1989 CDER guideline entitled ``Guideline for the Study of Drugs Likely to be Used in the Elderly.''
Although the ICH harmonized guideline provides much useful information for sponsors submitting applications to
CDER and CBER, the 1989 document contains background and additional commentary not present in the harmonized guideline.
For this reason, FDA intends to provide both the ICH harmonized guideline and the 1989 document when information is
requested on the study of new drugs in a geriatric population.

Guidelines are generally issued under  10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the use of guidelines
to state procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that are acceptable
to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising  10.90(b). Therefore, this guideline is not being issued
under the authority of  10.90(b), and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or
on any person, nor does it operate to bind FDA in any way. 

As with all of FDA's guidelines, the public is encouraged to submit written comments with new data or other new information
pertinent to this guideline. The comments will be periodically reviewed and, where appropriate, the guideline will
be amended. The public will be notified of any such amendments through a notice in the 

Federal Register

.

Interested persons may, at any time, submit written comments on the guideline to the Dockets Management Branch (address
above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to
be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The guideline and received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

The text of the final guideline follows:



Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics



I. Statement of Purpose



It is important to ensure that clinical testing programs are carried out according to harmonised guidelines based
on agreed ethical and scientific principles so that the international development of valuable innovative drugs
is achieved with maximum efficiency. Harmonisation in relation to medicines for geriatric populations is an important
issue because the total population of the elderly will increase significantly in the coming years in Europe, Japan
and the USA. The use of drugs in this population requires special consideration due to the frequent occurrence of underlying
diseases, concomitant drug therapy and the consequent risk of drug interaction.



II
