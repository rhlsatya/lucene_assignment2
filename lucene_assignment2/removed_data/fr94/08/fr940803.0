Federal Crop Insurance Corporation





Nursery Crop Insurance Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) amends the Nursery Crop Insurance regulations effective for the 1995
and succeeding crop years, by allowing a six month delay in the payment of premiums. The premium billing date will be
extended for up to six months from September 30, to March 31 of the subsequent year insurance attaches.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation
1512-1. This action does not constitute a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of the
regulations affected by this rule under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations
is October 1, 1994.



This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 

This action will not increase the federal paperwork burden for individuals, small businesses, and other persons.
The action will not have a significant economic effect on the producers served by this voluntary crop insurance program
because this action liberalizes the terms of the nursery crop insurance contract for the insured. Extending credit
to producers may have a minor economic effect on the insurer only if producers do not pay their premium. However, based
on past experience, non-payment of nursery crop premiums has been insignificant. For years in which premium payment
have been deferred, only two disputes over premium payment have occurred. This represents less than one percent of
the total nursery crop policies purchased. As these disputes have not yet been resolved, all premiums may potentially
be paid. Further, FCIC will administratively extend the date for payment by the reinsured company when necessary
to be consistent with the final date the insured is required to submit premium payment. Therefore, this action is determined
to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.

This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450.

This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with state and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24,
1983.

This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety.
Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.

This amendment does not contain information collections that require clearance by the Office of Management and Budget
under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, the Paperwork Reduction Act.

It has been determined under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that the policies and procedures
contained in this rule do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. The policies and procedures in this rule will not have an increased substantial direct effect on states
or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of
government.

This rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this rule are not retroactive
and will preempt state and local laws to the extent such state and local laws are inconsistent therewith. The administrative
appeal provisions located at 7 CFR part 400, subpart J must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought for actions
taken under this policy or before any proceedings for the imposition of civil penalties under 7 U.S.C. 1506 or under
the Program Fraud Civil Remedies may be effective.

Following publication of this rule as proposed, the public was given 15 days in which to submit comments, data, and
opinions. No comments were received, however, a non-substantive change has been made to the amended language. Accordingly,
this rule is hereby issued as final.



Background 



The nursery crop insurance policy is the only Federal crop insurance policy that requires premium payment in full
prior to insurance attachment. Premium for other Federal crop insurance policies can be paid later, usually at or
near harvest. FCIC took such action for the 1993 and 1994 crop years. Discontinuing this practice would be burdensome
to the insured, therefore, FCIC intends to continue to allow the later payment of premiums. The insurance premium
will be changed from September 30 preceding the crop year, to March 31 of the crop year.

Final Rule



Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 

et seq.

), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation hereby amends the Nursery Crop Insurance Regulations (7 CFR part 406) effective
for the 1995 and subsequent crop years, by amending the provisions for coverage. This rule amends the regulations
set forth herein in the following instances:

Authority: 

7 U.S.C. 1506, 1516.




2. Section 406.7 is amended in the contract by revising subsection 5.a to read as follows:



 406.7 

The application and policy.

Oranges and Grapefruit Grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas; Expenses and Assessment Rate for the 1994-95
Fiscal Year 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate for the Texas Valley Citrus Committee
(TVCC) under Marketing Order (M.O.) No. 906 for the 1994-95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables
the TVCC to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer this program. Funds to administer this
program are derived from assessments on handlers.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 906 [7 CFR Part 906] regulating the handling
of oranges and grapefruit grown in the lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas. The agreement and order are effective under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as
the Act.


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, oranges and grapefruit grown in Texas are subject to assessments. It is intended that
the assessment rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable citrus fruit handled during the 1994-95
fiscal year, beginning August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any state or
local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 135 handlers of oranges and grapefruit regulated under the marketing order each season and
approximately 2,500 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by
the Small Business Administration [13 CFR  121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
The Texas orange and grapefruit marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate
for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable citrus fruit handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets
of expenses are prepared by the TVCC, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and
submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the TVCC are handlers and producers of Texas oranges and grapefruit.
They are familiar with the TVCC's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and
are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The TVCC's budget is formulated and discussed in a public
meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the TVCC is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of oranges and grapefruit. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which
will provide sufficient income to pay the TVCC's expected expenses. 

The TVCC met on May 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $1,141,944 and an assessment rate of $0.16
per 7/10 bushel carton for the 1994-95 fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993-94 fiscal year expense amount
was $984,319, which is $157,625 less than the recommended $1,141,944 for this season and the assessment rate was $0.15,
which is $0.01 less than that recommended for the 1993-94 fiscal year. 

Assessment income for the 1994-95 fiscal year is expected to amount to $960,000 based upon estimated fresh domestic
shipments of 6 million cartons of oranges and grapefruit. This, in addition to a withdrawal of $181,944 from the TVCC's
reserve fund, should be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. In comparison, the assessment income for the 1993-94
fiscal year was estimated at $825,000 based upon anticipated fresh domestic shipments of 5.5 million cartons of oranges
and grapefruit. 

Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $276,468, will be within the maximum permitted by the
order of one fiscal year's expenses. 

Major expense categories for the 1994-95 fiscal year include $132,444 for shared administrative expenses
with the South Texas Onion and Melon Committees, $650,000 for advertising, compared to $723,425 for the 1993-94
fiscal year, and $174,000 for the Mexican Fruit Fly support program. 

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the TVCC and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend to
effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The TVCC needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2)
the fiscal year for the TVCC begins August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for
the fiscal year apply to all assessable oranges and grapefruit handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers are aware
of this action which was recommended by the TVCC at a public meeting and which is similar to budgets issued in past years;
and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this action.

The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, apricots and sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington, and fresh
prunes grown in designated counties in Washington and in Umatilla County, Oregon are subject to assessments. It is
intended that the assessment rates specified herein will be applicable to all assessable apricots, sweet cherries,
and fresh prunes handled during the 1994-95 fiscal year, which began April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. This
interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are about 55 handlers of Washington apricots, 55 handlers of Washington sweet cherries, and 30 handlers of Washington-Oregon
fresh prunes subject to regulation under their respective marketing orders. In addition, there are about 190 Washington
apricot producers, 1,100 Washington sweet cherry producers, and 350 Washington-Oregon fresh prune producers in
the respective production areas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified
as small entities. 

An annual budget of expenses is prepared by each marketing order committee and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committees are handlers and producers of the regulated commodities. They are familiar with the
Committees' needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local areas and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly
affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. 

The assessment rate recommended by each Committee is derived by dividing anticipated expenses by the tons of fresh
fruit expected to be shipped under the order. Because the rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established
at rates which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committees' expected expenses. Recommended budgets and
rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committees shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred
on a continuous basis. Therefore, budget and assessment rate approvals must be expedited so that the Committees will
have funds to pay their expenses.

The Washington Apricot Marketing Committee met on May 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994-95 expenditures
of $13,602, which is $1,216 more in expenses than the $12,386 amount that was recommended for the 1993-94 fiscal
year.

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.00 per ton of fresh apricots, which is a decrease
of $2.50 in the assessment rate. In comparison, the 1993-94 assessment rate was $2.50 per ton. The Committee
unanimously recommended bringing forward its reserve fund of $22,170 to pay budgeted expenses for the 1994-95
fiscal year as an alternative to charging handlers an assessment rate. Shipments of fresh apricots are estimated
at 5,200 tons.

Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year, estimated at $8,568, will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.

The Washington Cherry Marketing Committee met on May 17, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994-95 expenses
of $100,213 and an assessment rate of $1.00 per ton of sweet cherries. In comparison, 1993-94 budgeted expenses
were $139,313, with an approved assessment rate of $3.00 per ton. This represents a $39,100 decrease in expenses and
a $2.00 decrease in the assessment rate from the amounts recommended for the current fiscal year.

The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 40,000 tons of cherries, would yield $40,000 in assessment
income. Adequate funds exist in the Committee's reserve to cover additional expenses.

Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year, estimated at $74,695, will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.

The Washington-Oregon Fresh Prune Marketing Committee met on June 1, 1994, and recommended 1994-95 expenses
of $18,760, which represents a $8,042 decrease in expenses from the $26,802 that was recommended for 1993-94
fiscal year.

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $1.00 per ton of fresh prunes. In comparison, this
is $2.00 less than the $3.00 per ton assessment rate that was approved for the previous fiscal year. Shipments of fresh
prunes for 1994 are estimated at 6,500 tons, which would yield $6,500 in assessment income. Adequate funds exist in
the Committee's reserve to cover additional expenses.

Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year, estimated at $22,800, will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.

Major expense categories for the Committees are for the administration of these marketing orders and for fresh prune
research and sweet cherry market development activities. Administrative expenses include those for salaries,
travel, and office operations. The stone fruit marketing Committees share office expenses, based on an agreement
among the Committees.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including information and recommendations submitted by
the Committees and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis; (2) the 1994-95 fiscal year for the Committees began April 1, 1994, and the marketing orders require that
the rates of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable apricots, sweet cherries, and fresh prunes handled
during the fiscal year; and (3) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received
will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

Almonds Grown in California; Revision of the Definition of Inedible Kernel


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule revises the definition of inedible kernel established under the administrative rules and
regulations of the Federal marketing order for California almonds. This revised definition of inedible kernel will
better reflect handler processing capabilities and will be more equitable to growers and handlers. This rule is based
on a unanimous recommendation of the Almond Board of California (Board), which is responsible for local administration
of the order.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 981 (7 CFR Part 981), both as amended, regulating
the handling of almonds grown in California. The marketing agreement and order are authorized by the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in accordance with Executive Order 12866.
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule
is not intended to have retroactive effect. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling.
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this interim final rule on small entities.
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
There are approximately 115 handlers of almonds that are subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately
7,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration
(13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000 and small agricultural producers are defined
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the almond producers and handlers may be classified
as small entities.
This rule revises the definition of inedible kernel in  981.408_Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations
by excluding almond kernels, pieces, or particles of almond kernels with web and frass from being considered inedible
almonds.
The processing of almonds involves various steps taken by growers and handlers prior to shipment to market. In most
situations, growers initially take their almonds to a huller/sheller operation where the hulls and shells are mechanically
removed. The almonds are then delivered to a handler, who has the almonds inspected by the Federal-State Inspection
Service. The inspector determines the percentage of inedible almond kernels in a sample, as defined in section 981.408.
Based upon the inspection, growers are paid by the handlers for the marketable almonds in the lot.

The quality control provisions of the marketing order are designed to provide procedures to remove inedible almonds
from human consumption channels. Under this program, handlers incur a disposition obligation of inedible almonds,
based on the inspection results. Section 981.442 specifies that the weight of inedible kernels in excess of 1 percent
of the inedible kernel weight in the lot determined by USDA constitutes the inedible disposition obligation. In order
to meet this disposition obligation, handlers normally deliver packer pickouts, kernels rejected in blanching,
pieces of kernel, meal accumulated in manufacturing, or other material to crushers, feed manufacturers, feeders
or dealers in nut wastes on record with the Board as accepted users.
In order to ensure that the inedible kernels are diverted to non-human consumption channels, the Board maintains
a list of approved accepted users, which includes feedlots and oil mills. Handlers notify the Board at least 72 hours
prior to making delivery to an accepted user so the Board, at its option, can witness the disposition.
Section 981.8 of the marketing order defines inedible kernel as meaning ``a kernel, piece, or particle of almond kernel
with any defect scored as serious damage, or damage due to mold, gum, shrivel, or brown spot, as defined in the United
States Standards for Shelled Almonds or which has embedded dirt not easily removed by washing.'' This section authorizes
modification of the definition by the Board with the approval of the Secretary. Currently, the definition under  981.408
of the regulations defines an inedible kernel as ``a kernel, piece, or particle of almond kernel with any defect scored
as serious damage, or damage due to mold, gum, shrivel, or brown spot, as defined in the United States Standards for
Shelled Almonds or which has embedded dirt or other foreign material not easily removed by washing.'' Kernels or kernel
pieces with any defect scored as serious damage are considered inedible kernels.
Section 51.2130 of the U.S. Standards for Grades of Shelled Almonds defines serious damage as ``any defect which makes
a kernel or piece of kernel unsuitable for human consumption, and includes decay, rancidity, insect injury and damage
by mold.'' Section 51.2123 of the Standards defines ``insect injury'' to mean that ``the insect, web, or frass is present
or there is definite evidence of insect feeding.''
The way the definition is currently applied, web or frass is considered serious damage by insect injury and when present
and noted on the incoming inspection, causes the almonds so affected to be classified as inedible. As stated previously,
handlers pay their growers based on the percentage of marketable almonds in the lot. Handlers do not pay growers for
almonds classified as inedible. Web and frass can be removed from the kernels or kernel pieces during normal processing,
thus making them suitable for human consumption. Because handlers pay growers based on the marketable almonds in
each lot prior to processing, growers are not compensated for any additional marketable almonds made available due
to web or frass removal after processing.
Handlers disposition obligations are based on the inedible kernel content found in the lot prior to processing. When
the web and frass are removed during processing, those kernels become marketable, thus making it difficult to generate
enough inedible almonds to meet the disposition obligation with inedible almonds. Handlers then often purchase
a mixture of inedible almonds and foreign material such as hulls, shells, etc., mixed with almond meats from a hulling
and/or shelling operation to satisfy their disposition obligation. It has been determined that the revision of the
definition of inedible kernel will make it easier for handlers to meet their inedible obligations because the disposition
obligations will more accurately reflect the inedible percentage determined by the incoming inspection. This rule
will better address the intent of the quality control program.

For these reasons, the Board and its Quality Control Committee developed plans to further revise the definition.
As a result, the Board unanimously recommended on May 16, 1994, to revise the definition of inedible kernel to eliminate
kernels with attached frass and webbing from being classified as insect injury and therefore, inedible. This rule
will not affect the U.S. Standards for Grades of Shelled Almonds. 
This revision is expected to improve the quality control program by making the definition of inedible kernel better
reflect handler processing capabilities and providing more equity for handlers and growers. It may also result in
growers being paid for marketable almonds which are currently being scored as inedible on incoming inspections and
may result in higher returns to growers. 
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this interim final rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Board's recommendation, it is found that
this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) This rule relaxes requirements currently in effect; (2) this rule should be made effective as close to
the beginning of the 1994-95 crop year as possible to be equitable and beneficial to growers and handlers; (3)
this rule was unanimously recommended at a public meeting and all interested persons had an opportunity to provide
input; (4) this rule is not controversial; and (5) this rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any comments received
will be considered prior to finalization.

Assessment Obligation for 1994-95 Crop Year Peanuts Under 
7 CFR Part 997; Peanuts Not Subject to Peanut Marketing Agreement No. 146


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule will implement Public 
Law 103-66. That law requires the Department to impose an administrative assessment on peanuts received or
acquired for the account of handlers who are not signatory (non-signatory handlers) to Peanut Marketing Agreement
No. 146 (Agreement). The assessment rate of $.60 per net ton of farmers stock peanuts for the 1994-95 crop year
will be the same as the administrative assessment established by the Department and applied to handlers under the
Agreement. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued pursuant to the requirements of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937
(Act), as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), and as further amended December 12, 1989, Public Law 101-220, section
4(1), (2), 103 Stat. 1878, and August 10, 1993, Public Law 103-66, section 8b(b)(1), 107 Stat. 312.


The Department is issuing this interim final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. The Department will establish a 1994-95
crop year assessment rate applicable to non-signatory handlers effective July 1, 1994-June 30, 1995. Segregation
1 farmers stock peanuts received or acquired by non-signatory handlers during that crop year will be subject to the
assessment. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge
to the provisions of this interim final rule. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
There are approximately 45 handlers of peanuts who have not signed the Agreement and, thus, will be subject to the regulations
proposed herein. The Small Business Administration now defines small agricultural service firms 
(13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000 and small agricultural producers as those
whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of non-signatory handlers and peanut producers may be classified
as small entities. 
Since aflatoxin was found in peanuts in the mid-1960's, the domestic peanut industry has sought to minimize aflatoxin
contamination in peanuts and peanut products. The Agreement was established in 1965 and plays a very important role
in the industry's quality control efforts. The Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) was established by
the Agreement and works with the Department in administering the marketing agreement program. Approximately 95
percent of the area peanut crop is marketed by handlers who are signatory to the Agreement. Requirements established
pursuant to the Agreement provide that farmers stock peanuts with visible 

Aspergillus flavus

 mold (the principal source of aflatoxin) must be diverted to non-edible uses. Each lot of shelled peanuts destined
for edible channels must be officially sampled and chemically tested for aflatoxin by the Department or in laboratories
approved by the Committee.
Public Law 101-220, enacted December 12, 1989, amended section 608b of the Act to require that all peanuts handled
by persons who have not entered into the Agreement (non-signers) be subject to quality and inspection requirements
to the same extent and manner as are required under the Agreement. Approximately 5 percent of the U.S. peanut crop is
marketed by non-signer handlers.

Under the non-signer provisions, no peanuts may be sold or otherwise disposed of for human consumption if the peanuts
fail to meet the quality requirements of the Agreement. Regulations to implement Pub. L. 101-220 were issued
and made effective on December 4, 1990 [55 FR 49980] and amended several times thereafter, and are published in 7 CFR
part 997. All such amendments were made to ensure that the non-signer handling requirements remain consistent with
modifications to the handling requirements applied to signatory handlers under the Agreement. 
Public Law 103-66 (107 Stat. 312), enacted August 10, 1993, provides for mandatory assessment of farmer's stock
peanuts acquired by non-signatory peanut handlers. Under this law, paragraph (b) of section 1001, of the Agricultural
Reconciliation Act of 1993, specifies that: (1) Any assessment (except indemnification assessments) imposed under
the Agreement on signatory handlers also shall apply to non-signatory handlers, and (2) such assessment shall be
paid to the Secretary. 
This rule will add new permanent  997.51 Assessments to Part 997_Provisions Regulating the Quality of Domestically
Produced Peanuts Handled by Persons Not Subject to the Peanut Marketing Agreement. Notice of the actual assessment
rate established for each crop year will be issued as a new section as an Implementing Regulation beginning with  997.100
Assessment rate, and be sequentially numbered each succeeding year. 
The Committee meets in February or March each year and recommends to the Secretary a per ton, administrative assessment
of Segregation 1, farmers stock peanuts received or acquired by signatory handlers for the upcoming crop year. The
crop year covers the 12-month period from July 1 to June 30. The Committee met on March 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended
a $.60 administrative assessment per ton of 1994-95 crop year Segregation 1 peanuts handled by those handlers
who are signatory to the Agreement. The Department has initiated rulemaking procedures to implement such an administrative
assessment on signatory handlers. 
Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 103-66, this interim final rule provides notice that the Department will assess
non-signatory handlers a $.60 administrative assessment per net ton of Segregation 1 farmers stock peanuts for the
1994-95 crop year. The assessment will be based on: 
(1) Tonnage reported on incoming inspection certificates of each handler's Segregation 1 farmers stock peanuts
received or acquired for the handler's account and (2) tonnage reported on FV-117 ``Weekly Report of Uninspected
Farmers Stock Seed Peanuts Received for Custom Seed Shelling.'' For example, in 1994-95, a handler who receives
or acquires 100,000 tons of Segregation 1 farmers stock peanuts will pay an assessment of $60. 
The assessment will be applied to peanuts intended for human consumption and peanuts intended for non-human consumption
outlets such as seed, oilstock and animal feed. The assessment will be applied to peanuts received or acquired for
a handler's account, including the handler's own production. Assessment will not be applied on Segregation 1 peanut
lots received or acquired by a handler from other handlers or from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) program
received for non-edible use, or lots received on behalf of an area association pursuant to warehousing services ( 997.20(a)).

The assessment will be applied, pro rata, on non-signatory handlers who perform handling functions defined in  997.14.
Handling is defined as engaging in the receiving or acquiring, cleaning and shelling, cleaning inshell, or crushing
of peanuts and in the shipment (except as a common or contract carrier of peanuts owned by another) or sale of cleaned
inshell or shelled peanuts or other activity causing peanuts to enter the current of commerce. Handling does not include
the sale or delivery of peanuts by a producer to a handler or to an intermediary person engaged in delivering peanuts
to handlers and the sale or delivery of peanuts by such intermediary to a handler. 
Section 997.15 defines a non-signatory handler as any person who handles peanuts, in a capacity other than that of
a custom cleaner or dryer, and assembler, a warehouse person or other intermediary between the producer and the 
non-signatory handler. 
Speculators, brokers, or other entities who take possession of Segregation 1 farmers stock peanuts, submit such
peanuts for incoming inspection, and subsequently enter such peanuts into the channels of commerce will pay assessments
on such peanuts. Entities who receive or acquire farmers stock peanuts for the purpose of custom seed shelling will
be assessed on the basis of Form FV-117 ``Weekly Report of Uninspected Farmers Stock Seed Peanuts Received for
Custom Seed Shelling.'' Form FV-117 is currently required from such entities. Producer/handlers who store
peanuts of their own production (farm-stored peanuts) will, at some point prior to further handling, obtain incoming
inspection on such peanuts and, at that time, pay the pro-rata administrative assessment on such peanuts. 
Only one administrative assessment will be applied to any lot of farmers stock peanuts. Non-signatory and signatory
handlers will not pay an administrative assessment on a lot which they purchase from speculators, brokers or other
such entities who have already paid an administrative assessment on the lot. 
A crop year's original assessment could be increased by the Secretary based on a similar increase applied by the Secretary
on signatory handlers. Such an increase will be applied on all peanuts first handled by non-signatory handlers during
the crop year in which the increased assessment occurred. 
Peanuts will be assessed based on the rate applicable to the crop year in which the lot is presented for incoming inspection.

Also pursuant to Pub. L. 103-66, this rule will establish that non-signatory handlers pay their administrative
assessment to the Secretary. The Secretary will bill non-signatory handlers on a periodic basis determined by the
Secretary. The non-signatory handler will be responsible for remitting payment by the date specified. Payment in
the form of a personal check, cashier's check or money order will be remitted to the Department. Audits of each handler's
account may be conducted by the Department to reconcile incoming, farmers stock volume received or acquired and assessments
paid.
Violation of the non-signer regulations may result in a penalty in the form of an assessment by the Secretary equal
to 140 percent of the support price for quota peanuts. The support price for quota peanuts is determined under 7 U.S.C.
1445c-3 for the crop year during which the violation occurs. The established administrative assessment rate
will impose some additional costs on non-signatory handlers. However, the costs will be in the form of uniform assessments
on all handlers who are not signatory to the Agreement. 
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1988 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the information collection requirements
that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have
been assigned OMB No. 0581-0163. 



Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that, upon good cause, it is impracticable, unnecessary,
and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good
cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register 

because: (1) Public Law 103-66 requires the Department to impose an administrative assessment on peanuts received
or acquired for the account of handlers who are not signatory (non-signatory handlers) to Peanut Marketing Agreement
No. 146 (Agreement); (2) the peanut crop year begins July 1, and to achieve the intended purpose of the law this action
should be taken promptly; and (3) this rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered
prior to finalization of this rule.

Expenses, Assessment Rate, and Indemnification Reserve for Marketing Agreement No. 146 Regulating the Quality
of Domestically Produced Peanuts 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting, without change, the provisions of an interim final rule
that authorized expenditures for administration and indemnification, established an assessment rate, and authorized
continuation of an indemnification reserve under Marketing Agreement 146 (agreement) for the 1994-95 crop
year. The rule also increased the administrative assessment rate for the 1993-94 crop year. Authorization
of this budget enables the Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) to incur operating expenses, collect funds
to pay those expenses, and settle indemnification claims during the 1994-95 crop year. Authorization of the
increase in the administrative assessment rate for the 1993-94 crop year enables the Committee to collect sufficient
funds to pay expenses projected for the remainder of that year. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments
on handlers who have signed the agreement. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement 146 (7 CFR part 998) regulating the quality of domestically produced
peanuts. This agreement is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C.
601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the agreement now in effect,
peanut handlers signatory to the agreement are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the peanut agreement
program are derived from such assessments, and a deductible type insurance for 1994-95 indemnification expenses.
This rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate for the Committee for the crop year which began
July 1, 1994, and ends June 30, 1995, and increases the administrative assessment rate for the crop year which began
July 1, 1993, and ended June 30, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must
be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
There are approximately 47,000 producers of peanuts in the 16 States covered under the agreement, and approximately
76 handlers regulated under the agreement. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business
Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service
firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of the producers may be classified
as small entities, and some of the handlers covered under the agreement are small entities.

Under the agreement, the assessment rate for a particular crop year applies to all assessable tonnage handled from
the beginning of such year (i.e., July 1). An annual budget of expenses is prepared by the Committee and submitted to
the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of peanuts. They are familiar
with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel for program operations and, thus,
are in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed at industry-wide meetings.
Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to provide input in recommending the budget, assessment
rate, and indemnification reserve. The handlers of peanuts who are directly affected have signed the marketing agreement
authorizing the expenses that may be incurred and the imposition of assessments. 
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee for the 1994-95 crop year was derived by dividing anticipated
expenses by expected receipts and acquisitions of farmers' stock peanuts. It applies to all assessable peanuts received
or acquired by handlers from July 1, 1994. Because that rate is applied to actual receipts and acquisitions, it must
be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 
The Committee met on March 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994-95 crop year administrative expenses
of $1,056,000 and an administrative assessment rate of $0.60 per net ton of assessable farmers' stock peanuts received
or acquired by handlers. In comparison, 1993-94 crop year budgeted administrative expenditures were $1,020,000,
and the administrative assessment rate was initially recommended and fixed at $0.60 per ton. 
Administrative budget items for 1994-95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993-94
(in parentheses) are: Executive salaries, $140,146 ($134,304), clerical salaries, $132,500 ($127,479), field
representatives salaries, $290,420 ($278,778), field representatives travel, $110,000 ($107,000), insurance
and bonds, $8,500 ($7,500), and furniture and equipment, $9,500 ($4,000). Items which have decreased compared to
those budgeted for 1993-94 (in parentheses) are: Payroll taxes, $43,000 ($45,000), office rent and parking,
$50,000 ($52,500), postage and mailing, $12,000 ($13,000), and audit fees, $9,200 ($9,500). All other items are
budgeted at last year's amounts. The administrative budget includes $14,234 for contingencies ($4,439 last year).

The Committee also unanimously recommended 1994 crop indemnification claims payments of up to $9,000,000 and an
indemnification assessment of $2.00 per net ton of farmers' stock peanuts received or acquired by handlers to continue
its indemnification program. The 1993-94 crop year indemnification assessment was $1.00 per net ton. Because
of the high number of claims being processed during the 1993-94 crop year, the Committee recommended a higher
assessment rate so that sufficient reserve funds will be available. The $9,000,000 of indemnification claims coverage
to be provided on 1994 crop peanuts includes $5,000,000 in excess loss insurance to be purchased by the Committee_the
same as last year. 
The cost of the indemnification insurance premium and the costs to carry out indemnification procedures (sampling
and testing of 2-AB and 3-AB Subsamples, and crushing supervision, of indemnified peanuts, pursuant
to  998.200(c)), are additional indemnification costs which must be authorized and paid from available indemnification
funds. Such costs are not expected to exceed $2,000,000. 
The total assessment rate is $2.60 per ton of assessable peanuts ($0.60 for administrative and $2.00 for indemnification).
Assessments are due on the 15th of the month following the month in which the farmers' stock peanuts are received or
acquired. Application of the recommended rates to the estimated assessable tonnage of 1,760,000 will yield $1,056,000
for program administration and $3,520,000 for indemnification. The indemnification amount, when added to expected
cash carry over from 1993-94 indemnification operations of $12,609,100, will provide $16,129,100, which
should be adequate for the 1994 fund, and to maintain an adequate reserve.

The 1993-94 budget was published in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule on June 11, 1993 (58 FR 32600), and finalized on August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43066). The administrative
expenses and assessment rate for the 1993-94 crop year were based on an estimated assessable tonnage of 1,700,000.
Due to an unexpected short crop, the assessable tonnage is estimated to be only 1,476,377. In order to have sufficient
revenue to cover budgeted expenses of $1,020,000, the Committee unanimously recommended that the 1993-94
crop year administrative assessment be increased from $0.60 to $0.70 per net ton of assessable farmers' stock peanuts.


An interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24633). That interim final rule added  998.407 which authorized expenditures for administration
and indemnification, established an assessment rate, and authorized continuation of an indemnification reserve
for the Committee. That rule also amended  998.406, paragraph (c) to increase the administrative assessment
rate for the 1993-94 crop year. That rule provided that interested persons could file comments through June
13, 1994. No comments were received. 

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers signatory to the agreement. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these
costs will be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing agreement. Therefore,
the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1993-94 crop year began on July 1, 1993, and the 1994-95 crop year for the program began on July
1, 1994, and the marketing agreement requires that the rate of assessment for the crop year apply to all assessable
peanuts handled during the crop year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee
at a public meeting and published in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule.

Loan Interest Rates



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The current 18 percent per year federal credit union loan rate ceiling is scheduled to revert to 15 percent on September
9, 1994, unless otherwise provided by the NCUA Board (Board). A 15 percent ceiling would restrict certain categories
of credit and adversely affect the financial condition of a number of federal credit unions. At the same time, prevailing
market rates and economic conditions do not justify a rate higher than the current 18 percent ceiling. Accordingly,
the Board hereby continues an 18 percent federal credit union loan rate ceiling for the period from September 9, 1994
through March 8, 1996. Loans and line of credit balances existing prior to May 15, 1987, may continue to bear their contractual
rate of interest, not to exceed 21 percent. The Board is prepared to reconsider the 18 percent ceiling at any time should
changes in economic conditions warrant.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Public Law 96-221, enacted in 1979, raised the loan interest rate ceiling for federal credit unions from 1 percent
per month (12 percent per year) to 15 percent per year. It also authorized the Board to set a higher limit, after consultation
with Congress, the Department of the Treasury, and other federal financial agencies, for a period not to exceed 18
months, if the Board should determine that: (i) money market interest rates have risen over the preceding 6 months:
and (ii) prevailing interest rate levels threaten the safety and soundness of individual credit unions as evidenced
by adverse trends in growth, liquidity, capital, and earnings.

On December 3, 1980, the Board determined that the foregoing conditions had been met. Accordingly, the Board raised
the loan ceiling for 9 months to 21 percent. In the unstable environment of the first half of the 1980s, the Board extended
the 21 percent ceiling four times. On March 11, 1987, the Board lowered the loan rate ceiling from 21 percent to 18 percent
effective May 15, 1987. This action was taken in an environment of falling market interest rates from 1980 to early
1987. The ceiling has remained at 18 percent to the present.

The Board felt, and continues to feel, that the 18 percent ceiling will fully accommodate an inflow of liquidity into
the system, preserve flexibility in the system so that credit unions can react to any adverse economic developments,
and will ensure that any increase in the cost of funds would not impinge on earnings of federal credit unions.

The Board would prefer not to set loan interest rate ceilings for federal credit unions. In the final analysis, the
market sets the rates. The Board supports free lending markets and the ability of federal credit union boards of directors
to establish ban rates that reflect current market conditions and the interests of credit union members. Congress
has, however, imposed loan rate ceilings since 1934. In 1979, Congress set the ceiling at 15 percent but authorized
the Board to set a ceiling in excess of 15 percent if the Board can justify it. The following analysis justifies a ceiling
above 15 percent, but at the same time does not support a ceiling above the current 18 percent. The Board is prepared
to reconsider this action at any time should changes in economic conditions warrant.



Justification for a Ceiling No Higher Than 18 Percent



Money Market Interest Rates



Both long and short rates have increased significantly in the last few months. Table 1 gives information on past interest
rates. There is a general consensus among economists that money market rates will continue to rise as economic growth
accelerates. Implied forward rates, the money market's best guess about where interest rates are going, are significantly
higher over the next year. By the time this rule becomes effective, money markets will have experienced 6 months of
rising rates. The Board is ready to revisit this issue should this expectation not be confirmed.



Liquidity, Capital, Earnings, and Growth and Individual Credit Unions



For at least 1,477 credit unions, market conditions call for rates on unsecured loans to be above 15 percent. For some
of these credit unions, three factors combine to require interest rate charges above 15 percent in order to maintain
liquidity, capital, earnings, and growth.

<DOCNO> FR940803-0-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 





The first factor is low average loan balance. For example, the credit unions with under $2,000,000 in assets have an
average unsecured balance of $1,314, with many loans below $1,000. There are fixed costs of granting and processing
a loan. Many of these costs are incurred regardless of the size of the loan. Expressed as a percentage of the loan balance
on which interest will be collected, these costs can be very high on small loans. As one credit union states, ``The total
interest earned on a $200 loan at 17 percent for 12 months is $34. Even at 17 percent it costs us more to make the loan than
we recover in interest income, assuming it does pay to maturity and is not charged off.'' The Functional Cost and Profit
Analysis by the Federal Reserve System calculates the average cost to a credit union for making an installment loan
to be $95.66 plus $5.49 per payment. The $34 does not even cover the cost of accepting the twelve payments.

Many banks will not even consider loan applications for less than $1,000. Lowering the interest rate ceiling for credit
unions will discourage credit unions, too, from making these loans. Credit seekers' options will be reduced, with
most of the affected members having no choice but to turn to neighborhood lenders.

The second factor is credit risk. Loans to young members who have not yet established a credit history and loans to those
who have built weak credit histories both carry high credit risk. Credit unions must charge rates high enough to cover
higher-than-usual losses for such loans. There are undoubtedly more than 1,477 credit unions charging over 15 percent
for unsecured loans to such members. Many credit unions have ``Credit Builder'' or ``Credit Rebuilder'' loans but
must report the ``most common'' rate on the Call Report for unsecured loans.

The third factor is credit union size. Small credit unions have fewer loans over which to distribute their overhead
costs.

Thus, small credit unions making small loans to borrowers with poor or no credit histories are struggling with far
higher costs than the typical credit union. Both young people and lower income households have limited access to credit
and, absent a credit union, often pay rates of 24 to 30 percent to small loan companies. Or they may be forced to resort
to the check-cashing outlet where a post-dated check will be cashed at effective rates of 200, or even 300, percent.
Rates between 15 and 18 percent are attractive to such members. The higher rates are necessary to help cover the credit
unions' costs of providing this kind of credit.

Table 2 shows the number of credit unions in each asset-size group that charge more than 15 percent for unsecured loans.
It also shows the percent of credit unions in each group that do so.

NCUA staff are not aware of any complaints from members of those credit unions offering high-risk, high-interest
rate loans.

Among the 1,477 credit unions charging more than 15 percent for unsecured loans, there are 356 credit unions with 20
percent or more of their assets in this kind of loan. For these credit unions, lowering their rates would damage their
liquidity, capital, earnings, and growth. Table 3 shows credit unions charging more than 15 percent that have more
than 20 percent of their assets in these loans. In general the percent of assets in unsecured loans goes down as credit
union size goes up.

At the same time, lowering the ceiling would not change the rates the vast majority of credit unions are charging, since
they are already at or below market. A ceiling can cause rates to be higher than they would have been without the ceiling.
The closer a loan rate is to actual market rates, the more likely it is that the ceiling will act as a floor for rates. There
are two reasons why this happens. First, setting a ceiling close to market rates creates the impression that the ceiling
rate is the ``federally approved'' rate. Second, if credit unions feel they may not have the flexibility to raise rates
in the near future should market rates rise unexpectedly, they are more likely to keep current rates higher than they
otherwise would, as insurance against market rate increases. This ceiling-as-floor phenomenon militates against
letting the ceiling approach the more common, typical market rates.
In conclusion, the Board has continued the federal credit union loan interest rate ceiling of 18 percent per year for
the period from September 9, 1994 through March 8, 1996. Loans and line of credit balances existing on May 15, 1987 may
continue to bear their contractual rate, not to exceed 21 percent. Finally, the Board is prepared to reconsider the
18 percent ceiling at any time during the extension period, should changes in economic conditions warrant it.


Regulatory Procedures


Administrative Procedures Act


The Board has determined that notice and public comment on this rule are impractical and not in the public interest,
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Due to the need for a planning period prior to the September 9, 1994 expiration date of the current
rule, and the threat to the safety and soundness of individual credit unions with insufficient flexibility to determine
loan rates, final action on the loan rate ceiling is necessary.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


For the same reasons, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required, 5 U.S.C. 604(a). However, the Board has considered
the need for this rule, and the alternatives, as set forth above.


Paperwork Reduction Act


There has been no change in the paperwork requirements.


Executive Order 12612


This final rule does not affect state regulation of credit unions. It implements provisions of the Federal Credit
Union Act applying only to federal credit unions.

 National Credit Union Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; extension of compliance date. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The NCUA Board is publishing a change to the compliance date to part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations (Truth in Savings).
This document extends the compliance date for nonautomated credit unions that have assets of $2 million or less as
of December 31, 1993. The extension gives the smaller, nonautomated credit unions more time to come into compliance
with part 707.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

(1) Background.



Prior Extensions



NCUA previously extended the compliance date for part 707, Truth in Savings, for certain small, nonautomated credit
unions. (Final rule, 59 FR 13435, March 22, 1994). At that time, the compliance date of part 707 was extended to March
31, 1995, for credit unions of an asset size between $500,000 and $1 million as of December 31, 1993, that are not automated.
Similarly, the compliance date of part 707 was extended to June 30, 1995, for credit unions of an asset size of less than
$500,000 as of December 31, 1993, that are not automated. The compliance date remained January 1, 1995, for all other
credit unions.



Importance of Small Credit Unions



The NCUA Board is very concerned with the continued viability of small credit unions. As Norman E. D'Amours, NCUA Chairman,
explained recently:




Small credit unions are very important to the continuing growth of the movement. Like the tender shoots on a large tree,
they represent the promise of continuing life and health. They serve people who badly need their services, and they
know their members very well. Such a credit union is more likely to take a risk on the reputation and character of a member
unable to find credit elsewhere.



NCUA Letter to Credit Unions No. 153 (April 1994)



Ten years ago, credit unions under $2 million in size made up about two-thirds (10,564) of all federally insured credit
unions. Today, such credit unions number only 4,132, about one-third of federally insured credit unions. In addition,
the assets of today's 4,132 smallest credit unions are 1.2 percent of total assets in all credit unions, while credit
unions of $2 million or less accounted for 7.7 percent of total assets ten years ago. The average credit union today
has $22.5 million in assets, compared to $5 million ten years ago.

However, over two-thirds of these small credit unions are already automated or have data processing capabilities.
Since these credit unions are in a position to begin Truth in Savings compliance on January 1, 1995, the Board believes
that to grant these credit unions a further compliance extension would be contrary to the intent of Congress in enacting
TISA, and contrary to the interests of their credit union members.

Small credit unions that are not automated present a different 
picture entirely. Because of the many dividend rate, annual 
percentage yield, and annual percentage yield earned calculations 
required by TISA, and the prohibition of the prevalent rollback 
method of calculating dividends, nonautomated credit unions are 
much more needful of adequate resources and time to accomplish 
meaningful Truth in Savings compliance. To this end, the NCUA 
Board adopted a program to place retired NCUA computers with 
nonautomated credit unions with $2 million or less in assets. 
Due to the length of the federal procurement process for 
obtaining new NCUA computers, however, no computers will be 
available to distribute until sometime in 1995. The Board 
understands that many nonautomated credit unions with assets of 
$2 million or less have relied upon previous estimates of earlier 
delivery dates of retired NCUA computers. Therefore, the Board 
has decided to expand the extension for all credit unions 
eligible for retired NCUA computers until January 1, 1996. 
Only a small number of credit unions are affected by this 
extension. NCUA has determined that there are 1,248 credit unions under $2 million in assets that have no or grossly
inadequate computers or data processing capability. Of these credit unions, approximately 1,096 have less than
$1 million in assets and approximately 152 have between $1-2 million in assets. 
The compliance date remains January 1, 1995, for all other 
credit unions (automated credit unions under $2 million in assets 
and all credit unions having over $2 million or more in assets). 
NCUA encourages early Truth in Savings compliance by all credit 
unions as soon as they are able in order to meet the 
Congressional intent of universal Truth in Savings coverage of 
consumer held accounts in financial institutions. Each credit 
union receiving this extension is encouraged to begin to comply 
with TISA and part 707 as soon as its board of directors believes 
the credit union is ready. 
The NCUA Board is well aware that most credit unions start 
small, and historically, the fostering of small credit unions has 
strengthened the entire credit union movement. The Board has 
supported and instituted several small credit union initiatives 
to continue the development of small credit unions. For 
instance, in NCUA's Region V, a ``big brother'' partnership program 
has teamed smaller credit unions with larger credit unions, 
proving that the smallest credit unions can be preserved if 
examiners, other credit unions, and trade associations work 
together cooperatively in the spirit of the credit union movement 
to help those in need. Over 331 small credit unions are 
benefiting from participation in various Region V small credit 
union programs. NCUA has implemented the ``big brother'' program 
in all other NCUA Regions. 
The NCUA Board recently established an Office of Community 
Development Credit Unions to help implement NCUA's commitment to 
small, low-income, and community credit unions. In addition, the 
Board recently adopted new chartering and field of membership 
policies designed to encourage the creation of new credit unions, 
and facilitate credit union services in financially depressed 
communities (Final Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement No. 
94-1, 59 FR 29066, June 3, 1994). Moreover, the agency has 
liberalized its rules governing receipt of nonmember deposits by 
low-income credit unions (Final Rule, 59 FR 26101, May 19, 1994), 
and has previously extended the Truth in Savings compliance 
deadline for small credit unions (Final Rule, 59 FR 13435, March 
22, 1994). A commitment has been made by the Board to provide 
some nonautomated, small credit unions access to laptop computers 
used by credit union examiners as this equipment is replaced with 
newer technology. Credit unions that are not automated and under 
$2 million in assets, and that have not already done so, should 
contact either their appropriate state credit union supervisor or 
NCUA Regional Director no later than October 1, 1994, if 
interested in participating in the laptop computer program. 
By these, and other, initiatives and programs, the Board seeks 
to assure all credit unions that the NCUA Board values small 
credit unions and will work to preserve them. Larger credit 
unions and the trade groups are urged to assist their colleagues 
in the smallest credit unions. The Board believes that such 
selfless giving lies at the heart of the cooperative philosophy 
and history of the credit union movement. Healthy, small credit 
unions are an absolutely essential part of a bright future for 
all credit unions. With this background, when the Board 
discovered that the extensions previously granted to small, 
nonautomated credit unions would not be sufficient to accomplish 
all of the Board's objectives, the Board decided to grant an 
additional extension. 
It has been shown to the satisfaction of the NCUA Board that 
small, nonautomated credit unions need more time to comply with 
the complex, technical requirements of Truth in Savings than 
other, larger, more automated credit unions. An extended 
compliance date for affected credit unions will enable NCUA and 
other interested parties to complete the extensive training and 
preparation that is necessary to ensure that these credit unions 
comply with part 707 by the extended compliance dates. This 
action is taken to preserve, educate, and possibly automate (by 
providing retired NCUA computers and by fostering the provision 
of minimal cost computer hardware, software and services by other 
parties) many of these small credit unions; ensure compliance 
with Truth in Savings at the earliest possible date; assist 
administrative convenience; reduce the risk of potential losses 
to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund; and to allow 
time for coordination of this effort among NCUA, affected credit 
unions, data processors and other interested parties. 
As stated previously, NCUA intends to use the December 31, 1993, 
NCUA Form 5300 report to determine the requisite nonautomation 
status and asset size for those credit unions filing Form 5300 
reports that are eligible for the extensions in required 
compliance. Credit unions which do not file Form 5300 reports 
will be permitted to prove nonautomation status and asset size by 
other means. NCUA will consider verified self-certifications, 
certifications by appropriate state supervisory authorities, and 
other equivalent forms of proof as sufficient for eligibility for 
the extension by non-federally insured credit unions. Indeed, 
with the assistance of the affected credit unions, trade groups, 
and the NCUA regional and central office staffs, NCUA is well on 
its way to having identified credit unions in need of Truth in 
Savings compliance assistance, and in providing various 
educational and other assistance to the affected small, 
nonautomated credit unions. 


Administrative Procedure Act 


The extension made to this part is not subject to 
the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure 
Act (the ``APA''), 5 U.S.C. 551 

et seq.

 The extension relates to a 
few credit unions that need more time and assistance in complying 
with part 707. No major changes are contemplated, or made, by 
this extension. Therefore, the NCUA Board has determined that, in this case, the APA notice and comment procedures
for this extension is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. 5 U.S.C. 
553(b)(3)(B).

Procedural Regulations Governing Size Protests



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Small Business Administration is amending its procedural regulations governing size protests for purposes
of clarification. The amendment makes clear that size protests filed by any person, including the contracting officer,
will be considered premature and will be dismissed if filed before bids have been opened or the identity of the prospective
awardee has been established.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is amending  121.1603(a)(4) of its procedural regulations governing
size protests in order to make clear that size protests filed by contracting officers, like all other protests, will
be dismissed if prematurely filed, 

i.e.

, if filed prior to bid opening (in the case of sealed bids) or prior to identification of the apparent successful offeror
(in the case of negotiated procurements).




Section 121.1603(a)(4) presently states that ``(a)t any time after bid opening a contracting officer may question
the size of any offeror for the purpose of a particular procurement or sale by filing a protest with the SBA Regional
Office * * *'' Although SBA had intended that this regulation preclude contracting officers from
filing premature protests with respect to both sealed bid and negotiated procurements, the language employed does
not reflect this intention and has resulted in a recent decision by SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals holding that
a contracting officer's protest filed after the date for submitting initial offers but before the submission of best
and final offers or identification of the apparent successful offeror was not premature and necessitated a decision
on the merits.

In order to effect its original intentions with respect to premature protests, SBA is amending paragraph (a)(4) by
adding clarifying language to emphasize that contracting officers (like all other protestors) are precluded from
filing premature protests in negotiated procurements as well as in procurements conducted using sealed bid procedures.
This expressed intention accords with paragraph (b)(5) of  121.1603, which clearly states that ``(p)rotests
filed by any person before bid opening or notification of intended award shall be considered premature and shall be
dismissed.'' It in no way conflicts with the statement in paragraph (b)(2) of  121.1603 that ``(a) protest by
a contracting officer shall be timely for the purpose of the procurement or sale in question whether filed before or
after award.'' Paragraph (b)(2) of  121.1603 addresses the issue of lateness. Paragraphs (a)(4) and (b)(5)
address the issue of prematurity.

SBA's distinction between lateness and prematurity with respect to protests filed by contracting officers is based
upon the realities of the procurement process and the need to establish procedures for adjudicating size status that
are fair as well as administratively efficient. A contracting officer, unlike any other potential protestor, has
the authority to terminate a contract awarded as a small business set aside should it be determined that the awardee
is not a small business. Thus it is prudent to permit a contracting officer to file a late protest whenever size ineligibility
is suspected in order to preserve the integrity of the set-aside program by resolving any questions on size status
in an expeditious manner. The prohibition against premature protests, however, has historically been applied to
contracting officers and other protestors alike, because in neither case is it prudent either to impose the burdens
of a size investigation on a concern unnecessarily or to expend SBA's limited resources by making formal size determinations
where it is unclear that the protested concern is the potential awardee of the contract.

Under  121.1603(a)(4), a protest is considered premature until identification of the prospective awardee.
Traditionally, this identification occurs at bid opening or, in the case of a negotiated procurement, at the point
the contracting officer notifies other offerors of the intended award and names the prospective awardee. SBA believes
that the concept of notification applicable to protests filed by other offerors is not appropriate with respect to
contracting officers, since it is the contracting officer who does the notification. Thus  121.1603(a)(4)
will merely require that a contracting officer wait until he or she has identified the apparent successful offeror
before filing a protest concerning that firm's size status. Such a restriction will ensure that SBA does not impose
the burdens of an unnecessary size investigation on other offerors or expend its limited resources rendering size
determinations that are unlikely to have any practical significance for the procurement in question.
This clarification of SBA's procedural regulations governing premature protests applies to all pending protests
as well as all size determinations for which a final decision has not yet been rendered by the Office of Hearings and
Appeals.


Compliance With Executive Orders 12866, 12612 and 12778; the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.; and
the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. CH 35


For purposes of Executive Order 12866, SBA certifies that this rule will not have an economic effect in excess of $100
million, result in a major increase in costs for individuals or governments, or have a significant adverse effect
on competition and, therefore, will not constitute a major or significant rule. SBA has made this determination because
the rule is purely procedural in nature and will impose no additional filing or other requirements and, as such, does
not represent a significant regulatory event.
For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule will not have Federalism implications warranting
the preparation of a Federalism assessment.
For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that the rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance
with the standards set forth in section 2 of that Order.
For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, SBA certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic effect
on a substantial number of small entities, for the same reason that it will not be a major or significant rule.
For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, SBA certifies that the rule will not impose a new recordkeeping or reporting
requirement.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final special conditions; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These special conditions are issued for Canadair Model CL-215-6B11 (CL-415 variant) airplanes
manufactured by Canadair Inc. of Montreal, Canada. These airplanes are equipped with digital electronic flight
instrument systems (EFIS) and an integrated instrument display system with active matrix liquid crystal displays
(LCD's) that perform critical functions. The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety
standards for the protection of the EFIS and the LCD's from the effects of high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF).
These special conditions provide the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to
ensure that the critical functions performed by these systems are maintained when the airplane is exposed to HIRF.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Comments Invited



The FAA has determined that good cause exists for making these special conditions effective upon issuance, however,
interested persons are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the regulatory docket and special conditions number and be submitted in duplicate to the address
specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the
Administrator. These special conditions may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments submitted
will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons, both before and after the closing date
for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking
will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response
to this request must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket No. NM-98.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.



Background



On December 17, 1993, Canadair, Inc. of Montreal, Canada, applied for an amendment to Type Certificate A14EA to incorporate
the model CL-215-6B11 (CL-415 variant) water bomber aircraft. This aircraft is similar to the Model
CL-215-6B11, approved March 30, 1993, as a retrofit conversion of the reciprocating engine-powered
CL-215-1A10. It differs, however, in that it is a production model featuring the same turboprop engines,
but incorporating certain product improvements. The design of the CL-215-6B11 includes the installation
of digital avionics consisting of an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and an integrated instrument display
system with active matrix liquid crystal displays that are potentially vulnerable to high-intensity radiated

 fields (HIRF) external to the airplane.



Supplemental Type Certification Basis



Under the provisions of  21.101 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Canadair Inc. must show that the
Model CL-215-6B11 (CL-415 variant) meets the applicable provisions of the regulations incorporated
by reference in Type Certificate No. A14EA, or the applicable regulations in effect on the date of application for
the Model CL-215-6B11. The regulations incorporated by reference in the type certificate are commonly
referred to as the ``original type certification basis.''

The regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A14EA for the Model CL-215-6B11 are
part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), as amended by Amendment 25-61, except for certain requirements
found inappropriate for the intended special purpose. Those exceptions, which are not relevant to the special conditions
proposed herein, are listed in Report RAO-215-100, Supplement 1, Part 2.1, pages 47 through 117, dated
September 19, 1991. These special conditions will form an additional part of the certification basis.

If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the CL-215-6B11 (CL-415 variant) because of a novel
or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a
level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.

Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by   11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with  21.101(b)(2).

Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended at a later date to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of  21.101(a)(1).



Discussion



There is no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems from
high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). Increased power levels from ground-based radio transmitters, and the growing
use of sensitive electrical and electronic systems to command and control airplanes, have made it necessary to provide
adequate protection.

To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference,
special conditions are needed for the CL-215-6B11 (CL-415 variant) that would require the EFIS
and LCD's be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to the effects of
HIRF.



High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)



With the trend toward increased power levels from ground-based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite
communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics
systems, such as the EFIS and LCD's, to HIRF must be established.

It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling to cockpit-installed equipment
through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analyses of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate
level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special condition is shown with either paragraphs
1 or 2 below:

1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz.

a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe
shielding.

b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis.

2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated.






The envelope given in paragraph 2 above is a revision to the envelope used in previously issued special conditions
in other certification projects. It is based on new data and SAE AE4R subcommittee recommendations. This revised
envelope includes data from Western Europe and the U.S.

As discussed above, these special conditions are applicable to CL-215-6B11 (CL-415 variant) airplanes
manufactured by Canadair, Inc., of Montreal, Canada. Should Canadair apply at a later date for a change to the type
certificate to include another model incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions
would apply to that model as well, under the provisions of  21.101(a)(1).


Conclusion


This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on CL-215-6B11 (CL-415 variant)
airplanes. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval
of these features on the airplane.
The substance of the special conditions for these airplanes has been subjected to the notice and comment procedure
in several prior instances and has been derived without substantive change from those previously issued. It is unlikely
that prior public comment would result in a significant change from the substance contained herein. For this reason,
and because a delay would significantly affect the certification of the airplane, which is imminent, the FAA has determined
that prior public notice and comment are unnecessary and impracticable, and good cause exists for adopting these
special conditions immediately. Therefore, these special conditions are being made effective upon issuance. The
FAA is requesting comments to allow interested persons to submit views that may not have been submitted in response
to the prior opportunities for comment described above.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, that requires inspections to detect cracking of 
certain fuselage longitudinal lap joints, repair of any cracking found, and replacement of 
the countersunk fasteners in those lap joints with protruding head fasteners. This 
amendment is prompted by a structural reassessment of Model 747 series airplanes. The 
actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent skin cracking in the longitudinal lap 
joints of certain stringers, which can lead to rapid decompression of the airplane.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10338). That action proposed to require repetitive external high frequency eddy current inspections
to detect cracking of the skin around the fasteners in the upper row of the longitudinal lap joints of Stringer (S)-12L
and S-12R from station 520 to station 741.1, repair of any cracking found, and replacement of the countersunk
fasteners in those lap joints with protruding head fasteners. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 

Two commenters support the proposed rule. 

One commenter requests that the compliance time specified in proposed paragraph 
(b) for accomplishing the replacement of the countersunk fasteners be reduced from the 
proposed ``20,000 total flight cycles or within 4 years after the effective date of the AD, 
whichever occurs later,'' to ``20,000 total flight cycles or within 2 years after the effective 
date of the AD, whichever occurs later.'' The commenter states that this suggested 
shorter compliance time would make the compliance time requirements of the proposed 
AD commensurate with the compliance time of AD 94-12-09, amendment 39-8937 
(59 FR 30285, June 13, 1994), which requires modification of certain skin panel lap joints 
in this same area. 

The FAA does not concur. After consideration of all the available information, the 
FAA cannot conclude that a reduction of the proposed compliance time, without prior 
notice and opportunity for public comment, is warranted. In developing an appropriate 

compliance time, the FAA considered the safety implications, parts availability, and normal 
maintenance schedules for timely accomplishment of replacement of the fasteners. 
Further, the proposed compliance time was arrived at with operator, manufacturer, and 
FAA concurrence. In consideration of all of these factors, the FAA determined that the 
compliance time, as proposed, represents an appropriate interval in which replacement of 
the fasteners can be accomplished in a timely manner within the fleet and still maintain an 
adequate level of safety. Operators are always permitted to accomplish the requirements 
of an AD at a time earlier than that specified as the compliance time; therefore, if an 
operator elects to accomplish the fastener replacement prior to the accumulation of 
20,000 total flight cycles or 2 years after the effective date of this AD, whichever is later 
(in order to accomplish the replacement concurrently with an action required by another 
AD), it is that operator's prerogative to do so. If additional data are presented that would 
justify a shorter compliance time, the FAA may consider further rulemaking on this issue. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
as proposed. 

There are approximately 30 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in 
the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 12 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected 
by this AD, that it will take approximately 17 work hours per airplane to accomplish the 
required inspections, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the required inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to 
be $11,220, or $935 per airplane. 

The FAA estimates that it will take approximately 302 work hours per airplane to 
accomplish the requirement to replace fasteners, and that the average labor rate is $55 per 
work hour. Required parts will be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost 
impact of the requirement to replace fasteners on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$199,320, or $16,610 per airplane. 

Based on the figures, above, the total cost impact of the required actions (cost of 
inspections added to the cost of replacement of fasteners) on U.S. operators is estimated 
to be $210,540, or $17,545 per airplane. 

The FAA recognizes that the replacement of fasteners would require a large 
number of work hours to accomplish. However, the 4-year compliance time specified in 
paragraph (b) of this AD should allow ample time for the replacement of the fasteners to 
be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance 
activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at

Airworthiness Directives: Beech Aircraft Corporation Models B300 and B300C Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment revises AD 91-20-14, which currently requires incorporating revised takeoff and climb
performance charts into the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual and Pilot's Operating Handbook (AFM/POH) on Beech
Aircraft Corporation (Beech) Models B300 and B300C airplanes. Beech has started incorporating these takeoff and
climb requirements into the AFM/POH of airplanes manufactured since issuance of AD 91-20-14. This action
limits the applicability to only those airplanes without these takeoff and climb requirements incorporated into
the AFM/POH at production. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure that the affected airplanes achieve
required minimum takeoff and climb performance for each approved combination of takeoff configuration, weight,
pressure altitude, and temperature. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain
Beech Models B300 and B300C airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12205). The action proposed to revise AD 91-20-14 and continue to require incorporating
revised takeoff and climb performance charts, B2 revision, part number 130-590031-1, dated September
1991, into the AFM/POH, but would exclude those airplanes incorporating the takeoff and climb requirements at manufacture.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposed rule or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public.

After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these
minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already
proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 118 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
1 workhour per airplane to incorporate the charts into the AFM/POH. Since an owner/operator who holds a private pilot's
certificate as authorized by sections 43.7 and 43.11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 43.7 and 43.11) can
accomplish this action, the only cost impact upon the public is the time it takes to incorporate these charts. In addition,
this action requires the same thing as AD 91-20-14, which is replaced by this action. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Industrie Model A340-211 and -311 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Airbus Industrie Model A340-211 and -311 series airplanes. This action requires 
modifying the bonding leads on the fuel quantity indicating (FQI) probes or the 
temperature sensor, on the fuel low pressure inlet pipe next to the compensator, and on 
the jet pump. This amendment is prompted by results of a quality survey, which revealed 
that there may be insufficient clearance between several bonding leads and certain FQI 
system probes or the temperature sensor, and between the bonding leads and the FQI 
probes and the compensator. The actions specified in this AD are intended to eliminate 
such insufficient clearance, which could lead to electrical arcing and a resultant fire in the 
event of a lightning strike. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile 
(DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that 
an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Industrie Model A340-211 and -311 series 
airplanes. The DGAC advises that results of a quality survey conducted by Airbus 
Industrie have revealed that there may be insufficient clearance between several bonding 
leads and certain fuel quantity indicating (FQI) system probes or the temperature sensor. 
Further, insufficient clearance also may exist between the bonding leads and the FQI 
probes in the inner collector cell and the compensator. Such insufficient clearance, if not 
corrected, could result in electrical arcing and a resultant fire in the event of a lightning 
strike. 



Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A340-28-4008, dated July 9, 1993, 
which describes procedures for modifying the bonding leads on the FQI probes or the 
temperature sensor. This modification involves installing shorter bonding leads and/or 
rerouting certain bonding leads on the water drain pipe, the engine fuel feed pipe, the fuel 
recirculation pipe, the vent pipe, and the surge tank drain pipe. Accomplishment of this 
modification will maintain the correct clearance between the bonding leads and the FQI 
probes or the temperature sensor. The DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory 
and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93-120-002(B), dated August 4, 1993, in order 
to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 

Airbus Industrie also has issued Service Bulletin A340-28-4012, dated 
November 8, 1993, which describes procedures for modifying the bonding leads on the 
fuel low pressure inlet pipe (next to the compensator) and on the jet pump. This action 
involves installing a sleeve on the bonding lead on the fuel pipe at certain FQI probes in 
the inner collector cell and installing shorter bonding leads on the fuel pipe at the 
compensator. Accomplishment of this modification will maintain the correct clearance 
between the bonding leads and the FQI probes and compensator. The DGAC classified 
this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 
93-206-003(B), dated December 8, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness 
of these airplanes in France. 

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation 
in the United States under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation 
Regulations (14 CFR 21.19) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. 
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed 
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, 
reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for 
products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being 
issued to prevent electrical arcing and a resultant fire in the event of a lightning strike. 
This AD requires modifying the bonding leads on the FQI probes or the temperature 
sensor, on the fuel low pressure inlet pipe next to the compensator, and on the jet pump. 
The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins 
described previously.

There currently are no Model A340-211 or -311 series airplanes on the U.S. 
Register. All airplanes included in the applicability of this rule currently are operated by 
non-U.S. operators under foreign registry; therefore, they are not directly affected by this 
AD action. However, the FAA considers that this rule is necessary to ensure that the 
unsafe condition is addressed in the event that any of these subject airplanes are imported 
and placed on the U.S. Register in the future. 

Should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the 
future, it would require approximately 63 work hours to accomplish the required actions, 
at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by the 
manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this 
AD would be $3,465 per airplane. 

Since this AD action does not affect any airplane that is currently on the U.S. 
register, it has no adverse economic impact and imposes no additional burden on any 
person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary and the 
amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule and was not preceded by notice 
and opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested 
persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or 
arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number 
and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES.

 
All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be 
considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual 
information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in 
evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional 
rulemaking action would be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. 
All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for 
comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that 
summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be 
filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on 
which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-106-AD.'' 
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption 


ADDRESSES.

Establishment of Class E Airspace; Thomaston, GA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at Thomaston, Georgia. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway 30 Standard
Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) for the Thomaston-Upson County Airport has recently been developed. Controlled
airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL), is needed for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations
when utilizing this SIAP. This action is intended to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at Thomaston,
GA. The operating status of the airport will change from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with
publication of the SIAP.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History



On May 2, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Thomaston, Georgia, (59 FR 24990). The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class
E airspace for IFR operators executing the NDB Runway 30 SIAP serving the Thomaston-Upson County Airport. Interested
parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal
to the FAA. No comments relating to this Class E airspace proposal were received. The coordinates for this airspace
docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations extending upward from 700 feet or more above
ground level are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16,
1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The operating status of the airport will be changed
from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Thomaston, GA, to accommodate
a new NDB Runway 30 SIAP to Thomaston-Upson County Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet to
1200 feet AGL is needed for IFR operators executing the developed SIAP. The operating status of the airport will be
changed from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class D and Class E4 airspace at Kenosha, WI. This action also revokes the Class E5 airspace
at Kenosha, WI. An air traffic control tower has been commissioned at Kenosha Municipal Airport. The intended effect
of this action is to provide adequate Class D airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations and require two-way
radio communication at Kenosha Municipal Airport, and to establish Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures
in areas outside the Class D surface area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



History



On Monday, April 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class D and E4 Airspace at Kenosha Municipal Airport, Kenosha, WI (59 FR 15667). The proposal was to add controlled
airspace extending upward from the surface designated as an extension to a Class D surface area. Interested parties
were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA.
No comments objecting to the proposal were received.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D, Class E4 and Class E5 airspace
designations are published respectively in Paragraphs 5000, 6004, and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993,
and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The
Class D and E4 airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Class
E5 airspace designation listed in this document will be subsequently removed.






The Rule






This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class D airspace with Class E arrival extensions
at Kenosha Municipal Airport. An air traffic control tower was commissioned at Kenosha Municipal Airport. Controlled
airspace at an airport with an operating control tower is designated as Class D airspace. The intended effect of this
action is to provide adequate Class D airspace for IFR operations and require two-way radio communications at Kenosha
Municipal Airport.






The Class D surface area does not completely contain six instrument approach procedures. This Class E4 airspace will
contain the instrument approach procedures in controlled airspace without imposing a requirement on aircraft operating
under visual flight rules within the Class E4 area to communicate with the Kenosha Municipal Airport air traffic control
tower.






The Class E5 airspace at Kenosha Municipal Airport is revoked due to the commissioning of the air traffic control tower.






Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable visual flight rule requirements.






The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

IFR Altitudes; Miscellaneous Amendments



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment adopts miscellaneous amendments to the required IFR (instrument flight rules) altitudes and changeover
points for certain Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes for which a minimum or maximum en route authorized
IFR altitude is prescribed. This regulatory action is needed because of changes occurring in the National Airspace
System. These changes are designed to provide for the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace under instrument
conditions in the affected areas.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 95 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 95) amends, suspends, or revokes IFR altitudes
governing the operation of all aircraft in flight over a specified route or any portion of that route, as well as the
changeover points (COPs) for Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes as prescribed in part 95. The specified
IFR altitudes, when used in conjunction with the prescribed changeover points for those routes, ensure navigation
aid coverage that is adequate for safe flight operations and free of frequency interference. The reasons and circumstances
that create the need for this amendment involve matters of flight safety and operational efficiency in the National
Airspace System, are related to published aeronautical charts that are essential to the user, and provide for the
safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace. In addition, those various reasons or circumstances require making
this amendment effective before the next scheduled charting and publication date of the flight information to assure
its timely availability to the user. The effective date of this amendment reflects those considerations. In view
of the close and immediate relationship between these regulatory changes and safety in air commerce, I find that notice
and public procedure before adopting this amendment are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public
interest and that good cause exists for making the amendment effective in less than 30 days. The FAA has determined
that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments
are necessary to keep them operationally current.



It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant
rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation
of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this
amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Oral Dosage Form New Animal Drugs; Chlortetracycline Soluble Powder 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of two supplemental
new animal drug applications (NADA's) filed by the American Cyanamid Co. The supplemental NADA's provide for the
safe and effective use of chlortetracycline hydrochloride (CTC HCl) soluble powder in both the drinking water of
chickens and turkeys for control of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to CTC, and the drinking water of swine
and cattle for control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to CTC. The approvals reflect compliance
with results of the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group's
(DESI) evaluation of the drugs' effectiveness and FDA's conclusions concerning that evaluation.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 American Cyanamid Co., Berdan Ave., Wayne, NJ 07470, submitted a supplement to its approved NADA 65-071 for
Aureomycin

 

 (chlortetracycline hydrochloride (CTC HCl)) Soluble Powder (available in 181 gram (g) (6.4 ounce (oz) packets and
2.3 kilogram (kg) (5 pound (lb) bags, with a concentration of 25 g CTC HCl/lb) and NADA 65-440 for Aureomycin

 

 (CTC HCl) Soluble Powder Concentrate (available in 181 g (6.4 oz) and 726 g (25.6 oz) packets, with a concentration
of 64 g CTC HCl/lb). The drug products are used to medicate drinking water to be administered to chickens, turkeys,
swine, calves, beef cattle, and nonlactating dairy cattle in accordance with  520.445b(d)(4) (21 CFR 520.445b(d)(4)).
Both NADA's were originally approved on June 23, 1953, as antibiotic Form 6 applications. 


The drugs were the subject of a NAS/NRC DESI evaluation of effectiveness (DESI 0113NV). The findings were published
in the 

Federal Register

 of July 21, 1970 (35 FR 11646). NAS/NRC evaluated the drugs as probably effective for growth promotion and feed efficiency
and for the treatment of animal diseases caused by pathogens sensitive to chlortetracycline. NAS/NRC stated: 


(1) Claims made regarding ``for prevention of'' or ``to prevent'' should be replaced with ``as an aid in the control
of'' or ``to aid in the control of''; 
(2) claims for growth promotion or stimulation are disallowed and claims for faster gains and/or feed efficiency
should be stated as ``may result in faster gains and/or improved feed efficiency under appropriate conditions'';

(3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as ``appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by pathogens
sensitive to (name of drug)''; if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be dropped; 
(4) claims pertaining to egg production and hatchability should be changed to ``May aid maintaining egg production
and hatchability, under appropriate conditions, by controlling pathogenic microorganisms''; 
(5) the labels should warn that treated animals must actually be consuming enough medicated water or medicated feed
to provide a therapeutic dosage under the conditions that prevail and, as a precaution, state the desired oral dose
per unit of animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective usage of the preparation in drinking water
or feed; and 
(6) effective blood levels are required for each recommended dosage. 


FDA concurred with the NAS/NRC findings. 
The NAS/NRC evaluation is concerned only with the drugs' effectiveness and safety to the treated animal. It does not
take into account the safety for food use of food derived from drug-treated animals. Nothing herein will constitute
a bar to further proceedings with respect to questions of safety of the drugs or their metabolites in food products
derived from treated animals. 
The American Cyanamid Co. filed supplemental NADA's which revised the labeling of its products to comply with the
results of the NAS/NRC DESI review and FDA's conclusions. The supplemental NADA's are approved as of June 15, 1994,
and the regulations are amended by revising  520.445b (21 CFR 520.445b) to reflect the approvals. 
Additionally,  520.445b(b) is amended to reflect sponsor approvals as a result of this latest DESI finalization:



1. Drug sponsor no. 053389 (Pennfield Oil Co.) is currently codified for the uses provided in  520.445b(d)(3)
and (d)(4). Actually, the approval is limited to the uses provided only in  520.445b(d)(2)(i)(D) and (d)(3)(i)(A).

2. Drug sponsor no. 010042 (American Cyanamid Co.) is currently codified for the uses provided in  520.445b(d)(1)
and (d)(2). However, approval of its applications is now limited to the uses listed in  520.445b(d)(4). 
3. Drug sponsor no. 054273 (Fermenta Animal Health Co.) is codified for all of the current uses in  520.445b(d)(4),
which is being amended because the sponsor does not hold an approval for the claim added in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C)
of  520.445b. 
4. Drug sponsor no. 017274 (Feed Specialties Co., Inc.) is currently codified for the uses provided in  520.445b(d)(4)(i)
through (d)(4)(iii). However, this is being amended because the sponsor does not hold an approval for the claim added
in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C). 


As a result of the DESI finalization,  520.445b(d)(1) and (d)(2) are being removed (for claims no longer acceptable)
and new paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) is being added to reflect a claim for control of mortality due to fowl cholera caused
by 

Pasteurella multocida

. 
Section 520.445b is further amended in paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(B) and (d)(4)(iv)(B) to change the name of one of the
causative agents, 

Hemophilus

, to 

Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

, the current scientific name. 
Finally,  520.445b is amended in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(C) to add warning statements now required on the labeling.

The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration,
rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), these
approvals for food producing animals do not qualify for marketing exclusivity because the supplemental applications
do not contain reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and
new human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approvals and conducted
or sponsored by the applicant. 
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through
Friday.

Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals,
and Other Non-Profit Organizations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

United States Information Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim Final Rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim final rule is in response to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) publishing a final revised OMB Circular
A-110, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education,
Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations, in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 62992) on November 29, 1993. The revised Circular was developed by an interagency task force for governmentwide
use in a common rule format to facilitate regulatory adoption by executive departments and agencies. In the published
revised Circular, OMB specified as ``required action'' that, Federal agencies responsible for awarding and administering
grants and other agreements to recipients described therein, shall adopt the language in the Circular unless other
provisions are required by Federal statute or exceptions or deviations are approved by OMB. This interim final rule
adopts the provisions of the revised Circular word-for-word.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






Background


This interim final rule incorporates and reflects the provisions of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issuance
of revised OMB Circular A-110 at 58 FR 62992 into a new 22 CFR Part 518 of the USIA regulatory requirements for financial
assistance. OMB Circular A-110 was originally issued by OMB in 1976 with minor revisions made in 1987. The standards
it contained were structured into 15 attachments lettered A-O. An interagency task force also reviewed the
circular in 1987 and recommended it be combined with OMB Circular A-102, Uniform Requirements for Grants and
Agreements with State and Local Governments, as a consolidated ``common rule''. In November 1988, a proposed consolidated
``common rule'' was published in the 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 44716) but, due to adverse concerns by some university groups and Federal agencies it was not finalized and issued
by OMB. In November 1990, another interagency task force was convened to review Circular A-110 and a revision
in a ``common rule'' format was proposed and developed. This revision was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 39018) in August 1992 and over 200 comments were received from all sources. All comments were considered in a
final revision of Circular A-110 which was issued for governmentwide application in the 

Federal Register

 on November 29, 1993. Consequently, this rule is published as an interim final rule because of the previous request-for-comment
process used in the development of the Circular, the large number of comments already received and considered by OMB
and the Federal agencies, and the limited flexibility to revise the rule provided by OMB.

Authority: 

This interim final rule is issued under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 503 (the Chief Financial Officers Act), 31 U.S.C.
1111, 41 U.S.C. 405 (the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act), Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, and E.O. 11541
(``Prescribing the Duties of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council in the Executive
Office of the President''). 


Justification to Issue Interim Final Rule


Under the Administrative Procedures Act, to issue a final rule without notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), it is
necessary to make a finding that issuing an NPRM would be impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.
As stated above, this rule is based on the revised OMB Circular A-110, that was developed by an interagency task
force and received extensive public comment. The revised Circular specifies that Federal agencies responsible
for awarding and administering grants and other agreements to recipients described therein, shall adopt the language
in the Circular unless other provisions are required by Federal statute or exceptions or deviations are approved
by OMB. This interim final rule adopts the provisions of the Circular word-for-word. Therefore, an NPRM would not
allow the public to make comments that could have a significant impact on the content of the rule. This would make such
an effort unnecessary.

 518.3 



Effect on other issuances. 



For awards subject to this part, all administrative requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals,
handbooks and other non-regulatory materials which are inconsistent with the requirements of this part shall be
superseded, except to the extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with the deviations provision
in  518.4. 



 518.4 



Deviations.



The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may grant exceptions for classes of grants or recipients subject to the requirements
of this part when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in the interest of maximum uniformity, exceptions
from the requirements of this part shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. Federal awarding agencies may
apply more restrictive requirements to a class of recipients when approved by OMB. Federal awarding agencies may
apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for those requirements which are statutory.
Exceptions on a case-by-case basis may also be made by Federal awarding agencies. 



 518.5 



Subawards. 



Unless sections of this part specifically exclude subrecipients from coverage, the provisions of this part shall
be applied to subrecipients performing work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher education,

of regulations implementing the grants management common rule, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants
and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,'' published at 53 FR 9034 (3/11/88).

Sections 518.11 through 518.17 prescribes forms and instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying
for Federal awards.


 518.11


Pre-award policies.


(a) Use of Grants and Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts. In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall
decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant
and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts.
A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public
purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants
and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial involvement is expected between the executive
agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.''
Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or
use of the Federal Government.
(b) Public Notice and Priority Setting. Federal awarding agencies shall notify the public of its intended funding
priorities for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute.


 518.12


Forms for applying for Federal assistance.


(a) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320,
``Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public,'' with regard to all forms used by the Federal awarding agency in place
of or as a supplement to the Standard Form 424 (SF-424) series.
(b) Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and instructions prescribed by the Federal awarding
agency.
(c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' the applicant
shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF-424 (Application for Federal Assistance) indicating whether
the application was subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for
a particular State can be obtained from the Federal awarding agency or the 

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. 

The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State
for review.

(d) Federal awarding agencies that do not use the SF-424 form should indicate whether the application is subject
to review by the State under E.O. 12372.


 518.13


Debarment and suspension.


Federal awarding agencies and recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension rule, implementing
E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' This rule restricts subawards and contracts with certain
parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance
programs or activities.


 518.14


Special award conditions.


(a) Federal awarding agencies may impose additional requirements as needed, if an applicant or recipient:
(1) Has a history of poor performance,
(2) Is not financially stable,
(3) Has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this part,
(4) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or
(5) Is not otherwise responsible.
(b) Additional requirements may only be imposed provided that such applicant or recipient is notified in writing
as to:

<TEXT>
 

(1) The nature of the additional requirements, 

(2) The reason why the additional requirements are being imposed, 

(3) The nature of the corrective action needed, 

(4) The time allowed for completing the corrective actions, and 

(5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed. 



 518.15 

Metric system of measurement.



The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205), declares that
the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency
to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies shall follow the provisions of
E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.'' 



 518.16 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. 



Under the Act, any State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal
funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the
purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR Parts 247-254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education,
hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference
in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.




 518.17 

Certification and representations.




Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal awarding agency is authorized and encouraged
to allow recipients to submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive order, or regulation
on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications
and representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance
with the pertinent requirements. 




Subpart C_Post-Award Requirements 



Financial and Program Management 



 518.20 

Purpose of financial and program management.



Sections 518.21 through 518.28 prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making payments
and rules for: satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for program income, budget revision
approvals, making audits, determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability. 






 518.21 

Standards for financial management systems.



(a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate financial data to performance data and develop
unit cost information whenever practical. 

(b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following. 

(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program
in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in  19.52. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting
on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall
not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its
reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.

(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income and interest.

(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately
safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.

(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should
be related to performance and unit cost data.

(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs.''

(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.

(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation.

(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal
awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements
of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.

(d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient
coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.

(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.''



 518.22



Payment.



(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of
State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR part 205.

(b)(1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:

(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient,
and

(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in
section  518.21.

(2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the
actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share
of any allowable indirect costs.

(c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal
awarding agency to the recipient.

(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.

(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.

(3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic
fund transfers are not used.

(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,''
or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to
the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal
awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.

(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding
agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project
is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor
portion of the project.

(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt
of the billing, unless the billing is improper.

(2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds are
not used.

(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that
reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency
may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance
cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's
disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements.
The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely
advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned
on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges
made by recipients at any time during the project period unless the conditions in paragraphs (h)(1) or 

(2) of this section apply.

(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements.

(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129,
``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable
notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until
the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.

(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are
as follows:

(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, Federal awarding agencies shall not require
separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories
for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure
of funds.

(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.

(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members).

(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless the conditions in paragraphs
(k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.

(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances.

(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources.

(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient
for administrative expense. In keeping with Electric Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR part 206), interest should be
remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electric medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients
which do not have this capability should use a check. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it
pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards
without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under
CMIA.

(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.
(1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270
as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods
are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in
lieu of the SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.''
(2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding
agency shall adopt the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction
programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines
that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.


 518.23 

Cost sharing or matching.


(a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing
or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria.
(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.
(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.
(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.

(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable. 
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the
Federal awarding agency.
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities
acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the
lesser of paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section.
(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the
time of donation.
(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency
may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value
at the time of donation to the project.
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid. 

(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop
and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be
reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. 

(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title
passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if the conditions in paragraphs (g)(1) or
(2) of this section apply. 

(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total
value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. 

(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved
the charges. 

(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications. 

(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient. 

(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition
at the time of donation. 

(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality. 

(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value. 

(5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third
parties. 

(i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient
for its own employees. 

(ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall
be documented. 



 518.24 

Program income. 




(a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards set forth in this section in requiring recipient organizations
to account for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds. 

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained
by the recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award,
shall be used in one or more of the ways listed in the following.

(1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding agency and recipient and used to further eligible
project or program objectives. 

(2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program. 

(3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal
share of costs is based. 

(c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this
section. 

(d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of
the award how program income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects
or programs except research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically
unless the awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award or the recipient
is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in  518.14. 

(e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients
shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.


(f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident
to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these
costs have not been charged to the award. 

(g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards
(See   518.30 through 518.37). 

(h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients
shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties
for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However,
Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or
research award. 



 518.25 

Revision of budget and program plans. 



(a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It may
include either the Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon Federal awarding agency
requirements. It shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate. 

(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget
and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section. 

(c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for one
or more of the following program or budget related reasons. 

(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring
prior written approval). 

(2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award document. 

(3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved
project director or principal investigator. 

(4) The need for additional Federal funding. 

(5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval
is required by the Federal awarding agency.

(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, Federal awarding agencies are
authorized, at their option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this
part and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or
more of the following:
(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the
Federal awarding agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Federal awarding agency
is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award
is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).
(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following
conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing with
the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award.
This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances.
(i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.
(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.
(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.
(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods.

(4) For awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the award or in the
agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section are automatically
waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph
(e)(2) of this section applies.
(f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or
programs, functions and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative
amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal
awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or
part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.
(g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section,
do not require prior approval.
(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies
for budget revisions whether the conditions in paragraphs (h) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.
(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program.
(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.
(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed
consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in  518.27
(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by
OMB.
(j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction
work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval from the Federal awarding agency
before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.
(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify
the Federal awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed
the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever
is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation
award.
(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application
unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.
(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies
shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision
is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient
in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

 518.26 

Non-Federal audits.



(a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations shall
be subject to the audit requirements contained in OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education
and Other Non-Profit Institutions.''

(b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C.
7501-7) which implements OMB Circular A-128, ``Audits of State and Local Governments.''

(c) Hospitals not covered by the audit provisions of OMB Circular A-133 shall be subject to the audit requirements
of the Federal awarding agencies.

(d) Commercial organizations shall be subject to the audit requirements of the Federal awarding agency or the prime
recipients as incorporated into the award document.



 518.27 

Allowable costs.



For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of
costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus,
allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined
in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.''
The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions
of OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred
by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, ``Cost
Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance
with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and
Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations
and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with
the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.



 518.28 

Period of availability of funds.



Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations
incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal awarding agency.



Property Standards



 518.30 

Purpose of property standards.



(a) Sections 518.31 through 518.37 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property
furnished by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Federal awarding
agencies shall require recipients to observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements,
unless specifically required by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and
procedures provided it observes the provisions of   518.31 through 518.37.



 518.31 

Insurance coverage.



Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired
with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless
required by the terms and conditions of the award.



 518.32 

Real property.



Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of
real property acquired in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements,
at a minimum, shall contain the following.

<DOCNO> FR940803-0-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the Federal awarding agency.

(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal awarding agency for the use of real property in other
federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose
of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e.,
awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the Federal awarding agencies.

(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal awarding agency. The
Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more of the following disposition instructions.

(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project.

(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and
pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the
Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any,
from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures
shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage
of the current fair market value of the property.



 518.33



Federally-owned and exempt property.



(a) Federally-owned property. (1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government.
Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to the Federal
awarding agency. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report
the property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency utilization.

(2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to
the General Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the
property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C.
3710(I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821,
``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions
shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency.

(b) Exempt property. When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to
property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under
conditions the Federal awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should a Federal
awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient
without further obligation to the Federal Government.

 518.34 

Equipment.


(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section.
(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside
organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment. 
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient
shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order or priority:
(1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded the original project, then 
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall
be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal
Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by
the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income. 
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Federal
awarding agency. 
(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following. 
(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information. 
(i) A description of the equipment.
(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification
number. 
(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number. 
(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost. 
(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment
(not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).

(vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.

(viii) Unit acquisition cost.

(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current
fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.

(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.

(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.

(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.

(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.

(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established
which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient
may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency
or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation
in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has
no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency.
The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements.
If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services
Administration by the Federal awarding agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other
Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar
days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.

(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's
request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an amount computed by applying
to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However,
the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever
is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.

(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal
Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost
of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping
or interim storage costs incurred.

(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the
Federal awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.

(4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party
named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer
shall be subject to the following standards.

(i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.


(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of
a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment.
If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient
shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate. 

(iii) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions
for federally-owned equipment. 




 518.35 

Supplies and other expendable property.





(a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual
inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project
or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall
retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either cases, compensate
the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.


(b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations
for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal
statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies. 





 518.36 

Intangible property.



(a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was
purchased, under an award. The Federal awarding agency(ies) reserve a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable
right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so. 

(b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide
regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations
and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.'' 

(c) Unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, the Federal Government has the right to the following: 

(1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award. 

(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes. 

(d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition
in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient

authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of paragraph
 19.34(g).

 518.37 

Property trust relationship.



Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds
shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property
was acquired or improved. Agencies may require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of record
to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition
conditions apply to the property.



Procurement Standards



 518.40 

Purpose of procurement standards.



Sections 518.41 through 518.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or
requirements shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, unless specifically required by
Federal statute or executive order or approved by OMB.



 518.41 

Recipient responsibilities.



The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal awarding agency,
regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements
entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source
evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to
such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.



 518.42 

Codes of conduct.



The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.



 518.43 

Competition.



All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer
is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered.
Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid
or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest
to do so.



 518.44

(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following:
(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.
(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms or functions to be performed or performance
required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.
(iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items
are included in the solicitation.
(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in
the metric system of measurement.
(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipient to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business
enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further this
goal.
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable.
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange timeframes for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
(5) Use of services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and
the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used.

(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources.
In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by the implementation of E.O.'s 12549 and
12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.''

(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement
documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the
following conditions apply.

(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part.

(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000)
and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.

(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.

(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement.

(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold.



 518.45 



Cost and price analysis.



Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement
action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted,
market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element
of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability.



 518.46



Procurement records.



Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following
at a minimum: 

(a) Basis for contractor selection,

(b) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained, and 

(c) Basis for award cost or price.



 518.47



Contract administration.



A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions
and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall
evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions,
and specifications of the contract.



 518.48



Contract provisions.



The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions
in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.

(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.

(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. 

(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements
of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest
is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.


(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified. 

(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.


(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 

(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 

(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, the Comptroller General of the
United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers
and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits,
examinations, excerpts and transcriptions. 

(e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement
provisions of Appendix A to this part, as applicable. 



Reports and Records 



 518.50 

Purpose of reports and records. 



Sections 518.51 through 518.53 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial
and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements.




 518.51 

Monitoring and reporting program performance. 



(a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function or activity
supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements
as delineated in  518.26. 

(b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted.
Except as provided in  518.51(f), performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly
or, less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or
semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual
reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance
reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award. 

(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.


(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the
following. 

(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 

(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-0-00066 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high
unit costs. 
(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. 
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency of developments that have a significant impact
on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse
conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include
a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
(g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed. 
(h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance
data from recipients.


 518.52 

Financial reporting.


(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information
from recipients. 
(1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report. 
(i) Each Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF-269 or SF-269A to report the status
of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of
not requiring the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF-272,
Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that
a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF-270 is used
only for advances. 
(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal
awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the
accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual
information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand. 
(iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or
program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not
be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the
completion of the agreement. 
(iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original
and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and
semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved
by the Federal awarding agency upon request of the recipient.

(2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions.
(i) When funds are advanced to recipients the Federal awarding agency shall require each recipient to submit the SF-272
and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF-272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to
monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.
(ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of
the report.
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks''
section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations
of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.
(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF-272 15 calendar
days following the end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients
receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.
(v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following
reasons:
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through
other forms contained in this section;
(B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive
Federal advances; or,
(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.
(b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall
be observed.
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall
issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports.
(2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in
 518.21, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to
the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in obtaining this
information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.
(3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.
(4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format
or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
(5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes
to the accuracy of reporting.

 518.53 

Retention and access requirements for records.





(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. Federal
awarding agencies shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients.



(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that
are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as
authorized by the Federal awarding agency. The only exceptions are the following.



(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.



(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.



(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement
is not applicable to the recipient.



(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. as specified in paragraph  518.53(g).



(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.



(d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines
that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal
awarding agency may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint
use.



(e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers,
or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts,
transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's
personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph
are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.



(f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall place restrictions on recipients that limit public
access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate
that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency.



(g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply
to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals,
cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is
chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).

(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits
to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year
retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.

(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the
subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation
purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records
starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.



Termination and Enforcement



 518.60



Purpose of termination and enforcement.



Sections 518.61 and 518.62 set forth uniform suspension, termination and enforcement procedures.



 518.61



Termination.



(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section
apply.

(1) By the Federal awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.

(2) By the Federal awarding agency with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon
the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to
be terminated.

(3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency written notification setting forth the reasons for
such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However,
if the Federal awarding agency determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion
of the grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety
under either paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section.

(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in  518.71(a), including
those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall
be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.



 518.62



Enforcement.



(a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award,
whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the Federal awarding
agency may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in  518.14, take one or more of the
following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.

(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement
action by the Federal awarding agency.

(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity
or action not in compliance.

<TEXT>
 

(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
(4) Without further awards for the project or program.
(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
(b) Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity
for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation
applicable to the action involved.
(c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient
during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes
them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after
termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if the conditions in paragraphs (c) (1)
or (2) of this section apply.
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period
in which the termination takes effect.
(d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension
and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and
12689 and the Federal awarding agency implementing regulations (see  518.13).


Subpart D_After-the-Award Requirements


 518.70 

Purpose.

and adjustments.


 518.71 

Closeout procedures.


(a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all financial, performance,
and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. The Federal awarding agency may approve extensions
when requested by the recipient.
(b) Unless the Federal awarding agency authorizes an extension, a recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred
under the award not later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion as specified in the
terms and conditions of the award or in agency implementing instructions.

the award being closed out.
(d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that the Federal awarding agency has advanced
or paid and that is not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A-129
governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts.

Federal Government in accordance with   518.31 through 518.37.
(g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, the Federal awarding agency shall
retain the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowing costs
resulting from the final audit.


 518.72


Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.


(a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following.
(1) The right of the Federal awarding agency to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other

the consent of the Federal awarding agency and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient referred
to in  518.73(a), including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made
for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.


 518.73


Collection of amounts due.


(a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled
under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable
period after the demand for payment, the Federal awarding agency may reduce the debt by the provisions of paragraphs
(a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section.
(1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements.
(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient.

All contracts, awarded by a recipient including small purchases, shall contain the following provisions as applicable:
1. 

Equal Employment Opportunity

_All contracts shall contain a provision requiring compliance with E.O. 11246, ``Equal Employment Opportunity,''
as amended by E.O. 11375, ``Amending Executive Order 11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity,'' and as supplemented
by regulations at 41 CFR part 60, ``Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity,
Department of Labor.''
2. 

Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874 and 40 U.S.C. 276c)

_All contracts and subgrants in excess of $2,000 for construction or repair awarded by recipients and subrecipients
shall include a provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874), as supplemented
by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3, ``Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public
Work Financed in Whole or in part by Loans or Grants from the United States''). The Act provides that each contractor
or subrecipient shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion,
or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The recipient shall
report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency.
3. 

Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7)

_When required by Federal program legislation, all construction contracts awarded by the recipients and subrecipients
of more than $2,000 shall include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7)
and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5, ``Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to
Contracts Governing Federally Financed and Assisted Construction''). Under this Act, contractors shall be required
to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage determination made
by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors shall be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The recipient
shall place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor in each solicitation
and the award of a contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage determination. The recipient shall
report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency.
4. 

Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333)

_Where applicable, all contracts awarded by recipients in excess of $2,000 for construction contracts and in excess
of $2,500 for other contracts that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers shall include a provision for compliance
with Sections 102 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333), as supplemented
by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under Section 102 of the Act, each contractor shall be required
to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the
standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than 11/2 times the basic
rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. Section 107 of the Act is applicable to construction
work and provides that no laborer or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions
which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials
or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.
5. 

Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract or Agreement

_Contracts or agreements for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work shall provide for

Discussion of Regulations


The Wilmington Family YMCA submitted an application to hold the swim portion of the 16th Annual Wilmington Family
YMCA_Physicians Health Plan Triathlon at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The swim portion of the triathlon
will consist of approximately 700 swimmers racing in a section of the Wrightsville Channel. The regulations in 33
CFR 100.513 govern the activities of the swim portion of the triathlon in Wrightsville Channel between Wrightsville
Channel Daybeacon 18 (LLNR 28050) and Wrightsville Channel Daybeacon 23 (LLNR 28065). Because the swim portion of
the triathlon is an event of the type contemplated by these regulations, the safety of the participants will be enhanced
by the implementation of the special local regulations. The waterway will be closed during the event. Since the waterway
will not be closed for an extended period, commercial traffic should not be severely disrupted.

Safety Zones, Security Zones, and Special Local Regulations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of temporary rules issued.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document provides required notice of substantive rules adopted by the Coast Guard and temporarily effective
between April 1, 1994 and June 30, 1994, which were not published in the 

Federal Register

. This quarterly notice lists temporary local regulations, security zones, and safety zones, which were of limited
duration and for which timely publication in the 

Federal Register

 was not possible. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

District Commanders and Captains of the Port (COTP) must be immediately responsive to the safety needs of the waters
within their jurisdiction; therefore, District Commanders and COTPs have been delegated the authority to issue
certain local regulations. Safety zones may be established for safety or environmental purposes. A safety zone may
be stationary and described by fixed limits or it may be described as a zone around a vessel in motion. Security zones
limit access to vessels, ports, or waterfront facilities to prevent injury or damage. Special local regulations
are issued to assure the safety of participants and spectators at regattas and other marine events. Timely publication
of these regulations in the 

Federal Register

 is often precluded when a regulation responds to an emergency, or when an event occurs without sufficient advance
notice. However, the affected public is informed of these regulations through Local Notices to Mariners, press releases,
and other means. Moreover, actual notification is provided by Coast Guard patrol vessels enforcing the restrictions
imposed by the regulation. 



Because mariners are notified by Coast Guard officials on-scene prior to enforcement action, 

Federal Register

 notice is not required to place the special local regulation, security zone, or safety zone in effect. However, the
Coast Guard, by law, must publish in the 

Federal Register

 notice of substantive rules adopted. To discharge this legal obligation without imposing undue expense on the public,
the Coast Guard periodically publishes a list of these temporary special local regulations, security zones, and
safety zones. Permanent regulations are not included in this list because they are published in their entirety in
the 

Federal Register

. Temporary regulations may also be published in their entirety if sufficient time is available to do so before they
are placed in effect or terminated. These safety zones, special local regulations and security zones have been exempted
from review under E.O. 12866 because of their emergency nature, or limited scope and temporary effectiveness. 

The following regulations were placed in effect temporarily during the period April 1, 1994 and June 30, 1994, unless
otherwise indicated.

Notice of Hazardous Conditions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is amending the rule that requires notice of hazardous conditions. The amended rule will clarify the
conditions requiring notice and the parties responsible for providing notice; it will eliminate any confusion that
might exist in determining whether a particular incident is reportable and, if so, by whom. It should forestall another
disaster such as the derailment of a passenger train near Mobile, Alabama, in September 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Request for Comments




The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking [CGD
94-027] and the specific section of this interim rule to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each
comment. Please submit two copies of all comments and attachments in an unbound format, no larger than 81/2 by 11 inches,
suitable for copying and electronic filing. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose
stamped, self-addressed postcards or envelopes.

The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this rule in view of the
comments.

The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Marine Safety Council
at the address under ``ADDRESSES.'' The request should include the reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it
determines that the opportunity for oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a hearing
at a time and place announced by a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.



Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant John P. Sifling, Project Manager, Office
of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection, and Mr. Patrick J. Murray, Project Counsel, Office of
the Chief Counsel.



Regulatory Information



This rule is being published as an interim rule and is being made effective on the date of publication. The Coast Guard
has determined that it would be contrary to the public interest to delay publication of this amendment, which clarifies
existing law, imposes no new regulatory requirements, and involves no significant change in policy. For these good
reasons, the Coast Guard finds, under 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(3) and (d)(3), that both notice and public hearing on the notice,
before the effective date of this rule, are unnecessary and that this rule should be made effective less than 30 days
after publication.



Background and Purpose



The derailment of the Amtrak Sunset Limited, a passenger train, on September 22, 1993, with extensive injury and loss
of life, resulted in a study by the Coast Guard entitled 

Review of Marine Safety Issues Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels

. This study, conducted jointly by the Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services (G-N) and the Office
of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection (G-M), provided the Commandant of the Coast Guard
with a number of recommendations to enhance safety in the towboat industry. (Persons may review this study at the office
of the Marine Safety Council at the address under ``ADDRESSES.'') One of these recommendations called for ``a regulatory
project to amend 33 CFR 160.215 to clearly indicate that the required notice of a hazardous condition includes a hazardous
condition caused by a vessel or its operation even when the hazardous condition is not on board the vessel.'' The Commandant
concurred, and directed the Division of Port Safety and Security (G-MPS), Office of Marine Safety, Security,
and Environmental Protection, to initiate the recommended regulatory project. On March 2, 1994, the Coast Guard
announced [59 FR 10031] a public meeting to help guide the project. On April 4, 1994, the meeting occurred.



Discussion of Rule



This interim rule amends the existing rule in one editorial and three substantive ways. First, it revises 33 CFR 160.203,
Definitions, to redefine ``hazardous condition.'' Second, it revises 33 CFR 160.215, Notice of hazardous conditions,
by including among reporting-criteria for hazardous conditions, along with any such condition actually aboard
a vessel, any caused by the operation of a vessel. Although current  160.203 defines such a condition as any ``that
could adversely affect the safety of any vessel, bridge, structure, or shore area * * *'', the Coast
Guard suspects potential for confusion regarding the responsibility for giving notice under certain circumstances.
This confusion might arise from current  160.215 itself, which prescribes notice only ``whenever there is
a hazardous condition on board a vessel [emphasis added].'' The Coast Guard is concerned that owners, masters, agents,
or persons in charge (or, from now on [see below], operators) might misinterpret this to cover such a condition aboard
a vessel and yet not one that adversely affects, as the definition specifies, the safety of other vessels, bridges,
structures, or shore areas, or the environmental quality of ports, harbors, and navigable waters of the United States.
Third, this rule adds the term ``operator'' to the list of those responsible for giving notice. Often, a vessel is owned
by one company but operated by another. An operator must bear responsibility for the action of its employees_particularly
with regard to foreign vessels, where the master and crew are not licensed in the United States. Making ``operator''
explicit will clarify the operator's responsibility for giving notice of hazardous conditions. Fourth, this rule
supplies a parenthetical cross-reference to the requirement of a less-urgent but more-detailed written report
whenever the hazardous conditions involves a ``marine casualty'' within the meaning of 46 CFR part 4.



Regulatory Evaluation



This interim rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) [44 FR 11040 (February 26, 1979)]. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary. This finding rests on the determination that this rule clarifies an existing requirement and
does not place any new requirement on the public.

Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

], the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed
rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000.

The Coast Guard has reviewed this interim rule for potential impact on small entities. Because this rule does not place
any new requirements on the public, the Coast Guard has determined that it will have no economic impact on small entities.
If you nonetheless think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have
a significant economic impact on your business or organization, please submit a comment (see ``ADDRESSES'') explaining
why you think it qualifies and to what degree this rule will economically affect it.



Collection of Information



This interim rule contains no new collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act [44
U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

].



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this interim rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that the rule does not have sufficient implications for federalism to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this interim rule and concluded that, under  2.B.2 of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
This rule is an administrative matter within the meaning of sub- 2.B.2.1. of that Instruction that clearly
has no environmental impact. A Determination of Categorical Exclusion is available in the docket for inspection
or copying where indicated under ``ADDRESSES.''



List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 160

wherever they appear with the words ``owner, agent, master, operator, or person in charge''.

4. Section 160.215 is revised to read as follows:



 160.215

Notice of hazardous conditions.



Whenever there is a hazardous condition either aboard a vessel or caused by a vessel or its operation, the owner, agent,

Safety Zone Regulation; Kent Narrows Hydroplane Races, Kirwan Creek, Hog Island, MD



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is establishing a safety zone for the Kent Narrows Hydroplane Races. This
safety zone is necessary to control spectator craft and to provide for the safety of life and property on U.S. navigable
waters during the event. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rule Making has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. The application to hold this
event was not submitted until June 1, 1994 to Coast Guard Group Baltimore and there was not sufficient time remaining
to publish proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.



Background and Purpose



The Kent Narrows Racing Association filed an application with Coast Guard Group Baltimore requesting Coast Guard
assistance to control spectator craft during the Kent Narrows Hydroplane Races. Due to the possible hazards associated
with this event, the Coast Guard has determined that a safety zone is necessary to ensure the safety of spectators and
participants.



Discussion of Regulations



The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is establishing a safety zone on Kirwan Creek just off of Hog Island
for the Kent Narrows Hydroplane Races. The Kent Narrows Hydroplane Races will feature groups of high performance
hydroplane's racing around a set course near the mouth of Kirwan Creek at speeds in excess of 130 miles per hour. This
safety zone will encompass all waters of Kirwan Creek that lie 200 yards on all sides of a line that connects the following
points: 38 degrees 57 minutes 56 seconds north, 076 degrees 14 minutes 58 seconds west to 38 degrees 57 minutes 36 seconds
north, 076 degrees 15 minutes 24 seconds west.

Since the mouth of Kirwan Creek will not be completely closed down during this event, vessel traffic should not be severely
disrupted.

Spectator vessels that wish to watch the race may anchor outside of the safety zone, but they may not anchor in or block
a navigable channel.



Drafting Information



The drafters of this regulation are Chief Warrant Officer Timothy P. Ryan, project officer for the Captain of the Port,
Baltimore, Maryland and Lieutenant Commander Christoper A. Abel, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District
Legal Staff.



Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Do to the location of this safety zone the Coast Guard expects the impact of this rule to be minimal. The Coast Guard certifies
under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation.

Safety Zone; Yachts for All Seasons, Inc. Fireworks, Upper New York Bay, NY and NJ



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for a fireworks program located in Federal Anchorage 20C in
the Upper New York Bay. This event will take place on August 3, 1994, from 10 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. and will temporarily
close all waters of Federal Anchorage 20C in the Upper New York Bay, within a 300 yard radius from the center point of
two fireworks barges anchored together approximately 300 yards east of Liberty Island, New York. This safety zone
will preclude all vessels from transiting this portion of the Upper New York Bay and is needed to protect the boating
public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Drafting Information


The drafters of this notice are LT R. Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York and CDR J. Astley, Project
Attorney, First Coast Guard District, Legal Office.



Regulatory History



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was not published for this regulation and good cause
exists for not publishing an NPRM as well as making it effective less than 30 days after 

Federal Register

 publication. Due to the date this application was received, there was insufficient time to draft and publish a notice
of proposed rulemaking that allows for a reasonable comment period prior to the event. There was also insufficient
time for publication of this temporary final rule 30 days prior to the event. The delay encountered if normal rulemaking
procedures were followed would effectively cancel this event. Cancellation of this event is contrary to public interest.





Background and Purpose



Fireworks by Grucci submitted an application to hold a fireworks program in the waters of the Upper New York Bay, off
of Liberty Island, New York. This regulation establishes a temporary safety zone in the waters of Federal Anchorage
20C in the Upper New York Bay within a 300 yard radius from the center point of two fireworks barges anchored together
approximately 300 yards east of Liberty Island at or near 40
 41
'17
'
' N latitude, 74
 02
'25
'
' W longitude. This safety zone will preclude all vessels from transiting this portion of the Upper New York
Bay and is needed to protect boaters from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area.



Regulatory Evaluation



This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This safety zone will close a portion of the Upper New York Bay to all vessel traffic
between 10:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. on August 3, 1994, unless terminated sooner by the Captain of the Port, New York. Although
this regulation will prevent traffic from transiting this area, the effect of this regulation will not be significant
for several reasons. Due to the fact that this safety zone will not impact any navigable channel; that Federal Anchorage
20C is minimally used so no vessel is expected to be displaced by this event; that the duration of the event is limited:
that the event is at a late hour; and that extensive, advance advisories will be made to the maritime community, the
impact of this regulation is expected to be minimal. In addition, there are sufficient alternate anchorage areas
in the immediate vicinity for mariners to anchor if desired.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation
will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).

For the reasons given in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal.
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information





This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501).



Federalism





The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Environment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to promote maritime
safety and protect the environment, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination is included in the docket.

Pesticide Tolerance for Tebuconazole




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule establishes tolerances for residues of the fungicide tebuconazole (

alpha

-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethyl]-

alpha

-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1

H

-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) in or on the raw agricultural commodities peanuts and peanut hulls. Miles, Inc., petitioned
EPA for this regulation to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of the fungicide.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

: EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 23, 1989 (54 FR 12009), which announced that Miles, Inc., Agricultural Division (formerly Mobay Corp., Agricultural
Chemicals Division), P.O. Box 4913, Kansas City, MO 64120-0013, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 9F3724 to
EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA),
21 U.S.C. 346a(d), propose to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing tolerances for residues of the fungicide tebuconazole
(

alpha

-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethyl]-

alpha

-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1

H

-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) in or on the raw agricultural commodities barley grain at 2.0 parts per million (ppm),
barley grain forage at 5.0 ppm, barley straw at 5.0 ppm, grapes at 2.0 ppm, grass seed cleanings (including hulls) at
25.0 ppm, grass seed straw (including chaff) at 30.0 ppm, peanuts at 0.05 ppm, peanut hulls at 3.5 ppm, peanut hay at
50.0 ppm, raisins at 3.0 ppm, wheat grain at 0.40 ppm, wheat grain forage at 4.5 ppm and wheat straw at 19.0 ppm. 


Miles, Inc., has amended the petition to propose amending 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation to permit the
residues of the fungicide tebuconazole in or on peanuts at 0.1 ppm and peanut hulls at 4.0 ppm. This was announced as
a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29291).
In previous amendments to the cited pesticide petition, requested by Miles, Inc., all commodities other than peanuts
and peanut hulls (peanut hay, barley grain, barley grain forage, barley straw, grapes, grass seed cleanings including
hulls, grass seed straw including chaff, raisins, wheat grain, wheat grain forage, and wheat straw) were withdrawn.



Comments on the Amended Notice of Filing


Comments have been received in reponse to the June 6, 1994 notice of filing.
Comments were received asserting that tebuconazole concentrates in peanut oil, based on the previously proposed
food additive petition (FAP) for tebuconazole in peanut oil and the assumption that tebuconazole therefore concentrates
during processing in peanut oil. The commenter asked how EPA could proceed to grant the section 408 tolerances for
peanuts without also addressing the section 409 food additive regulation for peanut oil. 


EPA's response

. Tebuconazole does in fact concentrate in peanut crude oil. However, EPA does not regulate peanut crude oil; instead,
EPA regulates the peanut refined oil used in commerce and consumed by humans. Initial tebuconazole peanut processing
studies and the resulting proposed food additive regulation in/on peanut oil indicated concentration of tebuconazole
in both peanut crude and refined oil, but those studies did not represent commercial peanut oil refining procedures
since they did not include oil bleaching and deodorization.
A subsequent peanut processing study did include oil bleaching and deodorization and these additional refining
operations, which are used in commercial peanut oil refining, resulted in a 93-percent reduction in tebuconazole
residues. Therefore, a section 409 food additive regulation for tebuconazole in/on peanut oil is not required. 
Tebuconazole has been shown to concentrate in peanut soapstock. Based upon recently acquired information, EPA has
found that peanut soapstock is no longer used as an animal feed. Therefore, an FAP for tebuconazole in peanut soapstock
is not required. 


The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
data considered in support of the tolerance include:
1. A 90-day rat feeding study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 34.8 milligrams per kilogram of body weight
per day (mg/kg bw/day) (400 ppm) and a lowest effect level (LEL) of 171.7 mg/kg bw/day (1600 ppm) in males, based on decreased
body weight gains and histological changes in the adrenals. For females, the NOEL was 10.8 mg/kg bw/day (100 ppm) and
the LEL was 46.5 mg/kg bw/day (400 ppm) based on decreased body weights, decreased body weight gains, and histological
changes in the adrenals.
2. A 90-day dog feeding study with a NOEL of 200 ppm (73.7 mg/kg bw/day in males and 73.4 mg/kg bw/day in females) and a
LEL of 1000 ppm (368.3 mg/kg bw/day in males and 351.8 mg/kg bw/day in females). The LEL was based on decreases in mean
body weights, body weight gains, and food consumption, and an increase in liver 

N

-demethylase activity.
3. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1 mg/kg bw/day (40 ppm) and a LEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day (200 ppm), based on lenticular
and corneal opacity and hepatic toxicity in either sex (the current Reference Dose was determined based on this study).
A subsequent 1-year dog feeding study, using lower doses to further define the NOEL for tebuconazole, defines a systemic
LOEL of 150 ppm (based on adrenal effects in both sexes) and a systemic NOEL of 100 ppm.
4. A 2-year rat chronic feeding study defined, a NOEL of 7.4 mg/kg bw/day (100 ppm) and a LEL of 22.8 mg/kg bw/day (300
ppm) based on body weight depression, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV and MCHC, and increased liver microsomal
enzymes in females. Tebuconazole was not oncogenic at the dose levels tested (0, 100, 300, 1000 ppm).
5. A rat oral developmental toxicity study with a maternal NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 60 mg/kg bw/day based on
elevation of absolute and relative liver weights. For developmental toxicity, a NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of
60 mg/kg bw/day was determined, based on delayed ossification of thoracic, cervical and sacral vertebrae, sternum,
fore and hind limbs and increase in supernumerary ribs.
6. A rabbit oral developmental toxicity study with a maternal NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 100 mg/kg bw/day based
on depression of body weight gains and food consumption. A developmental NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 100 mg/kg
bw/day were based on increased post-implantation losses, from both early and late resorptions

7. A mouse oral developmental toxicity study with a maternal NOEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 20 mg/kg bw/day based
on a supplementary study indicating reduction in hematocrit and histological changes in liver. A developmental
NOEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day based on dose-dependent increases in runts/dam at 30 and 100 mg/kg
bw/day.

8. A mouse dermal developmental toxicity study with a maternal NOEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and a LEL of 60 mg/kg bw/day based
on a supplementary study indicating increased liver microsomal enzymes and histological changes in liver. The NOEL
for developmental toxicity in the dermal study in the mouse is 1000 mg/kg bw/day, the highest dose tested (HDT).

9. A two-generation rat reproduction study with a dietary maternal NOEL of 15 mg/kg bw/day (300 ppm) and a LEL of 50 mg/kg
bw/day (1000 ppm) based on depressed body weights, increased spleen hemosiderosis and decreased liver and kidney
weights. A reproductive NOEL of 15 mg/kg bw/day (300 ppm) and a LEL of 50 mg/kg bw/day (1000 ppm) were based on neonatal
birth weight depression.

10. An Ames mutagenesis study in Salmonella that showed no mutagenicity with or without metabolic activation.

11. A micronucleus mutagenesis assay study in mice that showed no genotoxicity.

12. A sister chromatid exchange mutagenesis study using CHO cells that was negative at dose levels 4 to 30 

m

g/ml without activation or 15 to 120 

m

g/ml with activation.

13. An unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) study that was negative for UDS in rat hepatocytes.

Additionally, a mouse oncogenicity study at dietary levels of 0, 20, 60, and 80 ppm for 21 months did not reveal any oncogenic
effect for tebuconazole at any dose tested. Because the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was not reached in this study,
the study was classified as supplementary. A followup mouse study at higher doses (0, 500, 1500 ppm in the diet), with
an MTD at 500 ppm, revealed statistically significant incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in males
and carcinomas in females. The initial and follow-up studies, together with supplementary data submitted by Miles,
Inc., were classified as core minimum.

The Office of Pesticide Programs' Health Effects Division's Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee (CPRC) has classified
tebuconazole as a Group C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen). This classification is based on the Agency's ``Guidelines
for Carcinogen Risk Assessment'' published in the Federal Register of September 24, 1986 (51 FR 33992). The Agency
has chosen to use the reference dose calculations to estimate human dietary risk from tebuconazole residues. EPA
believes any cancer risk to humans from consumption of tebuconazole residues to be negligible. 

The Reference Dose (RfD) is established at 0.01 mg/kg of body weight (bwt)/day, based on a lower NOEL of 1 mg/kg bwt/day
from the first of two 52-week feeding studies in dogs, and an uncertainty factor of 100. The Theoretical Maximum Residue
Contribution (TMRC) from the current action is estimated at 0.000007 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 0.07 percent of the
RfD for the general population of the 48 States. The TMRCs for the most highly exposed subgroups, children (1 to 6 years
old) and children (7 to 12 years old) are 0.000024 mg/kg bwt/day (0.24% of the RfD) and 0.000017 mg/kg bwt/day (0.17
percent of the RfD), respectively.

The nature of the residue in peanuts is adequately understood. An adequate analytical method, high-pressure liquid
chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes.
The enforcement methodology has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for publication in the Pesticide
Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). Because of the long lead time for publication of the method in PAM II, the analytical
methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested
from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of
Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and
telephone number: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202 (703) 305-5232.

Miles has withdrawn proposed tebuconazole tolerances in animal tissues, milk and eggs. The Agency has determined
that, with the label restriction against feeding peanut hay, there is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues
will occur in milk, eggs or meat of livestock or poultry as a result of the proposed use on peanuts.

The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerances are sought.

Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending
40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal
Register, file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections
and hearing requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections
and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The
objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the
objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing
is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the
requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27).
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor
would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2)
creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.

Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Alachlor; Revocation of Certain Tolerances




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revokes certain tolerances for residues of the herbicide alachlor and its metabolites in or on various
raw agricultural commodities. EPA is initiating this action because registered uses of alachlor on certain food
commodities have been canceled.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2799), EPA proposed to revoke tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the herbicide alachlor (2-chloro-2',6'-diethyl-

N

-(methoxymethyl)acetanilide) and its metabolites in or on the following raw agricultural commmodities listed
in 40 CFR 180.249: Cotton forage, cottonseed, sunflower seed, pea forage, pea hay, peas with pods removed, and potatoes.



By March 1988, the product registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
as amended, for the pesticide products containing the herbicide alachlor were canceled for the above-mentioned
raw agricultural commodities. Based on the fact that alachlor is no longer domestically registered for use on these
food crops and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered for the particular
food use, EPA now proposes to revoke the tolerances listed in 40 CFR 180.249 for residues of alachlor in or on these commodities.
Since the product registrations were canceled more than 5 years ago, residues should not appear in any legally treated,
domestically produced or imported commodities. These tolerances were obtained in conjunction with the FIFRA registrations.

The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerances because sufficient
time has elapsed in order for the residues to dissipate, and EPA does not expect a residue problem due to environmental
contamination. 
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance revocation will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance revocation is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector

``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes a permanent tolerance for residues of the insecticide/nematicide cadusafos, 

O

-ethyl 

S,S

-di-

sec

-butyl phosphorodithioate, in or on the raw agricultural commodity bananas. This regulation to establish a maximum
permissible level for residues of the insecticide/nematicide in or on the commodity was requested in a petition submitted
by the FMC Corp. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24101), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the FMC Corp., Agricultural Chemicals
Group, 200 Market St., Philadelphia, PA 19103, had submitted confirmatory usage data and had requested that EPA,
pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose the establishment
of a permanent tolerance for residues of the nematicide/insecticide cadusafos in or on the RAC bananas at 0.01 part
per million (ppm). 


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the permanent tolerance will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Demeton; Revocation of Tolerances and Feed Additive Regulations




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revokes tolerance and feed additive regulations listed in 40 CFR 180.105 and 186.1600 for residues
of the insecticide demeton in or on various raw agricultural commodities and in animal feeds. EPA is initiating this
action because registered uses of demeton have been canceled.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2800), EPA proposed to revoke tolerances and feed addtive regulations established under
sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a and 348, respectively, for
residues of the insecticide demeton (a mixture of 

O,O

-diethyl 

O

 (and 

S

)-2-(ethylthio)ethylphosphorothioates) in or on raw agricultural commodities and animal feeds. EPA is initiating
this action because all registered uses of this chemical on raw agricultural commodities have been canceled.


By mid-October 1989, all product registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
as amended, for the pesticide products containing the insecticide demeton were canceled. Based on the fact that demeton
is no longer domestically registered for use on any food crops and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide
chemical which is not registered for the particular food use, EPA now proposes to revoke the tolerances and feed additive
regulations for residues of demeton as listed in 40 CFR 180.105 and 40 CFR 186.1600. Since the product registrations
were canceled more than 3 years ago, residues should not appear in any legally treated, domestically produced or imported
commodities. These tolerances were obtained in conjunction with the FIFRA registrations. 
The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerances and feed additive regulations
because sufficient time has elapsed in order for the residues to dissipate, and EPA does not expect a residue problem
due to environmental contamination. 
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance revocations will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance revocations are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by these regulations may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing

Immediate Reporting of Casualties



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is amending the rule that requires notice of marine casualties. The amended rule will clarify which
marine casualties require immediate notice, the means of giving other notice, who shall give it, and to whom it shall
be given, so that prompt corrective or investigative efforts can be initiated. The intent of this change is to provide
a mechanism that will help prevent another disaster such as the derailment of a passenger train near Mobile, Alabama,
in September, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking [CGD
94-030] and the specific section of this interim rule to which each comment applies, and give a reason for each
comment. Please submit two copies of all comments and attachments in an unbound format, no larger than 81/2 by 11 inches,
suitable for copying and electronic filing. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose
stamped, self-addressed postcards or envelopes. The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the
comment period. It may change this rule in view of the comments. 

The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Marine Safety Council
at the address under ``ADDRESSES.'' The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. It it determines
that the opportunity for oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at
a time and place announced by a later notice in the 

Federal Register.





Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LCDR P.A. Jensen and LTJG S.M. Atkinson, Project Managers,
Office of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection, and Patrick J. Murray, Project Counsel, Office
of Chief Counsel.



Regulatory Information



This rule is being published as an interim rule and is being made effective on the date of publication. The Coast Guard
has determined that it would be contrary to the public interest to delay publication of this amendment, which clarifies
existing law, imposes no new regulatory requirement, and accomplishes no significant change in policy. For these
good reasons, the Coast Guard finds, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3) and (d)(3), that both notice and public hearing on the
notice, before the effective date of this rule, are unnecessary and that this rule should be made effective less than
30 days after publication.



Background and Purpose



(a) The derailment of the Amtrak Sunset Limited, a passenger train, on September 22, 1993, with extensive injury and
loss of life, resulted in a study by the Coast Guard entitled 

Review of Marine Safety Issues Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels.

 This study, conducted jointly by the Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services (G-N) and the Office
of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection (G-M), provided the Commandant with a number of recommendations
to enhance safety in the towing industry. (Persons may review this study at the office of the Marine Safety Council
at the address under ``ADDRESSES.'') One of these recommendations called for a regulatory project to improve procedures
whereby information concerning allisions is reported. The Commandant concurred, and directed the Marine Investigation
Division (G-MMI), within G-M, to initiate the project. On March 2, 1994, the Coast Guard announced [59
FR 10031] a public meeting to help guide the project.

(b) The preliminary findings on the allision in September, 1993, of a tow with a railroad bridge near Mobile, Alabama
(the AMTRAK accident), indicated that there is substantial potential for misunderstanding which incidents require
immediate notice, the means of giving other notice, by whom, and to whom. Rulemaking is necessary to improve the giving
of notice on allisions.

(c) A ``town meeting'' took place on April 4, 1994, at Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington,
DC. This open meeting, comprised mainly of representatives from the towing industry and the Coast Guard, solicited
and elicited detailed comments concerning the recommendations of the Coast Guard and Department of Transportation
(DOT) in the study of safety of towing vessels. The comments helped shape both the Work Plan and the new regulatory language.



Discussion of Rule



The net effect of this interim rule and of a similar one, going forward under docket number CGD 94-027 and concerning
33 CFR part 160, will be to rationalize the ``division of labor'' between that part and 46 CFR part 4. Part 160 will comprehend
all urgent matters, including some that part 4 might have seemed either to embrace or to neglect. Conspicuous among
these will be many allisions with bridges, prompt notice of which might prevent another such catastrophe as the AMTRAK
accident.

This interim rule cross-refers to new 33 CFR   160.203 and 160.215, which, respectively, redefine the
term ``hazardous condition'' and elaborate the requirements for reporting hazardous conditions.  160.215
now covers many allisions with bridges and every hazardous condition ``caused by a vessel or its operation.''

Like the interim rule on part 160, this interim rule on part 4 adds the term ``operator'' to the list of those responsible
for giving notice. Often, a vessel is owned by one company but operated by another.

Making ``operator'' explicit in both parts will clarify the operator's responsibility for giving notice of hazardous
conditions and marine casualties.

This interim rule breaks existing 46 CFR 4.05-1 into two paragraphs. Paragraph (a) will require specified marine
casualties to be reported immediately after the resulting safety concerns have been addressed rather than ``as soon
as possible.'' This quoted phrase has allowed for considerable personal interpretation and has been removed. Paragraph
(b) will eliminate dual reporting when a hazardous condition also involves a marine casualty, by allowing the notice
given under 33 CFR 160.215 to suffice for the notice required in 46 CFR 4.05-1(b).

New paragraph (b) of 46 CFR 4.05-10 emphasizes the filing of the required written notice without delay. The timely
submission of the written notice of marine casualties not involving hazardous conditions will fulfill the requirement
of paragraph (a) of  4.05-1. The substitution of written for spoken notice will lighten the burden both
on mariners of giving, and on the Coast Guard of getting, spoken notice of marine casualties not involving hazardous
conditions.



Regulatory Evaluation



This interim rule is not a significant regulatory action under  3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under  6(a)(3) of that Order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that Order.

It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) [44
FR 11034 (February 26, 1979)]. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory
Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This finding rests
on the determination that this interim rule clarifies an existing requirement and does not place any new requirement
on the public.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small
entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1)
small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant
in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.

The Coast Guard has reviewed this interim rule for potential impact on small entities. Because this rule does not place
any new requirement on the public, the Coast Guard has determined that it will have no economic impact on small entities.
If you nonetheless think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have
a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment (see ``ADDRESSES'') explaining why and to what degree
this rule will economically affect it.

Collection of Information


Under the Paperwork Reduction Act [44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.], the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each
rule that contains a collection-of-information requirement, to determine whether the practical value of the information
is worth the burden imposed by its collection. Collection-of-information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping,
notification, and other, similar requirements. This rule will clarify the reporting of marine casualties to include
unintentional strikes of bridges. However, when it has met the additional criteria found in 46 CFR 4.05-1, this
type of casualty has always been included in the category of ``other'' casualties listed on the form. A CG-2692
(OMB No. 2115-0003) will still be the form used. Persons submitting comments on the requirements should submit
their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard where indicated under 

ADDRESSES.


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this interim rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient implications for federalism to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this interim rule and has concluded that, under  2.B.2
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
This rule is an administrative matter within the meaning of sub- 2.B.2.1 of that instruction that clearly has
no environmental impact. (It requires the reporting of marine casualties and the reporting of most strikes of bridges.)
A ``Determination of Categorical Exclusion'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated
under ADDRESSES.


List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 4


Administrative practice and procedure, Investigations, Marine safety, National Transportation Safety Board,
Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Safety, and Transportation.



For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard amends 46 CFR Part 4 as follows:


TITLE 46 [AMENDED]


PART 4_MARINE CASUALTIES AND INVESTIGATIONS

4.40: 49 U.S.C. 1903(a)(1)(E); 49 CFR 1.46.



2. Section 4.05-1 is revised to read as follows:


 4.05-1

Notice of marine casualty.


(a) Immediately after the addressing of resultant safety concerns, the owner, agent, master, operator, or person
in charge, shall notify the nearest Marine Safety Office, Marine Inspection Office or Coast Guard Group Office whenever
a vessel is involved in a marine casualty consisting in_
(1) An unintended grounding, or an unintended strike of (allison with) a bridge;
(2) An intended grounding, or an intended strike of a bridge, that creates a hazard to navigation, the environment,
or the safety of a vessel, or that meets any criterion of paragraphs (a) (3) through (7);
(3) A loss of main propulsion, primary steering, or any associated component or control system that reduces the maneuverability
of the vessel;
(4) An occurrence materially and adversely affecting the vessel's seaworthiness or fitness for service or route,
including but not limited to fire, flooding, or failure of or damage to fixed fire-extinguishing systems, lifesaving
equipment, auxiliary power-generating equipment, or bilge-pumping systems;
(5) A loss of life;
(6) An injury that requires professional medical treatment (treatment beyond first aid) and, if the person is engaged
or employed on board a vessel in commercial service, that renders the individual unfit to perform his or her routine
duties; or
(7) An occurrence causing property-damage in excess of $25,000, this damage including the cost of labor and material
to restore the property to its condition before the occurrence, but not including the cost of salvage, cleaning, gas-freeing,
drydocking, or demurrage.
(b) Notice given as required by 33 CFR 160.215 satisfies the requirement of this section if the marine casualty involves
a hazardous condition as defined by 33 CFR 160.203.
3. Section 4.05-10 is revised to read as follows:


 4.05-10

Written report of marine casualty.


(a) The owner, agent, master, operator, or person in charge shall, within five days, file a written report of any marine
casualty. This written report is in addition to the immediate notice required by  4.05-1. This written
report must be delivered to a Coast Guard Marine Safety Office or Marine Inspection Office. It must be provided on Form
CG-2692 (Report of Marine Accident, Injury or Death), supplemented as necessary by appended Forms CG-2692A
(Barge Addendum) and CG-2692B (Report of Required Chemical Drug and Alcohol Testing Following a Serious Marine
Incident).
(b) If filed without delay after the occurrence of the marine casualty, the notice required by paragraph (a) of this
section suffices as the notice required by  4.05-1(a).

and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project [3060-0329], Washington, DC 20503.



Summary of Report and Order



1. By this action, the Commission is amending Part 18 of its rules to remove regulations that unnecessarily increase
the amount of time and money required to bring new non-consumer, medical magnetic resonance (MR) systems to market.
These systems are used by medical professionals to study the molecular structure of a patient for diagnostic and monitoring
purposes. This action is taken in response to a petition for rule making filed by the National Electrical Manufacturers
Association on January 29, 1992.

2. 47 CFR Part 18 sets forth requirements designed to minimize the potential for interference to radio and TV services
by industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) equipment. Such equipment generates radio frequency (RF) energy in
order to perform a non-communications related function. Common examples of non-consumer ISM equipment include
microwave ovens and RF lighting devices. Examples of non-consumer ISM equipment include industrial heaters, RF
stabilized are welders and magnetic resonance (MR) equipment. Before ISM equipment can be marketed in the United
States, it must comply with the technical standards and equipment authorization procedures specified in 47 CFR Part
18.

3. It appears that MR systems pose little risk of interference because of the way they are designed and installed by
professionals. We note that there are under 1000 installations of MR systems. We further note that, in the event that
measures need to be taken to correct interference, the locations of these installations are on file with Manufacturers
due to U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations. We also recognize that the authorization requirement is burdensome
and costly for MR systems. Given the low volume production of MR systems, such requirements can significantly affect
the unit cost of each system, contributing to the increasing costs of medical care.

4. The circumstances presented here are similar to those that led us earlier to exempt non-consumer medical ultrasonic
equipment from 47 CFR Part 18 rules. We are unaware of any interference that resulted from the medical ultrasonic equipment
exemption. On balance, we tentatively conclude that the costs of our technical standards and authorization requirements
for MR systems are unwarranted given the low risk of interference. Accordingly, we are amending 47 CFR Part 18 to exempt
MR systems from the technical standards and authorization requirements that now apply to them. We will continue to
apply the requirements of 47 CFR Section 18.111(b), which require operators of MR systems to correct any harmful interference
that may occur. The proposed rule changes are set forth below.

5. Accordingly, 

it is ordered 

that pursuant to the authority contained in Section 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,
47 CFR Part 18 is amended as set forth below. These Rules and Regulations are effective 30 days after publication in
the 

Federal Register

. It is further ordered 

that 

this proceeding 

is terminated.

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice amends Standard No. 208, 

Occupant Crash Protection,

 to require that Type 2 safety belts installed for adjustable seats in vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of
10,000 pounds or less either be integrated with the vehicle seat or be equipped with a means of adjustability to improve
the fit and increase the comfort of the belt for a variety of different sized occupants. NHTSA believes that some occupants
who find their safety belts to be uncomfortable react to their discomfort either by wearing their safety belts incorrectly
or by not wearing them at all. NHTSA believes that improving safety belt fit will encourage the correct use of safety
belts and could increase the overall safety belt usage rate. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Section 2503(4) of the ``Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991'' requires the NHTSA to address
the matter of improved design for safety belts (Pub. L. 102-240). In response to this statutory mandate, NHTSA
issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on May 29, 1992, proposing to add safety belt ``fit'' requirements
to FMVSS No. 208, 

Occupant Crash Protection

 (57 FR 22687). The ANPRM listed three rulemaking options and posed ten questions. The options included: 




A. Take no regulatory action at this time. 

B. Adopt detailed regulatory requirements to ensure proper belt fit. 

C. Adopt a general requirement that safety belts adjust to fit different sized occupants. 




The ten questions asked for information on costs and benefits, and for comments on the test procedure. At the same time,
NHTSA continued research, begun in March 1992, to investigate some of the issues associated with belt fit. 

After considering the responses to the ANPRM, and the results of the research, NHTSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking
(NPRM) on April 26, 1994 (59 FR 21740). A detailed discussion of the responses to the ANPRM and of the research can be
found in the NPRM. The NPRM proposed a general requirement that Type 2 safety belts either be integrated with the vehicle
seat or be equipped with a means of adjustability to improve the fit and increase the comfort of the belt for a variety
of different sized occupants (collectively referred to in the remainder of this notice as the adjustability requirement).
As explained in the NPRM, NHTSA believes that some occupants who find their safety belts to be uncomfortable react
to their discomfort either by wearing their safety belts incorrectly or by not wearing them at all. NHTSA believes
that improving safety belt fit will encourage the correct use of safety belts and could increase the overall safety
belt usage rate. A more detailed discussion of the anticipated safety benefits can be found in the ANPRM and the NPRM.


NHTSA received 30 comments in response to the NPRM. In general, vehicle manufacturers only marginally concurred
with the proposal. Many vehicle manufacturers believe that there would be no benefit in adopting the requirement
because market forces are increasingly inducing vehicle manufacturers to voluntarily provide improved adjustability
in their belt designs. The vehicle manufacturers further believe that the requirement would stifle innovation in
developing other, and perhaps better, designs to improve belt fit. If the agency were nevertheless to adopt an adjustability
requirement, they wanted NHTSA to exclude belts for rear seats and belts in convertibles, and in vehicles with a gross
vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 10,000 pounds, and to broaden the definitions of the type of adjustability
devices which may be used. Consumer advocates and some vehicle manufacturers wanted the agency to amend the standard
to include a detailed performance requirement. Equipment and multistage vehicle manufacturers wanted more lead
time. None of the commenters disputed that improving safety belt fit should increase safety belt usage; however,
the commenters believed that this benefit could not be quantified. All of these comments were considered by the agency
in formulating this final rule, and the most significant comments are addressed below. 



General v. Detailed Performance Requirement 



Eight commenters stated that a detailed performance requirement would be better than the proposed general requirement.
One commenter, Transport Canada, stated that NHTSA should adopt a performance requirement based on the Belt-fit
Test Device (BTD), a device developed in Canada. The Canadian government has proposed that the BTD be used to assess
belt fit in Canadian vehicles.

As discussed in the NPRM, the agency decided not to propose the detailed test procedure discussed in the ANPRM because
agency research indicated that the procedure would not provide an adequate means of identifying improper fit on the
wide variety of sizes and shapes of vehicle occupants. In addition, commenters on the ANPRM raised a number of questions
concerning the test procedure that the agency has been unable to resolve. Since no commenter submitted any information
to remedy the inadequacies that the agency's research disclosed in the ANPRM test procedure, NHTSA still lacks a detailed
test procedure whose adequacy has been sufficiently supported through agency testing. 

NHTSA appreciates the information submitted by Transport Canada regarding the BTD. However, the NPRM did not provide
adequate notice to permit the agency to adopt a rule based on the BTD. Further, NHTSA does not have sufficient experience
with the device to consider even proposing such a rule at this time. However, the agency will continue its coordination
with Transport Canada on this issue to attempt to harmonize regulatory requirements where possible. 

Vehicle manufacturers stated that the proposed adjustability requirement was a design-based standard, and therefore,
design restrictive. The agency disagrees. The language does not specify the use of any particular designs to meet
the adjustability requirement. Instead, the requirement affords manufacturers broad flexibility in designing
means of compliance. Manufacturers may comply by providing for the adjustability of the anchorage and have a broad
choice regarding the means for doing so. In addition, the requirement allows them to choose other means of compliance.
In lieu of anchorage adjustability, manufacturers may either integrate the belts with the seat or provide a means
of automatically moving the webbing in relation to the anchorage. 

Accordingly, the agency has decided to adopt the adjustability requirement, as proposed, for those seats that are
required by this final rule to have adjustable belts. 

Vehicle manufacturers also asked the agency to clarify whether certain devices would be allowed under the requirement,
and, if not, to expand the requirement to allow these devices. In response, the agency has listed below the various
devices mentioned in the comments and indicated whether each of those devices is permissible. 



Adjustable Upper Anchorage:

 An AUA is a device which provides a means of adjusting the upper anchorage of the shoulder belt and which has at least
two distinct positions. This device would comply with the adjustability requirement if switching from one adjustment
position to the other moves the device or webbing at least 5 centimeters, measured linearly. 



Floor-mounted Inboard Adjustable Anchorage:

 This is a device similar to an AUA, except that it is mounted on the floor on the inboard side of the seat. This device would
comply if it has at least two distinct adjustment positions, and if switching from one adjustment position to the other
moves the device or webbing at least 5 centimeters, measured linearly. 



Integrated Safety Belt Assembly:

 This is a safety belt system anchored completely to the seat structure. For a movable seat, the anchorages must be located
on a part of the seat above the seat adjuster. This system would comply with the adjustability requirement. 



``Semi-integrated'' Safety Belt Assembly:

 As described by Ford, this is a safety belt system which has the upper anchorage and the retractor for the upper torso
portion of the Type 2 belt mounted to the moving portion of the seat structure. Other commenters mentioned similar
``semi-integrated'' designs, including: lower anchorages for the upper torso belt mounted on the movable portion
of the seat; shoulder belt guides; and through-the-seat routing of the safety belt webbing. These devices would be
allowed if (1) the device is considered part of the anchorage and meets the requirements of Standard No. 210, 

Seat Belt Anchorages

, and (2) if the movement of the device, measured linearly, is at least 5 centimeters. The agency believes that all ``semi-integrated''
safety belt assemblies which meet the first criterion would comply because the movement of the seat would move the
anchorage component sufficiently to meet the second criterion. 



Sling-Mounted D-Rings:

 This is a sling-mounted upper shoulder belt anchorage D-ring, used to relocate the D-ring closer to the occupant.
The sling usually rotates freely around the anchorage bolt to permit D-ring movement. Sling-mounted D-rings designed
in this manner do not have two distinct adjustment positions and would not comply with the adjustability requirement.
NHTSA does not believe that a sling-mounted D-ring which does not have distinct adjustment positions should be allowed
as the position of such a device could change due to vehicle vibration or occupant movement, resulting in reduced comfort
for the occupant. 

Ford's comment indicated that some sling-mounted D-rings are ``fixed and rigid'' and can ``be adjusted to a variety
of different positions that provide at least 5 centimeters of adjustment.'' Such a device would comply with the adjustability
requirement. 



Intentional Set Retractor:

 As described by General Motors, this is a safety belt retractor that would permit the introduction of slack in the upper
torso portion of the safety belt. Such a device could not be used to comply with the requirement because the anchorage
does not have a movable component which has at least two adjustment positions (S7.1.2), nor does the design move the
webbing in relation to the anchorage (S7.1.2.1). Spooling of webbing off the retractor increases the amount of webbing
in the belt system, but does not move the webbing in relation to the anchorage as specified in S7.1.2.1. An example of
the type of design that would meet the requirements of S7.1.2.1 is the Volvo design in which the shoulder belt webbing
is fed through a slot in the pillar at different angles and in different locations as increasing amounts of webbing
are spooled off the conical spool of the retractor. 



Adjustable Seat Height:

 Porsche described a system which adjusts the seat height relative to a fixed D-ring to be used to comply with the adjustability
requirement. NHTSA is not amending the language to allow the use of this system as a means of compliance. The agency
does not believe that, in practice, a seat with adjustable height would be functionally equivalent to an anchorage
with two or more adjustment positions. NHTSA believes that occupants use seat adjustability primarily as a means
of reaching controls and increasing visibility out of the vehicle. NHTSA has no evidence, nor did Porsche provide
any evidence that such a system alone would also be used by motorists to provide a better safety belt fit. Moveover,
even if motorists did use it this way, the optimum seat adjustment for seat belt comfort could conflict with optimum
seat height for control access and visibility. 



Rear Seats

Thirteen vehicle manufacturers and one association requested that belts for rear seats be excluded from the adjustability
requirement. Some manufacturers stated that the agency's rationale for allowing seats with integrated belts as
an alternative means of compliance (i.e., that integrated belts provide a good fit for a wide range of occupants because
the upper and lower anchorages maintain a constant position relative to the seat) is equally applicable to belts for
fixed rear seats. Other manufacturers stated that there are very difficult design problems involved in installing
AUAs for rear seats. One commenter, Ford Motor Company, requested an exclusion for belts for all non-movable seats
(both front and rear) and for seats which move fore-and-aft only to allow access to other areas. 

In the NPRM, NHTSA explained that it was aware of very few means being used to provide adjustability in rear seats. NHTSA
requested comment on designs that could be used to comply with the proposed requirements in the rear seats, the practicability
of these designs, and the costs of these designs. In response to these questions, many comments indicated that there
were greater design problems with designing rear seats to comply with the adjustability requirement, and that compliance
was costlier for these seats with little benefit. 

NHTSA agrees with the comments that the anchorages for belts installed at a fixed seat will retain a constant position
in relation to the seat. Fixed seats, especially rear fixed seats, allow manufacturers greater flexibility to design
the location of the upper anchorage to provide a good fit for a wide range of occupants because the anchorage does not
need to be located out of the way of the seat movement. For those seats which have the anchorages on or very near the seat
(e.g., an upper anchorage on the shelf near the top of a rear seat in a passenger car), the belt system should provide
a range of fit comparable to that provided by an adjustable seat with integrated belts. 

While NHTSA is aware that not all fixed seats have the upper anchorage on or near the seat, NHTSA notes that requiring
adjustability of belts whose anchorages are not on or near fixed rear seats would not solve the belt fit problems of
many of the occupants of those seats. The majority of fixed seats are rear seats, which are more commonly occupied by
children than adults. As noted in the NPRM, NHTSA's research indicated a significantly lower percentage of both non-adjustable
and adjustable belts were within the comfort zone for the six-year-old dummy than for the adult dummies. This suggests
that this rulemaking cannot solve the belt fit problems of children and that other means, such as booster seats, must
be used to provide comfortable belt fit for children. Further, one commenter, a child seat manufacturer, expressed
concern that if belts were integrated with rear seats, those belts could not be used to secure a child seat. 

For these reasons, NHTSA has decided to exclude fixed seats from the adjustability requirement. NHTSA also agrees
with Ford Motor Company that this exclusion should also apply to a seat which can be adjusted to provide access to other
areas, but is otherwise fixed. NHTSA has therefore drafted this exclusion accordingly. 



Convertibles 



Three vehicle manufacturers asked the agency to exclude convertibles from the adjustability requirement. These
manufacturers stated that the requirement was impracticable for these vehicles, since convertibles do not have
a B-pillar and therefore cannot accommodate AUAs. These manufacturers further argued that, while the proposal permits
the use of other designs which could be used in convertibles to comply with the adjustability requirement, electing
these options would greatly increase the cost of compliance. 

Besides AUAs, other options for convertible seats include integrated safety belt assemblies, and ``semi-integrated''
seat belt assemblies. NHTSA estimates that providing an AUA costs $3.12 per seating position, while integrated belts
cost $38.15 each, and ``semi-integrated'' belts cost $0.43 each. 

After reviewing these comments, NHTSA has decided not to exclude convertibles from the adjustability requirement.
While NHTSA agrees that manufacturers of convertibles may not be able to use AUAs, there are other options, some of
which are less expensive than AUAs.

Voluntarily Installed Type 2 Belts 



Heavy truck manufacturers, one of their belt suppliers, and motor home manufacturers expressed concern that the
proposed regulatory language was broad enough to include Type 2 belts that had been voluntarily installed in vehicles
with a GVWR of more than 10,000 pounds. Motor vehicle manufacturers were similarly concerned that the regulatory
language included Type 2 belts voluntarily installed at seating positions in other types of vehicles (e.g., center
seating positions). 

NHTSA intended the adjustability requirement to apply to seating positions for which Standard No. 208 requires a
Type 2 belt, but not to seating positions for which Standard No. 208 provides a choice of either a Type 1 or a Type 2 belt.
Among the seating positions for which the Standard provides this choice are all seating positions in vehicles with
a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds, and center seating positions in vehicles with a GVWR of not more than 10,000 pounds.
For all of these seating positions, the choice of a Type 2 belt is voluntary. Under this final rule, a Type 2 belt that
is voluntarily installed in any vehicle need not comply with the adjustability requirement. 



Owner's Manual 



Three commenters addressed the issue of requiring information on the use of manual AUAs in the owner's manual. Two
commenters supported an owner's manual insert. One manufacturer stated that clarification was needed on whether
the information must be provided for belts mounted on the seat frame so that they move with the seat. The agency has clarified
the informational requirement in S7.1.2 so that it more clearly applies only if the belt system includes the movable
component required by that paragraph. 



Effective Date 



Every vehicle manufacturer requested additional leadtime to make the design changes required by this rule. Some
manufacturers stated that an effective date of September 1, 1997 would better correspond to the date on which air bags
will be mandatory. Other requests ranged from 2 years to a request for a four-year phase-in beginning at least 5 years
after publication. The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA) and Bornemann Products Incorporated (Bornemann)
requested an additional two years leadtime after the effective date for vehicles manufactured in two or more stages.


After reviewing these comments, NHTSA has decided to extend the effective date to September 1, 1997. The agency believes
it would be more practicable to closely parallel the schedule for vehicle redesign required for the implementation
of manual belts and air bags. Manufacturers will then be able to avoid redesign of the anchorage systems for two safety
belt-related rules. By this date, 100 percent of passenger cars and 80 percent of light trucks must be equipped with
manual belts and air bags. 

While NHTSA agrees that redesigning some vehicles will be difficult, many commenters stated that all or most of their
vehicles will have an adjustment feature before this date. In addition, NHTSA notes that many of the requests for longer
extensions were based on compliance difficulties for rear seats. Therefore, NHTSA has decided that longer extensions
are not necessary. 

NHTSA has also decided not to allow additional leadtime for vehicles manufactured in two or more stages. There are
questions about the sufficiency of the agency's authority to grant relief to vehicles based on their method of production
instead of their type; however, the agency need not address those questions in this final rule. 

Bornemann and RVIA requested additional leadtime because there is no assurance that engineering information or
prototype vehicles would be available in time for final stage manufacturers to comply with the adjustability requirement
by the same date as single stage manufacturers. The commenters are concerned that, due to the lack of leadtime and lack
of early information from vehicle manufacturers, they would be forced to install integrated seats to comply with
the proposed adjustability requirement. 

The agency believes these concerns are unwarranted for numerous reasons. First, as discussed above, the agency has
provided an additional year leadtime beyond that proposed. Because NHTSA anticipates that many vehicles will comply
before the effective date, this should allow first stage manufacturers additional time to divulge design information
to final stage manufacturers. Second, the apparent trend in the industry is to provide AUAs in incomplete vehicles.
Since the upper anchorage is not a component that is normally modified by final stage manufacturers, there would be
no additional requirement or burden on the final stage manufacturers. Third, if neither of the previous reasons provide
relief, final stage manufacturers have options other than integrated seats in designing vehicles to comply with
the adjustability requirement. For example, a ``semi-integrated'' safety belt assembly in which the lower inboard
anchorage is mounted on the moving portion of the seat can be provided by the seat manufacturer and is in the same magnitude
of price as an AUA. 

RVIA also stated that additional leadtime was necessary if the agency did not exclude motor homes and rear seats. This
request is largely moot. As explained previously, the adjustability requirement does not apply to voluntarily installed
Type 2 safety belts. The agency's decision to exclude voluntarily installed Type 2 safety belts makes it unnecessary
to adopt RVIA's request to exclude motor homes. Many motor homes have a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds. Thus, the Type
2 belts in those motor homes are all voluntarily installed belts. For motor homes with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less,
the modifications made to the front seating positions are not different than other van conversions. Finally, the
agency's decision to exclude fixed seats has effectively excluded rear seats.

Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures



NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning
and Review.'' This action has been determined to be not ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. NHTSA estimates that the annual economic impact of this final rule will be between
$44 and $61 million. A Final Regulatory Evaluation has been prepared for this final rule and is available in the docket
for this notice. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this final rule under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. By not including the
rear seat of vehicles, the agency believes that the small businesses involved in altering vehicles, van conversions,
and multi-stage manufacturing will have little difficulty meeting the standard. Most of the companies perform very
few changes to the front of the vehicle. Van converters may change the seats, but they typically use the anchorage points
provided by the original manufacturer of the front seat. Those manufacturers that start with incomplete vehicles
will have to add and certify anchorages. However, either seats with seat-frame mounted anchorages or adjustable
upper anchorages will be on the market and these manufacturers should not have difficulty certifying compliance.




Paperwork Reduction Act



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-511), there are no requirements for information
collection associated with this final rule. 



National Environmental Policy Act



NHTSA has also analyzed this final rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it will not
have a significant impact on the human environment. 



Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)



NHTSA has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined
that this rule will not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.




Civil Justice Reform



This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety
standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level
of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for
judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

five centimeters, measured linearly. If the component required by this paragraph must be manually moved between
adjustment positions, information shall be provided in the owner's manual to explain how to adjust the seat belt and
warn that misadjustment could reduce the effectiveness of the safety belt in a crash. 

S7.1.2.1 As an alternative to meeting the requirement of S7.1.2, a Type 2 seat belt assembly shall provide
a means of automatically moving the webbing in relation to either the upper anchorage, or the lower anchorage nearest
the intersection of the torso belt and the lap belt. The distance between the midpoint of the webbing at the contact
point of the webbing and the anchorage at the extreme adjustment positions shall be not less than five centimeters,
measured linearly. 

S7.1.2.2 The requirements of S7.1.2 do not apply the anchorages of a Type 2 seat belt assembly installed:

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of inseason action.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, on behalf of the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC),
publishes notice of this inseason action pursuant to IPHC regulations approved by the U.S. Government to govern the
Pacific halibut fishery. This action is intended to enhance the conservation of Pacific halibut stocks in order to
help sustain them at an adequate level in the northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The IPHC, under the Convention between the United States of America and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut
Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea (signed at Ottawa, Ontario, on March 2, 1953), as amended by a Protocol
Amending the Convention (signed at Washington, DC, on March 29, 1979), has issued this inseason action pursuant to
IPHC regulations governing the Pacific halibut fishery. The regulations have been approved by the Secretary of State
(59 FR 22522, May 2, 1994). On behalf of the IPHC, this inseason action is published in the 

Federal Register

 to provide additional notice of its effectiveness, and to inform persons subject to the inseason action of the restrictions
and requirements established therein.


Inseason Action:


1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 13


Area 2A to Reopen on August 3



The IPHC estimates that 25,000 lb (11.3 mt) were landed from Area 2A (Washington, Oregon, and California) during the
July 19 fishing period, resulting in a total catch of 150,000 lb (68 mt). As the total catch is 29,000 lb (13.2 mt) less
than the 178,750 lb (81 mt) catch limit, Area 2A will reopen on August 3 for 10 hours from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time. Fishing
period limits as indicated in the following table will be in effect for this opening. Note that the fishing period limits
for the three smallest vessel classes have all been set at the same level.






The fishing period limit is shown in terms of dressed, head-off weight as well as dressed, head-on weight. Fishermen
should be aware that regulations require that all halibut from Area 2A be landed with their heads on. The fishing period
limit applies to the vessel, not the individual fisherman, and any landings over the vessel limit will be subject to
forfeiture and may result in a fine.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is closing the directed fishery for northern rockfish in the Western Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).
This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the northern rockfish total allowable catch (TAC) in this area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.


In accordance with  672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the northern rockfish TAC for the Western Regulatory Area was established
by the final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 1,000 metric tons (mt).
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), established in accordance with  672.20(c)(2)(ii),
a directed fishing allowance for northern rockfish of 900 mt, with consideration that 100 mt will be taken as incidental
catch in directed fishing for other species in this area. The Regional Director has determined that this directed
fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for northern rockfish in
the Western Regulatory Area effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., July 29, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31,
1994.

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends the fuel economy regulations to include alternative-fueled automobiles. The Alternative
Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) of 1988 includes 1993 model year and later alternative-fueled automobiles (passenger automobiles
and light trucks) in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program on a favorable basis to encourage the manufacture
of these vehicles. The AMFA provides these CAFE ``credits'' for automobiles designed to be fueled with methanol,
ethanol, other alcohols, natural gas, or dual-fueled automobiles designed to operate on one or more of these alterative
fuels and gasoline or diesel fuel. Under the AMFA, these credits are only available for automobiles that meet certain
requirements regarding: alternative fuel content (e.g., for alcohol fuels, a minimum of 85 percent by volume alcohol),
energy efficiency, and driving range. Neither the AMFA nor today's final rule will affect automobiles that do not
meet these requirements; such vehicles would not receive the favorable CAFE treatment. Alternative-fueled automobile
labeling requirements are also specified in the AMFA. This final rule codifies the requirements of the AMFA in 40 CFR
part 600. Recently, AMFA was amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, to extend the CAFE credit to automobiles designed
to operate on additional types of alternative fuels. However, this final rule does not include these additional alternative
fuel types, as they were not included in the CAFE program at the time the NPRM was published and the final rule was developed.

I. Authority 



The promulgation of these regulations is authorized by 15 
U.S.C. 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2013; 42 U.S.C. 7521, 7522, 7524, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7549, 7550, 7552, and 7601(a).



II. Introduction 


On October 14, 1988, Congress enacted the Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA), Public Law 100-494, 15 U.S.C.
2001 

et seq.

, to encourage: (1) The development and widespread use of methanol, ethanol, and natural gas as transportation fuels
by consumers; and (2) the production of methanol, ethanol, and natural gas-fueled motor vehicles. (AMFA section
3) The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486, October 4, 1992) amended the AMFA to also include liquefied
petroleum gas; hydrogen; coal derived liquid fuels; fuels derived from biological materials; electricity; and
any other fuel the Secretary of Transportation determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield
substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits. The AMFA prescribes explicit requirements
in two areas relating to fuel economy of alternative-fueled vehicles: (1) CAFE credit qualification and calculation;
and (2) fuel economy labeling. 
Regarding the first area, the AMFA section 6, 15 U.S.C. 2013, as amended, provides for favorable CAFE treatment of
certain dedicated alternative-fueled vehicles, and dual-fueled vehicles that meet specified requirements. Passenger
automobiles and light-duty trucks that can be eligible for CAFE credit include those designed to: (1) Operate exclusively
on alternative fuels, or (2) operate on either gasoline or diesel fuel, as well as alternative fuels, or a combination
of gasoline or diesel fuel and alternative fuels (i.e., dual-fueled automobiles). 
The eligibility for favorable CAFE treatment of dual-fueled vehicles is dependent on their ability to meet certain
energy efficiency requirements. 15 U.S.C. 2013(h)(1). In order to be eligible, dual-fueled automobiles are to provide
equal or superior energy efficiency when operating on the alternative fuel as when operating gasoline or diesel fuel.
In addition, in order to be eligible, automobiles capable of operating on a mixture of an alternative fuel and gasoline
or diesel fuel which are manufactured in model years 1993 through 1995 (or for a longer period if extended by the Administrator)
are to achieve energy efficiency when operated on a mixture of 50 percent alternative fuel and 50 percent gasoline
or diesel equal to or superior to that achieved when operated exclusively on gasoline or diesel fuel. 
One further requirement established by the AMFA for dual-fueled passenger automobiles to be eligible for CAFE credit
is that they comply with minimum driving range requirements established by the Secretary of Transportation. 15 U.S.C.
2013(h)(2) Ranges were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for alcohol dual-fueled
and natural gas dual-fueled passenger automobiles in the 

Federal Register

 on April 26, 1990 (55 FR 17611). The minimum driving range established in NHTSA's rule for alcohol dual-fueled passenger
automobiles is 200 miles and the range for natural gas dual-fueled passenger automobiles is 100 miles when operated
on the alternative fuel. However, section 403 (5)(I) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 amends the Motor Vehicle Information
and Cost Savings Act (MVICSA) to require that all dual-fueled passenger automobiles (other than electric automobiles)
meet a minimum driving range of 200 miles (or a higher value if determined by the Secretary of Transportation) while
operating on the alternative fuel. 15 U.S.C. 2013(h)(2)(C). This amendment supersedes the requirements of AMFA
and the NHTSA rulemaking. 
For dedicated automobiles, the fuel economy calculated for CAFE purposes is based on the gasoline or diesel content
of the mixture which is deemed by AMFA to be 15 percent by volume. 15 U.S.C. 2013(a)(c). Fuel economy for CAFE purposes
is then based on the amount of gasoline or diesel fuel consumed. For example, a dedicated alcohol automobile which
has a measured fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon of alcohol would receive a rating of 18/0.15 or 120 mpg for CAFE purposes.

Similarly, for dedicated natural gas-fueled automobiles, a gallon equivalent of natural gas is deemed by AMFA to
contain 15 percent gasoline or diesel fuel for CAFE purposes. The AMFA provides that 100 cubic feet of natural gas shall
be considered to contain 0.823 gallon equivalent of natural gas. 15 U.S.C. 2013(c). The fuel economy for CAFE purposes
is based on the equivalent amount of gasoline or diesel fuel consumed. For example, a dedicated natural gas-fueled
automobile with a measured fuel economy of 23 miles/100 cubic feet of natural gas at standard conditions would receive
a value for CAFE purposes of 186.3 mpg ((23 miles/100 cubic feet) x (100 cubic feet/0.823 gallons equivalent
natural gas) x (1 gallon equivalent natural gas/0.15 gallon gasoline)). 
For dual-fueled automobiles, the fuel economy for CAFE purposes is to reflect the assumption that the automobiles
are operated half of the time on gasoline or diesel fuel and half of the time on the alternative fuel. 15 U.S.C. 2013(b)(d).
Therefore, fuel economy is based on the harmonic average of the fuel economy value when operated on gasoline or diesel
and the credited fuel economy value when operated on the alternative fuel as described for the dedicated alternative-fueled
vehicles above. The harmonic averaging method required by AMFA is equivalent to averaging fuel consumption (gallons/mile),
which is the inverse of fuel economy (miles/gallon). For example, assume a model type achieves a combined city/highway
fuel economy of 27 mpg on gasoline and 18 mpg on alcohol. If the model type were dedicated alcohol fueled, the rating
for CAFE purposes would be 120 mpg as described previously. The fuel economy value for CAFE purposes of the dual-fueled
model type would be 44.1 mpg (1/(((1/27)+(1/120))/2)).

The AMFA also limits the maximum model year increase in a 
manufacturer's CAFE attributable to dual-fueled automobiles to 
1.2 mpg for model years 1993 through 2004 and, if extended by the 
Secretary of Transportation, to 0.9 mpg for model years 2005 
through 2008 for each compliance category of automobiles (i.e. 
domestic passenger, import passenger, domestic light truck, and 
import light truck). 15 U.S.C. 2013(g). Furthermore, if the 
Secretary of Transportation reduces the average fuel economy 
standard applicable to passenger automobiles to less than 27.5 
mpg for any model year, increases above 0.7 mpg in the 
manufacturer's average fuel economy attributable to dual-fueled 
passenger automobiles are to be reduced by the amount the 
standard was lowered, but may not be reduced to yield less than 
0.7 mpg. 

Regarding the second area, fuel economy labeling 
requirements, the AMFA section 8, 15 U.S.C. 2006(a), requires 
that specific fuel economy information for dedicated alterative- 
fueled automobiles and dual-fueled automobiles appear on the fuel 
economy label and in the Gas Mileage Guide published by the 
Department of Energy. For dedicated automobiles, the AMFA 
states that the fuel economy for labeling purposes shall be the 
fuel economy value calculated for CAFE purposes multiplied by the 
value, 0.15. 15 U.S.C. 2006(a)(4)(A). For dual-fueled 
automobiles, the AMFA 15 U.S.C. 2006(a)(4)(B) states that each 
label must: (i) Indicate the fuel economy of such automobiles 
when operated on gasoline or diesel fuel; (ii) clearly identify 
such automobiles as dual-fueled automobiles; (iii) clearly 
identify the fuels on which such automobiles may be operated; and 
(iv) contain a statement informing the consumer that the 
additional information is contained in the booklet published and 
distributed by the Department of Energy. 

To administer the provisions of the AMFA described above, 
the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the 


Federal Register

 on March 1, 1991. The purpose of the NPRM was 
to propose to integrate the requirements of the AMFA into EPA's 
existing fuel economy regulations (40 CFR part 600) and to frame 
issues of potential interest to commenters. Again, as stated in 
the ``Summary'' section, today's final rule does not affect 
automobiles that do not meet the eligibility requirements for 
favorable CAFE treatment specified in the AMFA. Also, to avoid 
significant delays, this final rule only covers those fuels 
contained in the AMFA at the time of proposal, namely alcohols 
and natural gas, and does not address the other fuels added by 
the Energy Policy Act of 1992, since this Act was passed well 
after publication of the NPRM and late in the development of this 
final rule. EPA will include these other fuels in a future 
separate rulemaking. The sections that follow describe the final 
regulations that have been adopted and the consideration of 
public comment that led to decisions regarding the final 
regulations. 



III. Description of the Action 



Today's final rule sets in place the CAFE credit 
mechanism and the fuel economy labeling requirements for the 1993 
and later model year alternative-fueled vehicles covered by the 
AMFA, namely alcohol and natural gas automobiles. In addition, 
since emission standards and emission measurement procedures have 
already been developed for methanol-fueled automobiles (54 FR 
14426), fuel economy measurement procedures for methanol-fueled 
vehicles are also included in today's rule. The fuel economy 
calculations for methanol-fueled vehicles are based on the carbon 
balance technique which relies on the premise that the quantity 
of carbon contained in the exhaust is equal to the quantity of 
carbon consumed by the engine as fuel. The proposed equation was 
based on fixed fuel properties. However, based on comments 
received in response to the NPRM, EPA decided that measured fuel 
properties are more appropriate for the calculation of fuel 
economy and, therefore, today's final rules are based on measured 
fuel properties. This is further discussed in section V. ``Public 
Participation''. 


EPA is currently developing emission standards, emission 
test procedures, and fuel economy calculation procedures for 
natural gas-fueled vehicles in a separate rulemaking. The notice 
of proposed rulemaking, ``Standards for Emissions From Natural 
Gas-Fueled, and Liquified Petroleum Gas-Fueled Motor Vehicles and 
Motor Vehicle Engines, and Certification Procedures for 
Aftermarket Conversion Hardware'' was published in the 

Federal 
Register

 on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52912). EPA expects that 
this rule will be promulgated in advance of the completion of 
the 1993 model year annual production period, after which CAFE 
for the 1993 model year is calculated, thereby allowing 
manufacturers to obtain CAFE credits for 1993 model year and 
later natural gas-fueled vehicles. In the event that this 
rulemaking cannot be promulgated in time, EPA expects to 
promulgate those portions regarding fuel economy test and 
calculation procedures in order to ensure fuel economy credits 
are available for 1993 model year natural gas-fueled vehicles.

<TEXT>
 

EPA is currently developing a timeline for the development 
of emission standards and test procedures for ethanol-fueled 
vehicles. In the event that manufacturers introduce ethanol- 
fueled vehicles into commerce before federal fuel economy test 
procedures are established, EPA will consider proposing 
California test procedures and a fuel economy equation to ensure 
that a mechanism is in place for ethanol-fueled vehicle CAFE 
credit as soon as possible. 

Today's rule also integrates the energy efficiency 
requirements of the AMFA into EPA's existing fuel economy 
regulations. These requirements must be met for a dual-fueled 
vehicle to be eligible for fuel economy credit. In the NPRM, EPA 
proposed that the manufacturer must test each dual-fueled vehicle 
used for fuel economy purposes on both the city and highway 
driving cycles using three fuels: gasoline or diesel fuel, the 
alternative fuel, and, in the case of alcohol dual-fueled 
automobiles, a 50 percent gasoline/50 percent alcohol mixture to 
satisfy the energy efficiency requirements of the AMFA. 15 U.S.C. 
2013(h)(1)(C) (ii) and (iii). Although testing on both the 
alternative fuel and gasoline fuel is required to determine fuel 
economy, the 50/50 mixture requirement is only needed to 
determine energy efficiency. After considering comments received 
from manufacturers, the EPA realizes that the requirement to test 
every fuel economy vehicle on three fuels could be excessively 
burdensome compared to the requirements for testing gasoline- 
fueled vehicles, which are tested on one fuel. Therefore, for 
dual-fueled vehicles, this final rule requires manufacturers to: 
(1) Perform city and highway fuel economy tests on all vehicles 
used for fuel economy purposes using both gasoline and the 
alcohol fuel and, (2) during initial certification, either 
perform city and highway fuel economy tests on one emission data 
vehicle per engine family using the 50/50 alcohol/gasoline 
mixture or provide a statement attesting that equal or superior 
energy efficiency is attained while using a 50/50 mixture 
compared to using gasoline, where applicable. EPA retains the 
right to audit test any vehicle used for fuel economy purposes to 
confirm the manufacturer's statement. This will reduce the test 
burden on the manufacturer while preserving the intent of the 
energy efficiency requirements of the AMFA by ensuring that 
vehicles are designed to be equally or more energy efficient 
while operating on the alternative fuel and a 50/50 
alcohol/gasoline mixture than when operated on gasoline. 

Today's rule also integrates the fuel economy labeling 
requirements of the AMFA for alternative-fueled vehicles into the 
existing fuel economy regulations. Some minor modifications were 
made to the proposed label formats as a result of comments 
received on the NPRM. These changes are discussed in detail in 
the ``Public Participation'' section. In response to 
manufacturers' comments, the EPA is offering an optional label 
format for dual-fueled vehicles that contains fuel economy values 
for vehicle operation using the alternative fuel. The AMFA 
requires that the fuel economy values while operating on gasoline 
or diesel appear on the label with a statement that further 
information is contained in the Gas Mileage Guide available at 
the dealer. This optional label format contains a limited amount 
of additional information pertaining to the fuel economy while 
operating on the alternative fuel and should reduce consumer 
confusion and frustration in obtaining such fuel economy 
information. Also, this optional label will contain a statement 
that refers to the availability of additional information in the 
Gas Mileage Guide. The label formats established under this 
rulemaking are found in the revised regulations following the 
preamble. 

EPA is working with the Department of Energy (DOE), the 
Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) to revise the Gas Mileage Guide to include 
information on alternative-fueled vehicles. These changes will 
be coordinated with the FTC's implementation of section 406 of 
the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486) which mandates 
that the FTC promulgate rules to establish uniform labeling 
requirements for alternative fuels and alternative-fueled 
vehicles, including requirements for appropriate information with 
respect to costs and benefits so as to reasonably enable the 
consumer to make choices and comparisons. The revisions to the 
Gas Mileage Guide (including changing the name of the guide to 
``Fuel Economy Guide'') will not be completed in time for inclusion 
in the 1994 model year guide. Therefore, the fuel economy 
labeling requirements for alternative-fueled vehicles, which 
contain label statements that refer the consumer to the Gas 
Mileage Guide for further information on the fuel economy of 
alternative-fueled vehicles, are applicable beginning with the 
1995 model year. However, those manufacturers who produce 1993 
or 1994 model year alternative-fueled automobiles may optionally 
comply with the labeling regulations in today's rule using the 
appropriate label wording modifications, approved by the 
Administrator, regarding availability of additional information 
in the Gas Mileage Guide. 

The AMFA does not address the applicability of the gas 
guzzler tax to dedicated alternative-fueled vehicles or dual-fueled vehicles. The Secretary of the Treasury (after

consultation with the Secretary of Transportation) is authorized 
by Section 201 of the Energy Tax Act of 1978, 26, U.S.C. 4064 

et 
seq.

, to include in the gas guzzler tax program automobiles 
fueled with any product of petroleum or natural gas, if such 
inclusion is consistent with the need of the nation to conserve 
energy. Consequently, the alternative fuels covered by the AMFA 
could conceivably be included in the gas guzzler tax program. 
Currently the program is limited to passenger automobiles powered 
by gasoline or diesel fuel. The Secretary of Treasury has not 
made a determination to include alcohols or natural gas in the 
gas guzzler program; therefore, dedicated alternative-fueled 
vehicles are currently not included in the guzzler program. In 
the NPRM, the EPA solicited comments regarding whether 
alternative fueled automobiles or dual-fueled automobiles should 
be included in the gas guzzler tax program. The comments were 
forwarded to the Treasury Department for consideration in the 
determination of applicability of gas guzzler tax to dual-fueled 
vehicles. The IRS agreed that EPA's decision to label dual- 
fueled automobiles for gas guzzler tax purposes based on the fuel 
economy while operating on gasoline is in accordance with the 
law. 

To save time and printing costs, some technical amendments of 
40 CFR parts 86 and 600 have also been included in this final 
rule.

March 1, 1991 NPRM. These comments and other documents relevant 
to the development of this final rule are contained in the public 
docket. The Agency has fully considered these comments in 
developing today's final rule. 

The following section presents a brief summary of the major 
comments received on the NPRM and EPA's responses to those 
comments. A separate and more detailed Summary and Analysis of 
Comments on the NPRM has been prepared and is contained in the 
public docket. The interested reader is referred to that 
document for a more complete discussion of the comments, 
including some of the more minor concerns that have been 
evaluated, but are not presented here. 



A. Options To Include Alternative-Fueled Automobiles in the 
Fuel Economy Regulations



Summary of the Proposal 



EPA proposed to establish the CAFE incentive mechanism 
(credit calculation procedures) provided by the AMFA for 
methanol, ethanol, and natural gas-fueled automobiles in the 
regulations. EPA also proposed fuel economy measurement 
procedures for methanol-fueled automobiles. The current 
requirement that fuel economy data vehicles be covered by a 
certificate demonstrating compliance with emission standards was 
proposed to be revised so that it applies only when the vehicles 
are subject to emission standards. The Agency requested comments 
on how test procedures for alternative-fueled vehicles other than 
methanol could be promulgated on a timely basis, and whether 
there are any alternative fuels other than those addressed in the 
Alternative Motor Fuels Act, that could be included in the CAFE 
program in a manner consistent with the need of the nation to 
conserve energy. More specifically, EPA requested comments on 
whether the Agency would have good cause to dispense with prior 
notice and comment (i.e., direct final rule), if necessary to 
promulgate test procedures in time for manufacturers to obtain 
credits for vehicles designed to run on alternative fuels not 
already covered by established test procedures. 



Summary of Comments 



The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association (MVMA) agreed 
with the proposal to revise the current requirements so that fuel 
economy data vehicles be covered by a certificate of conformity 
only when such vehicles are subject to emission standards. 
Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO) took issue with this proposal, 
stating that equal treatment is preferred for all the fuels, and 
that fuel economy determinations should be made on vehicles 
meeting emission standards both for gasoline and any alternative 
fuels considered. 

A number of comments were received regarding the importance 
of a level playing field for alternative fuels and that a lack of 
federal regulations may impede the development of alternative-fueled vehicles. Particularly, a number of commenters
urged that 
the establishment of emission standards and fuel economy test 
procedures for natural gas vehicles not be delayed. Comments 
were also received recommending that a timetable for 
implementation of ethanol-fueled automobile standards and test 
procedures be established as this technology develops. One 
manufacturer further commented that it is working on electric 
vehicles and urged the EPA to work with the Department of Energy 
to establish a CAFE credit mechanism for electric vehicles. The 
Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA) expressed that 
they were very concerned that the proposed amendments did not 
address electric vehicles and that electric-powered vehicles and 
electric dual-fueled vehicles should be included in fuel economy 
regulations. The NESEA also encouraged EPA to pursue emission 
standards for solar, hydrogen, and electric powered automobiles. 
ARCO stressed that gasoline reformulations should be included 
when working toward a level playing field for alternative fuels. 

A number of commenters recommended that California's 
existing alternative-fueled vehicle test procedures could be used 
to generate fuel economy data until federal regulations are 
promulgated. 

Comments were received in response to EPA's request for 
comments on a direct final rule type approach. Ford stated that 
manufacturers should be allowed to comment on both test 
procedures and standards before they are finalized. Ford 
recommended that EPA schedule workshops to discuss proposed 
rulemaking, which would be advantageous in allowing manufacturers 
and EPA to raise questions and concerns before test procedures 
are published. The Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) believes 
that sufficient ``good cause'' exists for EPA to take immediate 
action to establish emission standards and procedures for natural 
gas vehicles based on California's standards and procedures. 



EPA Response to Comments 



The EPA recognizes ARCO's concern that fuel economy 
determinations be made on vehicles meeting emission standards 
both for gasoline and alternative fuels. EPA has promulgated 
emission standards and test procedures for methanol-fueled 
vehicles and is currently developing standards for gaseous-fueled 
(CNG and LPG) vehicles. In addition, EPA will continue to assess 
the need to develop emission standards for other alternative-fueled vehicles. However, in the event that emission
standards 
are not developed and promulgated for alternative-fueled vehicles 
covered by the AMFA before a manufacturer produces and enters 
such vehicles into commerce, the current regulations that require 
that fuel economy data vehicles be covered by a certificate 
demonstrating compliance with emission standards would not 
provide a mechanism for obtaining CAFE credit. Therefore, EPA is 
revising the current regulation so that it applies only where the 
vehicles are subject to emission standards. This will serve as 
an interim policy to ensure that manufacturers receive the CAFE 
credit provided by the AMFA for natural gas-fueled vehicles, 
ethanol-fueled vehicles and other alternative-fueled vehicles in 
the event that such vehicles are entered into commerce before 
emission standards are promulgated. 

The EPA agrees with the comments received regarding the 
importance of a level playing field for the alternative fuels 
covered by the AMFA as well as other promising alternative fuels. 
The intent of EPA is to establish emission standards for any 
alternative-fueled vehicle design before such vehicles are 
commercially produced or, at the latest, before their sales 
volume could significantly impact a manufacturer's CAFE. As 
discussed previously, the EPA has promulgated emission standards 
and test procedures for methanol-fueled vehicles and is currently 
developing emission standards and test procedures for natural 
gas-fueled vehicles. The notice of proposed rulemaking for 
emission standards and emission test procedures as well as fuel 
economy calculation procedures for natural gas-fueled vehicles 
was published on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52912). EPA expects 
that this rule will be finalized in advance of the completion of 
the 1993 model year annual production period after which CAFE for 
the 1993 model year is calculated, thereby allowing manufacturers 
to obtain CAFE credits for 1993 model year and later natural gas-fueled vehicles. In the event that this rulemaking
cannot be 
promulgated in time, EPA will expect to finalize those portions 
regarding fuel economy test and calculation procedures in order 
to ensure fuel economy credits are available for 1993 model year 
natural gas-fueled vehicles. 

EPA is currently developing a timeline for the development 
of emission standards and test procedures for ethanol-fueled 
vehicles. In the event that manufacturers introduce ethanol-fueled vehicles into commerce before federal fuel
economy test 
procedures are established, EPA will consider proposing 
California test procedures or procedures similar thereto and a 
fuel economy equation to ensure that a mechanism is in place for 
ethanol-fueled vehicle CAFE credit as soon as possible.

EPA has not established a timeline for the development of 
emission standards or test procedures for hydrogen, electric, and 
solar powered vehicles. EPA will continue to assess the need for 
establishing emission standards and test procedures for these 
vehicles. 

The Department of Energy, under the Chrysler Corporation 
Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, is responsible for developing 
petroleum equivalency factors for electric vehicles for the 
purpose of including such vehicles in the CAFE program. The CAFE 
calculation and test procedures for electric vehicles are 
contained in 10 CFR 474.4. The petroleum equivalency 
factors for electric vehicles were not extended past 1987. 
However, due to continued technology development and a strong 
industry interest in the CAFE treatment of electric vehicles, DOE 
is currently developing a notice of proposed rule to establish 
new petroleum equivalency factors. 

EPA is currently developing a reformulated gasoline program. 
Reformulated gasoline will be used in current gasoline-fueled 
vehicles. The AMFA does not provide CAFE credits for 
reformulated gasoline-fueled vehicles. 



B. Fuel Specifications 



Summary of the Proposal 



The Agency proposed that alcohol fuel and natural gas fuel 
used for fuel economy testing and service accumulation shall be 
representative of commercially available fuel for motor vehicles. 



Summary of Comments 



Several automobile manufacturers recommended that definite 
fuel specifications for methanol and natural gas fuels used for 
emissions and fuel economy testing be adopted. The commenters 
stated that the proposed procedure allows for too much potential 
inconsistency between the manufacturers and EPA in fuels used for 
testing. Without fuel specifications, fuel economy and emission 
results could vary in response to differences in fuel properties. 
The manufacturers suggested that specifications for methanol 
blends be based on chemical grade methanol (ASTM D 1152) and 
certification grade gasoline (40 CFR 86.113-82a). 



EPA Response to Comments 



The Agency agrees that setting fuel specifications for 
alternative fuels for emission and fuel economy testing would 
reduce the uncertainty associated with certification using 
unspecified commercially representative fuels. However, EPA 
believes that, to the extent variability in fuel specifications 
can affect emissions, fuel specifications for methanol, natural 
gas, and other alternative fuels used for emissions testing (and, 
therefore, fuel economy testing since they are calculated from 
the same test) should be representative of fuels encountered in-use. Certified automobiles are expected to comply
with emission 
standards under normal in-use conditions, which includes the use 
of fuels that are representative of those commercially available. 
The Administrator reserves the right to test vehicles using fuels 
representative of those that in-use vehicles will encounter. 

Ideally, fuel specifications should be developed that are 
representative of in-use fuels. However, since the markets for 
these fuels for use in motor vehicles are not yet established, 
and the fuels that become commercially available could vary 
significantly in composition, a single set of specifications may 
not be representative of the fuels that could be used. Also, it 
is difficult to identify which compositions are representative in 
the absence of established markets. 

On April 11, 1989, EPA published a final rulemaking in the 


Federal Register

 (54 FR 14426) which established emission 
standards and test procedures for methanol-fueled automobiles. 
In that rulemaking, methanol test fuels were required to be 
representative of in-use fuels. However, the methanol fuel 
market is not yet at a level of development to allow for the 
determination of a representative fuel. EPA has developed a 
package of proposed technical amendments (58 FR 11816, March 1, 
1993) to the above-mentioned final rule to improve the quality of 
emissions data and increase the flexibility for manufacturers to 
meet the requirements. One of the proposals in this package is 
to allow a combination of chemical grade methanol and 
certification gasoline for test fuels in proportions that reflect 
the composition of the intended in-use fuel (currently this would 
be 85% methanol and 15% gasoline) until specifications for a fuel 
representative of in-use fuel can be determined. EPA plans to 
apply these provisions for both emissions and fuel economy 
testing purposes. 

For natural gas, the issue of setting fuel specifications 
is being addressed in a separate rulemaking (``Standards for 
Emissions From Natural Gas-Fueled, and Liquified Petroleum Gas-Fueled Motor Vehicles and Motor Vehicle Engines
* * *'' NPRM 
published on November 5, 1992, 57 FR 52912). In the interim, EPA 
will allow a manufacturer to petition the Administrator to use a 
specific composition of natural gas, provided that the 
manufacturer can demonstrate that this fuel is similar in 
composition to currently available in-use fuel. If standard 
grade fuels emerge when methanol, natural gas, ethanol, and other 
alternative fuels become commercially available, EPA will 
consider such fuels for setting test fuel specifications. 



C. Energy Efficiency of Dual-Fueled Automobiles 



Summary of the Proposal 



EPA proposed a method for determining whether a vehicle 
meets the AMFA energy efficiency requirements to be eligible for 
CAFE credit. The method proposed by EPA required each fuel 
economy data vehicle to be tested under both the city and highway 
test cycles using the alternative fuel, the petroleum fuel, and, 
for alcohol dual-fueled vehicles, a 50 percent by volume alcohol 
and 50 percent petroleum (gasoline or diesel) fuel mixture. The 
calculation of energy efficiency that was proposed would require 
manufacturers to determine, and the Administrator to approve, the 
net heating values and densities of the alternative fuel, 
petroleum fuel, and 50/50 mixture. 



Summary of the Comments

Many manufacturers expressed concern that the proposed 
testing to determine energy efficiency of dual-fueled automobiles 
is excessive and may be a deterrent to alternative-fueled vehicle 
development and production. The manufacturers recommended that 
the equal or superior energy efficiency determination could be 
adequately demonstrated when the vehicle is first certified. The 
comparison of the three fuels could be made one time, for each 
engine family and could be based on the highway test only. The 
regulations should allow EPA to waive the 50/50 mixture testing 
requirement if demonstrated M85 (or M100) tests indicate a 
significant increase in fuel efficiency when compared to gasoline 
tests in the same vehicle. 



EPA Response to Comments 



The AMFA does not specify how the energy efficiency is to be 
calculated. However, the intent of the Act is to encourage the 
use of alternative fuels and the energy efficiency requirement is 
a means of ensuring that dual-fueled automobiles are designed to 
be equally or more energy efficient while operating on the 
alternative fuel. Based on comments submitted by manufacturers, 
EPA realizes that the proposal to require the manufacturer to 
test each vehicle used for fuel economy purposes using the three 
fuels could be unnecessarily burdensome and costly for the 
manufacturer as compared to the test requirements for gasoline-fueled vehicles, which require tests using one test
fuel. For 
example, if a vehicle, when fueled with an M85 blend, 
demonstrated significantly superior energy efficiency performance 
compared to when fueled with gasoline, it is likely to have 
superior energy efficiency performance when operating on the 
50/50 blend as when operating on gasoline. EPA expects that in 
the vast majority of vehicles demonstrating a superior M85 energy 
efficiency performance, testing with a 50/50 blend would only 
serve to confirm expected performance. The energy efficiency 
requirements could still be equally served by lessening the 
testing requirements on the manufacturer in conjunction with 
provisions for EPA to reserve the right to audit test any vehicle 
used for fuel economy purposes. 

Therefore, this final rule requires that to satisfy the 
equal or superior energy efficiency requirements of AMFA for 
favorable CAFE treatment eligibility for dual-fueled vehicles, 
manufacturers must: (1) Perform city and highway fuel economy 
tests on all vehicles used for fuel economy purposes using both 
gasoline and the alternative fuel, and, additionally for alcohol 
dual-fueled vehicles, (2) during initial certification, either 
perform city and highway fuel economy tests on one emission data 
vehicle (EDV) per engine family using the 50/50 alcohol/gasoline 
mixture, or provide a statement attesting that equal or superior 
energy efficiency is attained while using a 50/50 mixture 
compared to using gasoline. The EPA retains the right to audit 
test any vehicle used for fuel economy purposes to confirm the 
manufacturer's statement. This approach will reduce the test 
burden on the manufacturer while preserving the intent of the 
AMFA to ensure that vehicles are designed to be equally or more 
energy efficient while operating on both the alternative fuel and 
50/50 alcohol/gasoline mixture than when operating on gasoline. 

The recommendations regarding the sole use of the highway 
test cycle for determining energy efficiency may not ensure that 
the equal or superior energy efficiency requirements of the AMFA 
are met. City and highway energy efficiencies could differ due 
to engine calibration differences and other design differences. 
This may not assure that the city energy efficiency requirements 
for CAFE credit are met as a result of testing using the highway 
cycle. To better represent in-use driving conditions, the energy 
efficiency determination should be based on both the city and 
highway cycles. After experience is gained with the relationship 
between highway and city energy efficiency for alternative-fueled 
vehicles, this issue can be revisited. 



D. Fuel Economy Calculations_Fuel Properties 



Summary of the Proposal 



The proposed fuel economy equation was based on fixed values 
for the fuel properties of carbon weight fraction and density. 
For determining energy efficiency, EPA proposed that the 
manufacturers would be required to determine the net heating 
values and densities of the alternative fuel, petroleum fuel, and 
a 50 percent alcohol, 50 percent gasoline mixture where 
appropriate. EPA proposed that upon reviewing the net heating 
values and densities submitted by the manufacturer, the 
Administrator would determine the net heating values and 
densities to be used in the energy efficiency determination. 



Summary of the Comments 



The MVMA and Ford recommend that actual methanol fuel 
properties be used in both the fuel economy calculation and 
energy efficiency equations with the option of using standard or 
``fixed'' values if the methanol fuel property data are 
unavailable. The use of actual fuel properties for the gasoline 
calculations and standard fuel properties for the methanol 
calculations creates an inconsistency in the energy efficiency 
calculations since the proposed energy efficiency comparison 
equation is a ratio of these two values. 

MVMA suggested two alternative methods to be used for 
determining the heating value for methanol fuel blends. The 
first is to measure the heating value using ASTM D 240, which 
uses a bomb calorimeter. The second method is to calculate the 
heating value using: 




LHV(BTU/lb)=(mass fraction methanol x 8560)+(mass fraction 
gasoline x LHV gasoline), 




where the LHV gasoline is the heating value of the gasoline 
portion of the M85 fuel and is measured using ASTM D 3338. 



Ford recommended the following equation to calculate fuel 
economy for methanol vehicles using measured values for the 
carbon weight fraction and density of the methanol blend: 





(CWF  x  SG  x  3777.623)/[(CWF

exHC

  x  HC)+(0.429  x  CO)+(0.273  x  CO

2

)+(0.375  x  CH

3

OH)+(0.400  x  HCHO)] 




Ford recommended that the carbon weight fraction (CWF) of the 
methanol blend should be determined using ASTM D 3343 and the 
specific gravity of the methanol blend should be determined using 
ASTM D 1298. The equation proposed in the NPRM should be 
contained in the regulation only as an option; with the density 
of gasoline in the equation revised from 2796 to 2830. 



Regarding the determination of the carbon weight fraction of 
exhaust hydrocarbons (CWF

exHC

) in the denominator of the methanol 
fuel economy equation, manufacturers agreed that the effect of 
this term on fuel economy is very small and measurement of this 
value is difficult to obtain. They agreed that a standard value 
should be determined. However, some of the commenters stated 
that the standard value of 0.866 is not appropriate and the 
carbon weight fraction of the exhaust hydrocarbons of each blend 
should be specified and based on test data. One manufacturer 
agreed that the hydrogen to carbon ratio of 1.85:1 (i.e., CWF

exHC

=0.866) is adequate for calculating fuel economy.

EPA Response to Comments 



Although fixed fuel properties were proposed for the 
determination of fuel economy for methanol-fueled vehicles in the 
NPRM, EPA requested comments on the appropriateness of using 
fixed fuel properties in place of measured fuel properties. The 
comments reflect a common desire among manufacturers to use 
measured fuel properties for the determination of fuel economy of 
methanol-fueled vehicles. Although the use of measured fuel 
properties is more burdensome, it is consistent with current 
gasoline fuel economy regulations and eliminates problems 
associated with energy efficiency comparisons between gasoline 
operation and alternative fuel operation. With minor revision, 
the fuel economy equation for methanol-fueled vehicles 
recommended by Ford is an appropriate equation if measured fuel 
properties are used. However, the use of ASTM D 3343 for the 
measurement of the carbon weight fraction of the methanol blend 
is not appropriate. This procedure applies to hydrocarbon fuels 
and is not appropriate for oxygenated fuels. Rather, the carbon 
weight fraction of the blend can be calculated by the following: 




CWF = (CWF

g

 x mass fraction gasoline)+(CWF

m

 x mass fraction methanol) 




where: 



CWF

g

=carbon weight fraction of gasoline as measured 
by ASTM D 3343. 

CWF

m

=carbon weight fraction of methanol=0.375 

mass fraction gasoline=(G  x  SG

g

)/(G x SG

g

+M x SG

m

) 

mass fraction methanol = (M x SG

m

)/(G x SG

g

+M x SG

m

) 



where: 



G=volume fraction of gasoline 

M=volume fraction of methanol 

SG

g

=specific gravity of gasoline as measured by 
ASTM D 1298 

SG

m

=specific gravity of methanol fuel as 
measured by ASTM D 1298 




This method requires measurement of the fuel properties of the 
individual fuels prior to blending. EPA is currently 
investigating acceptable methods for measuring the carbon weight 
fraction of the fuels after blending. As these methods are 
developed and proven satisfactory, EPA plans to revise the 
regulations to include such methods. EPA will allow the use of 
other procedures for measuring the carbon weight fraction of the 
fuel blend if the manufacturer can show that the procedures are
 superior to or equally as accurate as those specified in the 
final rule. To provide flexibility and reduce the burden on 
manufacturers who may blend the fuels at the pump, the specific 
gravity of the blend can be optionally determined by measuring 
the specific gravity of the individual fuels before blending and 
combining those values as follows: 



SG=SG

g

 x volume fraction gasoline+SG

m

 x volume fraction 
methanol 




The correct value of the term in the numerator of the fuel 
economy equation which converts the specific gravity from 
dimensionless units to grams/gallon should be 3781.8 
grams/gallon. This is the product of multiplying the density of 
pure water at 60
 F of 0.99904 grams/cubic centimeter (reference 
ASTM D 4052) by the volume conversion of 3785.412 cubic 
centimeters/gallon. Therefore, the value suggested by Ford of 
3777.623 is replaced by 3781.8 for the final rule. 

The NPRM is unclear as to how the net heating value and the 
density of methanol/gasoline mixtures are to be determined. EPA 
agrees that test procedures should be specified in the 
regulations to eliminate this ambiguity. Therefore, for the 
final rule, ASTM D 240 is to be used for the determination of net 
heating value and ASTM D 1298 for the determination of density. 
However, the use of other procedures will be allowed if the 
manufacturer can show these procedures to be equal or superior to 
the specified procedures. 

Regarding the determination of the carbon weight fraction of 
exhaust hydrocarbons (CWF

exHC

), again the effect of this value on 
the determination of fuel economy is expected to be negligible. 
While the use of different values for different fuel blends would 
be technically more accurate than using the value of 0.866 for 
all blends, insufficient data is available to determine 
appropriate values at this time. In addition, the use of 
different values would add additional complexity to fuel economy 
calculations while having a negligible effect on fuel economy 
values. Therefore, the EPA does not believe that it is 
appropriate to assign different carbon weight fractions for 
exhaust hydrocarbons from various methanol/gasoline blends at 
this time. Until the carbon/hydrogen ratios of the exhaust 
hydrocarbon constituents can be better assessed, the carbon 
weight fraction of the exhaust hydrocarbons will be equal to the 
carbon weight fraction measured for the gasoline portion of the 
blend or, for neat methanol, equal to 0.866. As experience is 
gained with measuring the carbon/hydrogen ratios of exhaust 
hydrocarbons from vehicles fueled with methanol/gasoline blends, 
this issue can be revisited. 



E. Fuel Economy Label Format Requirements 



Statement of Proposal 



The proposed fuel economy labeling requirements for alternative-fueled automobiles are those currently specified
for gasoline-fueled and diesel-fueled automobiles with modification to satisfy 
AMFA requirements. For dedicated alternative-fueled automobiles, 
the EPA proposed that the fuel title (e.g. Methanol, Natural Gas) 
be located above the fuel pump logo and for dual-fueled 
automobiles, that the title ``Dual Fuel'' be positioned above the 
logo. For dedicated alternative-fueled automobiles the EPA 
proposed that the bottom border of the label contain the 
statement: ``This vehicle operates on [insert appropriate fuel(s)] 
only''. For dual-fueled automobiles, the statement: ``This dual 
fuel vehicle operates on ([gasoline or diesel] or [list alcohols 
or natural gas])'' was proposed to be located on the bottom border 
of the label. EPA proposed that fuel economy labels for natural 
gas-fueled automobiles include the statement: ``All fuel economy 
values on this label pertain to gasoline equivalent fuel economy. 
To convert these values into units of miles per 100 cubic feet of 
natural gas, multiply by 0.823.'' For dual-fueled automobiles, 
EPA proposed that the statement: ``All fuel economy values on 
this label pertain to [gasoline or diesel] fuel usage. [List 
alcohols or natural gas] fuel usage will yield different values. 
See the Gas Mileage Guide for information on [list alcohols or 
natural gas] fuel usage.'' The 0.9 and 0.78 multiplicative 
factors currently used for adjusting the petroleum-fueled vehicle 
city and highway measured fuel economy values to better represent 
in-use fuel economy were proposed to be applied to alcohol-fueled, natural gas-fueled, and dual-fueled automobiles.

Summary of Comments 



A number of manufacturers expressed concerns regarding the 
proposed fuel economy labeling requirements for alternative-fueled vehicles. One concern common to many manufacturers

related to the requirement to have statements appear on the 
bottom border of the label. Since manufacturers use printed 
forms to generate fuel economy labels, the number of preprinted 
types of forms that manufacturers would have to purchase would 
increase because of the differences in border wording for 
different vehicles. Instead, manufacturers recommended that 
these statements be written just above the bottom border, leaving 
the preprinted portion of the label unchanged. Manufacturers 
also recommended that the size of the fuel pump logo be reduced 
to accommodate fuel titles above the pump logo and that ``Gas 
Mileage Information'' be replaced by a more generic and 
appropriate title such as ``Fuel Mileage Information''. 

Manufacturers recommended that EPA establish an optional 
label format to include the fuel economy values for dual-fueled 
vehicles while operated on the alternative fuel in addition to 
the fuel economy values while operated on gasoline as required by 
the AMFA. They recommended that these optional fuel economy 
values could take the place of the reference to having the 
customer obtain the information from the gas mileage guide. 

One manufacturer recommended that the proposed label for 
natural gas vehicles, which includes a conversion factor of 0.823 
to be used by the consumer to convert mpg to miles per 100 cubic 
feet of natural gas, should be changed so that the manufacturer 
would perform the calculation for the consumer. The manufacturer 
would then report the natural gas fuel economy on the lower right 
hand side of the label in units that are used at retail. 

Several manufacturers commented that the multiplicative 
factors for label values for gasoline vehicles developed by EPA 
of 0.90 and 0.78 should also be applied to alcohol and natural 
gas fuel economy label values. However, these factors may have 
to be revised as more experience is gained with the use of 
alternative-fueled vehicles. 



EPA Response to Comments 



The EPA believes that the concerns of manufacturers 
regarding printing statements on the bottom border of the fuel 
economy label are valid. The purpose of the proposed location of 
the statement on the bottom border was to ensure that the 
statement was clearly visible and caught the eye of the consumer. 
However, this objective can still be reached if large print is 
used and the statement is printed just above the bottom border of 
the label. Therefore, for the final rule, EPA is requiring that 
this statement be located just above the bottom border of the 
label. 

EPA agrees with the comments received in regard to the 
size of the fuel pump logo be slightly reduced to provide 
adequate space for the fuel title to be positioned above the 
logo. The slight reduction in logo size will not have any 
adverse impact on the effectiveness of the label in informing the 
consumer of the vehicle's fuel economy. In addition, the fuel 
pump logo statement ``Gas Mileage Information'' is not appropriate 
for vehicles powered by alternative fuels. However, in 
clarifying the comments received on this issue, the commenters 
who recommended the use of ``Fuel Mileage'' in place of Gas Mileage 
agreed with EPA that an even more appropriate term would be ``Fuel 
Economy''. Therefore, for the final rule, all label occurrences 
of the term ``Gas Mileage'' are replaced by ``Fuel Economy''. 

The AMFA clearly mandates that the label for dual-fueled 
vehicles contain the fuel economy values when operated on 
gasoline or diesel fuel, and that additional information be 
contained in the Gas Mileage Guide regarding operation on the 
alternative fuel. The information required to be published in 
the Gas Mileage Guide includes: the energy efficiency and cost of 
operation of such automobiles when operated on gasoline or diesel 
fuels as compared to operation of alcohol or natural gas; the 
driving range of such automobiles when operated on gasoline or 
diesel fuel as compared to such automobiles when operated on 
alcohol or natural gas; information regarding the miles per 
gallon achieved by dual-fueled automobiles when operated on 
alcohol; and an explanation of how the information may be 
expected to change when the automobile is operated on mixtures of 
alcohol and gasoline or diesel fuel (15 U.S.C. 2006(b)(3)). This 
information will most likely be of interest to a consumer who is 
deciding whether or not to purchase a dual-fueled vehicle. 
Congress recognized that it would be impractical to incorporate 
all of this information on the fuel economy label and required 
that, at a minimum, the label contain gasoline fuel economy 
information while alternative fuel information is contained in 
the Gas Mileage Guide. However, the AMFA does not specifically 
prohibit other label formats. 

To avoid consumer confusion and frustration with dual-fueled 
vehicle labeling, EPA agrees with commenters that it would be 
beneficial to include fuel economy values while operating on the 
alternative fuel in addition to those while operating on gasoline 
on the same label. This could help avoid problems which would 
occur when a model is offered for sale before the Gas Mileage 
Guide is available for a particular model year. However, it 
would not be practical to design an optional label that would 
contain all the information that the AMFA requires to be 
contained in the Gas Mileage Guide. Therefore, EPA is providing 
an optional label format for dual-fueled vehicles that contains 
limited information on the fuel economy while operated on the 
alternative fuel. Also, this optional label will contain a 
statement that refers to the availability of additional 
information in the Gas Mileage Guide. 

The AMFA mandates that the fuel economy label values for 
dedicated natural gas-fueled vehicles are the values used for 
CAFE purposes multiplied by 0.15. This requires that the fuel 
economy value units are in terms of miles per equivalent gallon 
of gasoline for natural gas-fueled automobiles. The most 
appropriate units in terms of consumer usefulness are dependent 
on how the fuel will be sold at retail (e.g., per volume, per 
weight, per equivalent gallon gasoline). Since the vehicle fuel 
market for natural gas is not yet established, the most 
appropriate label units are not known at this time. Therefore, 
the statement: ``To convert these values into units of miles per 
100 cubic feet of natural gas, multiply by 0.823.'' will only be 
required if natural gas as a motor vehicle fuel is sold on a 
volume (cubic feet) basis. As an option, the manufacturer can 
perform the calculation for the consumer and display the values 
on the label in the following format: ``The fuel economy in units 
of miles per [insert units used in retail] is estimated to be 
[insert city fuel economy value] in the city, and [insert highway 
fuel economy value] on the highway.'' This format can also be 
used if natural gas is sold in terms of units other than gallon 
equivalent of gasoline or cubic feet. Also, for the optional 
label format for natural gas dual-fueled vehicles, the fuel 
economy units while operating on natural gas will be based on 
units used at retail. 

The EPA agrees with manufacturers' comments regarding the 
necessity to reevaluate the multiplicative city and highway fuel 
economy adjustment factors for label values to better represent 
in-use fuel economy when more experience and data are available 
for alternative-fueled vehicles.

F. Gas Guzzler Tax Applicability to Alternative-Fueled Vehicles 



Statement of Proposal 



The Alternative Motor Fuels Act did not address the 
applicability of the so-called ``gas guzzler tax'' to dedicated or 
dual alternative-fueled vehicles. The Energy Tax Act of 1978, 26 
U.S.C. 4064, authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury (after 
consultation with the Secretary of Transportation) to include in 
the gas guzzler tax program automobiles fueled with any product 
of petroleum or natural gas if such inclusion is consistent with 
the need of the nation to conserve energy. While alternative 
fuels thus could be included in the gas guzzler tax program, the 
Secretary of Treasury has not included such fuels by regulation 
under this section to date, and dedicated alternative-fueled 
automobiles thus do not appear to be currently subject to the gas 
guzzler tax. However, since dual-fueled automobiles can operate 
on gasoline, the applicability of the gas guzzler tax under 
current law is less clear. The EPA solicited comments regarding 
whether alternative-fueled automobiles or dual-fueled automobiles 
should be included in the gas guzzler tax program, but did not 
make any proposals in the NPRM. These comments were submitted to 
the Internal Revenue Service for their consideration. 



Summary of Comments 



Several automobile manufacturers provided comments 
recommending that dedicated and dual alternative-fueled vehicles 
not be included in the gas guzzler tax program. These 
manufacturers stated that the purpose of the AMFA is to 
facilitate widespread use of alternative fuels through incentives 
and that subjecting these vehicles to the gas guzzler tax program 
would contravene the goals of the AMFA. The Senate bill 
originally included a section intended to ``clarify that the lower 
energy content of the alternative fuels covered by this bill do 
not trigger the so-called 'gas-guzzler' tax provisions of current 
law.'' However, this section was deleted since taxes are revenue 
related matters that most appropriately should originate in the 
House of Representatives. Senator Rockefeller stated in the 
Congressional Record-Senate of April 15, 1988, page S. 4101: 
``in deleting section 8 from S.1518 that we believe the 
interpretation of the law should remain exactly as it was with 
section 8 in the bill.'' 

ARCO recommended that any motor fuel tax be applied equally 
to all motor fuels including alternative fuels to preserve the 
energy conservation intent of the Energy Tax Act of 1978. ARCO 
suggested that dual-fueled vehicles be subject to the gas guzzler 
tax based on the fuel economy when operated on gasoline. This 
will appropriately tax vehicles that are designed to run on the 
alternative fuel but will most likely operate inefficiently on 
gasoline. The generation of CAFE credits provided by the AMFA 
would likely result in the production of gas-guzzling vehicles. 
ARCO provided an example that showed that a M85 dual-fueled 
vehicle which has an mpg rating of 20 while operating on gasoline 
and 16 while operating on M85 would have a calculated fuel 
economy under the CAFE credit provisions of the AMFA of 34 mpg. 
They state for this example, at 34 mpg, that the dual-fueled 
vehicle would not be taxed as a gas guzzler. However, at 20 mpg 
gasoline fuel economy, ARCO feels that the tax would be 
justifiable and consistent with the intent of the Energy Tax Act 
to conserve energy. 

NESEA stated that because of the positive attributes of 
alternative-fueled vehicles and the urgency of switching away 
from oil-fueled cars, alternative-fueled and dual-fueled vehicles 
should be included in the gas guzzler tax program as this is an 
excellent first step in acknowledging the real costs of running 
gasoline powered vehicles. 



EPA Position 



The EPA does not have the authority to decide which vehicles 
and fuels are subject to the gas guzzler tax program. This 
authority lies with the Department of Treasury. The IRS agreed 
that EPA's decision to label dual-fueled automobiles for gas 
guzzler tax purposes based on the fuel economy while operating on 
gasoline is in accordance with the law. Therefore, EPA will 
label dual-fueled vehicles using the current regulations for 
gasoline-fueled vehicles contained in 40 CFR part 600,  600.513. 



V. Technical Amendments 



To save the time and printing costs involved in publishing 
them under a separate notice, the following technical amendments 
to the 40 CFR parts 86 and 600 are included in this final rule. 
Technical amendments described under items A and B below were 
proposed in the NPRM. EPA received no comments on these 
amendments and therefore will be included in the final rule as 
proposed. Technical amendments described under items C, D, and 
E, were not included in the NPRM. By issuing these technical 
amendments directly as a final rule, EPA is foregoing the 
issuance of an NPRM and the opportunity for public comment on the 
proposal provided by the NPRM rulemaking process. Such a 
curtailed procedure is permitted by 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and section 
307(d) of the Clean Air Act when issuance of a proposal and 
public comments would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary 
to the public interest. The Agency is publishing this action 
without prior proposal because these are non-controversial 
corrections that rectify minor errors and omissions in the Part 
600 regulations in a manner that does not substantively change 
the requirements of the final rule. The Agency finds that this 
constitutes good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) for a determination 
that the issuance of an NPRM is unnecessary. 

A. A formaldehyde concentration term is being added to the 
dilution factor equation located in 40 CFR 86.144-90(c)(7)(ii) 
and 86.144-94(c)(7)(ii). Although the magnitude of the 
formaldehyde concentration is very low, it is possible that an 
assumption of zero concentration could lead to a slight change in 
calculated fuel economy. There is no reason why the formaldehyde 
concentration term should be left out of the equation. With this 
amendment, all measured carbon-containing compounds will be 
included in the dilution factor equation. 

B. The symbol ``x'' is struck from the dilution factor equation 
on 40 CFR 86.144-90(c)(7)(ii) and 86.144-94(c)(7)(ii) the first 
time it appears in the equation. The first time ``x'' appears in 
the equation, it is used to represent multiplication. All other 
occurrences of ``x'' in the equation represent the measured fuel 
composition parameter: C

x

H

y

O

z

. By dropping the first occurrence of 
``x'', only the latter meaning is retained. The multiplication 
function can be assumed by virtue of a number adjacent to a 
variable enclosed in parenthesis. 

C. Part 600.513-91 (b)(2)(xii) currently reads ``(xii) At least 
12.5 mpg, the gas guzzler tax statement shall show a tax of 
$7,700''. This has been mis-typed; ``At least'' should read ``Less 
than''. Therefore, the statement is amended to read: ``Less than 
12.5 mpg, the gas guzzler tax statement shall show a tax of 
$7,700''.

D. To clarify the definition of the ``c'' factor in 40 CFR 600.513(a)(2) the current language which reads: ``c=1.300 x 10

^3

 for the 1986 and later model years'' is amended to read: ``c=gas guzzler adjustment factor = 1.300 x 10

^3

 for the 1986 and later model years''.
E. To correct the references for calculating the ``FE'' and ``a

g

'' terms in CFR 40 600.513-91(a)(2) each occurrence of the phrase ``in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of the
section'' is replaced by the phrase: ``in accordance with  600.207''.
F. In its 

Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles and New Motor Vehicle Engines: Gaseous and Particulate Emission
Regulations for 1994 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicles and Light-Duty Trucks; Final Rule 

(also known as Tier 1), 56 FR 25724 (June 5, 1991), EPA adopted the term ``heavy light duty truck'' (HLDT) for light duty
trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 6000 lbs. Pursuant to the definition of test weight in
section 216(8) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, the Tier I rule also adopted the term ``adjusted loaded vehicle
weight'' (ALVW) (the average of curb weight and GVWR) and required that ALVW be used for emission testing of HLDTs for
one-half the fleet in model year 1996 and the entire fleet beginning in model year 1997. Prior to this time, emissions
test weights were determined based on loaded vehicle weight (LVW), which is curb weight plus 300 lbs., and this weight
was also used for fuel economy testing conducted at the same time. ALVW is higher than LVW. Testing at a higher weight
would negatively impact fuel economy values. Increasing the test weight would therefore have the practical effect
of increasing the stringency of the fuel economy standard, which might be addressed by adjusting the standard. Under
the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (MVICSA), 15 U.S.C. 2003(d)(1), fuel economy is to be measured
in accordance with testing procedures established by the EPA Administrator by rule. Also under that provision, fuel
economy tests are, to the extent practicable, to be conducted in conjunction with emissions tests under the Clean
Air Act. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) is responsible for setting the fuel economy
standards. 15 U.S.C. 2002(b).
In its 

Light Truck Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Year 1995; Proposed Rule, 

57 FR 61377 (December 24, 1992), NHTSA requested comments on the issue of test weight for light trucks over 6000 lbs.
GVWR in the context of setting the MY 1995-97 light truck fuel economy standards. GM, Ford, Chrysler, American
Automobile Manufacturers Association and Rover Group all supported the continuation of fuel economy testing at
LVW. In its 

Light Truck Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Year 1995; Final Rule, 

58 FR 18019 (April 7, 1993), NHTSA quoted extensively from a January 7, 1993 letter from EPA to industry trade associations
explaining that EPA would consider comments during the NHTSA rulemaking regarding the proper test weight for fuel
economy testing when developing EPA guidance or rulemaking on this subject. The EPA letter was further quoted as stating
that EPA plans to defer to NHTSA's policy decisions on issues such as the competitiveness effects of the alternatives
and would follow NHTSA's resolution of the CAFE issue with conforming amendments to its regulations or policy.
NHTSA then concluded in that notice that the preferable solution would be to retain LVW as the test weight for fuel economy
purposes. This conclusion was based, in part, on comments expressing the concern that changing the test weight for
only a portion of the light truck fleet would cause consumer confusion and affect the competitiveness of manufacturers
with a higher proportion of sales of the heavier light trucks. NHTSA finally quoted from a March 4, 1993 letter from
EPA to NHTSA that if NHTSA decided against adjusting the CAFE standard to reflect a higher test weight, EPA would undertake
``the regulatory and guidance revisions needed to allow dual testing.''
Accordingly, EPA is today promulgating a technical amendment to provide that while ALVW is required for emission
testing of HLDTs, it is not required for fuel economy testing of such vehicles. Manufacturers may, instead, continue
to use LVW as the test weight for fuel economy testing. Vehicle manufacturers, however, have had and continue to have
the option of performing simultaneous emissions and fuel economy testing using heavier test weights (ALVW in this
case). Therefore, for HLDTs, separate testing using ALVW for emissions and LVW for fuel economy, or combined emissions
and fuel economy testing using ALVW is acceptable. However, fuel economy adjustments will not be made to account for
potentially lower fuel economy values due to the use of the heavier test weight (ALVW). This technical amendment changes
40 CFR 600.006-89 (b)(1) (i) and (h) and footnote 4 to the table found at 40 CFR 86.129-94(a) to specify the
test weight basis for heavy light duty trucks.
The Agency also reiterates that despite the change in the HLDT emission test weight basis, vehicle manufacturers
must still assure that fuel economy data vehicles comply with the applicable exhaust emission standards. The Administrator
reserves the right to require the manufacturer to either test using ALVW or submit the vehicle for testing by the Administrator
for emission standards compliance using ALVW for HLDTs.
This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes that this technical amendment is noncontroversial
and has been subject to notice and comment through NHTSA's rulemaking and EPA's January 7, 1993 letter referring interested
parties to the NHTSA proposed rule and advising that EPA would consider comments from that rulemaking. For these reasons,
EPA believes that a prior EPA proposal is unnecessary under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B).
Nevertheless, the public is advised that this action will be effective October 3, 1994, unless notice is received
by September 2, 1994, that someone wished to submit adverse or critical comments. If such notice is received, this
action will be withdrawn and two subsequent documents will be published. One document, which will be published before
the effective date, will withdraw the final action. Another document will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal
of the action and establishing a comment period. Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this proposed
approval. EPA will consider all comments received by September 2, 1994. Consequently, this procedure still allows
the opportunity for public comment under the Administrative Procedure Act, but provides an expedited procedure
for final action where a rulemaking is not expected to be controversial, public comment has already been received
by another federal agency, and no adverse comment is expected.

VI. Administrative Requirements


A. Administrative Designation


Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 1, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the old Executive Order
12291. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive
Order 12866. OMB reviewed this document under Executive Order 12866 and had no comment.


B. Reporting & Recordkeeping Requirement


The information collection requirements in this rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the 

Paperwork Reduction Act, 

44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 

An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR NO. 783.29) and a copy may be obtained from
Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch; EPA, 401 M Street, SW., 2740. These requirements are not effective until
OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the 

Federal Register

.
This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 14,600 hours per response and an estimated
annual recordkeeping burden averaging 1,250 hours per respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the date needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. The regulations do not impose any new significant reporting or recordkeeping burden. They provide
for the inclusion of alternative-fueled automobiles in the current fuel economy programs. The reporting and recordkeeping
burdens associated with fuel economy of alternative-fueled and current automobiles are identical with the exception
of minor changes in fuel economy label wording for alternative-fueled automobiles. In addition, it is difficult
to accurately separate the total burden of the fuel economy program, because much of the testing and data input for
determining fuel economy is coincident to that of the emissions program. In summary, the current impact of the final
regulations' testing, recordkeeping and reporting burden is negligible.
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch (PM-2136); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency;
401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''


C. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal
regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of
these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA).
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The fuel economy regulation
revisions herein provide Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) credits to manufacturers of alternative-fueled
vehicles who are subject to the CAFE program, most of which are large automobile manufacturers and therefore will
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Test procedures. 



(a) The test procedures to be followed for generation of 
the city fuel economy data are those prescribed in   86.127 
through 86.138 of this chapter, as applicable, except as 
provided for in paragraph (d) of this section. (The 
evaporative loss portion of the test procedure may be 
omitted unless specifically required by the Administrator.) 

(b) The test procedures to be followed for generation of 
the highway fuel economy data are those specified in 
paragraphs (b) through (j) of this section. 

(1) The Highway Fuel Economy Dynamometer Procedure 
consists of preconditioning highway driving sequence and a 
measured highway driving sequence. 

(2) The highway fuel economy test is designated to 
simulate non-metropolitan driving with an average speed of 
48.6 mph and a maximum speed of 60 mph. The cycle is 10.2 
miles long with 0.2 stop per mile and consists of warmed-up 
vehicle operation on a chassis dynamometer through a 
specified driving cycle. A proportional part of the diluted 
exhaust emission is collected continuously for subsequent 
analysis of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide 
using a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler. Diesel 
dilute exhaust is continuously analyzed for hydrocarbons 
using a heated sample line and analyzer. Methanol and 
formaldehyde samples are collected and individually analyzed 
for methanol-fueled vehicles (measurement of methanol and 
formaldehyde may be omitted for 1993 through 1994 model year 
methanol-fueled vehicles provided a HFID calibrated on 
methanol is used for measuring HC plus methanol).

road load power and test weight for highway fuel economy 
testing. The test weight for the testing of a certification 
vehicle will be that test weight specified by the 
Administrator under the provisions of part 86 of this 
chapter. The test weight for a fuel economy data vehicle 
will be that test weight specified by the Administrator from 
the test weights covered by that vehicle configuration. The 
Administrator will base his selection of a test weight on 
the relative projected sales volumes of the various test 
weights within the vehicle configuration. 

(e) 

Vehicle preconditioning

. The Highway Fuel Economy 
Dynamometer Procedure is designed to be performed 
immediately following the Federal Emission Test Procedure, 
  86.127 through 86.138 of this chapter. When conditions 
allow, the tests should be scheduled in this sequence. In 
the event the tests cannot be scheduled within three hours 
of the Federal Emission Test Procedure (including one hour 
hot soak evaporative loss test, if applicable) the vehicle 
should be preconditioned as in paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of 
this section, as applicable. 

(1) If the vehicle has experienced more than three hours 
of soak (68 
 F-86 
 F) since the completion of the Federal 
Emission Test Procedure, or has experienced periods of 
storage outdoors, or in environments where soak temperature 
is not controlled to 68 
 F-86 
 F, the vehicle must be 
preconditioned by operation on a dynamometer through one 
cycle of the EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule,  86.115 
of this chapter. 

(2) In unusual circumstances where additional 
preconditioning is desired by the manufacturer, the 
provisions of  86.132(a)(3) of this chapter apply. 

(f) 

Highway fuel economy dynamometer procedure. 

(1) The 
dynamometer procedure consists of two cycles of the Highway 
Fuel Economy Driving Schedule ( 600.109(b)) separated by 15 
seconds of idle. The first cycle of the Highway Fuel 
Economy Driving Schedule is driven to precondition the test 
vehicle and the second is driven for the fuel economy 
measurement. 

(2) The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), (e), (f), (g) 
and (h) of  86.135 

Dynamometer procedure

 of this chapter, 
apply for highway fuel economy testing. 

(3) Only one exhaust sample and one background sample are 
collected and analyzed for hydrocarbons (except diesel 
hydrocarbons which are analyzed continuously), carbon 
monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Methanol and formaldehyde 
samples (exhaust and dilution air) are collected and 
analyzed for methanol-fueled vehicles (measurement of 
methanol and formaldehyde may be omitted for 1993 through 
1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles provided a HFID 
calibrated on methanol is used for measuring HC plus 
methanol). 

(4) The fuel economy measurement cycle of the test 
includes two seconds of idle indexed at the beginning of the 
second cycle and two seconds of idle indexed at the end of 
the second cycle.

Engine starting and restarting. 

(1) If the engine is not running at the initiation of the highway fuel economy test (preconditioning cycle), the start-up
procedure must be according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. 

(2) False starts and stalls during the preconditioning cycle must be treated as in  86.136(d) and (e) of this
chapter. If the vehicle stalls during the measurement cycle of the highway fuel economy test, the test is voided, corrective
action may be taken according to  86.079-25 of this chapter, and the vehicle may be rescheduled for test.
The person taking the corrective action shall report the action so that the test records for the vehicle contain a record
of the action. 

(h) 

Dynamometer test run. 

The following steps must be taken for each test: 

(1) Place the drive wheels of the vehicle on the dynamometer. The vehicle may be driven onto the dynamometer. 

(2) Open the vehicle engine compartment cover and position the cooling fans(s) required. Manufacturers may request
the use of additional cooling fans for additional engine compartment or under-vehicle cooling and for controlling
high tire or brake temperatures during dynamometer operation. 

(3) Preparation of the CVS must be performed before the measurement highway driving cycle. 

(4) Equipment preparation. The provisions of  86.137(b)(3) through (6) of this chapter apply for highway fuel
economy test except that only one exhaust sample collection bag and one dilution air sample collection bag need be
connected to the sample collection systems. 

(5) Operate the vehicle over one Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule cycle according to the dynamometer driving
schedule specified in  600.109(b). 

(6) When the vehicle reaches zero speed at the end of the preconditioning cycle, the driver has 17 seconds to prepare
for the emission measurement cycle of the test. Reset and enable the roll revolution counter. 

(7) Operate the vehicle over one Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule cycle according to the dynamometer driving
schedule specified in  600.109(b) while sampling the exhaust gas.

Subpart C_[Amended] 
 

16. A new  600.201-93 is added to subpart C to read as 
follows: 


 600.201-93 

General applicability. 
 


The provisions of this subpart are applicable to 1993 
and later model year gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, 
alcohol-fueled, natural gas-fueled, alcohol dual fuel, and 
natural gas dual fuel automobiles. 
 
17. A new  600.206-93 is added to subpart C to read as 
follows: 



 600.206-93 

Calculation and use of fuel economy values 
 for gasoline-fueled, diesel-fueled, electric, 
 alcohol-fueled, natural gas-fueled, alcohol dual fuel, 
 and natural gas dual fuel vehicle configurations. 
 


(a) Fuel economy values determined for each vehicle, and 
as approved in  600.008 (b) or (f), are used to determine 
city, highway, and combined fuel economy values for each 
vehicle configuration (as determined by the Administrator) 
for which data are available. 
 

(1) If only one set of city and highway fuel economy values 
is accepted for a vehicle configuration, these values, rounded 
to the nearest tenth of a mile per gallon, comprise the city and 
highway fuel economy values for that configuration. 
 
(2) If more than one city or highway fuel economy value is 
accepted for a vehicle configuration: 
 
(i) All data shall be grouped according to the 
subconfiguration for which the data were generated using sales 
projections supplied in accordance with  600.207(a)(3). 
 
(ii) Within each group of data, all values are harmonically 
averaged and rounded to the nearest 0.0001 of a mile per gallon 
in order to determine city and highway fuel economy values for 
each subconfiguration at which the vehicle configuration was 
tested. 
 
(iii) All city fuel economy values and all highway fuel 
economy values calculated in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section are (separately for city and highway) averaged in 
proportion to the sales fraction (rounded to the nearest 0.0001) 
within the vehicle configuration (as provided to the 
Administrator by the manufacturer) of vehicles of each tested 
subconfiguration. The resultant values, rounded to the nearest 
0.0001 mile per gallon, are the city and highway fuel economy 
values for the vehicle configuration. 
 
(3) The combined fuel economy value for a vehicle 
configuration is calculated by harmonically averaging the city 
and highway fuel economy values, as determined in  600.206(a) (1) 
or (2), weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively, and rounded to the 
nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon. A sample of this calculation 
appears in Appendix II to this part. 
 
(4) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual 
fuel automobiles the procedures of paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) 
of this section shall be used to calculate two separate sets of 
city, highway, and combined fuel economy values for each 
configuration. 
 
(i) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy 
values from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test 
fuel. 
 
(ii) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy 
values from the tests performed using alcohol or natural gas 
test fuel. 
 
(b) If only one equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy 
value exists for an electric configuration, that value, rounded 
to the nearest tenth of a mile per gallon, will compose the 
petroleum-based fuel economy for that configuration. 
 
(c) If more than one equivalent petroleum-based fuel 
economy value exists for an electric vehicle configuration, all 
values for that vehicle configuration are harmonically averaged 
and rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon for that 
configuration. 
 

18. A new  600.207-93 is added to subpart C to read as 
follows: 




 600.207-93 

Calculation of fuel economy values for a model 
type. 
 



(a) Fuel economy values for a base level are calculated 
from vehicle configuration fuel economy values as determined in 
 600.206(a) for low-altitude tests. 
 (1) If the Administrator determines that automobiles 
intended for sale in the State of California are likely to 
exhibit significant differences in fuel economy from those 
intended for sale in other states, he will calculate fuel 
economy values for each base level for vehicles intended for 
sale in California and for each base level for vehicles intended 
for sale in the rest of the states. 
 

(2) In order to highlight the fuel efficiency of certain 
designs otherwise included within a model type, a manufacturer 
may wish to subdivide a model type into one or more additional 
model types. This is accomplished by separating 
subconfigurations from an existing base level and placing them 
into a new base level. The new base level is identical to the 
existing base level except that it shall be considered, for the 
purposes of this paragraph, as containing a new basic engine. 
The manufacturer will be permitted to designate such new basic 
engines and base level(s) if: 
 

(i) Each additional model type resulting from division of 
another model type has a unique car line name and that name 
appears on the label and on the vehicle bearing that label; 
 

(ii) The subconfigurations included in the new base levels 
are not included in any other base level which differs only by 
basic engine (i.e., they are not included in the calculation of 
the original base level fuel economy values); and 
 

(iii) All subconfigurations within the new base level are 
represented by test data in accordance with  600.010(c)(ii). 
 

(3) The manufacturer shall supply total model year sales 
projections for each car line/vehicle subconfiguration 
combination. 
 

(i) Sales projections must be supplied separately for each 
car line-vehicle subconfiguration intended for sale in 
California and each car line/vehicle subconfiguration intended 
for sale in the rest of the states if required by the 
Administrator under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
 

(ii) Manufacturers shall update sales projections at the 
time any model type value is calculated for a label value. 
 

(iii) The requirements of this paragraph may be satisfied 
by providing an amended application for certification, as 
described in  86.084-21 of this chapter. 
 

(4) Vehicle configuration fuel economy values, as 
determined in  600.206(a), are grouped according to base level. 
 

(i) If only one vehicle configuration within a base level 
has been tested, the fuel economy value from that vehicle 
configuration constitutes the fuel economy for that base level. 
 

(ii) If more than one vehicle configuration within a base 
level has been tested, the vehicle configuration fuel economy 
values are harmonically averaged in proportion to the respective 
sales fraction (rounded to the nearest 0.0001) of each vehicle 
configuration and the resultant fuel economy value rounded to 
the nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon. 
 

(5) The procedure specified in  600.207(a) will be repeated 
for each base level, thus establishing city, highway, and 
combined fuel economy values for each base level.

<TEXT>
 

(6) For the purposes of calculating a base level fuel economy value, if the only vehicle configuration(s) within the
base level are vehicle configuration(s) which are intended for sale at high altitude, the Administrator may use fuel
economy data from tests conducted on these vehicle configuration(s) at high altitude to calculate the fuel economy
for the base level. 

(7) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles the procedures of paragraphs (a)(1) through
(6) of this section shall be used to calculate two separate sets of city, highway, and combined fuel economy values
for each base level. 

(i) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy values from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel
test fuel. 

(ii) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy values from the tests performed using alcohol or natural
gas test fuel. 

(b) For each model type, as determined by the Administrator, a city, highway, and combined fuel economy value will
be calculated by using the projected sales and fuel economy values for each base level within the model type. 

(1) If the Administrator determines that automobiles intended for sale in the State of California are likely to exhibit
significant differences in fuel economy from those intended for sale in other states, he will calculate fuel economy
values for each model type for vehicles intended for sale in California and for each model type for vehicles intended
for sale in the rest of the states. 

(2) The sales fraction for each base level is calculated by dividing the projected sales of the base level within the
model type by the projected sales of the model type and rounding the quotient to the nearest 0.0001. 

(3) The city fuel economy values of the model type (calculated to the nearest 0.0001 mpg) are determined by dividing
one by a sum of terms, each of which corresponds to a base level and which is a fraction determined by dividing: 

(i) The sales fraction of a base level; by 

(ii) The city fuel economy value for the respective base level. 

(4) The procedure specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is repeated in an analogous manner to determine the
highway and combined fuel economy values for the model type. 

(5) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles the procedures of paragraphs (b)(1) through
(4) of this section shall be used to calculate two separate sets of city, highway, and combined fuel economy values
for each model type. 

(i) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy values from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel
test fuel. 

(ii) Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy values from the tests performed using alcohol or natural
gas test fuel. 

19. A new  600.209-95 is added to subpart C to read as follows: 



 600.209-95

to the nearest whole mpg; or 

(ii) For general labels for alcohol dual fuel and natural gas dual fuel automobiles: 

(A) Multiply the highway model type fuel economy calculated from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test
fuel as determined in  600.207 (b)(5)(i) by 0.78, rounding the product to the nearest whole mpg; and

to the nearest 0.1 mpg) divided by the sales-weighted average (rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mpg) of all model type
city fuel economy values (rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg). The quotient shall be rounded to 4 decimal places. These
average fuel economies shall be determined using the methodology of paragraph (c) of this section. 

c = 0.0022 for the 1986 model year. 

c = A constant value, fixed by model year. For 1987, the Administrator will specify the c value after the necessary laboratory
humidity and test fuel data become available. For 1988 and later model years, the Administrator will specify the c
value after the necessary laboratory humidity and test fuel data become available.

(f) The Administrator shall calculate and apply additional average fuel economy adjustments if, after notice and
opportunity for comment, the Administrator determines that, as a result of test procedure changes not 
previously considered, such correction is necessary to yield fuel economy test results that are comparable to those
obtained under the 1975 test procedures. In making such determinations, the Administrator must find that: 

(1) A directional change in measured fuel economy of an average vehicle can be predicted from a revision to the test
procedures; 

(2) The magnitude of the change in measured fuel economy for any vehicle or fleet of vehicles caused by a revision to
the test procedures is quantifiable from theoretical ca
