Irish Potatoes Grown in Oregon and California; Establishment of Interest and Late Payment Charges on Overdue Assessment
Payments


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would allow the Oregon-California Potato Committee (committee) to impose interest and late payment
charges on overdue assessments under the marketing order. Some handlers are frequently late paying their assessments,
which tends to cause cash flow problems for the committee and is inequitable to handlers who pay assessments when due.
Imposing interest and late payment charges on handlers would encourage such handlers to pay their assessment obligations
in a timely manner and help the committee maintain sufficient funds to carry on normal operations. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposal is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 114 and Marketing Order No. 947 [7 CFR part 947], as amended,
regulating the handling of potatoes grown in Modoc and Siskiyou Counties in California, and all counties in Oregon,
except Malheur County, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This proposal has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This proposed rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 40 handlers of Oregon-California potatoes who are subject to regulation under the order
and approximately 450 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms, which includes handlers,
have been defined by the Small Business Administration 
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of Oregon-California
potatoes may be classified as small entities. 
On May 25, 1994, a mail ballot was completed in accordance with  947.26 during which the committee recommended,
under the authority of  947.41(a) of the order, that handlers who are delinquent in paying their assessments
be subject to late payment and interest charges. Nine affirmative ballots were received, meeting the minimum number
for a quorum for the fourteen-member committee.
The committee depends upon handler assessments for operating funds. Handlers are invoiced by the committee on a monthly
basis. However, some handlers are continually late with their assessment payments and a few wait until the end of the
season to remit to the committee what is owed. When assessments are not paid in a timely manner, the handlers paying
assessments on time are placed in an unfair situation compared to the delinquent handlers.

As part of its collection efforts, the committee has requested delinquent handlers to promptly submit assessment
payments. However, such requests have not substantially decreased the frequency of delinquent payments. To facilitate
the collection of assessments needed for the maintenance and functioning of the committee, the committee recommended
that a late payment charge of five (5) percent of the unpaid assessment balance be applied to any handler account more
than thirty days overdue, and an interest charge of one (1) percent per month be applied to any assessment balance,
plus the late payment charge, remaining unpaid after sixty days. The interest charge added to the bill after 60 days
would be compounded monthly until the delinquent handler's assessment plus late payment charge and unpaid interest
charges have been paid in full. The committee believes these charges are high enough to encourage timely payment of
assessments, and are within the interest range customarily charged by banks on commercial accounts. 
This proposal is intended to encourage handlers to pay their assessments when due, thereby eliminating potential
inequities. The committee believes that the recommended action is the only alternative available to ensure timely
payments. The proposal is expected to reduce the need for Department involvement with compliance efforts and thereby
reduce the costs for the government to administer the marketing order program. 
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1988 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], the information collection requirements
that are contained in this proposal have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under
the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number 0581-0112. 
Interested persons are invited to submit their views and comments on this proposal. A 15-day comment period is considered
appropriate because any changes to the regulations, if adopted, should be in effect as soon as possible to encourage
timely payments. All comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this proposed rule.

Marketing agreements, Potatoes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 




For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 947 is proposed to be amended as follows:

 947.141 

Late payment and interest charges. 


The committee shall impose a late payment charge on any handler who fails to pay his or her assessment within thirty
(30) days of the billing date shown on the handler's assessment statement received from the committee. The late payment
charge shall, after 30 days, be five percent of the unpaid assessment balance. In the event the handler fails to pay
the delinquent assessment amount, plus the late payment charge, within 60 days following the billing date, an additional
one percent interest charge shall be applied monthly thereafter to the unpaid balance, including any accumulated
interest. Any amount paid by a handler as an assessment, including any charges imposed pursuant to this paragraph,
shall be credited when the payment is received in the committee office.

Proposed Amendment to Regulations for Collecting Cotton Research and Promotion Assessment 






<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 








</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Agricultural Marketing Service is amending the Cotton Board Rules and Regulations by raising the value assigned
to imported cotton for the purpose of calculating supplemental assessments collected for use by the Cotton Research
and Promotion Program. The amended value reflects the 12-month average price received by U.S. farmers for Upland
cotton for calendar year 1993. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 




This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 



The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under Section
12 of the Act, any person subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision
of the plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the District Court of the United States
in any district in which the person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review
the Secretary's ruling, provided a complaint is filed within 20 days from the date of the entry of the ruling. 




The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small
entities pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). 




There are an estimated 10,000 importers who are presently subject to rules and regulations issued pursuant to the
Cotton Research and Promotion Order. This proposed rule will affect importers of cotton and cotton-containing products.
The majority of these importers are small businesses under the criteria established by the Small Business Administration.
This proposed rule would raise the assessments paid by the importers under the Cotton Research and Promotion Order.
Even though the assessment would be raised, the increase is small and would not significantly affect small businesses.
The AMS Administrator therefore has certified that this rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. 




In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) which implement the Paperwork
Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.) the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule have been previously approved by OMB
and were assigned control number 0581-0093. 




The Cotton Research and Promotion Act Amendments of 1990 enacted by Congress under Subtitle G of Title XIX of the Food,
Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 on November 28, 1990, contained two provisions that authorized changes
in the funding procedures for the Cotton Research and Promotion Program.

These provisions are: (1) The assessment of imported cotton and cotton products; and (2) termination of the right
of producers to demand a refund of assessments. 

An amended Cotton Research and Promotion Order was approved by producers and importers voting in a referendum held
July 17-26, 1991. Proposed rules implementing the amended Order were published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 17, 1991, (56 FR 65450). The final implementing rules were published on July 1 and 2, 1992, (57 FR 29181)
and (57 FR 29431), respectively. 

This proposed rule would increase the value assigned to imported cotton in the Cotton Board Rules and Regulations
7 CFR 1205.510 (b)(2). This value is used to calculate supplemental assessments on imported cotton and the cotton
content of imported products. Supplemental assessments are the second part of a two-part assessment. The first part
of the assessment is levied on the weight of cotton produced or imported at a rate of $1 per bale of cotton which is equivalent
to 500 pounds or $1 per 226.8 kilograms. 

Supplemental assessments are levied at a rate of five tenths of one percent of the value of domestically produced cotton,
imported cotton, and the cotton content of imported products. The agency adopted the use of the average price received
by U.S. farmers for Upland cotton as a benchmark for the value of domestically produced cotton. The source for this
statistic is ``Agricultural Prices'', a publication of the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the Department
of Agriculture. Use of the average price figure in the calculation of supplemental assessments on imported cotton
and the cotton content of imported products yields an assessment that approximates assessments paid on domestically
produced cotton. 

The current value of imported cotton as published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 29431) for the purpose of calculating supplemental assessments on imported cotton is $1.160 per kilogram.
Using the Average Price Received by U.S. farmers for Upland cotton for the calendar year 1993, which is $0.543 per pound,
the new value of imported cotton would be $1.197 per kilogram. 

An example of the assessment formula and how the various figures are obtained is as follows: 




One bale is equal to 500 pounds. 

One kilogram equals 2.2046 pounds. 

One pound equals 0.453597 kilograms. 




One dollar per bale assessment converted to kilograms 





A 500 pound bale=226.8 kg. (500 x .453597) 



$1 per bale assessment


=$0.002000 per pound (1
500) 

=$0.004409 per kg. (1
226.8) 






Supplemental assessment of 5/10 of one percent of the value of the cotton converted to kilograms 




Average price received=$0.543 per pound 

or average value=$1.197 per kg. (0.543 x 2.2046) 




5/10 of one percent of the average price in kg.=$0.005985 per kg. (1.1970 x .005) 





Total assessment per kilogram 




$1 per bale equivalent assessment=$0.004409 per kg. 

Supplemental assessment+

$0.005985

 per kg. 

total assessment per kg.=$0.010394 





Since the value of cotton is the basis of the supplemental assessment calculation and the figures shown in the right
hand column of the Import Assessment Table 1205.510 (b)(3) are a result of such a calculation, these figures would
be revised. These figures indicate the total assessment per kilogram due for each Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS)
number subject to assessment. 



List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1205 



Advertising, Agricultural research, Cotton, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.





For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 1205 is amended as follows:

(b) * * * 

(2) The 12-month average of monthly average prices received by U.S. farmers will be calculated annually. Such average
will be used as the value of imported cotton for the purpose of levying the supplemental assessment on imported cotton
and will be expressed in kilograms. The value of imported cotton for the purpose of levying this supplemental assessment
is $1.197 per kilogram. 

(3) The following table contains the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) classification numbers and corresponding
conversion factors and assessments. The left column of the table indicates the HTS classifications of imported cotton
and cotton-containing products subject to assessment. The center column indicates the conversion factor for determining
the raw fiber content for each kilogram of the HTS. HTS numbers for raw cotton have no conversion factors in the table.
The right column indicates the total assessment per kilogram of the article assessed. Any line item entry of cotton
appearing on Customs entry documentation in which the value of the cotton contained therein is less than $220.99 will
not be subject to assessments as described in this section.

Land Ownership Requirements for Low-Level Waste Sites 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering amending its regulations to allow private ownership of Low-Level
Radioactive Waste facility sites as an alternative to the current requirement for Federal or State ownership. Information
to twelve questions is requested to assist in determining if such a change could be made without adversely impacting
public health and safety. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



The NRC regulations for licensing land disposal of radioactive waste require that the land must be owned by the Federal
or State government ( 61.59(a)). This requirement was issued to assure control of the disposal site after closure,
and thereby reduce the potential for inadvertent intrusion, better ensure integrity of the site, and facilitate
monitoring of site performance. 

However, on June 28, 1993, the NRC found acceptable an exemption to the above land ownership requirement that was granted
to Envirocare of Utah, Inc. (Envirocare) by the State of Utah (an Agreement State

1

). The State of Utah, using the exemption provision in its regulations, issued an exemption to the land ownership requirement
when it issued a license to Envirocare on March 21, 1991, for the land disposal of low-level radioactive waste (LLW).
Under the exemption, Envirocare will remain the property owner and remain responsible for the site under the license
through the 100 year post-closure period (referred to as the active institutional control period). 





The Commission initially reviewed the State of Utah's exemption in April 1992, and determined that the State of Utah
had not provided sufficient rationale for issuing the exemption to the land ownership requirement. Subsequently,
the NRC proposed, and the State of Utah and Envirocare agreed to, additional provisions imposed by the State of Utah
upon Envirocare. 

The restrictions on the land imposed by the State of Utah were zoning the property for industrial waste and writing
a restrictive covenant which was added as an annotation to the land record. The covenant adds additional restrictions
regarding future activities and uses of the land to ensure its integrity, and remains in effect indefinitely. 

To provide assurance of financial surety, the State of Utah required Envirocare to establish a trust account under
the control of the State. The disbursement of the funds from the account must be approved by the State. 

The Commission staff, in response to a 2.206 petition from US Ecology, is reviewing whether the State of Utah is controlling
Envirocare's LLW site in a manner that provides a substantially equivalent level of protection of the public health
and safety as is provided by Federal or State site ownership. The Envirocare site may present a special case for private
ownership. On the other hand, it is possible that land use controls could be used at other LLW sites without requiring
government ownership; therefore, the Commission is considering amending 10 CFR Part 61 to provide a generic basis
for allowing the use of such controls as an alternative to government ownership. 



Specific Proposal 



The Commission is considering amending  61.59 to allow private ownership of a LLW disposal site under provisions
similar to those used for Envirocare by the State of Utah as discussed above. Specifically,  61.59(a) would
be modified to permit private ownership of a LLW disposal site, provided that the integrity of the disposal site is
ensured after closure. 



Specific Considerations 



Advice and recommendations on a proposed rule reflecting the foregoing and on any other points considered pertinent
are invited from all interested persons. Comments and supporting reasons are particularly requested on the following
questions: 

1. The Commission considers that an amendment to 10 CFR Part 61 as described in this ANPRM could facilitate the objectives
of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1985, as amended, by allowing States additional flexibility in developing
new low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities. Would this change be useful for other LLW disposal sites or
is it likely that the Utah exemption was one of a kind? The NRC would specifically request Compacts and Agreement States
to inform us if private ownership for any potential site in their region is possible or is precluded by State laws or
other provisions.

2. Would this change facilitate or hinder future licensing of LLW facilities? 

3. Would this change have any adverse impacts on public health and safety and protection of the environment? 

4. Would the responsible regulatory agency lose any control over the disposal site if it is not owned by the Federal
or State government? 

5. Are there valid reasons why land ownership requirements for NRC-regulated disposal sites should be more restrictive
than EPA-regulated hazardous waste, municipal waste, and Superfund facilities, where government ownership is
not usually a requirement? 

6. How would private ownership affect liability for a disposal site? 

7. Would States' concerns about assuming liability for a disposal site be alleviated by this proposal? 

8. Would deletion of the State or Federal ownership requirement eliminate governmental liability under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) for releases from the site and, if so, does
this change have any adverse impacts on public health and safety and protection of the environment, including after
the active institutional control period? 

9. Should the NRC consider allowing a site owner to be only the licensee, or broaden the proposal to allow other private
ownership? 

10. Should there be a time period after which the licensee can request termination of the license, even though the land
might remain in private ownership? 

11. If the NRC were to implement this proposal, are the surety requirements contained in 10 CFR Part 61, Subpart E, sufficient?


12. Under  61.80(e), all records are to be transferred to Federal and/or State agencies at the time of license
termination. If the license remains in effect during the active institutional control period (licensee is site owner),
would there be a need for this records transfer?

<USDEPT>NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>






Truth in Savings



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Credit Union Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; official staff interpretation.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The NCUA Board is publishing for comment a proposed official staff commentary to Part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations
(Truth in Savings). The commentary applies and interprets the requirements of Part 707 and is a substitute for individual
staff interpretations. The proposed commentary incorporates much of the guidance provided when the regulation
was adopted, and addresses additional questions that have been raised about the application of its requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

(1) Background



The purpose of the Truth in Savings Act (``TISA'') (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) is to assist members in comparing share and
deposit accounts offered by credit unions. TISA requires credit unions to disclose fees, the dividend or interest
rate, the annual percentage yield, and other account terms whenever a member requests the information and before
an account is opened. Fees and other information also must be provided on any periodic statement the credit union sends
to the member. Rules are set forth for share and deposit account advertisements and advance notices to account holders
of adverse changes in terms. TISA restricts how credit unions must determine the account balance on which dividends
or interest are calculated. TISA is implemented by part 707 of the NCUA's Rules and Regulations (``part 707'') (12
CFR part 707), which becomes effective on January 1, 1995, for most credit unions. TISA authorizes the issuance of
official staff interpretations of the regulation.

The Board is publishing a proposed commentary to Part 707. The proposal is designed to provide guidance to credit unions
in applying the regulation to specific transactions and is a substitute for, and a supplement to, individual staff
interpretations. The Board contemplates updating the commentary periodically to address significant questions
that arise. It is expected that this commentary will be adopted in final form in the fall of 1994, with an effective date
of the compliance date of Part 707. Due to the special needs of small, nonautomated credit unions, and for the reasons
explained by the Board in the Final Rule adopted at the July Board meeting, the Board has decided to extend the compliance
date of part 707 until January 1, 1996 for credit unions that are not automated and are under $2 million in assets as of
December 31, 1993.



(2) Proposed Commentary



The 

Federal Register 

notices containing the regulation that implemented TISA and notices for subsequent amendments set forth a large
amount of supplementary material interpreting the new regulation. (See final rule published on September 27, 1993
(58 FR 50394), and final rule, corrections and correcting amendments, published on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13435).)
In large measure, the proposed commentary incorporates the supplementary material from those rulemakings, and
reflects the views expressed therein without substantive change. A number of issues that have arisen since the publication
of the regulation have also been addressed.

On December 6, 1993, the Federal Reserve Board (``FRB'') published a proposal to amend the regulation's rules for
calculating the annual percentage yield for accounts that pay dividends or interest prior to maturity (58 FR 64190).
(See also the notice extending the comment period published on January 13, 1994, 59 FR 1921.) This FRB proposed rule
was withdrawn on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24376). In its place, a new FRB proposed rule was published on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24378),
as amended on July 11, 1994 (59 FR 35271). The FRB amendments focus on two issues: a desire for the annual percentage
yield to reflect the time value of money, and the concern of compliance costs and the impact on depository institutions
if the proposed rules is adopted. The comment period on the May 11 and July 11 FRB proposed rules has been extended until
September 6, 1994. Credit unions are encouraged to sent comments to the FRB. For further information on the FRB proposed
amendments credit unions may contact Jane Ahrens, Senior Attorney, Kyung Cho or Kurt Schumacher, Staff Attorneys,
Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at (202) 452-3667
or 452-2412. The NCUA Board is delaying action regarding any adoption of similar amendments to part 707 until
the completion of the FRB's rulemakings.

The NCUA proposed commentary is derived from the one proposed by the FRB and from information provided in the supplementary
information to NCUA's final Truth in Savings rule, part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. The proposed commentary
also reflects NCUA staff's understanding of the FRB's interpretations which have not been publicly published. The
proposed commentary, for the most part, does not repeat information provided in part 707. We believe the proposed
commentary is self-explanatory and not in need of further supplementary information. Due to the fact that most credit
unions will not have to comply with part 707 until 1995, NCUA is in the unusual position of promulgating a commentary
before experiencing the implementation of the rule which is explained in the commentary. However, the NCUA Board
believes that it will be of assistance to credit union members and potential members, credit unions, credit union
supervisors and regulators, the NCUA, and other interested parties to have a commentary finalized before the compliance
date of part 707 to aid in compliance of this new, technical regulation required by Congress. Therefore, NCUA requests
the assistance of all interested parties in ensuring that the commentary address the most generally asked questions
and concerns that credit union members and potential members, credit unions, and other interested parties might
have regarding Truth in Savings and part 707. To a great extent, the final commentary to be issued by NCUA will reflect
the questions, concerns, and comments that are generated by this proposed commentary. NCUA solicits comments on
any aspect of part 707 that may be addressed by a commentary which may provide assistance to credit unions in complying
with TISA and part 707, providing an easily accessible, safe harbor for credit unions, while observing the letter,
spirit and intent of TISA. In providing comments on this proposal, NCUA reminds commenters that TISA requires NCUA's
regulation to be substantially similar to Regulation DD (12 CFR 230), the FRB's Truth in Savings regulation, except
that NCUA may take into account the unique nature of credit unions and the limitations under which credit unions pay
dividends. Commenters are asked to direct their comments not to the rule (12 CFR   707.1-707.9)
or Appendices A and B to part 707, but to how the rule and its appendices can best be implemented and complied with by credit
unions.



List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 707



Advertising, Credit unions, Consumer protection, Deposit accounts, Interest, Interest rates, Truth in savings.






For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board proposed to amend 12 CFR part 707 as follows:



PART 707_TRUTH IN SAVINGS



1. The authority citation for part 707 would continue to read as follows:








Authority: 

12 U.S.C. 4311.






2. Part 707 would be amended by adding a new Appendix C to Part 707_Official Staff Interpretations to read as follows:



Appendix C_Official Staff Interpretations

Introduction



1. 

Official status. 

This commentary is the vehicle by which the staff of the Office of General Counsel of the National Credit Union Administration
issues official staff interpretations of Part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Good faith compliance with this
commentary affords protection from liability under section 271(f) of the Truth in Savings Act (``TSIA''), 12 U.S.C.
 4311.



Section 707.1_Authority, purpose, coverage, and effect on state laws.

(c) Coverage



1. 

Foreign applicability. 

Part 707 applies to all credit unions, whether state or federally chartered, that offer share and deposit accounts
to residents (including resident aliens) of any state as defined in  707.2(v) and that offer accounts insurable
by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (``NCUSIF'') whether or not such accounts are insured by the NCUSIF.
Corporate credit unions designated as such by NCUA under 12 CFR  704.2 (definition of ``corporate credit union'')
are exempt from part 707.

2. 

Persons who advertise accounts. 

Persons who advertise accounts are subject to the advertising rules. This includes agent and agented accounts, such
as a member who subdivides interests in a jumbo term share certificate account for sale to other parties or among members
who form a certificate account investment club. For example, if a share broker places an advertisement that offers
members a dividend in an account at a credit union, the advertising rules apply to the advertisement, whether the account
is held by the broker or directly by the member.

3. 

Preemption of state laws. 

State laws are preempted to the extent they impose requirements that are inconsistent with TISA and part 707. If credit
union officials or members are concerned as to whether state law requirements are preempted, they may write to NCUA's
Office of General Counsel requesting a preemption determination. Written preemption requests should cite (or include
a copy of) the allegedly inconsistent state law, demonstrate the inconsistency with TISA and part 707 and the burden
on credit unions, and formally request a preemption determination.



Section 707.2_Definitions.

(a) Account



1. 

Covered accounts. 

Examples of accounts subject to the regulation are:






Dividend-bearing or interest-bearing accounts

Non-dividend-bearing or non-interest-bearing accounts

Accounts opened as a condition of obtaining a credit card

Escrow accounts with a consumer purpose, such as an account established by a member to escrow rental payments, pending
resolution of a dispute with the member's landlord

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00012 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Accounts held by a parent or custodian for a minor under a state's Uniform Gift to Minors Act (or Uniform Transfers to
Minors Act)
Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and simplified employee pension (SEP) accounts



Examples of accounts 

not

 subject to the regulation are:



Mortgage escrow accounts for collecting taxes and property insurance premiums
Accounts established to make periodic disbursements on construction loans
Trust accounts other than individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and simplified employee pension (SEP) accounts
Accounts opened by an executor in the name of a decedent's estate
Accounts of individuals operating businesses as sole proprietors
Certificates of indebtedness. Some credit unions borrow funds from their members through a certificate of indebtedness
that sets forth the terms and conditions of the repayment of the borrowing, such as federal credit unions do through
12 CFR 701.38. Such an account does not represent shares in a credit union and is not covered by part 707.



2. 

Other investments.

 The term ``account'' does not apply to all products of a credit union. Examples of products not covered are:



Government securities
Mutual funds
Annuities
Securities or obligations of a credit union
Contractual arrangements such as repurchase agreements, interest rate swaps, and bankers acceptances
Purchases of U.S. Savings Bonds through a credit union
Services offered through a group purchasing plan or a credit union service organization (CUSO)



3. 

Unincorporated nonbusiness association accounts.

 An account held by or offered to an unincorporated association of natural persons is a consumer account if the account
is primarily for a nonbusiness purpose. The following factors may be considered:



The credit union may rely on the declaration of the person representing the association as to whether the account is
held for a business or nonbusiness purpose.
Whether the association has paid employees, which would indicate a business purpose for the account. For example,
an account held by a religious organization that has payroll obligations is not covered by the regulation.



Examples of unincorporated nonbusiness associations are softball teams, bowling leagues, and church and school
groups. Accounts of such organizations opened on or after the compliance date of part 707 are covered by part 707. Such
accounts in existence prior to the compliance date of part 707 are not covered unless one of the association members
notifies the credit union that it would like to receive applicable account disclosures. If the credit union is notified
by such an organization, it must begin complying with the requirements of this rule for subsequent disclosures as
applicable, such as periodic statements and change-in-terms notices, within a reasonable period of time after notification.
A credit union would be required to comply with the provisions regarding notices to existing members, including full
disclosures at the credit union's option, if the association notifies the credit union prior to the first periodic
statement mailing after the compliance date of part 707.
4. 

Options.

 All accounts are either fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts.


(b) Advertisement

1. 

Coverage. 

Advertisements include commercial messages in visual, oral, or print media that invite, offer, or otherwise announce
generally to members and potential members the availability of member accounts such as:




Telephone solicitations

Messages on automated teller machine (ATM) screens

Messages on a computer screen in a credit union's lobby (including any printout)

Messages in a newspaper, magazine, or promotional flyer or on radio or television

Messages promoting an account that provided along with information about the member's existing account at a credit
union, such as on the periodic statement




Examples of messages that are not advertisements are:




Rate sheets published in newspapers, periodicals, or trade journals, provided the credit union (or share and deposit
broker that offers accounts at the credit union) does not pay a fee to have the information included

Telephone conversations initiated by a member or potential member about an account

An in-person discussion with a member about the terms for a specific account 

Information provided to members about their existing accounts, such as on IRA disbursements or notices for automatically
renewable term share accounts sent before renewal



(c) Annual Percentage Yield.



1. 

General. 

The annual percentage yield (APY) is required for disclosures for new accounts, oral responses to inquiries about
rates; disclosures provided upon request; disclosures for existing members (if the credit union chooses to provide
full disclosures instead of the shorter periodic statement notice); notices prior to the maturity of a term share
account, if known at the time the notice is sent, and in advertising. The annual percentage yield shows the total amount
of dividends on an assumed principal amount as a percentage of the principal, based on the dividend rate and frequency
of compounding for a 365 day period (for accounts such as share or share draft accounts) or for the term of the account
for term share accounts. The annual percentage yield assumes the principal amount remains in the account for 365 days
or for the term of the account.

2. 

How Annual Percentage Yield differs from Annual Percentage Yield Earned. 

The annual percentage yield (APY) differs from the annual percentage yield earned (APYE). The annual percentage
yield earned is required for periodic statements only. The annual percentage yield earned shows the total amount
of dividends earned for the dividend or statement period as a percent of the actual average daily balance in the member's
account. Unlike the annual percentage yield, the annual percentage yield earned is affected by additions and withdrawals
during the period. The annual percentage yield and the annual percentage yield earned must be calculated according
to the formulas provided in Appendix A to this rule.



(d) Average Daily Balance Method.



1. 

General. 

One of the two required methods (the daily balance is the other) of determining the balance upon which dividends must
be paid. The average daily balance method requires the application of a periodic rate to the average daily balance
in the account for the average daily balance calculation period. The average daily balance is determined by adding
the full amount of principal in the account for each day of the period and dividing that figure by the number of days in
the period.



(e) Board.



1. 

General. 

The NCUA Board.



(f) Bonus.



1. 

General. 

Bonuses include items of value offered as incentives to members, such as an offer to pay the final installment deposit
for a holiday club account. Bonuses do not include the payment of dividends (including extraordinary dividends),
the waiver of reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits, or other consideration
aggregating $10 or less per year.

2. 

Examples. 

The following are examples of bonuses.




 A credit union offers $25 to potential members for becoming a member and opening an account. The $25 could be provided
by check, cash, or direct deposit.

 A credit union offers $25 to a member with only a regular share account to open a share draft account. The $25 could be
provided by check, cash, or direct deposit.

 A credit union offers a portable radio with a value of $20 to members and potential members for opening a share draft
account.




The following are examples of items that are 

not

 bonuses:




Discount coupons distributed by credit unions for use at restaurants or stores.

 A credit union offers $25 to a parent or custodian if the parent or custodian opens an account for a minor. The $25 is not
a bonus because the parent or custodian is not opening the account in his or her own name.

 A credit union offers $20 to any member if the member is responsible for convincing a potential member to open an account.
The $20 is not a bonus because the $20 is not paid to the individual opening the account. Any item, including cash, given
or offered to a third party in exchange for a member or potential member opening (or a member renewing or adding to) an
account is not a bonus.

 A credit union offers $25 to a member if the member if the member can locate his name in the body of a newsletter.

Life savings benefits. Many credit unions offer life savings benefits to beneficiaries of deceased members. Because
the benefit accrues to a third party, such life savings plans offered are not bonuses.




3. 

De minimis rule. 

Items with a 

de minimis 

value of $10 or less are not bonuses. Credit Unions may rely on the valuation standard used by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) to determine if the value of the item is 

de minimus. 

(See 26 CFR  1.6049-5(a)(2), which discusses the fair market value of property received.) Items required
to be reported by the credit union under IRS rules are bonuses under this regulation. 

Examples of items that are not bonuses are:




Disability insurance premiums that are not connected to a loan account paid by the credit union in an amount $10 or less
per year

Any insurance premiums paid by the credit union in connection with a loan account

Coffee mugs, T-shirts or other merchandise with a market value of $10 or less per year




4. 

Aggregation. 

Credit unions must aggregate per account per calendar year any items given to a member that are individually valued
at $10 or less and must consider them to be a bonus if their aggregate value exceeds $10.

<TEXT>
 

5. 

Waiver or reduction of a fee or absorption of expenses. 

Bonuses do not include value received by members through the waiver or reduction of fees for credit union-related
services (even if the fees waived exceed $10), such as the following:



Waiving a safe deposit box rental fee for one year for members who open a new account
Waiving fees for travelers checks for members
Nondiscriminatorily waiving all fees for a particular class of members, such as seniors or minors
Discounts on interest rates charged for loans at the credit union
Rebates of loan interest already paid by a member
Discounts on application fees charged for loans at the credit union



6. 

Non-dividend membership benefits. 

Such benefits are not bonuses because they are sporadic in nature, often difficult to value, and providing non-dividend
membership benefits is a long-standing unique credit union practice. (See commentary to  707.2(r) for examples
of such benefits.)


(g) Credit union.


1. 

General. 

Includes credit unions in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and U.S. territories. Applies
to credit unions whether or not the accounts in the credit union are federally, state, or privately insured, or uninsured.


(h) Daily balance method.


1. 

General. 

One of the two required methods (the average daily balance is the other) of determining the balance upon which dividends
must be paid. The daily balance method requires the application of a daily periodic rate to the full amount of principal
in the account each day.


(i) Dividend and dividends.


1. 

General. 

Member savings placed in share accounts are equity investments, and the returns earned on these accounts are dividends.
Federal credit unions may only offer dividend-bearing and non-dividend-bearing share accounts. State-chartered
credit unions may offer both share and deposit accounts if permitted by state law. Dividends exclude the payment of
a bonus or other consideration worth $10 or less given during a year, the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption
of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits, and extraordinary dividends.
2. 

Procedure. 

Dividends may be viewed as a portion of the available current and undivided earnings of the credit union which is set
apart, after required transfers to reserves, by valid act of the board of directors, for distribution among the members.
As a matter of legal procedure, members are not entitled to dividends until the following steps are completed: (1)
the board of the credit union develops a nondiscriminatory dividend policy, by establishing dividend periods, dividend
credit determination dates, dividend distribution dates, any associated penalties (if applicable), and the method
of dividend computation for each type of share account; (2) the provision for required transfers to reserves are made;
(3) sufficient and available prior and/or current earnings are available at the end of the dividend period; (4) the
board formally makes a dividend declaration in accordance with the credit union's dividend policy; and (5) dividends
must be paid to members by a credit to the appropriate share account, payment by share draft or by a combination of the
two methods.
3. 

When available. 

Legally, it is the declaration of the dividend itself which creates the dividend and the member has no right to receive
a dividend until it is so declared. The decision of when to declare dividends lies within the official discretion of
each credit union's board of directors and cannot be abrogated by contract. An agreement to pay dividends on a share
account is interpreted not as an obligation to pay the stipulated dividends absolutely and unconditionally, but
as an undertaking to pay them out of the earnings when sufficiently accumulated from which dividends in general are
properly payable. ``Prospective rates'' are rates set in good faith in advance of the close of a dividend period, that
may be altered if sufficient funds are not available, or in the event of a superseding event, such as a significant fluctuation
in market rates, natural disaster or emergency that alters the assumptions under which the ``prospective rates''
were made. ``Prospective rates'' may also be referred to as ``projected rates'' or similar wording, but not as ``estimated
rates.'' (See commentary to  707.3(b)(2), prohibiting use of estimates).
4. 

Referencing. 

Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of the term ``share'' in part 707, as in ``share account,'' also refers
to ``deposit,'' as in ``deposit account,'' where appropriate (for interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing deposit
accounts at some state-chartered credit unions).


(j) Dividend declaration date.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00015 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. 

General.

 One means of disclosing dividend rate information is to disclose the dividend rate earned on the account for the previous
dividend period. The term ``dividend declaration date'' is used to define the date that the board of directors of a
credit union declares a dividend for the preceding dividend period. Credit unions are cautioned that the ``dividend
declaration date'' (the date dividends are legally declared and earned) and the ``dividend distribution date''
(the date dividends are credited to an account) may differ.



(k) Dividend period.



1. 

General.

 The dividend period is to be set by a credit union's board of director's for each account type, e.g., regular share,
share draft, money market share, and term share. The most common dividend periods are weekly, monthly, quarterly,
semiannually, and annually. Dividend periods need not agree with calendar months, e.g., a monthly dividend period
could begin March 15 and end April 14.



(l) Dividend rate.



1. 

General.

 The dividend rate does not reflect compounding. Compounding is reflected in the ``annual percentage yield'' definition.

2. 

Referencing.

 Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of the term ``dividend rate'' in part 707 also refers to ``interest
rate,'' where appropriate (for interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit accounts at some state-chartered
credit unions).



(m) Extraordinary dividends.



1. 

General.

 Extraordinary dividends are commonly referred to among credit unions as ``bonus dividends.'' The definition encompasses
all irregularly scheduled and declared dividends, and as dividends, extraordinary dividends are exempt from the
``bonus'' disclosure requirements. Extraordinary dividends do not have to be disclosed on account disclosures,
but the dollar amount of an extraordinary dividend credited to the account during the statement period does have to
be separately disclosed on the periodic statement for the dividend period during which the extraordinary dividends
are earned.



(n) Fixed-rate account.



1. 

General.

 Includes all accounts in which the credit union, by contract, gives at least 30 days advance written notice of decreases
in the dividend rate or interest rate. Thus, credit unions can decrease rates only after providing advance written
notice of rate decreases, e.g., a ``change-in-terms notice.''



(o) Grace period.



1. 

General.

 A period after maturity of an automatically renewing term share account during which the member may withdraw funds
without being assessed a penalty. Use of a ``grace period'' is discretionary, not mandatory. This definition does
not refer to the ``grace period'' account, which is a synonym for ``federal rollback method'' or ``in by the 10th''
accounts, which are prohibited by TISA and part 707.



(p) Interest.



1. 

General.

 Member savings placed in deposit accounts are debt investments, and the return earned on these accounts is interest.
Federal credit unions are not authorized to offer any interest-bearing deposit accounts. State-chartered credit
unions may offer both share and deposit accounts if permitted by state law. Interest excludes the payment of a bonus
or other consideration worth $10 or less given during a year, the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses,
non-dividend membership benefits, and extraordinary dividends.

2. 

Differences between Dividends and Interest.

 Dividends are returns on an equity investment (shares); interest is return on a debt investment (deposits). Dividends
are not properly payable until declared at the close of a dividend period; interest is properly payable daily according
to the deposit contract. Dividend rates are prospective until actually declared; interest rates are set according
to contract in advance and are earned on that basis. Share accounts establish a member (owner)/credit union (cooperative)
relationship; deposit accounts establish a depositor (creditor)/depositary (debtor) relationship.

3. 

Referencing.

 Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of the terms ``dividend'' or ``dividends'' in part 707 also refers
to ``interest'' where appropriate (for interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit accounts at some state-chartered
credit unions).



(q) Member.



1. 

Professional capacity.

 Examples of accounts held by a natural person in a professional capacity for another are:




Attorney-client trust accounts

Trust, estate and court-ordered accounts

Landlord-tenant security accounts




2. 

Nonprofessional capacity.

 Examples of accounts 

not

 held in a professional capacity are:




Accounts held by parents for a child under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act)

Accounts established by a tenant for apartment lease payments pending resolution of a landlord-tenant dispute




3. 

Retirement plans.

 Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and simplified employee pension (SEP) accounts are member accounts to the
extent that funds are invested in accounts subject to the regulation. Keogh accounts, like sole proprietor accounts,
are not subject to the regulation.



(r) Non-dividend membership benefits.



1. 

General.

 Term reflects unique credit union practices that are difficult to value, encourage community spirit, and are not
granted in such quantity as to be includable as calculable dividends.

2. 

Examples. 

Examples include:






Food and refreshments at annual meetings, member functions, and branch openings 

Travel club benefits

Prizes offered at annual meetings, such as U.S. Savings bonds, a deposit of funds into the winner's account, trips,
and other gifts. Such prizes are not bonuses because they are offered as an incentive to increase attendance at the
annual meeting, and not to entice members to open, maintain, or renew accounts or increase an account balance.

Life savings benefits





(s) Passbook account




1. Relation to Regulation E. 

Passbook accounts include accounts accessed by preauthorized electronic fund transfers to the account (as defined
in 12 CFR  205.2(j)), such as an account credited by direct share and deposit of social security payments. Accounts
that permit access by other electronic means are not ``passbook accounts,'' and any statements that are sent four
or more times a year must comply with the requirements of  707.6.





(t) Periodic statement




1. General.

 Passbook and term share accounts are exempt from periodic statement requirements.


2. 

Examples. 

Periodic statements do not include:






Additional statements provided solely upon request

Information provided by computer through home electronic credit union services

General service information such as a quarterly newsletter or other correspondence that describes available services
and products







3. 

Regulation E interplay.

 Credit unions need not, but
 may treat any Regulation E statements as periodic statements for part 707 purposes. For credit unions that choose
not to treat Regulation E activity statements as part 707 periodic statements, the quarterly periodic statement
must reflect the annual percentage yield earned and dividends earned for the full quarter. However, credit unions
choosing this option need not redisclose fees already disclosed on an interim Regulation E activity statement on
the quarterly periodic statement. For credit unions that choose to treat Regulation E activity statements as part
707 periodic statements, the Regulation E statement must meet all part 707 requirements.


4. 

Account status information.

 Credit unions may provide the account number, the type of account, and balance information for an account on a periodic
statement given for another account. This allows members to receive information on their accounts either not covered
by the periodic statement disclosure requirements (passbook and term share accounts) or accounts on different statement
cycles (e.g., ``status information'' could be provided on a share draft monthly periodic statement for a share money
market account on a quarterly periodic statement cycle). However, providing information other than the balance
in an account (such as dividend rate or annual percentage yield earned information) would require the credit union
to give full disclosures for the ``status information'' account on the piggybacked statement. (See commentary to
 707.6(a)).


5. 

Use of ledger and collected balance to calculate Annual Percentage Yield Earned. 

Ledger balance means the record of the balance in a member's account, as per the credit union's records. (The ledger
balance may reflect additions and deposits for which the credit union has not yet received final payment). Collected
balance means the record of balance in a member's account reflecting collected funds, that is, cash or checks deposited
in the credit union which have been presented for payment and for which payment has actually been received. (See Regulation
CC, 12 CFR  229.14). The method used by a credit union to accrue or pay dividends or interest on noncash deposits
must be the same method used to determine the annual percentage yield earned. For example, a credit union using the
collected balance method must use the collected balance method to determine the annual percentage yield earned.





(u) Potential member.




1. General.

 A potential member is a natural person eligible for membership in a credit union, who has not yet taken the steps necessary
to make himself or herself a member. The term also includes natural person nonmembers eligible to hold accounts in
a credit union pursuant to relevant federal or state law.


2. 

Verification of eligibility.

 All credit unions should have sound written procedures in place to identify those eligible for membership. If these
procedures include verification measures, such as an application process, verification telephone call or letter
to an employer or association within the field of membership, witnessing by an existing member, or similar procedure,
then the credit union may first verify the membership eligibility of a potential member before sending account disclosures
or other information to the potential member. This process of verifying a member's eligibility status, making a recommendation
for membership, and providing account disclosures should be completed within 20 calendar days.


3. 

Nonmembers.

 Within its sole discretion, the board of directors of a credit union may provide TISA disclosures to nonmembers who
are ineligible for membership or to hold an account at the credit union. If disclosures are made to such nonmembers,
it is the position of the Board that no civil liability can accrue to the credit union for any errors in such disclosures.
(See commentary to  707.3(d)).





(v) State




1. General.

 Territories and possessions include American Samoa, Guam, the Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands.





(w) Stepped-rate account


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. General.

 Stepped-rate accounts are those accounts in which two or more dividend rates (known at the time the account is opened)
will take effect in succeeding periods.
2. 

Example.

 An example of a stepped-rate account is a one-year term share certificate account in which a 5.00% dividend rate is
paid for the first six months, and 5.50% for the second six months.


(x) Term share account


1. 

Relation to Regulation D.

 Regulation D permits, in limited circumstances, the withdrawal of funds without penalty during the first six days
after a ``time deposit'' is opened. (See 12 CFR  204.2(c)(1)(i).) Withdrawals without penalty from a term share
account made in accordance with Regulation D do not disqualify the account from being a term share account for purposes
of this regulation, such as withdrawals upon the death of the member, or within a ``grace period'' for automatically
renewable term share accounts.
2. 

Club accounts.

 Club accounts, including Christmas club, holiday club, and vacation club accounts may be either term share or regular
share accounts, depending on the terms of the account.


a. Term share club accounts.


i. 

General.

 A club account may be a term share account if it has the following characteristics:



It has a maturity of at least seven days, and
During the first six days a member either
May not make withdrawals, or
If the member is allowed to make early withdrawals during the first six days or there is an early withdrawal penalty
equal to the loss of seven days' dividends.



A club account can be a term share account without a stated maturity date if members may not withdraw funds until a certain
date or if withdrawal occurs, an early withdrawal penalty is incurred.
ii. 

Examples.

 The following are examples of term share club accounts:



An account for which the credit union will distribute the funds on a certain date and withdrawals prior to that date
are either not permitted during the first six days after the account is opened or there is an early withdrawal penalty
equal to the amount of dividends earned on the account during the first seven days (e.g., a credit union offers an account
to which the member makes regular, periodic additions through October, with the funds distributed November 1. If
the member withdraws funds before November 1, an early withdrawal penalty is incurred, making the account a term share
account).
An account for which the credit union will distribute the funds on a certain date and withdrawals are permitted, but
the funds withdrawn are transferred to another account and dividends on the amount withdrawn earn at the second account's
rate, not the club account's rate (e.g., a credit union offers an account earning dividends at a 5.00% rate to which
a member makes regular, periodic additions, funds in the account are distributed November 1. Prior to the November
1 distribution date, the member withdraws funds which are transferred to a regular share account earning dividends
at a 3.00% rate. This rate decrease acts as a penalty, making the account a term share account).





b. Regular share club accounts.

 Accounts may be considered regular share accounts if such accounts do not have an early withdrawal penalty and permit
withdrawals within the first seven days after the account is opened.


(y) Tiered-rate account


1. 

General.

 Tiered-rate accounts are those accounts in which two or more dividend rates are paid on the account and are determined
by reference to a specified balance. Tiered-rate accounts are of two types: Tiering Method A and Tiering Method B.
In Tiering Method A accounts, the credit union pays the applicable tiered dividends rate on the entire amount in the
account. This method is also known as the ``hybrid'' or ``plateau'' tiered-rate account. In Tiering Method B accounts,
the credit union does not pay the applicable tiered dividends rate on the entire amount in the account, but only on the
portion of the share account balance that falls within each specified tier. This method is also known as the ``pure''
or ``split-rate'' tiered-rate account. (See commentary to Appendix A,  I, D.)
2. 

Example.

 An example of a tiered-rate account is one in which a credit union pays a 5.00% dividend rate on balances below $1,000,
and 5.50% on balances $1,000 and above.
3. 

Term share accounts.

 Term share accounts that pay different rates based solely on the amount of the initial share and deposit are not tiered-rate
accounts.
4. 

Minimum balance accounts.

 If dividends are not paid on amounts below a specified balance level, then the account has a minimum balance requirement
(required to be disclosed under  707.4(b)(3)(i)), but the account does not constitute a tiered-rate account.
A zero rate (0%) cannot constitute a tier. Minimum balance accounts are single rate accounts with a minimum balance
requirement.


(z) Variable-rate account


1. 

General.

 Includes all accounts in which the credit union does not contract to give at least 30 days advance written notice of
decreases in the dividend rate. An account meets this definition whether the rate change is determined by reference
to an index, by use of a formula, or merely at the discretion of the credit union's board of directors. A term share certificate
of deposit that permits one or more rate adjustments prior to maturity at the member's option, such as a rate relock
option, is a variable-rate account.
2. 

Differences between fixed-rate and variable-rate accounts.

 All accounts must either be fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts. Classifying an account as variable-rate affects
credit unions three ways:



Additional account disclosures are required ( 707.4(b)(1)(ii));
Rate decreases are exempted from change-in-terms requirements ( 707.5(a)(2)(i)); and
Advertising notice required ( 707.8(c)(1)).



Fixed-rate accounts require a contract term obligating the credit union to a 30-day advance, written notice to members
before decreasing the dividend rate on the account. Term changes and rate decreases cannot take effect until 30 days
after such fixed-rate change in terms notices are mailed or delivered to members ( 707.5(a)).


Section 707.3_General disclosure requirements.
(a) Form


1. 

General.

 All required disclosures, e.g., account disclosures, change-in-terms notices, term share maturity notices, statement
disclosures and advertising disclosures, must be made clearly and conspicuously, in a form the member may retain.
Disclosures need be made only as applicable, e.g., disclosures for a non-dividend-bearing account would not include
disclosure of annual percentage yield, dividend rate, or other disclosures pertaining to dividend calculations.
2. 

Design requirements.

 Disclosures must be presented in a format that allows members and potential members to readily understand the terms
of their account. Disclosures may be made:



In any order
In combination with other disclosures or account terms

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

On more than one page and on the front and reverse sides 

By using inserts to a document or filling in blanks

On more than one document, as long as the documents are provided at the same time.




3. 

Multiple account disclosures.

 Credit unions may prepare combined disclosures for all accounts offered, or prepare different documents for different
types of accounts. If a credit union provides one document for several types of accounts, members must be able to understand
clearly which disclosures apply to their account.

4. 

Consistent terminology.

 A credit union must use the same terminology to describe terms or features that are required to be disclosed. For example,
if a credit union describes a monthly fee (regardless of account activity) as a ``monthly service fee'' in account
opening disclosures, the same terminology must be used in its periodic statements and change-in-terms notices.



 (b) General



1. 

Terms and conditions.

 Credit unions are required to have disclosures reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the credit union
and a member at the time the member opens the account. This provision does not impose any contract terms or supersede
state or other laws that define how the legal obligations between a credit union and its membership are determined.

2. 

Specificity of legal obligation.

 A credit union may use the term ``monthly'' to describe its compounding or crediting policy when dividends are compounded
or paid at the end of each calendar month or for twelve periods during the year even if actual days in each period vary
between 28 and 33 days. Use of estimates is prohibited in TISA disclosures. 

3. 

Foreign language.

 Disclosures may be made in any foreign language, if desired by the board of directors of a credit union. However, disclosures
must also be provided in English, upon request. 



(c) Relation to Regulation E



1. 

General rule.

 Compliance with Regulation E (12 CFR part 205) is deemed to satisfy the disclosure requirements of this regulation,
such as when: 




A credit union changes a term that triggers a notice under Regulation E, and the timing and disclosure rules of Regulation
E are used for sending change-in-terms notices. 

A member adds an ATM access feature to an account, and the credit union provides disclosures pursuant to Regulation
E, including disclosure of fees before the member receives ATM access. (See 12 CFR  205.7.) If the credit union
complies with the timing rules of Regulation E, fees related to electronic services (such as balance inquiry fees
imposed if the inquiry is made at an ATM) that are required to be disclosed by this regulation, but not by Regulation
E, may also be provided at that time. 

A credit union relies on Regulation E's disclosure rules regarding limitations on the frequency and amount of electronic
fund transfers, including security-related exceptions. But any limitation on the number of ``intra-institutional
transfers'' from other accounts at the credit union during a given time period must be disclosed, even though those
transfers are exempt from Regulation E. 



(d) Multiple members




1. 

General.

 When an account has multiple natural person member accountholders, delivery of disclosures to any member accountholder
or agent authorized by the accountholder satisfies the disclosure requirements of part 707. In the case of a joint
account in a credit union, disclosures may be made to a nonmember holding a joint account with a member.

<TEXT>
 

(e) Oral responses to inquiries



1. 

Application of rule. 

Credit unions need not provide rate information orally.

2. 

Relation to advertising. 

An oral response to a question about rates is not covered by the advertising rules.

3. 

Disclosures. 

For dividend-bearing accounts other than term share accounts, a credit union must state either the dividend rate
and annual percentage yield as of the last dividend declaration date, or, if such rate might be inaccurate due to known
or contemplated dividend rate changes, a prospective rate and annual percentage yield determined in good faith by
the board of directors, or, both the past and prospective rates. For interest-bearing accounts and for dividends-bearing
term share accounts, a credit union would specify the interest (dividend) rate and annual percentage yield offered
during the most recent seven calendar days; state that the rate and yield are accurate as of an identified date; and
give a number for members to call for current rate information. These rate disclosures are identical to rate disclosures
made upon request ( 707.4(a)(2)(ii)), in account disclosures ( 707.4(b)(1)(i)), and in advertising
disclosures ( 707.8(c)(2)).



(f) Rounding and accuracy rules for rates and yields

(f)(1) Rounding



1. 

General. 

The annual percentage yield, annual percentage yield earned and dividend rate must be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth
of one percentage point (.01%) when disclosed. For example, if a credit union calculated an annual percentage yield
to be 5.644%, it would be rounded down and shown as 5.64%; 5.645% would be rounded up and disclosed as 5.65%.



(f)(2) Accuracy



1. 

Annual percentage yield and annual percentage yield earned. 

The tolerance for annual percentage yield and annual percentage yield earned calculations is designed to accommodate
inadvertent errors. Credit unions may not purposely incorporate the one-twentieth of one percentage point (.05%)
tolerance into their calculation of yields. 

2. 

Dividend rate. 

There is no tolerance for an inaccuracy in the dividend rate.



Section 707.4_Account disclosures.

(a) Delivery of account disclosures

(a)(1) Account opening



1. 

New accounts. 

New account disclosures must be provided when:




A term share account that does not automatically rollover is renewed by a member

A member changes the term for a renewable term share account (from a one-year term share account to a six-month term
share account, for instance)

Funds in a money market share account are transferred by a credit union to open a new account for the member, such as a
share draft account, because the member exceeded transaction limitations on the money market share account.

A credit union accepts a share deposit from a member to an account the credit union previously deemed to be ``closed''
by the member.




New account disclosures are 

not 

required when:




A credit union acquires an account through an acquisition of or merger with another credit union (but see  707.5(a)
regarding advance notice requirements if terms are changed).

A member opens separate subaccounts (suffix designations) from a main (suffix) account, if the terms of the subaccounts
are identical to that of the main account and disclosures for the main account have already been given to the member.



(a)(2) Requests

(a)(2)(i)



1. 

Inquiries versus requests. 

A response to an oral inquiry (by telephone or in person) about rates and yields or fees does not trigger the duty to provide
account disclosures. However, when a member asks for written information about an account (whether by telephone,
in person, or by other means), the credit union must provide disclosures.

2. 

General requests. 

When a member or potential member generally asks for information about a type of account (a share draft account, for
example), a credit union that offers several variations may provide disclosures for any one of them. No disclosures
need be made to nonmembers, though a credit union may provide disclosures to nonmembers within its sole discretion.

3. 

Timing for response. 

Twenty calendar days is a reasonable time for responding to a request for account information that a member does not
make in person.



(a)(2)(ii)(B)



1. 

Term. 

Describing the maturity of a term share account as ``1 year'' or ``6 months,'' for example, illustrates a response
stating the maturity of a term share account as a term rather than a date (e.g., ``June 1, 1995'').



(b) Content of account disclosures

(b)(1) Rate information

(b)(1)(i) Annual percentage yield and dividend rate




1. 

Rate disclosures. 

In addition to the dividend rate and annual percentage yield, a periodic rate corresponding to the dividend rate may
be disclosed. No other rate or yield (such as ``tax effective yield'') is permitted. If the annual percentage yield
is the same as the dividend rate, credit unions may disclose a single figure but must use both terms.

2. 

Fixed-rate accounts. 

To disclose the period of time the dividend rate will be in effect, credit unions may state the maturity date for fixed-rate
term share accounts that pay the opening rate until maturity. (See Appendix B, B-5_Sample Form.) For other fixed-rate
accounts, credit unions may disclose a date (such as ``This rate will be in effect through June 30, 1994'') or a period
(such as ``This rate will be in effect for at least 30 days'').

3. 

Tiered-rate accounts. 

Each dividend rate, along with the corresponding annual percentage yield for each specified balance level (or range
of annual percentage yields, if appropriate), must be disclosed for tiered-rate accounts. (See Appendix a, Part
I, Paragraph D.)

4. 

Stepped-rate accounts. 

A single annual percentage yield must be disclosed for stepped-rate accounts. (See Appendix A, Part I, Paragraph
B.) However, the dividend rates and the period of time each will be in effect also must be provided. When the initial
rate offered on a variable-rate account is higher or lower than the rate that would otherwise be paid on the account,
the calculation of the annual percentage yield must be made as if for a stepped-rate account. (See Appendix A, Part
I, Paragraph C.)

5. 

Minimum-balance accounts. 

If a credit union sets a minimum balance to earn dividends, the credit union need not state that the annual percentage
yield is 0% for those days the balance in the account drops below the minimum balance level when using the daily balance
method. Nor is a disclosure of 0% required for credit unions using the average daily balance method, if the member fails
to meet the minimum balance required for the average daily balance period.



(b)(1)(ii) Variable rates

(b)(1)(ii)(B)



1. 

Determining dividend rates. 

To disclose how the dividend rate is determined, credit unions must: 




Identify the index and specific margin, if the dividend rate is tied to an index 

State that rate changes are solely within the credit union's discretion, if the credit union does not tie changes to
an index



(b)(1)(ii)(C)



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. 

Frequency of rate changes. 

Credit unions that reserve the right to change rates at any time must state that fact.




(b)(1)(ii)(D)


1. Limitations. 

A floor or ceiling on rates or on the amount the rate may decrease or increase during any time period must be disclosed.
Credit unions need not disclose the absence of limitations on rate changes.




(b)(2) Compounding and crediting
(b)(2)(i) Frequency


1. General. 

Descriptions such as ``quarterly'' or ``monthly'' are sufficient. Irregular crediting and compounding periods,
such as if a cycle is cut short at year end for tax reporting purposes, need not be disclosed.
2. 

Dividend period. 

For dividend-bearing share accounts, the dividend period must be disclosed. A specific example of frequency must
be given. (See Appendix B,  B-1(c).)




(b)(2)(ii) Effect of closing an account


1. Deeming an account closed. 

If permissible under federal and state law, credit unions may provide in account contracts that certain actions by
members will be treated as the member voluntarily closing the account which will result in the forfeiture of accrued
but uncredited dividends, such as when a member withdraws all funds from the account prior to the date dividends are
credited. Credit unions are cautioned that bylaw requirements may prevent a credit union from deeming a member's
account closed until certain time periods are extinguished if funds remain in a member's account. 

NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws, 

Art. III,  3 (members have at least 6 months to replenish membership share before membership terminates and
account is deemed closed). Such bylaw requirements may not be overridden without proper agency approval.




(b)(3) Balance information
(b)(3)(i) Minimum balance requirements


1. Par value. 

Credit unions must disclose any minimum balance required to open the account, to avoid the imposition of a fee, or to
obtain the annual percentage yield. Since members cannot generally maintain any accounts until the par value of the
membership share is paid in full, this section requires that credit unions disclose the par value of a share necessary
to become a member and maintain accounts at the credit union. The par value of a share and the minimum balance requirement
do not have to be the same amount (e.g., a credit union may have a $5 par value for a membership share, in order for accounts
to be opened and maintained, and a $100 minimum balance requirement, in order for the account to earn dividends).
2. 

Disclosures. 

The explanation of minimum balance computation methods may be combined with the balance computation method disclosures
( 707.4(b)(3)(ii)) if they are the same. If a credit union uses different cycles for determining minimum balance
requirements for purposes of assessing fees and for paying dividends, the credit union must disclose the specific
cycle or time period used for each purpose (e.g., use of a midmonth statement cycle for determining dividends, and
use of a calendar month cycle for determining fees). Credit unions may assess fees by using any method. If fees on one
account are tied to the balance in another account, such provision must be explained (e.g., if share draft fees are
tied to a minimum balance in the regular share account (or a combination of the share draft and regular share accounts),
the share draft account must explain that fact and how the balance in the regular share account (or both accounts) is
determined). The fee need not be disclosed in the account disclosures if the fee is not imposed on that account.




(b)(3)(ii) Balance computation method


1. Methods and periods. 

Credit unions may use different methods or periods to calculate minimum balances for purposes of imposing a fee (daily
balance for a calendar month, for example) and accruing dividends (average daily balance for a statement period,
for example). Each method and period must be disclosed




(b)(3)(iii) When dividends begin to accrue


1. Additional information. 

Credit unions may disclose additional information such as the time of day after which share deposits are treated as
having been received the following business day, and may use additional descriptive terms such as ``ledger'' or ``collected''
balances to disclose when dividends or interest begin to accrue. Under the ledger balance method, dividends begin
to accrue on the day of deposit. Under the collected balance method, dividends begin to accrue when provisional credit
is received for the item deposited. Credit unions must include a statement as to when dividends begin to accrue for
noncash deposits.




(b)(4) Fees.


1. Types of fees. 

The following are types of fees that must be disclosed in connection with an account: 



Maintenance fees, such as monthly service fees
Fees related to share deposits or withdrawals, such as fees for use of the credit union's ATMs or nonproprietary ATMs
Fees for special services, such as stop payment fees, fees for balance inquiries or verification of share and deposits,
and fees associated with checks returned unpaid 
Fees to open or to close accounts
Credit unions need not disclose fees such as the following:
Fees assessed for services offered to members and nonmembers alike, such as fees for certain travelers checks, to
process credit card cash advances, or to handle U.S. Savings Bond redemption

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Incidental fees, such as fees associated with state escheat laws, garnishment or attorneys fees, to change names
on an account, to generate a midcycle periodic statement, to wrap loose coins, and fees for photocopying forms 
 


2. 

Amount of fees. 

Credit unions must state the amount and conditions under which a fee may be imposed. Naming and describing the fee typically
satisfies this requirement. Some examples are: 
 


 
 

``$4.00 monthly service fee'' 
 
``$7.00 and up'' or ``fee depends on style of checks ordered'' for check printing fees 
 





3. 

Tied-accounts. 

Credit unions must state if fees that may be assessed against an account are tied to other accounts at the credit union.
For example, if a credit union ties the fees payable on a share draft account to balances held in the share draft account
and in a regular share account, the share draft account disclosures must state that fact and explain now the fee is determined.

 
4. 

Regulation E statements. 

Some fees are required to be disclosed under both Regulation E (12 CFR  205.7) and part 707. If such fees, such
as ATM transaction fees, are disclosed on a Regulation E statement, they need not be disclosed again on a periodic statement
required under part 707. 
 


(b)(5) Transaction limitations 
 


1. 

General rule. 

Examples of limitations on the number or dollar amount of share deposits or withdrawals that credit unions must disclose
are: 
 


 
 

Limits on the number of share drafts or checks that may be written on an account for a given time period 
 
Limits on withdrawals or share deposits during the term of a term share account 
 
Bylaw limitations (e.g., maximum amount of shares which may be held by any one member, 

NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws, 

Art. III,  2, and limitations of withdrawals, 

NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws, 

Art. III,  5(a)) 
 
Limitations required by Regulation D, such as the number of withdrawals permitted from money market share accounts
by check to third parties each month (but they need not disclose that the credit union reserves the right to require
a seven-day notice for a withdrawal from an account). 
 


(b)(6) Features of term share accounts 
 
(b)(6)(i) Time requirements 
 


1. 

``Callable'' term share accounts. 

In addition to the maturity date, credit unions must state the date or the circumstances under which the credit union
may redeem a term share account at the credit union's option (a ``callable'' term share account). 
 


(b)(6)(ii) Early withdrawal penalties 
 


1. 

General. 

The term ``penalty'' need not be used to describe the loss that may be incurred by members for early withdrawal of funds
from term share accounts. 
 
2. 

Examples. 

Examples of early withdrawal penalties are: 
 


 
 

Monetary penalties, such as ``$10.00'' or ``seven days' dividends plus accrued but uncredited dividends'' 
 
Adverse changes to terms such as the dividend rate, annual percentage yield, or compounding frequency for funds remaining
in shares or on deposit 
 
Reclamation of bonuses 
 


 
 

3. 

Relation to rules for IRAs or similar plans. 

Penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Code for certain withdrawals from IRAs or similar pension or savings plans
are not early withdrawal penalties. 
 


(b)(6)(iv) Renewal policies 
 


1. 

Rollover term share accounts. 

Credit unions are not required to provide a grace period, to pay dividends during the grace period, or to disclose whether
or not dividends will be paid during the grace period. Credit unions offering a grace period must give the length of
the grace period. Commentary, Appendix B, Model Clauses,  B-1(i)(iv). 
 
2. 

Nonrollover term share accounts. 

Credit unions that pay dividends on funds following the maturity of term share accounts that do not renew automatically
need not state the rate (or annual percentage yield) that may be paid. Term share club accounts will generally have
a specific maturity data and be nonrollover. 
 


(b)(7) Bonuses 
 


1. 

General. 

Credit unions are required to state the amount and type of bonus, and disclose any minimum balance or time requirement
to obtain the bonus and when the bonus will be provided. If the minimum balance or time requirement is otherwise required
to be disclosed, credit unions need not duplicate the disclosure for purposes of this paragraph. 
 


(b)(8) Nature of dividends 
 


1. 

General. 

Dividends are not payable until declared and unless sufficient current and undivided earnings are available after
required transfers to reserves at the close of a dividend period. A disclosure explaining dividends educates members
and protects credit unions in the event that a prospective dividend cannot be paid, or is not properly payable. This
disclosure is required for all dividend-bearing share accounts except term share accounts. 
 
2. 

State-chartered credit unions with interest-bearing deposit accounts. 

If a member of a state-chartered credit union is opening only an interest-bearing deposit account, or is requesting
account disclosures only for an interest-bearing deposit account, the disclosures must generally include the following
information on any dividend-bearing share portion of the account (e.g., membership share): the par value of a share;
a statement that the portion of the deposit that represents the par value of the membership share will earn dividends
and that dividends are paid from current income and available earnings after required transfers to reserves. Further
additional disclosures, such as a separate dividend rate and annual percentage yield for the membership share, are
not required (as they would agree with the remainder of the account, invested in an interest-bearing deposit). 
 


(c) Notice to existing accountholders 
 


1. 

General. 

Only members who receive periodic statements (provided regularly at least four times per year) and who hold accounts
of the type offered by the credit union as of the compliance date of part 707 (generally January 1, 1995) must receive
the notice. If following receipt of the notice members request disclosures, credit unions have twenty calendar days
from receipt of the request to provide the disclosures. Rate and annual percentage yield information in such disclosures
must conform to that required for disclosures upon request As an alternative to including the notice in or on the periodic
statement, the final rule permits credit unions to send the account disclosures themselves, as long as they are sent
at the same time as the periodic statement (the disclosures may be mailed either with the periodic statement or separately).

 
2. 

Form of the notice. 

The notice may be included on the periodic statement, in a member newsletter, or on a statement stuffer or other insert,
if it is clear and conspicuous and it is sent with the first periodic statement after the compliance date of part 707.
The notice cannot be sent in a separate mailing from the periodic statement. 
 
3. 

Timing. 

The notice may accompany the first periodic statement after the compliance date for part 707, or the periodic statement
for the first cycle beginning after that date. For example, a credit union's statement cycle is December 15, 1994_January
14, 1995. The statement is mailed on January 15. The next cycle is January 15, 1995 through February 14, 1995, and the
statement for that cycle is mailed on February 15. The credit union may provide the notice either on or with the January
15 statement or on or with the February 15 statement, as it covers the first cycle after January 1, 1995.

4. 

Early compliance. 

Credit unions that provide the notice of existing members prior to the compliance date of part 707, must be prepared
to provide accurate and timely disclosures when, following receipt of the notice, members ask for account disclosures.
Such disclosures must be provided even if they are requested before the compliance date of part 707. Credit unions
who provide early notice to existing members need to comply with all other aspects of part 707.


Section 707.5_Subsequent disclosures.
(a) Change in terms
(a)(1) Advance notice required


1. 

Form of notice. 

Credit unions may provide a change-in-term notice on or with a regular periodic statement or in another mailing. If
a credit union provides notice through revised account disclosures, the changed term must be highlighted in some
manner. For example, credit unions may state that a particular fee has been changed (also specifying the new amount)
or use an accompanying letter that refers to the changed term.
2. 

Effective date. 

An example of a disclosure that complies is:




Effective as of May 11, 1995''




3. 

Terms that change upon the occurrence of an event. 

Credit unions that offer terms such as a fee waiver for employee account holders during their employment or for students
enrolled at a local university need not send advance notice of a change resulting from termination of employment or
enrollment if:




The account-opening disclosures given (to the employee, for example) describe the term and the event that would cause
the term to change (such as the member's leaving the credit union's employment), and
Notices are sent when the term is changed for other account holders, even though the term remains unchanged for the
member while employment or enrollment continues.


(a)(2) No notice required
(a)(2)(ii) Check printing fees


1. 

Increase in fees. 

A notice is not required even if an increase in check printing fees includes an amount added by the credit union to the
price charged by a vendor.


(b) Notice before maturity for term share accounts longer than one month that renew automatically


1. 

Maturity dates on nonbusiness days. 

For determining the term, credit unions may ignore the fact that the disclosed maturity falls on a nonbusiness day
and the term is extended beyond the disclosed number of days. For example, a holiday or weekend may cause a ``one-year''
term share account to extend beyond 365 days (or 366, in a leap year), or a ``one-month'' term share account to extend
beyond 31 days.
2. 

Disclosing when rates will be determined. 

Disclosures that illustrate when the annual percentage yield will be available include:




A specific date, such as ``October 28''
A date that is easily discernible, such as ``the Tuesday prior to the maturity date stated on the notice`' or ``as of
the maturity date stated on this notice''



Credit unions must indicate when the rate will be available if the date falls on a nonbusiness day.
3. 

Alternative timing rule. 

To illustrate the alternative timing rule: a credit union that offers a 10-day grace period must provide the disclosures
at least 10 calendar days prior to the scheduled maturity date.
4. 

Club accounts. 

Club accounts that are term share accounts are covered by this paragraph, even though funds may be withdrawn at the
end of the current club period. For example, if the member has agreed to the transfer of payments from another account
to the term share account for the next club period, the credit union must comply with the requirements for automatically
renewable term share accounts.
5. 

Renewal of a term share account. 

The following applies to a change in a term that becomes effective if a rollover term share account is subsequently
renewed.




If the change is initiated by the credit union, the disclosure requirements of this paragraph. (Paragraph 5(a) applies
if the change becomes effective prior to the maturity of the existing term share account.)
If initiated by the member, the account-opening disclosure requirements of  707.4(b). (If the notice required
by this paragraph has been provided, credit unions may give new account disclosures or disclosures that reflect the
new term.)



For example, if a member who receives a prematurity notice on a one-year term share account requests a rollover to a
six-month account, the credit union must provide either account-opening disclosures that reflect the new maturity
date or, if all other terms previously disclosed in the prematurity notice remain the same, only the new maturity date.


(b)(1) Maturities of longer than one year


1. 

Highlighting changed terms. 

Credit unions need not highlight terms that have changed since the last account disclosures were provided.


(c) Notice for term share accounts one month or less that renew automatically


1. 

Providing disclosures within a reasonable time. 

Generally, 20 calendar days after an account renews is a reasonable time for providing disclosures. For term share
accounts shorter than 20 days, disclosures should be given prior to the next scheduled renewal date.


(d) Notice before maturity for term share accounts longer than one year that do not renew automatically


1. 

Subsequent account. 

When funds are transferred following maturity of a nonrollover term share account, credit unions need not provide
account disclosures unless a new account is established.

Section 707.6_Periodic statement disclosures.
(a) Rule When Statement and Crediting Periods Vary


1. 

General. 

Credit unions are not required to provide periodic statements. If they provide periodic statements, disclosures
need only be furnished to the extent applicable. For example, if no dividends are earned for a statement period, credit
unions need not disclose ``$0'' dividends earned and ``0%'' annual percentage yield earned.
2. 

Regulation E interim statements.

 When a credit union provides regular quarterly statements, and in addition provides a monthly interim statement
to comply with Regulation E, the interim statement need not comply with this section unless it states dividend or rate
information. (See 12 CFR  205.9.)
3. 

Combined statements. 

Credit unions may provide certain information about an account (such as a money market share account or regular share
account) on the periodic statement for another account (such as a share draft account) without triggering the disclosures
required by this section, as long as:




The information is limited to the account number, the type of account, or balance information, and
The credit union also provides members a periodic statement that complies with this section for the account (the money
market share account or regular share account, in the example).



4. 

Other information. 

Credit unions may include additional information on or with a periodic statement, such as:



Dividend rates and periodic rates corresponding to the dividend rate applied to balances during the statement period.
The dollar amount of dividends earned year-to-date.
Bonuses paid (or any 

de minimis

 consideration of $10 or less).
Fees for other products, such as safe deposit boxes.




5. 

When statement and crediting periods vary. 

This rule permits credit union, on dividend_bearing share accounts, to report the annual percentage yield earned
and the amount of dividends earned on a statement other than on each periodic statement when the dividend period does
not agree with, varies from, or is different than, the statement period. For dividend-bearing share accounts, credit
unions may disclose the required information either upon each periodic statement, or on the statement on which dividends
are actually earned (credited or posted) to the member's account. In addition, for accounts using the average daily
balance method of calculating dividends, when the average daily balance period and the statement periods do not agree,
vary or are different, credit unions may also report annual percentage yield earned and the dollar amount of dividends
earned on the periodic statement on which the dividends or interest is earned. For example, if a credit union has quarterly
dividend periods, or uses a quarterly average daily balance on an account, the first two monthly statements may not
state annual percentage yield earned and dividends earned figures; the third ``monthly'' statement will reflect
the dividends earned and the annual percentage yield earned for the entire quarter. The fees imposed disclosure must
be given on the periodic statement on which they are imposed.
6. 

Length of the period. 

Credit unions must disclose the length of both the dividend period (or average daily balance calculation period)
and the statement period. For example, a statement could disclose a statement period of April 16 through May 15 and
further state that ``the dividends earned and the annual percentage yield earned are based on your dividend period
(or average daily balance) for the period April 1 through April 30.''
7. 

Quarterly statements and monthly compounding. 

Credit unions that use the average daily balance method to calculate dividends on a monthly basis, but send statements
on a quarterly basis, may disclose a single dividend (and annual percentage yield earned) figure. Alternately, a
credit union may disclose three dividends earned and three annual percentage earned figures, one for each month in
the quarter, as long as the credit union states the number of days (or beginning and ending date) in each dividend period
if it varies from the statement period.
8. 

Additional voluntary disclosures. 

For credit unions not disclosing the annual percentage yield earned and dividends earned on all periodic statements,
credit unions may place a notice on statements without dividends and annual percentage yield earned figures, that
the annual percentage yield earned and dollar amount of dividends earned will appear on the first statement at the
close of the dividend (or average daily balance) period, or similar wording. Credit unions may also choose to include
a telephone number to call for interim information, if desired by a member.


(b) Statement Disclosures
(b)(1) Annual percentage yield earned


1. 

Ledger and collected balances. 

The method used by a credit union to accrue or pay dividends on noncash deposits must be the same method used to determine
the annual percentage yield earned.


(b)(2) Amount of dividends or interest


1. 

Definition of earned. 

The term ``earned'' is defined to include dividends and interest either ``accrued'' or ``paid and credited.'' Credit
unions may use either the ``ledger'' or the ``collected'' balance for either option. (See commentary to  707.2(t).)
2. 

Terminology. 

In disclosing dividends earned for the period, credit unions must use the term ``dividends'' or terminology such
as:



``Dividends paid,'' to describe dividends that have been credited 
``Dividends accrued'' or ``dividends earned,'' to indicate that dividends are not yet credited.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. 

Closed accounts.

 If a member closes an account between crediting periods and forfeits accrued dividends, the credit union may not show
any figures for ``dividends earned'' or annual percentage yield earned for the period.
4. 

Extraordinary dividends.

 Extraordinary dividends are not a component of the annual percentage yield earned or the dividend rate, but are an
addition to the member's account. Only the dollar amount of the extraordinary dividends paid, denoted as a separate,
identified figure, can be disclosed on the periodic statement on which the extraordinary dividends are earned.


(b)(3) Fees imposed


1. 

General.

 Periodic statements must state fees debited to the account during the statement period even if assessed for an earlier
period.
2. 

Itemizing fees by type.

 In itemizing fees by type, credit unions may group together fees of the same type that are imposed more than once in the
period. If fees are grouped, the description must make clear that the dollar figure represents more than a single fee,
for example, ``total fees for checks written this period.''
Examples of fees that may 

not

 be grouped together are:



Monthly maintenance and excess activity fees
``Transfer'' fees, if different dollar amounts are imposed_such as $.50 for share deposits and $1.00 for withdrawals
Fees for electronic fund transfers and fees for other services, such as balance inquiry or maintenance fees (unless
permitted by Regulation E)



3. 

Identifying fees.

 Statement details must enable the member to identify the specific fee. For example:



Credit unions may use a code to identify a particular fee if the code is explained on the periodic statement or in documents
accompanying the statement.
Credit unions using debit slips may disclose the date the fee was debited on the periodic statement and show the amount
and type of fee on the dated debit slip.



4. 

Relation to Regulation E.

 Compliance with Regulation E complies with this section for the disclosure of fees related to electronic fund transfers
on periodic statements (for example, totaling all electronic funds transfer fees in a single figure).


(b)(4) Length of period


1. 

General. 

Credit unions that provide the beginning and ending dates of the period must make clear whether both dates are included
in the period. For example, stating ``April 1 through April 30'' would clearly indicate that both April 1 and April
30 are included in the period.
2. 

Opening or closing an account mid-cycle.

 If an account is opened or closed during the period for which a statement is sent, credit unions must calculate the annual
percentage yield earned based on account balances for each day the account was open.


Section 707.7_Payment of dividends.
(a) Permissible methods


1. 

Prohibited calculation methods.

 Calculation methods that do not comply with the requirement to pay dividends on the full amount of principal in the
account each day include:



The ``rollback'' method, also known as the ``grace period'' or ``in by the 10th'' method, where credit unions pay dividends
on the lowest balance in the account for the period 
The ``increments of par value'' method, where credit unions only pay dividends on full shares in an account, e.g.,
a credit union with $5 par value shares pays dividends on $20 of a $24 account balance
The ``ending balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on the balance in the account at the end of the period

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The ``investable balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on a percentage of the balance, excluding an
amount credit unions set aside for reserve requirements




2. 

Use of 365-day basis. 

Credit unions may apply a daily periodic rate that is greater than 1/365 of the dividend rate_such as 1/360 of the dividend
rate_as long as it is applied 365 days a year.

3. 

Periodic dividend payments. 

A credit union can pay dividends each day on the account and still make uniform dividend payments. For example, for
a one-year term, term share certificate account, a credit union could make monthly dividend payments that are equal
to 1/12 of the amount of dividends that will be earned for a 365-day period, or 11 uniform monthly payments and a final
payment that accounts for the total dividends earned for the period.

4. 

Leap year. 

Credit unions may apply a daily rate of 1/366 or 1/365 of the dividend rate for 366 days in a leap year, if the account will
earn dividends for February 29.

5. 

Maturity of term share accounts. 

Credit unions are not required to pay dividends after term share accounts mature, such as:




During any grace period offered by a credit union for an automatically renewable term share account, if the member
decides during that period not to renew the account 

Following the maturity of nonrollover term share accounts

When the maturity date falls on a holiday, and the member must wait until the next business day to obtain the funds




6. 

Dormant accounts. 

Credit unions may contract with a member not to pay dividends if the account becomes ``dormant,'' as defined by applicable
state or other law.

7. 

Insufficient funds. 

Credit unions are not required to pay dividends on checks or share drafts deposited to a member's account that are returned
for insufficient funds. If a credit union accrues dividends on a check that it later determines is not good, it may deduct
from the accrued dividends any dividends attributed to the proceeds of the returned check. If dividends have already
been credited before the credit union determines the item has insufficient funds, the credit union may deduct the
amount of the check and associated dividends from the account balance. The dividend deduction should 

not 

be included in the dividend amount and annual percentage yield earned that is reported for the next period.

8. 

Account drawn below par value of a share. 

If a member draws his or her account below the par value of a share, dividends would continue to accrue on the account.
However, under the 

NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws,

 if a member who reduces his or her share balance below the value of a par value share and does not increase the balance
within at least six months, the credit union may terminate the member's membership. State-chartered credit unions
may have similar termination provisions.



(a)(2) Determination of minimum balance to earn dividends



1. 

General. 

Credit unions may set minimum balance requirements that must be met in order to earn dividends. However, credit unions
must use the same method to determine a minimum balance required to earn dividends as they use to determine the balance
upon which dividends will accrue. For example, a credit union that calculates dividends on the daily balance method
must use the daily balance method to determine if the minimum balance to earn dividends has been met. Similarly, a credit
union that calculates dividends on the average daily balance method must use the average daily balance method to determine
if the minimum to earn dividends has been met. Credit unions may have a par value of a share that is different from the
minimum balance requirement to earn dividends (See commentary to  707.4(b)(3)(i).)

2. 

Daily balance accounts. 

Credit unions that use the daily balance method to calculate dividends and require a minimum balance to earn dividends
may choose not to pay dividends for days when the balance drops below the required daily minimum balance. For example,
a credit union could set a minimum daily balance level of $200 and pay dividends only those days the $200 daily balance
is maintained.

3. 

Average daily balance accounts. 

Credit unions that use the average daily balance method to calculate dividends and require a minimum balance to earn
dividends may choose not to pay dividends for the average daily balance calculation period in which the average daily
balance does not meet the required minimum. For example, a credit union could set a minimum average daily balance level
of $200 and pay dividends only if the $200 average daily balance is met for the calculation period.

4. 

Beneficial method. 

Credit unions may not require members to maintain both a minimum daily balance and a minimum average daily balance
to earn dividends, such as by requiring the member to maintain a $500 daily balance and an average daily balance that
is higher or lower. But a credit union could determine the minimum balance to earn dividends by using a method that is
``unequivocally beneficial'' to the member such as the following:




A credit union using the daily balance method to calculate dividends and requiring a $500 minimum daily balance could
choose to pay dividends on the account (for those days the minimum balance is not met) as long as the member maintained
an average daily balance throughout the month of $400.

A credit union using the average daily balance method to calculate dividends and requiring a $400 minimum average
daily balance could choose to pay dividends on the account as long as the member maintained a daily balance of $500 for
at least half of the days in the period.

A credit union using either the daily balance method or average daily balance method to calculate dividends that requires
either of the following, but not both, $500 daily balance or a $400 average daily balance to pay dividends on the account.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

5. 

Paying on full balance. 

Credit unions must pay dividends on the full balance in the account once a member has met the required minimum balance.
For example, if a credit union sets $300 as is minimum daily balance requirement to earn dividends, and a member share
and deposits $500, the credit union must pay the stated dividend rate on the full $500 and not just on $200.


6. 

Negative balances prohibited. 

Credit unions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine:




The daily or average daily balance on which dividends will be paid
Whether any minimum balance to earn dividends is met





(See commentary to Appendix A, Part II, which prohibits credit unions from using negative balances in calculating
the dividends figure for the annual percentage yield earned.)




7. 

Club accounts. 

Credit unions offering club accounts (such as ``holiday'' or ``vacation'' club accounts) cannot impose a minimum
balance that is based on the total number or dollar amount of payments required under the club plan. For example, if
a plan calls for $10 weekly payments for 50 weeks, the credit union cannot set a $500 minimum balance and then pay only
if the member makes all 50 payments.


8. 

Minimum balances not affecting dividends. 

Credit unions may use the daily balance, average daily balance, or other computation method to calculate minimum
balance requirements not involving the payment of dividends_such as to compute minimum balances for assessing fees.



(b) Compounding and crediting policies




1. 

General. 

Credit unions that choose to compound dividends may compound or credit dividends annually, semi-annually, quarterly,
monthly, daily, continuously, or on any other basis.


2. 

Withdrawals prior to crediting date. 

If members withdraw funds, without closing the account, prior to a scheduled crediting date, credit unions may delay
paying the accrued dividends on the withdrawn amount until the scheduled crediting date, but may not avoid paying
dividends.


3. 

Closed accounts. 

If members close accounts prior to the date dividends are credited, credit unions may choose not to pay accrued dividends
as long as they have previously disclosed that fact to the member. If accrued dividends are paid, accrued dividends
must be paid on funds up until the account is closed or the account is deemed closed. For example, if an account is closed
on a Tuesday, accrued dividends on the funds through Monday would be paid. Whether (and the conditions under which)
credit unions are permitted to deem an account closed by a member is determined by state or other law, if any. Credit
unions are cautioned that bylaw requirements may prevent a credit union from deeming a member's account closed until
certain time periods are extinguished. (See 

NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws, 

Art. III,  3 (members have at least 6 months to replenish membership share before membership can terminate and
the account is deemed closed). Such bylaw requirements may not be overridden without proper agency approval.


4. 

Dormant account. 

Subject to state or other law defining when an account becomes dormant, a credit union may contract with a member not
to pay accrued, but uncredited, dividends if the account becomes dormant prior to the regular dividend crediting
date.



(c) Date dividends begin to accrue


1. 

Relation to Regulation CC. 

Credit unions may rely on the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) and regulation CC (12 CFR part 229) to determine,
for example, when a share is considered made for purposes of dividend accrual, or when dividends need not be paid on
funds because a deposited check is later returned unpaid.


2. 

Ledger and collected balances. 

Credit unions may calculate dividends by using a ``ledger'' balance or ``collected'' balance method, as long as the
crediting requirements of the EFAA are met.


3. 

Withdrawal of principal. 

Credit unions must accrue dividends on funds until the funds are withdrawn from the account. For example, if a check
is debited to an account on a Tuesday, the credit union must accrue dividends on those funds through Monday.



Section 707.8_Advertising.

(a) Misleading or inaccurate advertisements




1. 

General. 

All advertisements must comply with the rule against misleading or inaccurate advertisements, even though the disclosures
applicable to various media differ. The word ``profit'' may be used when referring to dividend-bearing share accounts,
as it reflects the nature of dividends. The word ``profit'' may not be used when referring to interest-bearing deposit
accounts.


2. 

Indoor signs. 

An indoor sign advertising an annual percentage yield is not misleading or inaccurate if:




For a tiered-rate account, it also provides the upper and lower dollar amounts of the advertised tier corresponding
to the annual percentage yield

For a term, share account, it also provides the term required to obtain the advertised yield






3. 

``Free'' or ``no cost'' accounts. 

For purposes of determining whether an account can be advertised as ``free'' or ``no cost,'' maintenance and activity
fees include:





Any fee imposed if a minimum balance requirement is not met, or if the member exceeds a specified number of transactions

Transaction and service fees that members reasonably expect to be regularly imposed on an account



Examples of maintenance and activity fees include:





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A flat fee, such as a monthly service fee

Fees imposed to share and deposit, withdraw or transfer funds, including per-check or per-transaction charges (for
example, $.25 for each withdrawal, whether by check, in person or at an ATM owned by the credit union)




Examples of fees that are 

not 

maintenance or activity fees include:




Fees that are not required to be disclosed under  707.4(b)(4)

Check printing fees of any type

Fees for obtaining copies of checks, whether or not the original checks have been truncated or returned to the member
periodically

Balance inquiry fees

Fees assessed against a dormant account

Fees for using an ATM not owned by the account-issuing credit union

Fees for electronic transfer services that are not required to obtain an account, such as preauthorized transfers
or home electronic credit union services

Stop payment fees and fees for returned share draft or checks




4. 

Similar terms. 

An advertisement may not use a term such as ``fees waived'' if a maintenance or activity fee may be imposed because it
is similar to the terms ``free'' or ``no cost.''

5. 

Specific account services. 

Credit unions may advertise a specific account service or feature as free as long as no fee is imposed for that service
or feature. For example, credit unions that provide free access to their ATMs could advertise that fact.

6. 

Free for limited time. 

If an account or a specific account service is free only for a limited period of time_for example, for one year following
the account opening_the account or service may be advertised as free as long as the time period is stated.

7. 

Conditions not related to share accounts. 

Credit unions may advertise accounts as ``free'' for members that meet conditions not related to share accounts such
as age. For example, credit unions may advertise a share draft aaccount as ``free for persons over 65 years old,'' even
though a maintenance or activity fee may be assessed on accounts held by members that are 65 or younger.



(b) Permissible rates



1. 

Tiered-rate accounts. 

An advertisement for a tiered-rate account that states an annual percentage yield must also state the annual percentage
yield for each tier, along with corresponding minimum balance requirements. Any dividend rates stated must appear
in conjunction with the annual percentage yields for the applicable tier.

2. 

Stepped-rate accounts. 

An advertisement that states a dividend rate for a stepped-rate account must state each dividend rate and the time
period each rate is in effect.

3 

Representative examples. 

An advertisement that states an annual percentage yeild for a type of account (such as a term share account) need not
state the annual percentage yield applicable to every variation offered by the credit union. For example, if rates
vary depending on the amount of the initial share and deposit and term of a term share account, credit unions need not
list each balance level and term offered. Instead, the advertisement may:




Provide a representative example of the annual percentage yields offered, clearly described as such. For example,
if a credit union offers a $25 bonus on all term share accounts and the annual percentage yield will vary depending of
the term selected, the credit union may provide a disclosure of the annual percentage yield as follows: ``For example,
our 6-month term share certificate of deposit currently pays a 3.15% annual percentage yield.''

Indicate that various rates are available, such as by stating short-term and longer-term maturities along with the
applicable annual percentage yields that depend on the maturity you choose. For example, our one-month CD earns a
2.75% APY. Or, earns a 5.25 APY for a three-year CD.''



(c) When additional disclosures are required



1. 

Trigger terms. 

Disclosures are triggered by statements such as ``We will pay a bonus of 1% over our current rate for one-year term share
certificates of deposit opened before April 15, 1995.'' The following are examples of information stated in advertisements
that are not ``trigger'' terms:




``One, three, and five year CDs available''

``Bonus rates available''



(c)(2) Time annual percentage yield is offered



1. 

Specified recent date. 

If an advertisement discloses an annual percentage yield as of a specified date, that date must be recent in relation
to the publication or broadcast frequency of the media used. For example, the printing date of a brochure printed once
for an account promotion that will be in effect for six months would be considered ``recent,'' even though rates change
during the six-month period. Interest rates published in a daily newspaper or on television must be a rate offered
shortly before (or on) the date the rates are published or broadcast. Similarly, dividend rates published in a daily
newspaper or on television must be a rate reflecting either the preceding dividend period, or a prospective rate,
and the option chosen should be noted.



(c)(5) Effect of fees



1. 

Scope. 

This requirement applies only to maintenance or activity fees as described in paragraph 8(a).



(c)(6) Features of term share accounts

(c)(6)(i) Time requirements



1. 

Club accounts. 

If the maturity date of a club account is set but the term may vary depending on when the account is opened, credit unions
may use a phrase such as:




``The term of the account varies depending on when the account is opened. However, the maturity date is November 15.''



(c)(6)(ii) Early withdrawal penalties



1. 

Discretionary penalties. 

Credit unions that impose early withdrawal penalties on a case-by-case basis my disclose that they ``may'' (rather
than ``will'') impose a penalty if that accurately describes the account terms.



(d) Bonuses



1. 

General reference to ``bonus.'' 

General statements such as ``bonus checking'' or ``get a bonus when you open a checking account'' do not trigger the
bonus disclosures.



(e) Exemption for certain advertisements

(e)(1) Certain media



(e)(1)(iii)



1. 

Tiered-rate accounts. 

Solicitations for tiered-rate accounts made through telephone response machines must provide all annual percentage
yields and the balance requirements applicable to each tier.



(e)(2) Indoor signs

(e)(2)(i)



1. 

General. 

Indoor signs include advertisements displayed on computer screens, banners, preprinted posters, and chalk or peg
boards. Any advertisement inside the premises that can be retained by a member (such as a brochure or a printout from
a computer) is not an indoor sign.

2. 

Members outside the premises. 

Advertisements may be ``indoor signs'' even though they may be viewed by members from outside. An example is a banner
in a credit union's glass-enclosed branch office, that is located behind a teller facing customers but also may be
seen by passersby.



(e)(3) Newsletters



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00028 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. 

General.

 The partial exemption applies to all credit union newsletters, whether instituted before or after the compliance
date of part 707. Nor must a newsletter be of any particular circulation frequency (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly,
biannually, annually, or irregularly) or of any certain format (e.g. magazine, bulletin, broadside, circular,
mimeograph, letter, or pamphlet) in order to be eligible for the partial advertising exemption.
2. 

Distribution.

 In order for newsletters to retain the partial advertising exemption, newsletters can be sent to existing credit
union members only. Any distribution reasonably calculated to reach only members is also acceptable, such as 




Mailing newsletters to existing members
Distributing newsletters at a function reasonably limited to members, such as an annual meeting or member picnic
Displaying or offering newsletters at a credit union lobby, branch, or office. Distributing a newsletter in a place
open to nonmembers, such as a sponsor's lunch room, is not reasonably calculated to reach only members, and such newsletter
would be subject to all applicable advertising rules.


Section 707.9_Enforcement and record retention.
(c) Record retention


1. 

Evidence of required actions.

 Credit unions comply with the regulation by demonstrating they have done the following:



Established and maintained procedures for paying dividends and providing timely disclosures as required by the
regulation, and
Retained sample disclosures for each type account offered to members, such as account-opening disclosures, copies
of advertisements, and change-in-term notices; and information regarding the dividend rates and annual percentage
yields offered.




2. 

Methods of retaining evidence.

 Credit unions must retain information needed to reconstruct the required disclosures or other actions. They need
not keep disclosures or other business records in hard copy. Records evidencing compliance may be retained on microfilm,
microfiche, or by other methods that reproduce records accurately (including computer files). Credit unions must
retain copies of all printed advertisements and the text of all advertisements conveyed by electronic or broadcast
media, and newsletters.
3. 

Payment of dividends.

 Sufficient rate and balance information must be retained to permit the verification of dividends paid on an account,
including the payment of dividends on the full principal balance.


Appendix A to Part 707_Annual Percentage Yield Calculation


Part I. Annual percentage yield for account disclosures and advertising purposes.


1. 

Rounding for calculations.

 The following are examples of permissible rounding rules for calculating dividends and the annual percentage yield:




The daily rate applied to a balance rounded to five or more decimals. For example; .008219178%, 3.00% for a 365 day year,
would be rounded to no less than .00822%.

The daily dividends or interest earned rounded to five or more decimals. For example; $.08219178082, daily dividends
on $1,000 at 3% for a 365 day year, would be rounded to no less than $.08219.




2. 

Exponent numerator in a leap year.

 The annual percentage yield formula's exponent numerator will remain 365 in leap years.
3. 

First tier of a tiered rate account.

 The first tier of a tiered rate account is to be disclosed and advertised; ``Up to but not exceeding . . .'',
``$.01 to . . .'', or similar language.


Part II. Annual percentage yield earned for periodic statements.


1. 

Balance method.

 The dividend or interest figure used in the calculation of the annual percentage yield earned may be derived from the
daily balance method or the average daily balance method. The balance used in the annual percentage yield earned formula
is the sum of the balances for each day in the period divided by the number of days in the period. The balance for each day
is based on a point in time; i.e. beginning of day balance, end of day balance, closing of day balance, etc. Each day's
balance must be based on the same point in time and cannot be based on the day's low balance.
2. 

Collected balance method.

 Credit unions that accrue or pay dividends on noncash deposits using the collected balance method must disclose collected
balance information on the periodic statement in order that the member may calculate the dividend amount and annual
percentage yield earned (e.g., each day's collected balance when the daily balance method is used and the average
daily balance when the average daily balance is used).
3. 

Negative balances prohibited.

 Credit unions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine the balance on which the annual percentage
yield earned is calculated. (See commentary to  707.7(a)(2).)


A. General formula.


1. 

Accrued but uncredited dividends.

 To calculate the annual percentage yield earned, accrued but uncredited dividends:




Shall not be included in the balance for statements that are issued at the same time or less frequently than the account's
compounding and crediting frequency. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds dividends
daily and credits dividends monthly, the balance may not be increased each day to reflect the effect of daily compounding.
Assume a credit union will pay $13.70 in dividends on $100,000 for the first day, $6.85 in dividends on $50,013.70 for
the second day, and $3.43 in dividends on $25,020.55 for the third day. The sum of each days balance is $175,000 (does
not include accrued, but uncredited, dividends amounts $13.70, $6.85, and $3.43), thereby resulting in an average
daily balance for the three days of $58,333.33.
Shall be included in the balance for succeeding statements if a statement is issued more frequently than compounded
dividends is credited on an account. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds dividends
daily and credits dividends quarterly, the balance for the second monthly statement would include dividends that
had accrued for the prior month. Assume a credit union will pay $411.78 in dividends on 30 days of $100,000, $427.28
in dividends on 31 days of $100,411.78, and $415.23 in dividends on 30 days of $100,839.06. The balance (average daily
balance in the account for the period) for the second 31 days is $100,411.78.




2. 

Rounding.

 The dividends earned figure used to calculate the annual percentage yield earned must be rounded to two decimals to
reflect the amount actually paid. For example, if the dividends earned for a statement period is $20.074 and the credit
union pays the member $20.07, the credit union must use $20.07 (not $20.074) to calculate the annual percentage yield
earned. For accounts that pay dividends based on the daily balance method, compound and credit dividends or interest
quarterly, and send monthly statements, the credit union may, but need not, round accrued dividends to two decimals
for calculating the ``projected'' or ``anticipated'' annual percentage yield earned on the first two monthly statements
issued during the quarter. However, on the quarterly statement the dividends earned figure must reflect the amount
actually paid.
3. 

Compounding frequency using the average daily balance method.

 Any compounding frequency, including daily compounding, can be used when calculating dividends using the average
daily balance method. (See comment 707.7(b), which does not require credit unions to compound or credit dividends
at any particular frequency).

<TEXT>
 

B. Special formula for use where periodic statement is sent more often than the period for which dividends are compounded.



1. 

Statements triggered by Regulation E.

 Credit unions may, but need not, use this formula to calculate the annual percentage yield earned for accounts that
receive quarterly statements and that are subject to Regulation E's rule calling for monthly statements when an electronic
fund transfer has occurred. They may do so even though no monthly statement was issued during a specific quarter. This
formula must be used for accounts that compound and credit dividends quarterly and that receive monthly statements,
triggered by Regulation E, which comply with the provisions of  707.6.

2. 

Days in compounding period.

 Credit unions using the special annual percentage yield earned formula must use the actual number of days in the compounding
period.



Appendix B to Part 707_Model Clauses and Sample Forms



1. 

Modifications.

 Credit unions that modify the model clauses will be deemed in compliance as long as they do not delete information required
by TISA or regulation or rearrange the format so as to affect the substance or clarity of the disclosures.

2. 

Format.

 Credit unions may use inserts to a document (see Sample Form B-11) or fill-in blanks (see Sample Forms B-4
and B-5, which use double underlining to indicate terms that have been filled in) to show current rates, fees
or other terms.

3. 

Disclosures for opening accounts.

 The sample forms illustrate the information that must be provided to a member when an account is opened, as required
by  707.4(a)(1). (See  707.4(a)(2), which states the requirements for disclosing the annual percentage
yield, the dividend rate, and the maturity of a term share account in responding to a member's request.) 

4. 

Compliance with Regulation E.

 Credit unions may satisfy certain requirements under Part 707 with disclosures that meet the requirements of Regulation
E. (See  707.3(c).) The model clauses and sample forms do not give examples of disclosures that would be covered
by both this regulation and Regulation E (such as disclosing the amount of a fee for ATM usage). Credit unions should
consult appendix A to Regulation E for appropriate Regulation E model clauses.

5. 

Duplicate disclosures.

 If a requirement such as a minimum balance applies to more than one account term (to obtain a bonus and determine the
annual percentage yield, for example), credit unions need not repeat the requirement for each term, as long as it is
clear which terms the requirement applies to.

6. 

Guide to model clauses.

 In the model clauses, italicized words indicate the type of disclosure a credit union should insert in the space provided
(for example, a credit union might insert ``March 25, 1995'' in the blank for ``(

date

)'' disclosure). Brackets and diagonals (``/'') indicate a Credit unions must choose the alternative that describes
its practice (for example, [daily balance/average daily balance]).

7. 

Sample forms.

 The sample forms (B-4 through B-11) serve a purpose different from the model clauses. They illustrate
various ways of adapting the model clauses to specific accounts. The clauses shown relate only to the specific transactions
described.

AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its general labeling policy for over-the-counter (OTC)
drug products that allows for the interchangeable use of certain words in labeling required by an OTC drug monograph.
Examples of words already allowed include: ``doctor'' or ``physician,'' ``consult'' or ``ask,'' and ``indications''
or ``uses.'' This proposal provides for an additional phrase (``Drug interaction precaution'' or ``Avoid mixing
drugs'' or ``Do not mix drugs''). The agency is also requesting public comment on changing the wording of warnings
from negative phraseology to a more positive approach (i.e., ``Do not use more than 7 days'' to ``Use only 7 days'').

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

  


Background 


In the 

Federal Register

 of April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17553), the agency proposed to amend its general labeling policy for over-the-counter (OTC)
drug products to allow for the interchangeable use of certain words in the labeling required by an OTC drug monograph.
The agency had previously proposed in a number of tentative final monographs and included in a number of final monographs
a provision that the words ``doctor'' and ``physician'' may be used interchangeably in the labeling of OTC drug products.
Instead of including this provision in each OTC drug monograph, the agency proposed to include such a provision in
 330.1 (21 CFR 330.1) as part of the general conditions under which an OTC drug is generally recognized as safe,
effective, and not misbranded. The agency also proposed that, at manufacturers' discretion, the word ``ask'' could
be substituted for the word ``consult,'' which appears in the directions for many OTC drug monograph ingredients.
Thus, the agency proposed that the phrases ``consult a physician,'' ``consult a doctor,'' ``ask a physician,'' and
``ask a doctor'' could be used interchangeably. The agency invited comments and suggestions as to such other terms
that could be used interchangeably, i.e., terms general in nature that appear in more than one OTC drug monograph.
The comments received in response to the proposed rulemaking were favorable and suggested a number of additional
terms that could be used interchangeably. 
In a final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of 
January 28, 1994 (59 FR 3998), the agency allowed the following terms to be used interchangeably: (1) ``Ask'' or ``consult,''
(2) ``assistance'' or ``help,''(3) ``clean'' or ``cleanse,'' (4) ``continue'' or ``persist,'' (5) ``continues''
or ``persists,'' (6) ``doctor'' or ``physician,'' (7) ``indication'' or ``use,'' (8) ``indications'' or ``uses,''
and (9) ``lung'' or ``pulmonary.'' These terms are included in  330.1(i). 
The agency intends to continue to examine labeling required by OTC drug monographs to provide consumers more simplified
and understandable information. This includes interchangeable terms, alternative phraseology, and possibly
a new or different labeling format. At this time, the agency is proposing additional words or phrases that could be
used interchangeably. The words ``Drug interaction precaution'' appear in a number of OTC drug monographs. See,
for example,  341.76(c)(4) (21 CFR 341.76(c)(4)) which states: ``

Drug interaction precaution

. Do not use this product if you are presently taking a prescription drug for high blood pressure or depression, without
first consulting a doctor.'' The agency believes the phrase ``Avoid mixing drugs'' or ``Do not mix drugs'' may be better
understood by consumers than ``Drug interaction precaution.'' Accordingly, the agency is proposing to amend  330.1(i)
to include these additional terms that may be used interchangeably in the labeling of OTC drug products. 
Additionally, the agency is requesting comment from manufacturers and the public on whether it would be desirable
to change negatively worded warnings to a more positive phraseology. For example, in the labeling of first aid antibiotic
drug products in  333.150(c)(1) (21 CFR 333.150(c)(1)), the warning ``Do not use in the eyes or apply over large
areas of the body,'' could be changed to read: ``Avoid use in the eyes or over large areas of the body.'' Similarly, the
warning in  333.150(c)(2), which states: ``Do not use longer than 1 week unless directed by a doctor,'' could
be changed to read: ``Use for only 1 week unless directed by a doctor.'' 
Another example is the warnings in  331.30(c)(4) (21 CFR 331.30(c)(4)), which states: ``Do not use this product
except under the advice and supervision of a physician if you have kidney disease,'' and in  331.30(c)(5) (21
CFR 331.30 (c)(5)), which states: ``Do not use this product except under the advice and supervision of a physician
if you are on a sodium restricted diet.'' These warnings could be changed to read: ``Use only with a physician's help
if * * *,'' or ``Use only with the help of a doctor if * * *.'' 
The warning statements cited are only selected examples. There are many other similar statements in proposed and
final OTC drug monographs. At this time, the agency seeks comments on the following specific questions: 
(1) Should the terms ``Drug interaction precaution,'' ``Avoid mixing drugs,'' or ``Do not mix drugs'' be used interchangeably?

(2) Is a positive phraseology for some warnings a desirable labeling approach or should the more emphatic negative
phraseology be retained as the only allowed language in warning statements? 
(3) Will consumers pay more attention to ``Do not use'' language than to ``Use only'' language? Do repetitive terms
such as ``Do not use'' lose their impact and become less important when read by consumers? 
(4) Should negative warnings be used only for the most important advice? 
(5) Is it essential that similar products have identical warning language or may the language vary and still be desirable
provided the meaning is the same? 
The agency seeks comments from manufacturers, health professionals, and consumers on these issues. Any party having
any survey data on these labeling approaches should provide that information to the agency. 
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Executive Order. 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. If this proposed rule becomes a final rule, the labeling options could be implemented
at very little cost by manufacturers at the next printing of labels, for those products for which the manufacturer
chooses to make a change. Accordingly, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis
is required. 
The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking
would have on the labeling of OTC drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated
with relabeling. Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC drug products should be accompanied by appropriate
documentation. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and will reassess the
economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule. 
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 
Interested persons may, on or before October 17, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted
on or before October 17, 1994. Three copies of all comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document and
may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9
a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this proposed rule is to add a test method which would be used to verify the performance and accuracy of
gas dilution systems during a field test. The test method is entitled, ``Verification of Gas Dilution Systems for
Field Instrument Calibrations,'' and will be added to 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix M, as Test Method 205. This method will
allow the facility greater flexibility while assuring the Administrator of the quality of the calibration of the
field analyzers.

I. The Rulemaking 



A. 

Summary of Proposed Changes

 



A verification procedure for gas dilution systems is being proposed. Gas dilution systems allow the user to dilute
a high level certified gaseous standard to the concentration levels needed for multi-point calibration. The instrumental
test methods in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A (e.g., Methods 3A, 6C, 7E, 10, 15, 16, 20, 25A, and 25B) require on-site, multi-point
calibration using gases of known concentrations. An extensive field test can require the tester to transport dozens
of high pressure gas cylinders to a test site. If a gas dilution system were available, the number of gas cylinders to
be transported to the test site would be greatly reduced. This procedure provides a mechanism for the tester to avoid
the cost and risk associated with transport of multiple gas cylinders, while also providing assurances to the on-site
Administrator that the calibration gases produced by the gas dilution system will be precise and accurate. 



B. Comments and Responses on Draft 



The proposed method was published through the Emission Measurement Technical Information Center as Conditional
Test Method 007 in April 1991. No technical comments have been submitted thus far. Several commenters suggested that
the protocol be published in the CFR, thus resulting in this action. 



II. Administrative Requirements 



A. Public Hearing 



A public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss the proposed rulemaking in accordance with Section 307(d)(5)
of the Clean Air Act. Persons wishing to make oral presentations should contact EPA at the address given in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble. Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a
written statement with EPA before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing. Written statements should be addressed
to the Central Docket Section address given in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble. 

A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be available for public inspection and copying during
normal working hours at EPA's Central Docket Section in Washington, D.C. (see 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble). 



B. Docket 



The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered by EPA in the
development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are to: (1) allow interested parties
to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process, and (2) serve
as the record in case of judicial review except for interagency review materials [Section 307(d)(7)(A)]. 



C. Office of Management and Budget Review 



It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 



D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this attached rule, if promulgated, will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because no additional costs will be incurred.

EPA proposes to amend title 40, chapter I, part 51 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: 



PART 51_[AMENDED] 



1. The authority citation for part 51 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2), 7475(e), 7502 (a) and (b), 7503, 7601(a)(1) and 7620. 



Appendix M_Recommended Test Methods for State Implementation Plans 



2. Appendix M to part 51 is amended by adding Method 205 to read as follows: 



Method 205_Verification of Gas Dilution Systems for Field Instrument Calibrations 



1. Introduction 



1.1 Applicability. A gas dilution system can provide known values of calibration gases through controlled dilution
of high-level calibration gases with an appropriate dilution gas. The instrumental test methods in 40 CFR Part 60_e.g.,
Methods 3A, 6C, 7E, 10, 15, 16, 20, 25A and 25B_require on-site, multi-point calibration using gases of known concentrations.
A gas dilution system that produces known low-level calibration gases from high-level calibration gases, with a
degree of confidence similar to that for Protocol1 gases, may be used for compliance tests in lieu of multiple calibration
gases when the gas dilution system is demonstrated to meet the requirements of this method. The Administrator may
also use a gas dilution system in order to produce a wide range of Cylinder Gas Audit concentrations when conducting
performance specifications according to Appendix F, 40 CFR Part 60. 

1.2 Principle. The gas dilution system shall be evaluated on one analyzer once during each field test. A precalibrated
analyzer is chosen, at the discretion of the source owner or operator, to demonstrate that the gas dilution system
produces predictable gas concentrations spanning the range of concentrations expected during the field test. After
meeting the requirements of this protocol, the remaining analyzers may be calibrated with the dilution system in
accordance to the requirements of the applicable method for the duration of the field test. In Methods 15 and 16, 40
CFR Part 60, Appendix A, reactive compounds may be lost in the gas dilution system. Also, in Methods 25A and 25B, 40 CFR
Part 60, Appendix A, calibration with target compounds other than propane is allowed. In these cases, a laboratory
evaluation is required once per year in order to assure the Administrator that the system will dilute these reactive
gases without significant loss. Note: The laboratory evaluation is required only if the source owner or operator
plans to utilize the dilution system to prepare gases mentioned above as being reactive. 



2. Specifications 



2.1 Gas Dilution System. The gas dilution system shall produce calibration gases whose measured values are within


#

2 percent of the predicted values. The predicted values are calculated based on the certified concentration of the
supply gas (Protocol gases, when available, are recommended for their accuracy) and the gas flow rates (or dilution
ratios) through the gas dilution system.

<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2.1.1 For gas dilution systems utilizing mass flow controllers, the mass flow controllers in the gas dilution system
shall be calibrated against a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable standard according
to the manufacturer's instructions once per year. 

2.1.2 For gas dilution systems using mass flow controllers, the accuracy of the controllers diminishes at low flow
rates. Therefore, it is recommended that flow rates below 10 percent of flow controller capacity be avoided. 

2.2 High-Level Supply Gas. An EPA Protocol calibration gas is recommended, due to its accuracy, as the high-level
supply gas. 

2.3 Mid-Level Supply Gas. An EPA Protocol gas shall be used as an independent check of the dilution system. The concentration
of the mid-level supply gas shall be within 10 percent of one of the dilution levels tested in Section 3.2. 



3. Performance Tests 



3.1 Laboratory Evaluation (Optional). If the gas dilution system is to be used to formulate calibration gases with
reactive compounds (Test Methods 15, 16, and 25A/25B (only if using a calibration gas other than propane during the
field test) in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A), a laboratory certification must be conducted once per year for each reactive
compound to be diluted. In the laboratory, carry out the procedures in Section 3.2 on the analyzer required in each
respective test method to be laboratory certified (15, 16, or 25A and 25B for compounds other than propane). For each
compound in which the gas dilution system meets the requirements in Section 3.2, the source must provide the laboratory
certification data for the field test and in the test report. 

3.2 Field Evaluation (Required). The gas dilution system shall be evaluated at the test site with an analyzer or monitor
chosen by the source owner or operator. It is recommended that the source owner or operator choose a precalibrated
instrument with a high level of precision and accuracy for the purposes of this test. This method is not meant to replace
the calibration requirements of test methods. In addition to the requirements in this protocol, all the calibration
requirements of the applicable test method must also be met. 

3.2.1 Prepare the gas dilution system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using the high-level supply
gas, prepare, at a minimum, one dilution for each dilution device utilized in the dilution system. Dilution device
in this method refers to the mass flow controller, critical orifice, capillary tube, or any other device which is used
to achieve gas dilution. For gas dilution systems utilizing mass flow controllers, it is recommended that two dilutions
be performed for each mass flow controller range. 

3.2.2 Calculate the predicted concentration for each of the dilutions based on the flow rates through the gas dilution
system (or the dilution ratios) and the certified concentration of the high-level supply gas. 

3.2.3 Introduce each of the dilutions from Section 3.2.1 into the analyzer or monitor one at a time and determine the
instrument response for each of the dilutions. 

3.2.4 Repeat the procedure in Section 3.2.3 two times, i.e., until three injections are made at each dilution level.
Calculate the average instrument response for each triplicate injection at each dilution level. No single injection
shall differ by more than 

#

2 percent from the average instrument response for that dilution. 

3.2.5 For each level of dilution, calculate the difference between the average concentration output recorded by
the analyzer and the predicted concentration calculated in Section 3.2.2. The average concentration output from
the analyzer shall be within 

#

2 percent of the predicted value. 

3.2.6 Introduce the mid-level supply gas directly into the analyzer, bypassing the gas dilution system. Repeat the
procedure twice more, for a total of three mid-level supply gas injections. Calculate the average analyzer output
concentration for the mid-level supply gas. The difference between the certified concentration of the mid-level
supply gas and the average instrument response shall be within 

#

2 percent. 

3.3 If the gas dilution system meets the criteria listed in Section 3.2, the gas dilution system may be used throughout
that field test. If the gas dilution system fails any of the criteria listed in Section 3.2, and the tester corrects
the problem with the gas dilution system, the procedure in Section 3.2 must be repeated in its entirety and all the criteria
in Section 3.2 must be met in order for the gas dilution system to be utilized in the test.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agency issued a conditional registration for tefluthrin for use on corn, grain, field, and pop; corn, forage and
fodder, field and pop on January 13, 1989. The registration was made conditional with a final expiration date of July
31, 1993, since certain data were lacking. See the 

Federal Register

 (FR) of March 8, 1989 (54 FR 9887) for specific data requirements. Because of the lack of these data the tolerances were
established with an expiration date of July 31, 1994. (See the 

Federal Register

 of February 1, 1989 (54 FR 5080)).


On January 22, 1990, the Agency issued a Special Data Call-In Notice to Zeneca Ag Products requiring submission of
a simulated aquatic field test (mesocosm study) to assess long-term aquatic adverse effects related to exposure
to this pesticide. This data requirement was imposed because of a reported fish kill associated with alleged misuse
of the product and was added to other conditions imposed on the registration in January 1989. This study was due by November
30, 1994.

On October 20 and November 13, 1992, Zeneca Ag Products requested an extension of the conditional registration and
extension of time to November 15, 1994. They also requested a waiver of the mesocosm study because of a change in Agency
policy on the need for higher tiered fate and ecological effects data such as an aquatic field study. The Agency reexamined
the existing ecological effects database and concluded that it had sufficient baseline data to characterize aquatic
hazard for this pesticide, and the Agency waived the requirement for a mesocosm study. However, the Agency still concluded
that this pesticide may pose aquatic risk from use on corn and agreed to an extension of the conditional registration
until November 15, 1994, provided Zeneca Ag Products submit risk reduction measures designed to reduce the potential
for exposure of aquatic habitats of concern. Zeneca Ag Products agreed to these terms, and on June 14, 1993, the Agency
extended the conditional registration for tefluthrin on corn to November 15, 1994. By November 15, 1994, the Agency
intends to complete review of all data and other information submitted and to make FIFRA section 3(c)(5) or other appropriate
regulatory decisions for the corn use of tefluthrin.

To be consistent with the extensions issued for the conditional registrations the Agency is proposing to extend the
tolerances on corn and other affected commodities. The Agency has determined that extending the tolerances will
protect the human health. Therefore, extensions for the tolerances on corn and other affected crops are proposed
as set forth below.

The data submitted in support of these tolerances and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological
and metabolism data and analytical methods for enforcement purposes considered in support of these tolerances are
discussed in detail in related documents published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 1, 1989 (54 FR 5061), for corn.

Residues remaining in or on the above raw agricultural commodity after expiration of these tolerances will not be
considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term and in accordance with the provisions of
the conditional registrations.

Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of FIFRA.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, (PP 7F3521/P587). All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available to the Public Response Section, at the address given above, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,
except legal holidays.

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or food/feed additive regulations
or raising tolerance or food/feed additive regulation levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements
do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to
this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Calcium Hypochlorite; Exemption From Tolerance 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to establish an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of chlorine gas in or on grapes
when applied as a fumigant postharvest by means of a chlorine generator pad in accordance with good agricultural practices.
Chiquita Frupac requested this proposed expansion of the tolerance exemption.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), EPA proposes to exempt from the
requirement of a tolerance residues of chlorine gas in or on grapes when applied as a fumigant postharvest by means
of a chlorine generator pad. The fumigation process uses polyethylene-lined paper pads containing calcium hypochlorite
that are packed in grape containers during shipment. Under conditions of normal use, the pads are not in direct contact
with the grapes. The moisture from inside the box and the carbon dioxide produced by the metabolic process of the fruit
permeate the pad, activating the release of chlorine gas. The chlorine gas released in the pad diffuses through the
paper and the polyethylene liner before depositing on the grapes. The exemption for chlorine generators would not
apply to the use of chlorine gas during food processing or as a food-contact surface sanitizer since these uses are
under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.


Several clearances already exist for the calcium salt of hypochlorite used as the precursor of the chlorine gas. Calcium
hypochlorite is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance when used preharvest or postharvest in solution on all
raw agricultural commodities (40 CFR 180.1054). Calcium hypochlorite is an approved inert ingredient in pesticide
products when added to a formulation as a sanitizing and bleaching agent (40 CFR 180.1001). Calcium hypochlorite
is cleared by the Food and Drug Administration when used as a rinse on food-contact surfaces (21 CFR 178.1010). Chlorine
gas is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance when used preharvest or postharvest in solution on all raw agricultural
commodities (40 CFR 180.1095).
When added to water, chlorine gas reacts to form hypochlorous acid, a pesticidally active chemical which kills microorganisms
on the surface of the commodity to which it is applied. Hypochlorous acid is consumed when it reacts with bacteria,
fungi, and other organic matter. Because of the rapidity with which chlorine gas degrades, there is no reasonable
expectation that residues of chlorine gas will remain in eggs, meat, milk, or poultry in accordance with 40 CFR 180.3.
The residues that do remain are not of toxicological significance.
Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this active ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore,
EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended that contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulations. Comments must bear a notation

Pesticide Tolerances for Avermectin B

1

 and its Delta-8,9-Isomer; Renewal of Tolerances 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to renew tolerances for the residues of the insecticide avermectin B

1

 and its delta-8,9-isomer in or on certain raw agricultural commodities and food and feed commodities. Merck &
Co., Inc., requested this proposal to renew the effective date for tolerances for maximum permissible levels of residues
of this insecticide in or on these commodities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agency issued a conditional registration for avermectin B

1

 for use on cotton on May 22, 1989, with an expiration date of March 31, 1992 (see the 

Federal Register

 of August 23, 1989 (54 FR 35059)). This conditional registration was amended on July 25, 1989, to include citrus (see
the 

Federal Register

 of August 2, 1989 (54 FR 31836)). On April 1, 1992, this expiration date was subsequently extended to April 30, 1995,
to allow the Agency sufficient time to review the data. The registrations were made conditional since certain data
were lacking and required by the Agency to allow it to evaluate the effects of avermectin B

1

 on fish and aquatic organisms. See the 

Federal Register

 of August 23, 1989 (54 FR 35059), for specific data requirements. Because of the lack of these data the tolerances on
cotton and citrus were established with an expiration date of March 31, 1993. 


On November 20, 1992, Merck & Co. requested a waiver of the aquatic field study (mesocosm study) due to a change
in Agency policy regarding the need for higher tiered fate and ecological effects data. In addition, Merck & Co.
agreed to implement interim risk reduction measures designed to reduce the potential for aquatic exposure from application
of avermectin B

1

 to cotton and citrus. The interim risk reduction measures included label changes aimed at reducing exposure to aquatic
organisms such as (1) reduction in the number of applications and total seasonal applications; (2) increase in retreatment
intervals; (3) geographic limitations; and (4) inclusion of aquatic buffer zones.
The Agency reexamined the existing ecological effects data base and concluded that it had sufficient baseline data
to characterize aquatic hazard for this pesticide. Thus, on January 10, 1993, the Agency waived the requirement for
a mesocosm study. However, the Agency still concluded that this pesticide may pose aquatic risk from use on cotton
and citrus and that the registration must remain conditional until the Agency had evaluated the effectiveness of
the risk reduction measures and completed its aquatic risk assessment. By April 30, 1995, or sooner, the Agency intends
to complete review of all data and other information submitted and to make FIFRA section 3(c)(5) or other appropriate
regulatory decisions for the cotton and citrus use of avermectin B

1

.
To be consistent with the extensions issued for the conditional registrations, the Agency is proposing to renew the
tolerances on cotton, citrus and other affected commodities. The Agency has determined that renewing the tolerances
will protect the human health. Therefore, renewals for the tolerances on cotton, citrus, and other affected crops
are proposed as set forth below.

The data submitted in support of these tolerances and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological
and metabolism data and analytical methods for enforcement purposes considered in support of these tolerances are
discussed in detail in related documents published in the 

Federal Registers

 of May 31, 1989 (54 FR 23209) for cottonseed and August 2, 1989 (54 FR 31836) for citrus.

Residues remaining in or on the above raw agricultural commodity after expiration of these tolerances will not be
considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of and in accordance with the provisions
of the conditional registrations.

Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of FIFRA.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number (PP 7F3500, 8F3592, FAP 8H5650/P586). All written comments filed in response
to this petition will be available to the Public Response Section, at the address given above from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday, except legal holidays.

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or food/feed additive regulations
or raising tolerance or food/feed additive regulation levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements
do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to
this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

Qualification of Pipeline Personnel 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice proposes qualification standards for personnel who perform, or directly supervise those persons performing,
regulated operation, maintenance, and emergency-response functions. This action would amend current standards
for training personnel performing operating or maintenance activities on hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines,
and extend those standards to personnel performing similar functions on gas pipelines. This action is taken to ensure
that pipeline personnel have the necessary knowledge and skills to competently perform these regulated functions.
The intended effect of this proposed rulemaking is to improve pipeline safety by requiring operators to assure the
competency of pipeline personnel through training, testing, and periodic refresher training. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background 



The pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR Parts 192 and 195 cannot be fully effective in preventing and mitigating
pipeline accidents unless personnel who perform regulated functions, or directly supervise persons performing
regulated functions, understand the applicable regulations and have the knowledge and skills needed for competent
performance. Therefore, requiring operators to ensure that such personnel are qualified to perform operating,
maintenance, and emergency response functions is an essential step in making the pipeline safety regulations effective.
Also, requiring operation, maintenance, and emergency-response personnel to be knowledgeable about safety-related
elements, such as flammability, toxicity, potential ignition sources, and to be able to recognize and appropriately
react to abnormal and emergency conditions should further minimize the causes and consequences of pipeline accidents.


In accidents clearly recognized as involving human error, circumstances often indicate that a deficiency in knowledge
or skill, i.e. lack of qualification, has been a significant accident factor. However, the effects of personnel lacking
qualifications are not always apparent. The effects may be too subtle to be recognized as an accident factor. For example,
accidents that operators have attributed to equipment failure or corrosion may have actually been set in motion by
poorly performed operation or maintenance procedures. In addition, the pipeline safety regulations require operators
to report ``incidents'' (49 CFR 191.3) and ``accidents'' (49 CFR 195.50) only in instances meeting threshold requirements
set out in those regulations. Thus, there may be many more accidents involving personnel lacking qualifications
than commonly reported. 



Recommendations by National Transportation Safety Board 



In a letter to RSPA dated May 14, 1987, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that incorrect human
performance has already caused, or contributed to the severity of, many pipeline accidents, and that most of the errors
involved could be linked to inadequate training. NTSB identified 110 related Safety Recommendations it had issued
from 1975 through 1986 based on pipeline accidents indicating that training of pipeline personnel needed improvement.


The following two accidents are among those cited by NTSB in its correspondence:

On July 12, 1983, natural gas escaping under 60 psig pressure from a crack in a substandard butt-fusion joint in a 2-inch
plastic gas main entered an apartment building in Clear Lake, Iowa. It exploded and then burned. Two gas distribution
company employees were injured, one apartment building was destroyed, and the adjacent apartment building was damaged
heavily. Damage was estimated at more than $1 million. Fortunately, none of the building residents were injured or
killed. Company employees had been notified earlier about strong gas odors outside the apartments and were on site
searching for the gas leak more than 2 hours before the explosion. They did not shut off the flow of gas to the leak and
did not warn the residents to evacuate the apartment buildings before the explosion. NTSB recommended that the company
train its employees, including supervisors, in procedures for responding to emergencies and protection of the public
in areas exposed to leaking gas, and reinstruct its pipe fitters/operators in all elements of the procedures for fusion
of plastic pipe. 

On May 26, 1983, natural gas at 815 psig began to escape through a failed gasket in a compressor at a transmission company's
field compressor plant near Bloomfield, New Mexico. The compressor station operator heard a loud noise, ran to the
valve manifold outside the compressor building, and tried to shut off the gas supply to compressor No. 14. Another
employee, who also heard the noise, ran into the compressor building and tried to shut down the compressor engine.
Before either person succeeded, the escaping gas ignited, exploded, and burned. The two employees were burned severely,
compressor No. 14 was destroyed, another compressor was damaged, the windows and doors of the compressor building
were blown out, and other structural damage resulted. NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was
the improper tightening of compressor head bolts, resulting in the rupture of a compressor head gasket and the escape
and ignition of gas. Contributing to the accident was the operator's failure to assure that maintenance personnel
were trained in proper bolt tightening procedures. Contributing to the extent of damage and to the duration of the
emergency was the failure by plant personnel, due to inadequate training in emergency procedures, to promptly relieve
gas pressure in the piping by activating the blowdown system. 





In a February 1987 report (NTSB/PAR-87/01) detailing two Texas Eastern Gas Pipeline Company accidents occurring
in Kentucky in 1985 and 1986, NTSB determined that company employees who inspected corrosion damage had not been adequately
trained to assess the effect of corrosion. It also determined that in the 1986 accident, supervisors had not been properly
trained to cooperate with local officials during an emergency. In this report, NTSB recommended that RSPA: 




Amend 49 CFR Parts 192 and 195 to require that operators of pipelines develop and conduct selection, training, and
testing programs to annually qualify employees for correctly carrying out each assigned responsibility which is
necessary for complying with 49 CFR Part 192 and 195 as appropriate (Safety Rec. No. P-87-2). 





Additionally, in the May 14, 1987, letter from NTSB to RSPA identifying its 110 Safety Recommendations, NTSB urged
OPS to require all pipeline operators, without regard to size or ownership of the pipeline, to develop, through job/task
analyses, employee qualifications for all activities addressed by the pipeline safety standards. 

More recently the NTSB released the following account of an accident in Chicago that was attributed to inadequately
trained gas distribution personnel. 




On January 17, 1992, employees of a natural gas utility were performing annual maintenance on a pressure regulator
station that reduced high pressure upstream gas to the low pressure requirements of the downstream distribution
system. During this routine procedure the pressure regulator is taken out of service and the normally closed by-pass
valve is manually throttled to control gas flow to the low pressure distribution system. Workers operating the by-pass
valve normally determine the need to increase or decrease the gas flow to the low pressure system by monitoring the
liquid levels in manometers installed on that system. A manometer is a clear plastic U-tube used throughout the gas
industry to measure pressure (pressure head) in mains and services. When used on low pressure systems the open ended
U-tube commonly contains water. By observing the difference in height of the water columns, workers can readily determine
the pressure in the connected gas piping. Although, the workers saw the water blow out of their manometers, at least
twice, they waited for instructions from headquarters before shutting off the gas supply by closing the 4-inch by-pass
valve. The resulting over pressure condition (as high as 10 psig) lasted about 45 minutes, during which gas in the downstream
distribution system escaped through gas appliances into homes and other buildings where it was ignited by unidentified
sources. The resulting explosion and fires killed four people, injured four people and damaged 14 houses and three
commercial buildings. While the NTSB concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine which way the 4-inch
by-pass valve was turned or if it had been blocked by debris that become dislodged, it said that the accident could have
been prevented or its severity lessened if the onsite supervisor had closed the by-pass valve as soon as he realized
that the low pressure system was over pressured. Two of the workmen testified that they knew from their training that
when water blew out of their manometers, it was caused by excessive high pressure gas flowing through the by-pass valve.
However, none of the crew acknowledged having been trained to respond to emergencies, including those involving
overpressurization. NTSB found that the gas company's training manual did not detail how to recognize or respond
to those abnormal situations employees are likely to encounter nor did it tell supervisors the extent of their authority
or reference the company's emergency plan. Nonetheless, the NTSB found that the gas company's service department
responded very well after the gas was shut off. 




The NTSB also noted that such training deficiencies are not confined to Chicago, but are a nationwide problem. As a
result of its investigation of this accident, NTSB reiterated its 1987 recommendation to RSPA that it require operators
of pipelines to develop and conduct selection, training and testing programs to annually qualify employees for their
safety-sensitive responsibilities under 49 CFR Parts 192 and 195.

Recommendation by DOT Inspector General 



As the use of insufficiently qualified personnel by some operators has become known, several sources in addition
to NTSB have recommended that DOT take action to regulate the qualifications of pipeline personnel. In December 1982,
the DOT Inspector General (IG) recommended in a memorandum to the RSPA Administrator that RSPA require licensing
or certification of managers/superintendents of gas distribution systems. The IG said: 




State safety inspectors have indicated that operators of small municipal and privately owned gas distributors are
frequently unaware of the federal safety standards or lack the know-how to implement them. Managers or superintendents
of gas distribution systems should demonstrate a basic knowledge and understanding of federal safety standards
before they are allowed to operate/manage the systems. Licensing or certification of natural gas distribution operators
would improve compliance and enable State safety inspectors to provide greater coverage by reducing the amount of
time expended in explaining standards to operators. Many States already require the operators of other utility systems
to be licensed. 



Recommendations by Congress 



The House Committee on Energy and Commerce in its November 17, 1987, report to accompany H.R. 2266, a bill to amend the
Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA)

1

 and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA)

 stated that DOT ``may establish criteria for a program of testing for pipeline operations employees and include licensing
based on that testing if this is appropriate'' (H.R. Rep. No. 445, Pt. 1, 100th Congress, 1st Session, 13). This bill
culminated in the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988 (Pub. L. No. 100-561; October 31, 1988), which,
in sections 101 and 201, gave DOT discretionary authority to require ``that all individuals responsible for the operation
and maintenance of pipeline facilities be tested for qualifications and certified to perform such functions.''






Recommendation by Minnesota Commission on Pipeline Safety 



The need for qualification standards for pipeline personnel has also been recognized at the state level. Following
the July 1986 failure of an 8-inch products pipeline in Minnesota that resulted in the deaths of two people and serious
injury to another person, the Governor of Minnesota established the Minnesota Commission on Pipeline Safety. This
commission examined the safety and reliability of pipelines operating in Minnesota. The commission's December
1986 report included a recommendation that the U.S. Department of Transportation study the need for additional registration,
licensing, and certification requirements for pipeline design and construction personnel. 



Recommendations by National Association of Pipeline Safety Representatives 



An alternative approach to government licensing or certification of operators or operator personnel was recommended
in 1986 by the National Association of Pipeline Safety Representatives (NAPSR), an association of state pipeline
safety inspectors. In one of its annual resolutions (1986-9) submitted to the RSPA Administrator, NAPSR urged
DOT ``to initiate a rulemaking to establish regulations which would require natural gas operator personnel qualification.''
NAPSR made this recommendation after determining that ``it would be in the best interest of public safety, and as a
general standard for the natural gas industry, that all natural gas system operations be under the direction of a person
who is qualified by test, experience, and training in natural gas work.'' Again in 1990, in one of its annual resolutions
(1990-3), NAPSR urged the DOT Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) ``to create specific qualification standards
of uniformity across the industry'' and that the rulemaking ``be expanded to include personnel engaged in design
and construction.'' Like NTSB, NAPSR has recommended a rulemaking approach rather than Federal licensing or certification.
In this notice RSPA has proposed that regulated design or construction functions required to properly accomplish
covered operation, maintenance or emergency-response work must be performed by persons qualified as proposed in
this notice. However, persons with pipeline expertise and registered as professional engineers in the state where
the work is located are qualified for any such engineering design under this proposal. 

At this time, RSPA does not see the need to extend the proposed qualification requirements to include personnel engaged
in all regulated design and construction functions as recommended in the NAPSR resolution. Application of the proposed
requirements to only those personnel performing regulated operation, maintenance and emergency response functions
is consistent with the intent of the Recommendations by Congress and the mandate contained in the Pipeline Safety
Act of 1992 (below). Nonetheless, in response to that NAPSR resolution, RSPA invites persons to comment on whether
we should extend the testing and certification requirements to personnel engaged in all regulated design and construction
of covered pipelines. Persons commenting in support of such an extension are requested to support their positions
with data from related accidents that includes: the quantity of gas, hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide released
and any resulting deaths, personal injuries, property damages and environmental damages.

Small Gas Systems 


Although lack of sufficient training has been a factor contributing to accidents on both large and small pipeline
systems, OPS, the advisory committees (below) and state pipeline safety inspectors recognize that there is a particular
need to improve the knowledge and skills of personnel in some of the small gas distribution systems. Personnel with
some deficiencies include not only the operator and operator personnel, but also contractors working for small gas
distribution systems. Small gas distribution systems are characterized in this proposal as distribution systems
serving fewer than 10,000 customers. They include petroleum gas systems (covered by  192.11) and master meter
systems (defined in  191.3), both of which usually serve mobile home parks, housing projects, and apartment
complexes; and public, private, and municipal distribution systems. Industry sources estimate that there are about
1,000 petroleum gas systems covered by  192.11, that serve 10 or more customers. Additionally, information
in the OPS enforcement data base shows there are 52,000 master meter systems and 1,150 other small public, private,
and municipal distribution systems. The lack of qualified personnel working on these small gas distribution systems
looms as a potential threat to gas pipeline safety. 



Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 


On March 23, 1987, OPS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) titled, ``Pipeline Operator Qualifications,''
requesting public comment on the need for additional regulations or a certification/licensing program regarding
the qualification of personnel who design, construct, operate, or maintain gas or hazardous liquid pipelines (Docket
PS-94, Notice 1; 52 FR 9189). The ANPRM outlined RSPA's existing regulations requiring the qualification or
training of personnel in certain aspects of pipeline safety, such as welding steel pipe, corrosion control, and joining
plastic pipe. In addition, the ANPRM discussed RSPA and state efforts to train operator personnel in understanding
the pipeline safety regulations. 
Comments were received from 134 persons representing various gas and liquid pipeline operators, governmental agencies,
and other interested parties. Of the 116 persons who commented on the competency level of operator personnel, approximately
75 percent felt that a lack of competent personnel did not pose a significant enough threat to public safety to warrant
further governmental action. However, a minority of about 22 percent felt some attention should be given to small
gas distribution systems. Of the 60 persons who commented on the question of whether governmental action, if taken,
should apply industry-wide or be limited to small systems, approximately 62 percent favored the latter. Of the 34
persons expressing an opinion on the appropriate governmental action, about 53 percent favored increasing direct
training and the preparation of guidance material for operator personnel. The remainder were almost evenly divided
between more regulation of training/qualification and a licensing/certification program. Of the 24 persons who
commented on what areas of pipeline safety should be covered if additional training and qualification requirements
are developed, almost everyone favored various combinations of design, construction, operation, and maintenance.
Finally, of the 61 persons expressing an opinion on whether additional regulations for training and qualification
would result in an improvement in pipeline safety, approximately 46 percent expected an improvement in accidents
prevented or mitigated. 


Advisory Committees 


The Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (TPSSC) and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards
Committee (THLPSSC) are OPS's gas and liquid advisory committees representing government agencies, pipeline operators,
and the public. At a joint meeting in Washington, DC on September 23, 1987, the TPSSC and THLPSSC discussed the ANPRM.
The advisory committees generally supported requiring all pipeline operators to conduct training and testing programs
for personnel assigned to perform operation and maintenance functions. Many committee members were concerned,
however, about the ability of some small gas distribution system operators to provide the necessary training, and
requested that any new regulations be sensitive to the limited financial and technical resources of these small operators.

Subsequently, on September 13 and 14, 1988, these committees met again in Washington, DC, and discussed a preliminary
rulemaking proposal which OPS had developed for the qualification of pipeline personnel. The basic training and
testing requirements now being put forward for public comment were embodied in that proposal. The TPSSC supported
the proposal by unanimous vote. The THLPSSC, after making three minor recommendations for clarification of statements
in the proposed regulations, also supported the proposal unanimously. However, the three recommendations are no
longer germane, since the statements that required clarification have been removed from the proposed requirements.

Congressional Mandate 


Under sections 106 and 205 of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (Pub. L. No. 102-508; October 24, 1992), 49 U.S.C.
 60102, Congress mandated that DOT require ``all individuals responsible for the operation and maintenance
of pipeline facilities be tested for qualifications and certified to perform such functions''. In complying with
the congressional mandate, DOT is required to ``address the ability to recognize and appropriately react to abnormal
operating conditions which may indicate a dangerous situation or a condition exceeding design limits.'' Furthermore,
Congress provided that certification may, ``as the Secretary considers appropriate, be performed by the operator.''



Qualification and Certification 


RSPA is proposing that regulated pipeline operators implement requirements for the qualification of operation,
maintenance and emergency-response personnel (including contractor personnel) and for the qualification of certain
supervisory personnel. These requirements would be based on the continuing training program applicable to hazardous
liquid and carbon dioxide pipeline operators. Operators would be required to certify the qualification of personnel
for the performance of covered functions. However, RSPA is not proposing to establish an industry-wide personnel
licensing program. This decision was made because the severity and extent of the personnel qualification problem
does not currently warrant such an ambitious undertaking. In addition, there is no private or governmental apparatus
currently in place to conduct such extensive licensing. This decision is consistent with the regulatory authority
provided by 49 U.S.C.  60102, which requires qualification and certification of those individuals performing
functions related to the operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities. Of course, where local conditions warrant
more rigorous action, state agencies are not precluded from starting a licensing or certification program for intrastate
pipeline operators under their regulatory jurisdiction. 
It is difficult to assess how detailed and extensive the new Federal personnel qualification regulations should
be, because many pipelines have unique operating and maintenance requirements. Therefore, RSPA is proposing a more
general performance-oriented regulatory approach based on an expansion of the continuing training program hazardous
liquid operators must now provide under  195.403. 


Available Training 


Several states are working to improve the knowledge and skills of operator personnel in small gas distribution systems,
including master meter systems, by state-sponsored educational programs. Currently, states with notable training
programs include Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, and Texas. In addition, some gas operators have established
statewide and regional gas associations for the purpose of improving technical skills and the understanding of the
gas pipeline safety regulations. These associations often encourage gas equipment suppliers to exhibit and instruct
gas distribution and transmission personnel in the proper use of special tools and equipment. Similarly, state regulatory
agencies are often encouraged to participate by teaching or clarifying the applicable Federal/state pipeline safety
regulations to personnel working on small gas distribution systems. 
At the Federal level, RSPA provides pipeline safety training through its Transportation Safety Institute (TSI)
in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1992 and 1993 gas pipeline safety seminars taught by instructors from the TSI were held
in 20 and 21 states, respectively. These one, two, three, and four-day seminars teach various aspects of pipeline
safety regulations and include instructional material oriented toward the operator personnel working on small
gas distribution systems. The gas pipeline safety seminars will also be held in 26 states during 1994. Attendance
at these instructive seminars requires advance registration and payment of a modest registration fee. Additionally,
other hazardous liquid and gas pipeline safety courses planned by TSI for presentation in 1994 include regulation
compliance, corrosion control and computer simulator dispatching. Pipeline operators interested in further information
on TSI training courses should contact their state pipeline safety regulatory office or phone the Pipeline Safety
Division of the Transportation Safety Institute at (405) 954-7219.

In 1989, RSPA distributed to each state pipeline safety agency a set of 10 VHS cassettes prepared by the Pipeline Safety
Section of the Arizona Corporation Commission for training small gas distribution operators in that state. The cassettes
can be used by operators of small distribution systems in all the states to augment the training of their employees.
The cassettes present fundamental theory and practical application of gas distribution plus the basics of the Federal
pipeline safety regulations. 

Another RSPA training aid is the ``Guidance Manual for Operators of Small Gas Systems,'' which is available (in single
copy) to pipeline operators at no cost from the Transportation Safety Institute, Pipeline Safety Division, DTI-60,
Post Office Box 25082, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73125-5050. The manual was developed by RSPA with the assistance
of state pipeline safety representatives and gas distribution trade association members. The manual has recently
been revised and updated. It provides a broad overview of compliance responsibilities under parts 191, 192, and 199
of the Federal pipeline safety regulations and is designed for use by non-technically trained operator personnel
working on small gas distribution systems, including master meter systems. Since the publication of the first edition
in 1982, some 50,000 copies have been disseminated to gas operator personnel. 



Covered Functions 



The proposed regulations apply to personnel who perform regulated operation, maintenance, and emergency-response
functions ( covered functions ) on a ``pipeline,'' as that term is defined in   192.3 and 195.2 of the pipeline
safety regulations. Additionally, the proposed regulations would apply to ``supervisory persons'' (defined in
  192.803 and 195.503, as operators, managers, supervisors, foremen, co-workers, and other personnel)
who directly oversee persons performing these same covered functions. Lack of qualified personnel to perform regulated
pipeline design and construction functions that are unrelated to pipeline operation, maintenance, or emergency
response has not been identified as a significant safety problem. Thus, at this time, no new requirements are proposed
for these areas. Nonetheless, if regulated design or construction functions are required to properly accomplish
regulated operation, maintenance, or emergency-response work, then persons performing those related design or
construction functions must be qualified as proposed in this notice. However, persons with pipeline expertise and
registered as professional engineers in the state where the pipeline work is located are qualified for any such engineering
design under the proposed requirements. 

Covered functions are those operation, maintenance, and emergency-response functions that are regulated by the
pipeline safety regulations. However, covered functions are not limited to those under Part 192, Subpart L_Operations
and Subpart M_Maintenance or Part 195, Subpart F_Operation and Maintenance. The covered functions are much broader
and are generally identified as having all three of the following characterics: 

 Characteristic No. 1_The function is performed by persons either in direct contact, or in close association
with pipelines regulated by parts 192 or 195. 

 Characteristic No. 2_The function performed applies to the operation or maintenance of pipelines, or the
response to an emergency involving pipelines. These functions are performed on pipelines that are or have been in
service, as opposed to new pipelines that have not yet been readied for service. Operating functions include, among
other things, the control of pressure, movement, or storage of gas under part 192 and hazardous liquids or carbon dioxide
under part 195. Maintenance functions keep a pipeline in proper condition or preserve a pipeline for future use. They
include, among other things, functions involved in inspection, protection, repair, replacement, and integrity
testing. Emergency-response functions are steps an operator takes to recognize emergency conditions; control
or mitigate their harmful effects to persons, property, or the environment; and then return the pipeline to normal
operating conditions. 

 Characteristic No. 3_The function is regulated by a provision contained in part 192 or 195. A function is regulated
in instances where a provision: (1) contains a rule that governs the conduct of the function, or (2) requires that the
function be done according to a plan or procedure. 



Proposed Subparts 



Because the training and testing of pipeline personnel may be an expanding requirement, the qualification regulations
under this proposal would be placed in new subpart N of part 192 and new subpart G of part 195. The current  195.403
(Training) would be deleted. 

Under the proposed   192.805(a) and 195.505(a), operators would have to assure that personnel (both
experienced and inexperienced) who perform, or directly oversee persons performing, regulated operation, maintenance,
or emergency-response functions (covered functions) have been qualified by completion of all the requirements
for qualification. Persons qualified to perform certain covered functions may need additional training and testing
before performing other covered functions to which they are upgraded, promoted, or transferred. The personnel affected
by this proposal may be operators themselves; regular, part-time, or temporary employees of the operator; independent
contractors and subcontractors engaged by the operator; and regular, part-time, or temporary employees of contractors
and subcontractors. 

Under   192.805(b) and 195.505(b), functions required to be performed by qualified persons may (except
for the specified functions) also be performed by persons without such qualification if, while performing the function,
those persons are accompanied and directed by a qualified supervisory person. This provision is intended to permit
on-the-job training of persons not yet qualified. The supervisory person involved would not only have to directly
oversee performance of the covered function, but accompany and direct the trainee (or unqualified person) while
he or she performs the function. 

Moreover, supervisory persons directly overseeing qualified persons performing covered functions would, themselves,
be required to be qualified or required to be qualified administratively for those covered functions as required
in 
  192.805(c) and 195.505(c). The term ``qualified administratively'' is defined in   192.803
and 195.503.

Under the proposed   192.805(c) and 195.505(c), supervisory persons may become qualified administratively
in certain covered functions by meeting all the proposed training and testing requirements, except those involving
the demonstration of competent manual skills. Accordingly, supervisory persons directly overseeing personnel
such as qualified welders would be permitted an exemption from ``hands-on'' welding. However, such supervisory
persons would be required to demonstrate an appropriate knowledge of the pipeline safety regulations for welding_subpart
E of part 192 or subpart D of part 195 as required under the proposed   192.811(d)(1) and 195.511(d)(1).
RSPA encourages the practice of some pipeline operators to require that persons directly supervising welders be,
themselves, fully qualified welders. 

Under   192.807 and 195.507, all evaluating, training, and testing of personnel would be performed by
an instructor with demonstrable proficiency in the functions to be taught and tested. Demonstrable proficiency
is proposed to be defined as evidence of competence acceptable to other persons with specialized training or certification
in the performance of similar functions. However, the instructor's proficiency need only be commensurate with the
level of knowledge and skills required for competent performance of the function on the operator's unique pipeline.
This provision recognizes that the degree or extent of knowledge and skills required to competently perform some
functions on a particular pipeline may be less than that required for similar functions on more complex pipelines.


Operators (who own or operate pipelines) are permitted to serve as instructors or to select operator personnel or
other entities to serve as instructors, providing that the operator or persons selected as instructors have the required
level of proficiency. An operator who would not qualify as an instructor but would need to be evaluated for purposes
of qualification would have to obtain the evaluation from an instructor, who could be another operator, employee
of that other operator or an entity qualified as an instructor. 

Under   192.809(a) and 195.509(a), instructors would be required to evaluate the work experience and
training of persons requiring qualification in order to determine what, if any, prior work experience and training
were suitable and applicable to that required for competent performance of the persons' current functions. Work
experience and training that are evaluated as equivalent to any of the general or specific training elements of   192.811
and 195.511 would not require retraining, but would require testing under   192.813 and 195.513 to confirm
the evaluation. After completion of the evaluation of the prior experience and training of persons performing covered
functions, the operator would be required by   192.809(b) and 195.509(b) to prepare a written or computerized
qualification training and testing schedule containing details such as names and titles of affected persons, dates
and locations for training and testing, elements of general and specific training to be taught or tested, and names
of instructors. Under   192.809(c) and 195.509(c), the operator would be required to prepare a written
or computerized refresher training schedule showing similar details, except that testing is not required, under
this proposal, for refresher training. The proposed elements of qualification training under   192.811
and 195.511 are based on the training program hazardous liquid operators are now required to conduct under  195.403(a).
However, the proposed requirements are more comprehensive. 

Under the proposal, all affected personnel (except persons with prior equivalent work experience or training that
have been confirmed by testing) would have to satisfactorily complete general training elements of   192.811
and 195.511 appropriate to the operator's unique pipeline and specific training elements relevant to a person's
covered functions on that unique pipeline. Operators would have to demonstrate that their personnel have received
training relevant to the operator's unique pipeline system in the applicable elements of   192.811 and
195.511 through any, or a combination of the following methods: prior formal education, prior company-sponsored
training, work experience, apprenticeship, or newly provided on-the-job or classroom training. All would qualify
as legitimate training methods. The necessary depth and length of training would be established by the operator so
that they are sufficient to assure personnel competency as demonstrated by subsequent testing under   192.813
and 195.513. 

Under this approach, pipeline instructors would determine for each individual what work experience and prior education
or training are relevant to that individual's covered functions and what additional training is needed to meet the
proposed elements of training. Consequently, wholesale training should be unnecessary for most experienced personnel
of pipeline operators with currently adequate training programs. Although this approach is intended to give operators
latitude in developing a qualification program, each operator's program would be required to result in personnel
of the operator and the contractor being proficient in all the training elements proposed under   192.811
and 195.511. Because the training appropriate for one individual function, or a particular pipeline, may not be appropriate
for another individual function, or another pipeline, an operator's qualification program would be developed and
implemented to accommodate such distinctions.

RSPA is particularly concerned that control center dispatchers and other operating personnel are adequately trained
to recognize the abnormal operating conditions or the emergency conditions of proposed   192.811(d)(4)
and 195.511(d)(4). Further, RSPA is concerned that control center persons and other operating personnel are adequately
trained in the appropriate reactions to restore abnormal operating conditions to normal conditions and are adequately
trained in the appropriate reactions to prevent the development of emergency conditions. Additionally, in the proposed
  192.811(d)(5) and 195.511(d)(5), control center persons, and operating and emergency-response
personnel must be adequately trained in the appropriate reactions to control emergency conditions or to mitigate
the potential for personal injury, death, property damage, and environmental damage. Sections 192.811(d)(5) and
195.511(d)(5) would supplement the requirements of the current   192.615 (Emergency plans) and 195.402
(Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies). 
Under   192.813 and 195.513, tests would have to be designed by the operator to demonstrate that personnel
possess the knowledge and skills that training is intended to impart. Testing could be through any, or a combination
of, written, hands-on, or oral methods appropriate for the function tested. For some functions, a suitable test might
consist of observing ``hands-on'' performance supplemented by appropriate questioning. Operators must set the
minimum acceptable test grade at a level that would demonstrate the knowledge and skills required to competently
perform the function tested. Testing would be required for all persons performing covered functions including experienced
personnel evaluated under   192.809(a) and 195.509(a) to have met training requirements by equivalent
prior training or experience. RSPA believes that testing is the only reasonable way to ensure that personnel possess
the knowledge and skills required for qualification. 
Under these proposed regulations, qualification of an individual based on training and testing would not be a one-time
event. Each time the pipeline safety regulations or the operator's procedures are changed or new ones are put into
effect, operators would have to determine which persons may need additional training to carry out their covered functions
under the new regulations or procedures. When further qualification training is required, it would have to be followed
by a test. When qualification is required to comply with new or revised pipeline safety regulations, the qualification
training and testing would have to be completed before the compliance dates specified in the rule and before the affected
person begins performance of a covered function. A similar evaluation and timely qualification process would be
required each time a person is given an operation, maintenance, or emergency-response assignment for which that
person is not qualified. Until that person becomes qualified, the person must be accompanied and directed by a qualified
person. 
The requirement of existing  195.403(a) that the training program be continuing would be made more definite
under the proposed requirement for refresher training at intervals not to exceed 2 years. Under the proposed   192.815
and 195.515, refresher training is intended to be a review of the general and the appropriate specific elements under
  192.811 and 195.511. The review may be accomplished by the same methods used for qualification training.
However, there is no exception for prior experience or training evaluated as equivalent, as permitted in   192.811(a)
and 195.511(a). An existing requirement under  195.403(c) requires hazardous liquid operators to require
and verify that their supervisors maintain a thorough knowledge of that portion of the procedures established under
 195.402 (Procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies). This requirement would not be
continued in its present form under the proposed qualification standards because it is less rigorous than the proposed
requirement that affected personnel be qualified. Moreover, an existing requirement under  195.403(b) concerning
review of personnel performance relative to the objectives of the training program would be carried forward into
proposed competency reviews under   192.817(e) and 195.517(e). 
The purpose of competency reviews is to evaluate the effectiveness of qualification training, testing, and refresher
training by reviewing the performance of personnel involved with covered functions which resulted in reportable
accidents and other nonreportable events. The nonreportable events would be deaths, personal injuries, property
damage, or damage to the environment, any of which may have occurred without a release of the gas, hazardous liquid,
or carbon dioxide, or otherwise did not meet the threshold limits for reportable gas incidents under  191.5
or reportable liquid accidents under  195.50. Among other such events would be violation of operating procedures,
and abnormal operating conditions or emergency conditions as set out in the proposed   192.811(d)(4)-(d)(5)
and   195.511(d)(3)-(d)(4).

<TEXT>
 

Within 2 months after a competency review, the operator would be required to have identified and implemented appropriate
revisions, if any are identified, in the qualification program to reduce the likelihood of the reoccurrence of a similar
accident or event. 

Sections 192.819 and 195.519 would require the operators to prepare and maintain records showing that personnel
have been trained and tested as required. Additionally, the operator would be required to sign and date certification
statements specifying the covered functions for which each person is qualified. The date of the certification statement
becomes the date of the persons qualification for the specified covered functions. Records would be kept for a minimum
of 3 years after a person is no longer employed by the operator in a capacity that requires qualification. 


Relation to Other Qualification Rules 


Except for the removal of  195.403 discussed above, RSPA does not intend that the qualification rules proposed
by this notice substitute for any of the existing requirements of parts 192 and 195 governing the qualification of
personnel to perform specific functions. Consequently, individuals who perform functions requiring qualification
under the existing pipeline safety regulations such as welding, nondestructive testing, corrosion control, or
plastic pipe joining as part of a regulated operation, maintenance, or emergency-response function on a pipeline
would have to meet both the existing job-specific qualification requirements, and the additional qualification
standards put forth in this notice. 


Contractor Personnel 


The proposed regulations apply to persons performing covered functions and supervisory persons directly overseeing
persons performing covered functions. The persons may be employed by the operator, be a contractor engaged by the
operator, or be employed by the contractor. Thus, contractor and subcontractor personnel performing covered functions
for an operator on the pipeline would be required to be qualified, as prescribed in this notice. 

The pipeline operator is responsible for assuring that contractor personnel performing covered functions comply
with the proposed qualification requirements. To comply with this requirement, operators may elect to implement
the following steps: (1) include appropriate ``qualification of personnel'' clauses in contracts with contractors;
(2) require contractors to prepare and keep current records demonstrating that personnel performing covered functions
receive training, testing and refresher training and, if required, competency reviews as required by the proposed
requirements in this notice; and (3) monitor onsite contractor personnel to ensure that persons performing covered
functions are qualified and certified as proposed in this notice. 


Proposed Compliance Deadlines 


RSPA proposes, under   192.821(a)-(b) and 195.521(a), that all pipeline operators be given 6 months
to prepare a qualification training and testing schedule. However, operators of small gas systems would be given
3 years and all other pipeline operators would be given 2 years to comply with all other requirements for personnel
qualification under the proposed   192.821 and 195.521. Based on the recommendations of the joint advisory
committees made on September 23, 1987, that the regulations be sensitive to the limited financial and technical resources
of operators of small gas distribution systems, the proposed   192.821(b)(2)-(b)(4) would allow
operators of such systems an additional year to comply with all the regulations except the requirement for preparation
of the qualification training and testing schedule as set out in 
 192.821(b)(1). This extra year should provide a reasonable time period for small gas distribution operators
to utilize the state, Federal, and gas association training aids to develop the relevant training and testing required
to qualify personnel to whom these proposed rules would apply. All the compliance dates begin at the date of promulgation
of the final rule in the 

Federal Register

. 
Operators of pipelines subject to part 195 remain subject to  195.403 until the proposed subpart G becomes effective.



Rulemaking Analyses 


E.O. 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


This proposed rule is considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and,
therefore, is subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The proposal is considered significant
under the Department of Transportation Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979), because of the substantial
interest expressed by the pipeline industry, state and Federal agencies, and Congress. A regulatory evaluation

Federalism Assessment 


The proposed rulemaking action would not have substantial direct effects on states, on the relationship between
the Federal Government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), RSPA has determined
that this notice does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Based on the facts available about the impact of this rulemaking action, I certify pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C 601-612) that the action will not, if adopted as final, have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Paperwork Reduction Act 



This notice of proposed rulemaking contains information collection requirements in the form of written or computerized
training and testing schedules under the proposed   192.809 and 195.509, and recordkeeping to substantiate
the training and testing of personnel under the proposed   192.819 and 195.519. These paperwork requirements
are necessary to properly implement 49 U.S.C.  60102. The operator would develop the schedules and prepare
and maintain the personnel training and testing records for proper performance of the proposed rule. However, pipeline
operators with adequately qualified personnel currently have such records of training and testing. For persons
newly trained and tested under the requirements of this proposal, much of the information required for the personnel
records would be available in the required qualification schedules. None of these information collection requirements
would be prepared for the purpose of submittal to RSPA. 

These proposed information collection requirements have been submitted to the OMB for approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chap. 35) and 5 CFR 1320 under the following: 



ADMINISTRATION:

 Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration;

Parts and Accessories Necessary For Safe Operation; Automatic Brake Adjusters and Brake Adjustment Indicators



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FHWA is proposing to require the use of automatic brake adjusters (ABAs) on hydraulically-braked commercial
motor vehicles (CMVs) and air-braked CMVs manufactured on or after October 20, 1993, and October 20, 1994, respectively.
The FHWA is also proposing a requirement for brake adjustment indicators on air-braked CMVs with external adjustment
mechanisms manufactured on or after October 20, 1994. This rulemaking is intended to: Insure that the operational
standards for brakes in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) are consistent with the manufacturing
standards in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs) numbers 105 and 121, which now require the installation
of automatic brake adjusters and adjustment indicators on certain CMVs manufactured on or after these dates; and
improve the safety of operation of CMVs by reducing the incidence of brakes that are out of adjustment. 


In addition, the FHWA requests information concerning the possibility of requiring these devices to be retrofitted
to CMVs placed in operation prior to the effective dates of the recent amendments to FMVSS Nos. 105 and 121.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


A. General Information 


Proper brake adjustment is critical to the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. When brakes are correctly
adjusted, vehicles can generally be brought to a stop within a satisfactory distance and in a controlled manner. However,
brakes that are not properly adjusted cannot develop the retardation force designed into the vehicle's brake system,
resulting in increased stopping distances. Under emergency conditions, this can result in a collision that might
otherwise have been avoided, or in a more severe collision than would have occurred with properly-adjusted brakes.

Out-of-adjustment brakes are the primary equipment-related cause for commercial motor vehicles to be placed out
of service during roadside inspections. According to the FHWA's Office of Motor Carrier Field Operations Annual
Report for Fiscal Year 1992, 36.2 percent of vehicles placed out-of-service are cited for this deficiency. A copy
of this report has been placed in the docket. 
In addition, brake-related accidents, some stemming from gross brake maladjustment, are also a factor in some ``equipment
malfunction'' CMV accident citations. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) regulatory
evaluation, prepared in conjunction with their rulemaking on automatic brake adjusters (ABAs), noted that 6.8 percent
of all medium and heavy truck accidents were reported as being caused by defective equipment. Of that figure, 31 percent
were due to defective brakes, with 60 percent of those brakes judged to be out of adjustment; this amounts to 1.3 percent
of accidents reported_or nearly 4,000 accidents per year. The regulatory evaluation also cited a review of National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reports on 97 serious heavy truck accidents investigated from 1969 to 1981. Out-of-adjustment
brakes were cited as a causal or contributing factor in 27 of those 97 accidents, or 28 percent. A copy of the NHTSA's
regulatory evaluation has been placed in the docket. 


B. Safety and Operational Role of Automatic Brake Adjusters and Brake Adjustment Indicators 


Automatic brake adjusters significantly reduce the effort required for inspection and manual adjustment of the
brakes. Clearance-sensing ABAs limit the clearance between brake linings and drums, or pads and rotors, to a level
that ensures effective brake actuator strokes. They adjust on every complete brake application. Stroke-sensing
ABAs adjust on brake applications severe enough to cause the brake actuator stroke to exceed that which the ABA is designed
to maintain. ABAs include, but are not necessarily limited to, automatic slack adjusters (ASAs). The term ``automatic
brake adjusters'' is used to provide a performance-based description of this class of devices. 
Brake adjustment indicators (BAIs), especially when used in concert with ABAs, can do a great deal to address the brake
adjustment problem. A BAI conforming to the NHTSA requirements can significantly reduce the time necessary to assess
brake adjustment levels. Use of these indicators will make it easier for drivers and maintenance personnel to make
brake-adjustment checks at more frequent intervals, and detect brake adjustment problems before they become severe
enough to cause, or worsen the outcome of, an accident. 


C. NHTSA and NTSB Research on CMV Brake Performance and ABAs. 


Two extensive research studies of CMV brake performance, and operational and maintenance experiences of motor carrier
fleets utilizing CMVs equipped with ABAs, have been performed by the NHTSA and the NTSB. We summarize both here. Copies
of the NHTSA and the NTSB studies are available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS, Springfield,
Virginia, telephone (800) 553-6847). Copies have also been placed in the public docket. 


1. NHTSA Research. 

The NHTSA research was reported in ``Automatic Brake Adjusters for Heavy Vehicle Air Brake Systems,'' February 1991,
report DOT-HS-807-724 (PB 91-215814). Seven fleets participated during a 2.5-year initial study
period and an additional 3 years of follow-up; 245 tractors and 289 trailers accumulated nearly 50 million miles of
travel during this time. 
Researchers and fleet maintenance staffs made nearly 20,000 measurements of brake stroke length on approximately
1,800 brake adjusters (four different manufacturers' ABAs, plus manual brake adjusters (MBAs)). For 36 types of
ABA installations, the median out-of-adjustment rate was 4.0 percent, and the median number of out-of-adjustment
observations per brake per 10,000 miles was 0.016. The NHTSA noted that ``[t]he ASAs tested were principally models
designed and marketed in the early to mid 1980's. There have been extensive design improvements in both ASAs and other
brake system components since that time. Thus, the performance data presented here for these earlier ASA designs
likely understate the performance levels that can be expected from ASAs purchased today.'' 
The NHTSA collected a limited amount of control data on MBAs. There were 96 MBAs used in portions of 3 of the fleets. The
use of MBAs generally resulted in higher percentages and rates of out-of-adjustment brakes than did the use of ABAs,
and the differences were considered to be statistically significant. 


2. NTSB Research. 

The NTSB, an independent Federal agency responsible for investigating and determining the probable cause or causes
of certain transportation-related accidents, has studied numerous accidents in which brake deficiencies have
been cited as causal factors.

A recent NTSB study, ``Heavy Vehicle Airbrake Performance,'' adopted April 29, 1992, report NTSB/SS-92/01
(PB 92-917003), analyzed information gathered over a 17-month period from selected brake-related accidents
involving heavy trucks and buses, as well as data collected by NTSB staff during roadside inspections in 5 States.
The report's findings highlighted the role of brake system components in certain vehicle instability accidents,
and pointed out that many brake out-of-adjustment problems were due both to the small tolerance range and to a lack
of proper brake maintenance. The NTSB recommended that the DOT, among other things: (1) Require air-braked vehicles
to be equipped with visible adjustment indicators that will allow one person to check the level of adjustment (Recommendation
H-92-50); 
(2) require automatic adjusters on vehicles equipped with airbrake systems (Recommendation H-92-51);
and (3) encourage the installation of visible brake adjustment indicators on all vehicles equipped with air brake
systems for easy detection of adjustment levels (Recommendation H-92-57). 


D. NHTSA Requirement for ABAs and Automatic Adjustment Indicators 


The FHWA strives to maintain consistency between the manufacturing standards for commercial motor vehicles contained
in the NHTSA's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs), and the operations and maintenance regulations
contained in the FMCSRs. On October 20, 1992 (57 FR 47793), the NHTSA issued a final rule amending FMVSS No. 105, 

Hydraulic Brake Systems, 

to require ABAs on motor vehicles equipped with hydraulic brake systems. The NHTSA also amended FMVSS No. 121, 

Air Brake Systems, 

to require ABAs on all air-braked motor vehicles and adjustment indicators on air-braked vehicles with external
adjustment mechanisms. The effective dates are October 20, 1993, for the amendments to FMVSS No. 105 and October 20,
1994, for the amendments to FMVSS No. 121. 
While the NHTSA rulemaking requires manufacturers to equip new vehicles with ABAs in order to ensure brakes are in
proper adjustment, it does not affect the readjustment limits used by the States in roadside inspections nor those
required by the FHWA for periodic inspections (contained in Appendix G to the FMCSRs, ``Minimum Periodic Inspection
Standards''). The reach of the NHTSA's regulatory authority extends only to vehicle manufacturers. The FMCSRs apply
to employers, employees, and commercial motor vehicles which transport property or passengers in interstate commerce.



E. Brake Adjustment Criteria 


The North American Uniform Driver-Vehicle Inspection Procedure (NAUDVIP) provides a standardized procedure used
by States and local governments to inspect in-service CMVs. The NAUDVIP was developed by the Commercial Vehicle Safety
Alliance (CVSA). The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance is an association of Federal, State, and Provincial officials
responsible for the administration and enforcement of motor carrier safety laws in the United States, Canada, and
Mexico, who work together to enhance commercial motor vehicle safety. 
As a part of the NAUDVIP, the CVSA specifies certain limits for pushrod travel. These limits, which are identical to
the limits contained in Appendix G to the FMCSRs, ``Minimum Periodic Inspection Standards,'' have been set in consultation
with motor carrier safety enforcement officials and brake manufacturers. Brakes at or beyond these limits are considered
to be out of adjustment. 
The origin of the CVSA out-of-adjustment criteria can be traced back to the California Highway Patrol (CHP) inspection
criteria established in the 1960's. The CHP readjustment limits were based on brake adjustment limits developed
by the former Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (now the American Automobile Manufacturers Association,
which no longer deals with heavy truck issues). These limits are approximately 80 percent of full brake chamber stroke.
This is generally the point on the force versus stroke curve for a typical brake chamber where the brake force starts
decreasing rapidly with increasing stroke. 
CVSA criteria regarding brake adjustment limits specify that a vehicle is to be placed out of service if 20 percent
or more of its brakes are defective. A brake is considered 

defective

 if its adjustment is 

1/4 inch (6.5 mm) or more beyond the readjustment limit. 

Two brakes at the readjustment limit or less than 1/4 inch beyond the readjustment limit are also considered one 

defective

 brake. For example, on a 5-axle combination vehicle with 10 brakes, 4 brakes at the readjustment limit would be considered
as 2 defective brakes, and would also result in an out-of-service condition. 
Since the readjustment limits are based upon the characteristics of the brake chamber, the use of ABAs would not affect
the brake chamber output force. Therefore, the FHWA believes that the current readjustment limits are appropriate
for CMVs equipped with ABAs, as well as those currently equipped with MBAs. When properly installed and maintained,
ABAs can thus help prevent sudden and unexpected loss of braking ability due to a loss of brake force resulting from
excessive pushrod stroke. 


F. ABA Installation and Reliability 


As noted in the NHTSA's final rule, ABAs are currently being installed on a large percentage of newly-manufactured
medium- and heavy-duty air-braked vehicles. Some fleets have been specifying ABAs for their vehicles for a number
of years. However, NHTSA also noted that one major manufacturer and several smaller ones did not provide ABAs as standard
equipment, and many purchasers did not order them as optional equipment. In addition, the majority of CMVs currently
in operation are not equipped with ABAs.

<TEXT>
 

Brake adjuster lifespan generally depends upon the number of brake applications and the number of brake service cycles
of the CMV. The NHTSA fleet study noted that most ABAs observed performed for the duration of the study without mechanical
failure. The researchers did observe some mechanical failures, and some apparent failures that were actually due
to other problems in the brake system, such as wear in the foundation brakes. A number of the failures were caused by
wear to specific parts. The manufacturers reported that they have implemented design changes to remedy those problems.
The NHTSA's supplemental fleet data collected in 1988-1990 on newer ABAs indicated high levels of reliability.
The reported average replacement rates for ABAs were 0.06 replacements per million tractor miles and 0.3 per million
trailer miles. 

The NHTSA research report emphasized that ABAs must be installed in accordance with manufacturer specifications
to maintain efficient adjustments. In most cases, no special adjustments in brake component geometry are required.
Manufacturers of these devices provide drawings, templates, and similar aids to facilitate installation. 

The figures for CMVs placed out of service appear to indicate that there are considerable difficulties in monitoring
brake adjustment status. The findings of the NHTSA research demonstrate that BAIs, especially when used in concert
with ABAs, can make a significant contribution to resolving the brake adjustment problem. Aside from the clear safety
benefits of maintaining proper brake adjustment, ABAs can have a positive benefit on motor carrier productivity
by preventing CMVs from being placed out of service, reducing roadside service calls and the resulting delays to transportation
operations. 

A BAI conforming to the NHTSA requirements (49 CFR 571.121) can significantly reduce the time needed to assess brake
adjustment status. As their name implies, BAIs provide a visible indication of pushrod stroke. There are several
varieties: some BAIs consist of color-coded or scribed marks on the pushrod, others raise a plastic or metal ``flag''
when the pushrod stroke reaches the prescribed adjustment limit. 

ABAs do not eliminate the need for periodic inspection and maintenance of the brake system, but they do reduce the need
for brake adjustment. Recommended Practice RP-609 of The Maintenance Council of the American Trucking Associations
states that ``[a]n automatic slack adjuster should not have to be manually adjusted except for initial installation
and at brake reline * * *.'' If adjustment is needed, it could be a sign that the ABA is not working or that
there is a problem with the [foundation] brake system. Brake actuator strokes must still be monitored, of course.


Like their manual counterparts, ABAs and BAIs require regular maintenance. They operate in the same hostile and exposed
environment as manual systems. The NHTSA notes that their performance is affected by failures and wear in other parts
of the foundation brake system, and, like other components, their life expectancy can be less than that of the tractor
or trailer on which they are installed. 


Discussion of Proposal 



The FHWA believes that the information presented in the reports cited above indicates that both motor carriers and
the travelling public may derive substantial operational and safety benefits from the use of automatic brake adjusters
and brake adjustment indicators. 

The FHWA proposes to amend the FMCSRs by adding a new 
 393.53, Automatic Brake Adjusters and Brake Adjustment Indicators. This section would be added to Subpart
C, Brakes. 

The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) would require that automatic brake adjusters and brake adjustment
indicators installed on newly manufactured CMVs to comply with the requirements of FMVSS 105 and 121 be maintained
by the motor carriers operating those CMVs. 


Questions 



The FHWA believes there are also opportunities for improvements to operational safety of CMVs manufactured prior
to the effective dates of the recent amendments to FMVSS 105 and 121. The FHWA therefore requests information regarding
the potential impacts of requiring CMVs subject to the FMCSRs to be retrofitted with ABAs, and for requiring air-braked
CMVs with external adjustment mechanisms to be retrofitted with brake adjustment indicators. The FHWA specifically
requests comments on the following questions: 

1. Should air-braked CMVs manufactured before the effective date of NHTSA's rule be required to be retrofitted with
ABAs? 

2. Should all air-braked CMVs with external brake adjustment mechanisms be required to be retrofitted with brake
adjustment indicators? 

3. If certain CMVs are to be retrofitted, how much time should be allowed for installation of the new equipment? 

4. Are there certain types or configurations of air-braked vehicles that cannot be equipped with ABAs because of space
limitations around the axles and wheels? 

5. Should different periods be specified for retrofitting single-unit trucks, tractors, converter dollies, and
trailers?

6. The requirements proposed by this NPRM would exclude air-braked vehicles that were not subject to FMVSS No. 121
on the date of manufacture. (Vehicles not subject to the requirements are listed under Paragraph S3 of  571.121,
and include certain types of limited- or specialized-use vehicles such as wide trailers, vehicles equipped with
an axle with a gross axle weight rating of 29,000 pounds or more, any truck or bus that has a speed attainable in 2 miles
of not more than 33 mph, heavy hauler trailer sets, and load divider dollies.) Should specific types of CMVs, or CMVs
used in unique operations, (i.e., CMVs that are 

not

 subject to the requirements of FMVSS 121, but are subject to the FMCSRs) be exempt from a requirement to be retrofitted
with ABAs? Should these specific types of air-braked CMVs manufactured on or after October 20, 1994, be required to
be 

equipped

 with ABAs prior to being placed in operation in interstate commerce? Please provide details. 

7. What are the costs associated with retrofitting an ABA compared to replacement of an MBA? Please include the cost
of the device, the time required to complete the installation, and a representative hourly salary of the mechanic
performing the installation. Please also include a ``loss of use'' cost figure if a CMV were to be taken out of revenue
service for retrofitting at some time other than a time when a brake adjuster would normally be due for replacement.
How often do tractors and trailers visit a facility where retrofitting could take place? 

8. Should the FHWA consider a retrofitting requirement for hydraulically-braked CMVs? Please address the cost questions
asked in Question 7. 

The FHWA requests that commenters address the specific questions above. However, the FHWA encourages commenters
to include a discussion of any other issues that the commenters believe are relevant to the use and/or retrofitting
of automatic brake adjusters and brake adjustment indicators on CMVs. 


Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above will be considered
and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address. Comments received after the comment closing
date will be filed in the public docket and will be considered to the extent practicable. In addition to late comments,
the FHWA will also continue to file, in the public docket, relevant information that becomes available after the comment
closing date. Interested persons should continue to examine the public docket for new material. 


Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



The FHWA has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order
12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. This
rule would, if adopted, provide a companion operational standard for brakes in the FMCSRs to make them consistent
with the manufacturing standards in the FMVSSs 105 and 121. It would require automatic brake adjusters and brake adjustment
indicators installed on newly manufactured CMVs in accordance with those manufacturing standards to be maintained
by the motor carriers operating those vehicles. Based on the NHTSA studies, the FHWA believes that operation and maintenance
costs of the automatic brake adjusters and adjustment indicators required under the new FMVSSs will be lower than
costs of the devices previously required. Although the FHWA requests information concerning the possibility of
requiring these devices to be retrofitted to CMVs placed in operation prior to the effective dates of FMVSSs 105 and
121, no rule to require such retrofitting is being proposed at this time. It is anticipated that the economic impact
of this rulemaking will be minimal; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. If the FHWA proposes
retrofitting of these devices at some future date, a regulatory evaluation of the effects of that action will be prepared
at that time. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 



In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(5 U.S.C. 601-612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this proposed rule on small entities. This rule would
modify the operational standards for brakes in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to make them
consistent with the manufacturing standards in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs) numbers 105
and 121, which now require the installation of automatic brake adjusters and adjustment indicators on certain newly-manufactured
CMVs. As stated above, the FHWA believes that operation and maintenance costs of the automatic brake adjusters and
adjustment indicators required under the new FMVSSs will be lower than costs of the devices previously required.
Therefore, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a federalism assessment. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 



This action does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 


National Environmental Policy Act 



The agency has analyzed this action for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321


et seq.

) and has determined that this action would not have any effect on the quality of the environment.

Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment; Denial of Petition for Rulemaking


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Denial of petition for rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice denies a petition for rulemaking by Baran Advanced Technologies, Ltd., to amend Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard No. 108 to allow the abrupt release of the accelerator pedal to operate stop lamps. The reason for the
denial is the importance of retaining the existing requirement for activating the stop lamps only through application
of the brake pedal in order to avoid confusion.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Baran Advanced Technologies, Ltd. of Israel manufactures a device called ``Red Alert'' which is intended to activate
the stop lamps during emergency braking before the brake pedal is applied, thereby providing an earlier warning for
following vehicles. The device senses the rate at which the accelerator pedal returns to its upper stop after being
released. It activates the stop lamps for one second if the accelerator pedal reaches its upper stop at greater than
a certain predetermined rate. Its operation is based on the assumption that any rapid release of the accelerator pedal
is the beginning of an emergency braking maneuver, and thus will be immediately followed by application of the brake
pedal. Application of the brake pedal continues to activate the stop lamp in the usual way. If the brake pedal is depressed
within one second of the release of the accelerator, the brake light will remain on at the end of the initial one second
period of activation and thus provide a steady signal.


Standard No. 108 requires that stop lamps ``shall be activated upon application of the service brakes.'' That requirement
has been interpreted to mean that the stop lamps are to be activated only upon activation of the service brakes. Some
years ago, Baran's competitor in the Israeli market, ATAT, sought an interpretation of Standard No. 108 that would
allow the aftermarket installation of its similar Advanced Brake Light Device (ABLD) in the U.S. In a letter of January
25, 1990, to Larry Snowhite, Esq., the agency concluded that accelerator release activation by an aftermarket device
such as the ABLD would render the stop lamps partially inoperative within the meaning of the prohibition of 15 U.S.C.
1397(a)(2)(A). Said NHTSA:



The heart of our concern is that while the standard requires the stop lamp to operate in only one particular circumstance,
the ABLD causes the stop lamp to operate at an earlier time when the lamp is supposed to be unlighted. Further, the ABLD's
activation of the stop lamp indicates only that the operator has released the accelerator. It does not necessarily
follow that the brake pedal will be applied. Under this fact situation, the stop lamps fulfill a purpose other than
for which they are installed. This can only create the potential for confusion and dilution of the effectiveness of
the stop signal. For the reasons stated above, we have concluded that installation of the ABLD in the aftermarket would
render the stop lamps partially inoperative.



Baran's ``Red Alert'' and ATAT's ABLD operate under the same fundamental principle of measuring the accelerator
pedal return rate to anticipate emergency braking. ATAT did not report its threshold rate for accelerator pedal release.
However, the fact that its false alarm rate is similar to that of the Baran system suggests that the activation of both
systems is based on a similar threshold rate of accelerator release. These rates are discussed later in the notice.
NHTSA has examined Baran's petition in an effort to balance possible safety benefits of the device against the possible
safety disbenefits of signal confusion.
The first issue is whether the petitioner can demonstrate that its device is likely to lessen the number of accidents.
Baran estimates large reductions in rear-end accidents using figures from a paper by Enke ``Possibilities for Improving
Safety Within the Driver-Vehicle Environment Control Loop'' and from a NHTSA report on Intelligent Vehicle Highway
System (IVHS) countermeasures to rear end accidents (DOT HS 807 995). Enke's paper estimates that the impact speed
of 25 percent of rear end accidents is no more than 10 km/hr (9 ft/sec) and that the amount of distance traveled at the
assumed initial speed for 0.25 second equals the distance required to stop from the impact speed. Baran claims that
``based on Enke's analysis, providing a driver with an additional .25 seconds of warning of an impending stop by the
leading driver could result in a 25 to 30 percent reduction in all rear-end accidents.''
NHTSA disputes this conclusion. Enke's analysis presumes that the following driver is attentive to the very first
glimmer of a stop signal from the car ahead and that (s)he reacts immediately even though a speed differential has not
yet occurred. It also presumes that the lead driver decelerates so rapidly that the following driver cannot ``outbrake''
the lead driver and that the initial distance between them is less than following driver's reaction time multiplied
by the initial speed. NHTSA views these presumptions as unrealistic.
Further, NHTSA's IVHS report characterizes a rear-end crash as ``largely a dry/straight road phenomenon associated
with driver inattention.'' It found the lead vehicle stopped (LVS) in 75 percent of rear-end crashes, which



Typically do not involve simply a ``too-slow'' reaction of the following driver to a sudden crash threat. In the most
common scenario, the lead vehicle is stopped for an extended interval (i.e., 2-6 seconds) before it is struck
by the following vehicle. There is adequate time to provide a warning to the following driver and for the driver to avoid
the crash. Vehicles involved in this crash subtype should not be viewed as a locked pair where one vehicle is following
the other at a specified distance. Instead, the following vehicle is closing on a stationary object. The initial gap
distance between the vehicles is often several hundred feet or more. No cases were identified where a lead vehicle
decelerated rapidly and then was hit by a closely following vehicle immediately after coming to a stop.



It is difficult to see how a 0.25 second advance stop lamp warning would be of any use in the 75 percent of rear-end accidents
in the LVS category when prolonged driver inattention appears to be a near universal cause.

The report characterized the remaining 25 percent of rear-end accidents, those in which the lead vehicle was moving
(LVM) at impact, as follows:



In contrast, the LVM crash subtype may involve driver reaction time following a sudden crash threat as a critical factor.
Vehicles involved in this circumstance are often ``locked pairs'' with one vehicle following the other. However,
gaps or following distances can range from a few lengths to very substantial distances even in this subtype. Not all
LVM crashes are precipitated by rapid deceleration of the lead vehicle. Many involve slow decelerations (e.g., typical
slowing before a turn) or simply a speed differential between the lead and following vehicles.



This also indicates that driver inattentiveness is critical in LVM crashes. It is hard to accept that a 0.25 second
advance in stop lamp activation would be of value to an inattentive following driver. NHTSA accepts the IVHS report
as an accurate reflection of the conditions under which rear-end collisions happen, and has concluded that Red Alert
would not provide an adequate warning to avoid these collisions in virtually all the circumstances under which they
occur.
Nevertheless, a manufacturer should not be precluded from offering its product, even if safety benefits cannot be
demonstrated, unless there are potential safety disbenefits created by the product. The agency objected to ATAT's
ABLD because it was not an unambiguous signal of brake application. NHTSA believed that such devices created the potential
for confusion and dilution of the effectiveness of the stop signal. It pointed out that the activation of the stop signal
under the requested circumstances only signified that the accelerator had been released. It did not necessarily
follow that the brakes would be applied. The brakes were not applied 28 percent of time that the ABLD activated in a test
report submitted by its proponent, ATAT. Similarly, the brakes were not applied 23 percent of the time the ``Red Alert''
activated in a test report submitted as part of Baran's petition.
However, both devices activated the stop lamps far less frequently than did the ordinary brake switch activated by
depression of the brake pedal. During their respective tests, the ABLD activated the stop signal about 3 percent as
frequently as the ordinary brake switch did. ``Red Alert'' activated the signal about 1.2 percent as frequently.
Both tests compared the number of false alarms to the number of ordinary stop signal activations of one second or less.
False alarms of ``Red Alert'' were about 2.4 percent as frequent as short brake applications, and false alarms of the
ATAT device were reported as less than 10 percent as frequent as short brake applications. The conditions under which
the two devices were tested differed greatly. ATAT used a special test course, three test vehicles and a limited number
of test subjects who knew that some undisclosed part of their driving behavior was being evaluated. Baran installed
``Red Alert'' on six communal car pool vehicles that were operated for a period of months in ordinary traffic by various
drivers who had no knowledge that their behavior was being measured. Given the large variations in activation and
false alarm rates between test vehicles within each test and the differences in test conditions between the ABLD and
``Red Alert'' tests, there is no reason to believe that the two devices vary significantly in activation rate and false
alarm performance.
The activation rate observed in both tests seems to be too high for true emergency braking actions, as neither test
documented an actual incident of emergency braking. ATAT did not report either observing emergency maneuvers or
questioning its subjects regarding such instances, but it did measure the foot movement times when the accelerator
control activated the stop lamp. A range between 0.23 and 0.77 second was observed. When ATAT's subjects were asked
to perform fast accelerator to brake movements, the 5th and 95th percentile times were 0.10 and 0.28 second respectively.
It appears that very few of the activations in ATAT's test of an accelerator controlled stop lamp were rapid enough
to indicate an emergency. Baran did not report measurements of foot movement times, but it assumed that ``Red Alert''
activations were equivalent to instances of emergency braking. ``Red Alert'' was characterized as providing an
advance warning of 0.35 second which falls outside of ATAT's rapid foot movement range.
Both manufacturers argued that the false alarms were insignificant because they were few in comparison to the quite
large number of brake applications of less than one second. Baran also argued that the short brake applications themselves
had little significance because the duration of brake effort would be further reduced by the time consumed to build
up pressure and to release the brake pedal within one second. Baran pointed out that a short brake application may represent
only a release of cruise control, a state of preparedness or a warning to other drivers. While these facts tend to diminish
the importance of the systematic false alarms, they also demonstrate why following drivers are unlikely to act at
the instant of the stop lamp illumination in the absence of closing speed or some other cue. All the test experience
reported for accelerator controlled stop lamps involved leading and following drivers who were unaware of the use
of the device. But this device facilitates intentional false alarms as well as systemic occurrences. Its widespread
use would raise suspicions of intentional false alarms on the part of drivers in following vehicles. Intentional
false alarms can and will occur, sending a misleading signal to the driver behind.
To sum up, the idea that a slightly anticipatory brake lamp will prevent large numbers of rear-end collisions is intuitively
attractive. However, it ignores the fact that lack of driver attention is the root cause of rear-end accidents. It
is unlikely than an extra quarter second of brake light activation would cure or offset the inattentiveness of a following
driver.
The agency concludes that the potential safety benefits are minimal, but it will consider the results of the Israeli
Highway Safety Administration's trial of accelerator-controlled stop lamps when they are available. While Baran's
data indicate that the absolute numbers of systematic false alarms may be small on average, a perception by following
drivers that the brake signal allowed false alarms, whether or not intentional, might dilute the currently unambiguous
message of the stop signal. The agency previously found that ATAT's device would render the stop lamp partially inoperative
as a result of the same loss of unambiguous operation. There are no fundamental differences between the systems to
cause the agency to change its determination or even to allow the agency to distinguish between them in a regulation.
Accordingly, NHTSA has conducted and concluded a technical review of the petition, and has determined that there
is not a reasonable possibility that the amendment requested would be issued at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding.
Accordingly, the petition by Baran Advanced Technologies, Ltd., for rulemaking to amend Standard No. 108 is denied.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 By petition filed March 29, 1994, the National Association of Reversionary Property Owners (NARPO) sought a rulemaking
in order to amend the Commission's procedural rules concerning the Rails-to-Trails Program, 16 U.S.C. 1247(d).
The Commission, however, has previously addressed similar arguments raised by NARPO. In a decision served February
21, 1990, the Commission, upon reconsideration of a decision served May 26, 1989, 54 FR 22970 (1989), declined to amend
the rules implementing the National Trails System Act and found that the requirements sought by NARPO would be time-consuming,
expensive, and burdensome and were not warranted given the Commission's limited involvement in trail use proposals
and the purpose of the Trails Act, which is to encourage and facilitate interim trail use.

The law applicable to our previous decisions has not changed. Therefore, NARPO's petition for rulemaking is denied.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Endangered Status for Five Freshwater Mussels and Proposed
Threatened Status for Two Freshwater Mussels From Eastern Gulf Slope Drainages of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list seven freshwater mussels: The fat three-ridge (

Amblema neislerii

), shiny-rayed pocketbook (

Lampsilis subangulata

), Gulf moccasinshell (

Medionidus penicillatus

), Ochlockonee moccasinshell (

Medionidus simpsonianus

), and oval pigtoe (

Pleurobema pyriforme

) as endangered, and the Chipola slabshell (

Elliptio chipolaensis

) and purple bankclimber (

Elliptoideus sloatianus

) as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. These mussels are endemic to eastern Gulf
Slope streams draining the Apalachicolan Region of southeast Alabama, southwest Georgia, and north Florida. They
are currently known from localized portions of from one to four isolated marine river systems, mostly in the eastern
portion of the Apalachicolan Region. Impoundments and deteriorating water and benthic (bottom) habitat quality
resulting from channel modification, siltation, agricultural runoff, silvicultural activities, mining activities,
pollutants, poor land use practices, increased urbanization, and waste discharges have resulted in the restriction
and fragmentation of these mussels current ranges. In addition, the Service has little evidence to suggest that populations
of these seven species of mussels are reproductively viable.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


The fat three-ridge, shiny-rayed pocketbook, Gulf moccasinshell, Ochlockonee moccasinshell, oval pigtoe, Chipola
slabshell, and purple bankclimber are freshwater mussels endemic to eastern Gulf Slope streams draining the Apalachicolan
Region (streams from the Escambia to the Suwannee river systems in southeast Alabama, southwest Georgia and north
Florida). The Apalachicolan Region primarily drains the Coastal Plain Physiographic Province. Only the headwaters
of the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers, in the Apalachicola River system, occur above the Fall Line in the Piedmont
Physiographic Province in west-central Georgia. Streams draining the East Gulf Coastal Plain are generally low
gradient and have substrates of sand, silty sand, mud, and gravel. Some streams, particularly in the Apalachicola
River system, have coarser substrates of cobble, boulders, and bedrock in addition to areas with softer bed materials.
The seven species of mussels being considered for listing inhabit medium-sized streams to large rivers with substrates
of silty sand, sand, or gravel, and mixtures of these substrates. All are generally found in areas with water currents,
often in stream channels swept free of silt. The life histories of these seven species of mussels are unknown and little
biological information is available. 
The Apalachicolan Region is known for its high level of endemicity, harboring nearly 30 species of endemic mussels
(Butler 1989), at least a dozen fishes, over 20 aquatic snails, and nearly two dozen species of crayfish. In addition,
several candidate species from the Service's animal notice of review published on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804)
are also known from the Apalachicolan Region, the majority being endemic to these drainages. One of these candidates,
the Ochlockonee arc-mussel is thought to be extinct (Turgeon 

et al.

 1988), last reported in the early 1930's (Williams and Butler, in press). A recent status survey for candidate species
of mussels in the Apalachicola River system did not locate any populations of the winged spike and lined pocketbook,
species endemic to this system that were last sighted in 1958 and 1967, respectively. Between 1991 and 1993, the Service's
National Fisheries Research Center, now the National Biological Survey, Biological Science Center, in Gainesville,
Florida, completed field surveys for mussels in both the Apalachicola (325 collections at 315 sites) and Ochlockonee
(77 collections at 72 sites) river systems. These surveys are summarized by Butler (1993), and the information is
sufficient to support a status recommendation of endangered for the fat three-ridge, shiny-rayed pocketbook, Gulf
moccasinshell, Ochlockonee moccasinshell, and oval pigtoe, and a status recommendation of threatened for the Chipola
slabshell and purple bankclimber. Common and scientific nomenclature used in this rule follows that suggested by
Turgeon 

et al.

 (1988).

The fat three-ridge (

Amblema neislerii

) is a medium-sized to large, subquadrate, inflated, solid, and heavy shelled mussel that reaches a length of 102 millimeters
(4.0 inches). Older individuals are often so inflated that their width approximates their length. The dark brown
to black shell is strongly sculptured with seven to eight prominent horizontal parallel ridges. Internally, there
are two subequal pseudocardinal teeth in the left valve and one large and one small tooth in the right valve. The nacre
is bluish white to light purplish and very iridescent. The Service considers 

Unio neislerii

 to be a synonym of 

Amblema neislerii.
This taxon was originally assigned to the genera Quadrula

 and 

Crenodonta

 by Simpson (1914) and Clench and Turner (1956), respectively. Subsequent investigators have placed the fat three-
ridge in the genus 

Amblema.

 The fat three-ridge was described from the Flint River, Macon County, Georgia, and it historically occurred in the
mainstems of the lower two-thirds of the Flint, the lower one-third of the Chipola, and in the Apalachicola rivers
(Clench and Turner 1956, Butler 1993). Since 1981, no live specimens have been found in the Flint River. Its present
range is restricted to six localities in Florida, three each in the Apalachicola River mainstem and the lowermost
Chipola River mainstem (Butler 1993). Only two of these localities have sizable populations, which number in the
dozens of specimens. However, the viability of these populations of the fat three-ridge is not known. The fat three-ridge
has a very low tolerance for impoundments.
The shiny-rayed pocketbook (

Lampsilis subangulata

) is a medium- sized mussel that reaches approximately 85 mm (3.3 in) in length. The shell is subelliptical, with broad,
somewhat inflated umbos and a rounded posterior ridge. The fairly thin but solid shell is smooth and shiny, and light
yellowish brown with fairly wide bright emerald green rays over its entire length. Older individuals appear much
darker brown with obscure raying. Internally, the pseudocardinal teeth are double and fairly large and erect in the
left valve with one large tooth and one spatulate tooth in the right valve. The nacre is white, with some individuals
exhibiting a salmon tint in the vicinity of the umbonal cavity. The Service recognizes 

Unio subangulatus

 and 

Unio kirklandianus

 as synonyms of 

Lampsilis subangulata.
The shiny-rayed pocketbook was described from the Chattahoochee River, Columbus, Georgia. Historically, this
mussel occurred at 18 different Flint River system localities including numerous tributaries and several mainstem
sites, 1 Chattahoochee River mainstem site and 6 sites in some of its tributaries, 2 sites in an Apalachicola River
tributary (Mosquito Creek), a couple of Chipola River tributary sites and several localities in the mainstem above
Dead Lake, and several sites in the Ochlockonee River mainstem from Talquin Reservoir upstream to Georgia and in a
couple of its tributaries (Clench and Turner 1956, Butler 1993). The 19 populations presently known are restricted
to: a single Uchee Creek system site in the Chattahoochee River system of Alabama, 11 scattered sites in Flint River
tributaries, 2 sites in the Chipola River system including a mainstem and tributary (Dry Creek) site, and 5 Ochlockonee
River mainstem and tributary sites in the upper half of the system (Butler 1993). The shiny-rayed pocketbook presently
occupies about two-thirds of its original range. Population sizes numbered in the dozens of individuals at a few historical
sites in both systems. However, recent collections are generally represented by only a few individuals, and evidence
of any production is scarce. This riverine species does not tolerate impoundments.
The Gulf moccasinshell (Medionidus penicillatus

), a small mussel, reaches a length of about 55 mm (2.2 in), is elongate-elliptical or rhomboidal in shape and fairly
inflated, and has relatively thin valves. The ventral margin is nearly straight or slightly rounded. The posterior
ridge is rounded to slightly angled and intersects the end of the shell at the base line. Females tend to have the posterior
point above the ventral margin and are somewhat more inflated than males. Sculpturing consists of a series of thin,
radially-oriented plications along the length of the posterior slope. The remainder of the shell surface is smooth
and yellowish to greenish brown with fine, typically interrupted green rays. The left valve has two stubby pseudocardinal
and two arcuate lateral teeth and the right valve has one pseudocardinal and one lateral tooth. Nacre color is smokey
purple or greenish and slightly iridescent at the posterior end. The Service recognizes 

Unio penicillatus

 and 

Unio kingi

 as synonyms of 

Medionidus penicillatus.

Much confusion clouds the taxonomy of Medionidus

 species in the Apalachicolan Region. In the Chipola River system, van der Schalie (1940) recorded two species of 

Medionidus 

(

M. kingi

 and 

M. penicillatus

). Clench and Turner (1956) synonomized 

M. kingi

 and two other nominate species, the Ochlockonee moccasinshell and Suwannee moccasinshell with the Gulf moccasinshell,
an arrangement also followed by Burch (1975). Johnson (1970) erroneously reported both the Gulf moccasinshell and
Suwannee moccasinshell from the Apalachicola River system and the Suwannee moccasinshell from the Ochlockonee
and Suwannee rivers as well. In his monograph on 

Medionidus,

 Johnson (1977) recognized the validity of the Gulf moccasinshell, Ochlockonee moccasinshell, and Suwannee moccasinshell
from Apalachicolan Region streams based on shell characters. Turgeon 

et al.

 (1988) also recognized the validity of these three allopatrically distributed mussels.
The Gulf moccasinshell was described from three sites in the Apalachicola River system in Georgia: the Chattahoochee
River near Columbus and Atlanta, and the Flint River near Albany. The historical distribution of this diminutive
species included 18 sites in the tributaries and mainstems of the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers, one Apalachicola
River site, and 12 sites in the Chipola River system. The Gulf moccasinshell is known from 38 historical sites and has
been eliminated from about three-quarters of its original range. It persists at eight tributary sites in the middle
Flint River system, and in Econfina Creek (Butler 1993) but has not been collected in the Choctawhatchee River system
since the early 1930's. Large populations (60+ individuals) were documented at several of historical sites in the
Chipola River system (van der Schalie 1940); they probably occurred in similar numbers at other sites as well. However,
recent collections of the Gulf moccasinshell indicate that only small populations persist today. The Service's
recent survey of the Apalachicola River system located a total of only 10 specimens. Given the small sample sizes,
the population viability of this species is questionable. The Gulf moccasinshell does not tolerate impoundments.
The Ochlockonee moccasinshell (

Medionidus simpsonianus

) is a small species, generally under 55 mm (2.5 in) in length. It is slightly elongate-elliptical in outline with the
posterior end obtusely rounded at the shell
s median line and the ventral margin broadly curved. The posterior ridge is moderately angular and covered in its entire
length with well developed, irregular ridges. Sculpturing may also extend onto the disk below the ridge and the surface
texture is smooth. The color is light brown to yellowish green, with dark green rays formed by a series of connecting
chevrons or undulating lines across the length of the shell. Internal characters include thin straight lateral teeth
and compressed pseudocardinal teeth. There are two laterals and two pseudocardinals in the left valve and one lateral
and one pseudocardinal in the right valve. The nacre is bluish white. The Service considers 

Unio simpsonianus

 to be a synonym of 

Medionidus simpsonianus.
The Ochlockonee moccasinshell was described from the Ochlockonee River, Calvary, Grady County, Georgia. This mussel
was known historically from six sites in the mainstem above Talquin Reservoir, three each in Georgia and Florida,
and single site locations on the lower mainstem below Talquin Reservoir and in the Little River (Johnson 1977, Butler
1993). However, since 1974, the Ochlockonee moccasinshell has been represented by only two live individuals (both
found as individuals at a single site in the mainstem above Talquin Reservoir in Florida in the past 5 years) despite
concerted efforts by numerous investigators to locate additional populations. Four weathered dead shells were
found at other mainstem sites in the past few years, including two sites in Georgia and one site in Florida. Once a fairly
common species, with some populations numbering in the dozens of individuals, the Ochlockonee moccasinshell is
now one of the rarest mussels in North America. This narrow endemic does not tolerate impoundment conditions.
The oval pigtoe (Pleurobema pyriforme

) is a small to medium-sized mussel that attains a length of about 60 mm (2.4 in). The shell is suboviform compressed,
with a shiny smooth epidermis. The periostracum is yellowish, chestnut, or dark brown, rayless, and with distinct
growth lines. The posterior slope is biangulate and forms a blunt point on the posterior margin. The umbos are slightly
elevated above the hingeline. As is typical of the genus, no sexual dimorphism is displayed in shell characters. Internally
the pseudocardinal teeth are fairly large, crenulate and double in both valves. The lateral teeth are somewhat shortened,
arcuate and double in each valve. Nacre color varies from salmon to bluish white and is iridescent posteriorly. Variation
in this species has led to the description of various nominal species. The Service recognizes 

Unio pyriforme, Unio modicus, Unio bulbosus, Unio amabilis, Unio reclusum, Unio harperi,

 and 

Pleurobema simpsoni

 as synonyms of 

Pleurobema pyriforme.

The oval pigtoe was described from the Chattahoochee River, 
near Columbus, Georgia. Historically, this species was one of the 
most widely distributed mussels endemic to the Apalachicolan Region. 
It occurred throughout the mainstems and several tributaries of both 
the Flint (16 sites) and Chipola (10 sites) river systems, at 5 
sites in the Chattahoochee River system including one mainstem site, 
all associated with the Fall Line in Alabama and Georgia, at 6 sites 
in the Ochlockonee River mainstem above Talquin Reservoir in Florida 
and Georgia, at a single site on the lower Suwannee River and 15 
sites in the upper Santa Fe River system, its major tributary, in 
north Florida, and at a site in Econfina Creek, in northwest Florida 
(Clench and Turner 1956, Butler 1993). Fifty-four total historical 
sites are known. Existing populations have been verified from 21 
sites, including 5 scattered tributaries (7 sites) of the Flint 
River system and a single mainstem site, 4 Chipola River sites and 1 
in its tributary Dry Creek, 6 upper Ochlockonee River mainstem 
sites, and single sites in both the New River in the upper Santa Fe 
River system, and in Econfina Creek (Butler 1993). 


Recent surveys have documented the extirpation of the oval 
pigtoe from approximately two-thirds of its historical range, with 
no populations persisting in Alabama. Once a species of localized 
abundance (Clench and Turner 1956), oval pigtoe populations 
sometimes numbered in the hundreds (van der Schalie 1940). However, 
recent collections of the oval pigtoe are generally small, and 
rarely exceed a dozen individuals at any one site. The Service in 
its recent survey located only a single specimen from the entire 
Flint River mainstem. It is not known whether existing populations 
are sufficient in numbers to sustain the species. The oval pigtoe 
does not tolerate impoundments. 

The Chipola slabshell (Elliptio chipolaensis

) is a medium-
sized species reaching a length of about 85 mm (3.3 in). The shell 
is ovate to subelliptical, somewhat inflated and with the posterior 
ridge starting out rounded but flattening to form a prominent 
biangulate margin. The shell surface is smooth and chestnut in 
color. Dark brown coloration may appear in the umbonal region and 
the remaining surface may exhibit alternating light and dark bands. 
The umbos are prominent, well above the hingeline. Internally, the 
umbonal cavity is rather deep. The lateral teeth are long, slender, 
and slightly curved, with two in the left and one in the right 
valve. The pseudocardinal teeth are compressed and crenulate, with 
two in the left and one in the right valve. Nacre color is salmon, 
becoming more intense dorsally and somewhat iridescent posteriorly. 
The Service considers 

Unio chipolaensis

 to be a synonym of 

Elliptio 
chipolaensis.

 


The Chipola slabshell was described from the Chipola River in 
Florida. Clench and Turner (1956) restricted the type locality to 
the Chipola River, 1 mile north of Marianna, Jackson County, 
Florida. Until recently, this species was considered endemic to the 
Chipola River system, occurring in the mainstem above Dead Lake and 
a few of the larger tributaries, all in Florida (van der Schalie 
1940, Clench and Turner 1956). A single record of this mussel from 
a tributary of the Chattahoochee River in extreme southeastern 
Alabama has been verified by Butler (1993). These localities bring 
the total number of historic sites the Chipola slabshell inhabited 
to nine. The Chipola slabshell is known to persist only at four 
Chipola River mainstem sites and in Dry Creek, with the populations 
from Spring Creek (Chipola River system) and the Chattahoochee River 
system apparently extirpated. The numbers of specimens from recent 
collections indicate that populations are generally small, except at 
one site in the lower mainstem where three dozen specimens were 
recently observed (W. McCullagh, pers. comm.). The Chipola 
slabshell has the most restricted range of the Apalachicolan Region 
mussels. This species does not tolerate impoundments, but is more 
tolerant of silt than the other species of mussels. 

The purple bankclimber (

Elliptoideus sloatianus

) is a large, 
heavy shelled, strongly sculptured mussel reaching a length of about 
200 mm (8.0 in). A well developed posterior ridge extends from the 
umbos to the posterior ventral margin of the shell. The posterior 
slope and the disk just anterior to the posterior ridge are 
sculptured by several irregular ridges that vary greatly in 
development. Umbos are low, extending just above the dorsal margin 
of the shell. Internally, there is one pseudocardinal tooth in the 
right valve and two in the left valve. The lateral teeth are very 
thick and slightly curved. Nacre color is whitish near the center 
of the shell becoming deep purple towards the margin, and very 
iridescent posteriorly. The Service recognizes 

Unio sloatianus, 
Unio atromarginatus, Unio aratus, 

and 

Unio plectophorus 

as synonyms 
of 

Elliptoideus sloatianus.

 The purple bankclimber was described 
from the Chattahoochee River and its type locality is restricted to 
the Chattahoochee River at Columbus, Georgia (Clench and Turner 
1956).

Historically, the purple bankclimber was found at 14 sites in 
the Flint River system; 3 sites on the Chipola River mainstem (Dead 
Lake vicinity); 2 sites on the Apalachicola River mainstem; the type 
locality on the Chattahoochee River; and at 4 sites along the lower 
two-thirds of the Ochlockonee River mainstem in Florida and Georgia 
(Clench and Turner 1956, Butler 1993). A total of 24 historic 
sites are known for this species. 
This large mussel persists at 10 sites in the lower two-thirds 
of the Flint River mainstem, at 4 sites in the Apalachicola River, 
and at 8 sites in the Ochlockonee River mostly above Talquin 
Reservoir (Butler 1993). Although the purple bankclimber is 
currently known from only two fewer total sites than before, the 
species has nevertheless experienced a significant reduction in its 
total range. No specimens in recent years have been reported from 
the Chipola River and the species has not been collected in the 
Chattahoochee River for several decades. In addition, Flint River 
tributary populations appear to have been totally eliminated. At a 
few sites in the Florida portion of the Ochlockonee River, the 
purple bankclimber may number in the dozens of individuals. This 
species of mussel does not tolerate impoundment conditions well. 
On November 18, 1993, the Service notified (by mail; 72 
letters) Federal and State agencies, local governments, and 
interested individuals that a status review was being conducted for 
these seven species. A total of ten comments was received as a 
result of this notification. The Florida Division Office of the 
Federal Highway Administration replied that no bridge replacement 
projects were currently being planned in northwest Florida, and it 
was anticipated that any future bridge replacement projects would 
have no effect on these species based on the localized and short-term impacts associated with these activities. The
Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission reported that it licenses 12 hydroelectric 
development projects in the study area, and that any issues 
concerning these species could best be coordinated with the Office 
of Hydropower Licensing. The Fayette County (Georgia) Board of 
Commissioners expressed concern over the Service's contention that 
impoundments have played a major role in the decline of these 
species, but they did not oppose the listing. The Alachua County 
(Florida) Environmental Protection Department, after consultation 
with a Florida Museum of Natural History malacologist, indicated 
that none of these seven species of mussels are known or were 
suspected to occur in Alachua county. The Florida Game and Fresh 
Water Fish Commission expressed concern with how its plan to dredge 
the mouths of several silted-in streams along the Apalachicola River 
to improve access to striped bass might have on these mussels. The 
Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GDNR) had some questions 
concerning the distribution of these mussels, particularly in 
Georgia. The Florida Natural Areas Inventory supported the 
Service's listing of these species and provided information on 
Econfina Creek watershed where the Gulf moccasinshell and oval 
pigtoe occur. Three experts on freshwater mussels supported the 
potential Federal protection of these species. No objections to the 
proposed listing of these species were received. 


Previous Federal Action 


The purple bankclimber, oval pigtoe, shiny-rayed pocketbook, 
and fat three-ridge are included as category 2 species in the 
Service's notices of review for animal candidates that were 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554) and 
on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804). A category 2 species is one 
that may be in need of listing as endangered or threatened, but for 
which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are not 
currently available to support a proposed rule. Based on status 
surveys that were completed in 1993, the Service has determined that 
all of the species included in this proposal now qualify as category 
1 species.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures
for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to
one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the fat three-ridge


(Amblema neislerii), 

shiny-rayed pocketbook 

(Lampsilis subangulata), 

Gulf moccasinshell 

(Medionidus penicillis), 

Ochlockonee moccasinshell 

(Medionidus simpsonianus), 

oval pigtoe 

(Pleurobema pyriforme), 

Chipola slabshell 

(Elliptio chipolaensis), 

and purple bankclimber 

(Elliptoideus sloatianus) 

are as follows: 



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range



These species of mussels are endemic to the eastern Gulf Slope streams draining the Apalachicolan Region of southeast
Alabama, southwest Georgia and north Florida. They are currently found in localized portions of from one to four isolated
marine river systems, mostly in the eastern portion of the Apalachicolan Region. These species have been rendered
vulnerable to extinction by the significant loss of habitat within their restricted ranges in Apalachicolan Region
streams. Factors contributing to this habitat loss are: impoundments and deteriorating water and benthic habitat
quality resulting from channel modification, siltation, agricultural runoff from crop monoculture and poultry
farms, silvicultural activities, mining activities, pollutants, poor land use practices, increased urbanization,
and municipal and industrial waste discharges. 

A consideration of the effects of these impacts upon fishes is of critical importance in evaluating the well-being
of mussels. Mussels and fishes are inextricably linked ecologically; most larval mussels (glochidia) are obligate
parasites of specific fishes. Therefore, these various impacts may have resulted in the elimination of certain fishes
that serve as potential host species for these mussels. 

Impoundments have altered a significant portion of the free-flowing big river habitats of the Apalachicola and Ochlockonee
river systems in which most of these species occur. Stream habitat is destroyed by the conversion of free-flowing
streams to man-made lakes and ponds. In addition to riverine habitat destruction, dams block the passage of certain
migratory fishes which serve as hosts for one or more of these seven mussel species. None of these seven mussel species
are known to reproduce in impoundments. 

The Apalachicola River system has been especially impacted by the construction of numerous mainstem dams. This is
true for the Chattahoochee River, which has nine major dams and four locks and dams along its lower mainstem to facilitate
barge traffic. Additional major dams are located on the Flint River mainstem (

e.g., 

Blackshear Reservoir) and on the Apalachicola River where it is formed by the confluence of the Chattahoochee and
Flint Rivers (Seminole Reservoir). Smaller dams are located on major rivers and tributaries throughout the Apalachicola
River system and in other 
regional streams. Although pre-impoundment records are generally unknown for the fat three-ridge, shiny-rayed
pocketbook, Gulf moccasinshell, oval pigtoe, and purple bankclimber in the Apalachicola River system, numerous
populations of these species were possibly destroyed as a result of impoundments. It has been decades since any live
specimens of these five species were found along the Chattahoochee River mainstem; the type locality for the shiny-rayed
pocketbook, Gulf moccasinshell, oval pigtoe, and purple bankclimber. 

Talquin Reservoir, an impoundment on the Ochlockonee River formed by the closure of Jackson Bluff Dam, inundated
a significant reach of the middle portion of the river mainstem. Pre-impoundment records for the shiny-rayed pocketbook,
Ochlockonee moccasinshell, oval pigtoe, and purple bankclimber from a site at the upstream end of Talquin Reservoir
exist in museum collections. Most of these mussel species once had sizable populations at this site. Undocumented
populations of these four species were probably destroyed by the filling of Talquin Reservoir. 

In addition to riverine habitat being destroyed by Talquin Reservoir, the river downstream of Jackson Bluff Dam shows
noticeable signs of being impacted by sediment deposition. Riverine mussels such as the shiny-rayed pocketbook,
Ochlockonee moccasinshell, oval pigtoe, and purple bankclimber, are nearly absent in sizable stretches of this
heavily silted river. One site recently sampled by the Service (with SCUBA gear) had deposits of detritus and silt
sediments. The river lacked flows adequate to flush the channel of silty sediments. Potential lower mainstem channel
habitat of the shiny-rayed pocketbook, Ochlockonee moccasinshell, oval pigtoe, and purple bankclimber are being
impacted by this deposition.

Navigation channel maintenance in the Chattahoochee and Apalachicola Rivers has destroyed long stretches of benthic
habitat. In addition to the damage caused by the mechanical removal of tons of substrate, these activities increase
sedimentation in downstream areas by resuspending silt fines which smother benthic organisms. Dredging activities
may also resuspend contaminants that are bound to sediments, thus potentially exposing aquatic organisms to released
toxicants. Potential host fishes for the fat three-ridge and purple bankclimber in the Apalachicola River may also
be disrupted by channel modifications. Maintenance operations in the Apalachicola River mainstem continue to disrupt
habitat for these two species. A third mussel, the Gulf moccasinshell, has apparently been extirpated from the Apalachicola
River. 

Gravel mining operations have been observed in various portions of the Apalachicolan Region. Primary stream impacts
associated with gravel mining include stream channel modifications (alterations of habitat, flow patterns, and
sediment transport), water quality modifications, aquatic invertebrate population changes and changes in fish
populations (alteration and elimination of spawning and nursery habitats, and food web disruptions) (Kanehl and
Lyons 1992). Channel degradation caused by gravel mining has been implicated in the destruction of mussel populations
(Hartfield 1993, Grace and Buchanan 1981). In a study by Grace and Buchanan (1981), mussels were still absent from
an in-stream dredged area 15 years after mining took place. Siltation is particularly increased during the mining
of in-stream gravel and/or during the washing of gravel which rinses silt and debris back into the stream. Gravel from
the Chattahoochee River is used for various purposes including landscaping throughout the region. Jenkinson (1973)
recorded the shiny-rayed pocketbook, oval pigtoe, Gulf moccasinshell, and 10 other mussel species in Little Uchee
Creek (Chattahoochee River system) in Alabama. The creek now has active in-stream gravel mines; only a few shell fragments
were found during a recent survey by the Service. 

Municipal and industrial pollutants are widespread in Apalachicolan Region streams. Many municipal waste water
treatment plants provide only secondary treatment of waste water and three plants discharging wastes into the New
River (Suwannee River system) threaten that stream's population of the oval pigtoe. From 1955 to 1977, an estimated
950,000,000 gallons of chemical-laden solutions were discharged into the Flint River from a Department of Defense
facility in Albany, Georgia (P. Laumeyer, Service, pers. comm.). Service biologists surveyed a stretch of the Flint
River where dozens of purple bankclimbers had been killed by an unknown pollutant. Hundreds of round washboards (

Megalonaias boykiniana

) were found dead in the upper Flint River (C. Coney, Los Angeles County Museum, pers. comm.) and various beds of dead
mussels (species unknown) were observed in the Suwannee River (L. Parker, Service, pers. comm.). A battery plant
operation threatens water quality in the Chipola River system, which harbors populations of the fat three-ridge,
shiny-rayed pocketbook, oval pigtoe, and Chipola slabshell. 

Various agricultural practices conducted in the Apalachicolan Region have contributed to stream and habitat degradation.
A Soil Conservation Service (1993) study of a small agricultural watershed area in the middle Flint River system reported
an average of 35.44 metric tons per hectare per year (15.8 tons per acre per year) of sediment loading into area waters;
97% of the total sedimentation in the watershed was generated from agricultural runoff. Agricultural runoff, in
the form of organophosphate or carbamate pesticides, has been implicated in the die-off of populations of freshwater
mussels (J. Fleming, National Biological Survey, unpub. data). The poultry industry is expanding operations into
the Apalachicolan Region, particularly in the watersheds of the upper Apalachicola River system. Runoff from chicken
farms causes oxygen depletion in streams and has been implicated in fish and mussel die-offs in Alabama (U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service 1993). Feedlots are also another source of pollution in localized portions of the region's streams.
Large dairy farms located in the Suwannee River watershed also contribute to the pollution of this system's waters.


Erosion from poor land use practices causes extensive loss of topsoil and the subsequent siltation of stream bottoms.
Sources of siltation include timber clearcutting and other silvicultural activities, clearing of riparian vegetation
for agricultural purposes, and those construction and mining practices that allow exposed earth to enter streams.
Light to moderate levels of siltation are common in many of the streams in the Apalachicolan Region that still have
populations of these seven mussel species. Heavily silted streams were observed by Service biologists in numerous
tributaries of the Chattahoochee and upper Flint Rivers, particularly those draining the Piedmont Physiographic
Province, which is well known for its highly erodible soils. Stream banks devoid of riparian vegetation commonly
slough-off into stream channels. Several clear-cuts have been observed in watersheds of the middle Apalachicola
River system, some with inadequate riparian buffer strips (J. Brim-Box, Service, pers. comm.). A disregard for maintaining
riparian buffers during silvicultural activities threaten streams throughout the Apalachicolan Region. Continued
siltation and sedimentation of these streams may result in a 
depauperate fish fauna, reducing populations at many sites to those dominated by species tolerant of degraded habitats.
The negative effects of silt on benthic fishes were summarized by Burkhead and Jenkins (1991). Siltation reduces
habitat heterogeneity and increases fish egg and larval mortality, abrades organisms, and alters macrobenthic
communities.

The health of these seven mussel species is directly tied to benthic habitat quality. The effects of siltation on freshwater
mussels is more devastating than on fishes due to the sedentary nature of mussels. Ellis (1936) conducted experiments
on the effects of silt on mussels and determined that most mussels tested died from silt deposits of one quarter to one
inch. Silt also transfers organic substances into streams, adversely affecting stream habitat and water quality
by producing increased and localized enrichment impacts (Ellis 1936). 

Artifact and fossil collectors regularly work streams in various portions of the Apalachicolan Region and have been
known to use suction dredges to scour benthic habitats, thus increasing siltation downstream. A study on the effects
of suction gold dredging on stream invertebrates (Harvey 1986) concluded that impacts from these activities are
more severe in streams with soft substrates, which are typical for most Apalachicolan Region streams where these
mussels occur. 

Much non-agricultural and non-silvicultural habitat degradation in the upper Apalachicola River system watershed
is attributed to increased urbanization, particularly in the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Columbus, and Albany.
This current high rate of development is resulting in the conversion of farmland in areas relatively remote from these
cities. Associated with increased development and land clearing is increased siltation from erosion, accelerated
runoff and transport of pollutants in stormwater, and increased discharge of effluents. 

The tributaries harboring populations of these seven mussel species are criss-crossed by numerous road and railroad
bridges. These crossings are potential sites for accidental spills of toxic materials into streams. The large number
of bridge crossings in the Apalachicolan Region makes it probable that such a spill might occur in the future. 



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes. 



The fat three-ridge is a potential target species for the cultured pearl industry. Currently a congener (the three-ridge,


Amblema plicata

) is heavily utilized as a source of shell for pearl nuclei in more northern rivers. Due to a tremendous increase in the
price of shell, the harvesting of shell beds has resulted in the scouting of larger drainages in the Apalachicolan
Region for potential sources of shell. Although prices have decreased since 1992, future increases in shell price
and competition for harvestable populations can not be ruled out. Biological supply companies have utilized the
Flint and Ochlockonee rivers as sources for larger mussel specimens, including the purple bankclimber and possibly
the fat three-ridge, to sell to academic institutions for use in laboratory studies. Supply company representatives
have contacted Service biologists in hopes of obtaining information on new, unexploited mussel populations in the
Apalachicolan Region. On one recent occasion, approximately 10,000 large mussel specimens, presumably including
the purple bankclimber and possibly the fat three-ridge, were harvested from the Flint River near Bainbridge for
this purpose (J. Brim-Box, pers. comm.). Some of these species are a potential source of raw material for the polished
chip industry. Costume jewelry crafted from purple bankclimber shells has been observed in arts and crafts fairs
in the Southeast. Unregulated harvest of the fat three-ridge and purple bankclimber for these purposes, if unchecked,
could decimate their remaining populations. Small and/or thin-shelled mussel species, such as the other five mussels
considered here, are not known to be utilized commercially. 

There are a large number of shell clubs in Florida and surrounding States. Both national and international meetings
for amateur and professional malacologists are held in this area, and generally include organized field collecting
trips to a variety of habitats. The attraction of large numbers of people interested in the study and collection of
mollusks increases the potential for overcollection of these mussels. These species, particularly the larger ones,
are potential bait species, and are susceptible to harvesting especially during low-flow periods. Publication
of this rule will inform the general public as to the presence of these seven mussels in Apalachicolan Region streams.
The rarity of these mussels potentially makes them more appealing to shell collectors. Thus, revealing specific
stream reaches harboring these species could pose a threat from such collectors. Federal protection would serve
to minimize adverse population impacts from illegal take. 



C. Disease or Predation. 



Although diseases of freshwater mussels are virtually unknown, the periodic dieoff of mussel populations in several
primarily midwestern rivers in recent years may be due to unidentified diseases. Juvenile and adult mussels serve
as prey for various animals, and the muskrat has been implicated in jeopardizing recovery of listed mussels (Neves
and Odum 1989). Muskrats do not occur with regularity on Coastal Plain streams, where most of these mussels exist.
However, Piedmont populations of the shiny-rayed pocketbook and oval pigtoe in the upper Flint River system may be
subjected to some degree of muskrat predation.

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms




A scientific collecting permit is required by the State of 
Georgia to collect mussels for scientific purposes. However, 
dredging, brailling, or any form of mechanical harvest of mussels is 
illegal. In addition, a size limit has been placed on mussels 
harvested commercially in Georgia. Handpicking mussels requires 
only a resident or non-resident fishing license. In the State of 
Florida an individual must purchase a fishing license to collect 
mussels. Despite these permit requirements, there are no 
restrictions on the seasonality or sites of harvest, quantity, or 
species of mussels collected in Florida or Georgia. Alabama has 
recently imposed a set of guidelines concerning commercial harvest 
of mussels, including species-specific size limits, restricted areas 
for harvest, and closed seasons. Existing authorities available to 
protect aquatic systems, such as the Clean Water Act, administered 
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of 
Engineers, have not been fully utilized and may have led to the 
degradation of aquatic environments in the Southeast Region, thus 
resulting in a decline of aquatic species. If these seven species 
are listed under the Act, it would provide protection under section 
9 of the Act by prohibiting the take of these species except under 
Federal permit. Further, listing will require consultation with the 
EPA in relationship to water quality criteria, standards, and 
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits under the 
Clean Water Act, and implementation of actions to recover the 
species. 



E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued 
Existence




The range of these seven mussel species has been fragmented, 
and significant portions of the Apalachicola and Ochlockonee river 
systems have been permanently altered by various reservoirs. Many 
of the streams these species inhabit exhibit moderate to heavy 
degradation from poor land use practices. These factors have caused 
local extirpation and fragmentation of most of these species' 
populations. It is not known how many populations of these seven 
species are viable, but few juveniles have been observed in recent 
years. The restricted distribution of these seven mussels makes 
them vulnerable to extirpation from catastrophic events, such as 
toxic chemical spills. 

The introduced Asian clam (

Corbicula fluminea

) has invaded 
nearly all of the river systems in which these mussels occur, 
competing with native mussels for nutrients and space. Densities of 
Asian clams are sometimes heavy in Apalachicolan Region streams, 
with estimates running from approximately one hundred per square 
meter (Flint River, Sickel 1973) to thousands per square meter 
(Santa Fe River, Bass and Hitt 1974). In some streams the substrate 
has changed from one of a fairly homogeneous silty sand or sand to 
one with a gravel-like composition comprised of huge numbers of live 
and dead Asian clam shells. In some of these streams, the Gulf 
moccasinshell and Ochlockonee moccasinshell were once common but are 
now extirpated or severely reduced in numbers. This exotic species 
may be particularly competitive with small native mussels such as 
the diminutive moccasinshells. 

In developing this rule, the Service has assessed the best 
scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, 
present, and future threats faced by these seven mussels. Based 
upon these evaluations, the preferred action is to list the fat 
three-ridge, shiny-rayed pocketbook, oval pigtoe, Gulf 
moccasinshell, and Ochlockonee moccasinshell as endangered and the 
Chipola slabshell and purple bankclimber as threatened. These seven 
mussel species are endemic to the Apalachicolan Region in southeast 
Alabama, southwest Georgia, and north Florida, where they occur in 
from one to four isolated marine river systems. The fat three-ridge, Chipola slabshell, and Ochlockonee moccasinshell
are endemic 
to single drainages, the former two species to the Apalachicola and 
the latter species to the Ochlockonee river systems. The shiny-rayed pocketbook and purple bankclimber are restricted
to both the 
Apalachicola and Ochlockonee river systems, while the oval pigtoe is 
found in these two rivers in addition to the Suwannee River and 
Econfina Creek systems. The Gulf moccasinshell is now restricted to 
the Apalachicola River system and Econfina Creek.

<DOCNO> FR940803-1-00072 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940803-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

These species have been rendered vulnerable to extinction by 
significant loss of habitat and severe range restriction. The 
restricted distribution of these seven species also makes localized 
populations susceptible to catastrophic events and increased 
pressures from take. 



Critical Habitat 



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, and implementing 
regulations (50 CFR 424.12) require that, to the maximum extent 
prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat 
at the time the species is determined to be endangered or 
threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat 
is not prudent for these species. Service regulations (50 CFR 
424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not 
prudent when one or both of the following situations exist_(1) The 
species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and 
identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the 
degree of threat to the species, or (2) such designation of critical 
habitat would not be beneficial to the species. Such a 
determination would result in no known benefit to these species, and 
designation of critical habitat could further increase the threat of 
collecting or vandalism. 

Regulations promulgated for implementing section 7 provide for 
both a jeopardy standard, based on listing alone, and for a 
destruction or adverse modification standard, in cases where 
critical habitat has been designated. The fat three-ridge, shiny-rayed pocketbook, Gulf moccasinshell, Ochlockonee
moccasinshell, 
oval pigtoe, Chipola slabshell, and purple bankclimber occupy very 
restricted stream reaches. Any significant adverse modification or 
destruction of their habitat would likely jeopardize their continued 
existence. Therefore, no additional protection for the species 
would accrue from critical habitat designation that would not also 
accrue from listing these species. If these are listed, the Service 
believes that protection of their habitat can be accomplished 
through the section 7 jeopardy standard, and through section 9 
prohibitions against take. 

The publication of critical habitat maps in the 

Federal 
Register 

and local newspapers and other publicity accompanying 
critical habitat designation could increase the harvest or 
collection threat and also increase the potential for vandalism 
during the critical habitat designation process. 



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered 
or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, 
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and 
prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing 
encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, 
and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Act provides for 
possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and 
requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed 
species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the 
prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. 


Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies 
to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is 
proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to 
its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations 
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are 
codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal 
agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species 
or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed 
critical habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they 
authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely 
modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a 
listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal 
agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. 

Federal involvement is expected to include the EPA through the 
Clean Water Act's provisions for pesticide registration and waste 
management actions. The Corps of Engineers will consider these 
species in project planning and operation, and during the permit 
review process. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will 
consider these species prior to the relicensing of hydropower dams. 
The Federal Highway Administration will consider impacts of 
federally funded bridge and road construction projects when known 
habitat may be impacted. Continuing development within the 
Apalachicolan Region may involve the Farmers Home Administration and 
their loan programs. The Soil Conservation Service will consider 
the species during project planning and under their farmer's 
assistance programs. The Forest Service will consider downstream 
impacts to habitat of the fat three-ridge and purple bankclimber 
when planning or implementing silvicultural, recreational, or other 
programs in lands adjacent the lower mainstem of the Apalachicola 
River, and to habitat of the purple bankclimber when planning or 
implementing these activities in lands adjacent the lower mainstem 
of the Ochlockonee River, both drainages are in the Apalachicola 
National Forest.

The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 for 
endangered species, and 17.21 and 17.31 for threatened species set 
forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to 
all endangered and threatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in 
part, make it illegal for any person subject to jurisdiction of the 
United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, 
wound, kill, trap, or collect; or attempt any of these), import or 
export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial 
activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign 
commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, 
deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been 
taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service 
and State conservation agencies. 

Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited 
activities involving endangered or threatened wildlife species under 
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 
17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are available for scientific 
purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, 
and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful 
activities. For threatened species, there are also permits for 
zoological exhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes 
consistent with the purpose of the Act. 

In some instances, permits may be issued for a specified time 
to relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such 
relief were not available. However, since none of the species in 
this proposal are currently in active trade, no such permits are 
expected. 



Public Comments Solicited 



The Service intends that any final action resulting from these 
proposals will be as accurate and as effective as possible. 
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned 
governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any 
other interested party concerning these proposed rules are hereby 
solicited. Comments particularly are sought concerning:

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Rule to List the Arkansas River Basin Population of the Arkansas
River Shiner as Endangered

ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list the Arkansas River basin population of the Arkansas
River shiner (

Notropis girardi

) as an endangered species under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. The Arkansas
River shiner is a small fish found in the Canadian (South Canadian) River in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; and the
Cimarron River in Kansas and Oklahoma. A non-native, introduced population occurs in the Pecos River in New Mexico;
however, protection for this population is not under consideration. The Arkansas River basin population is threatened
by habitat destruction and modification from stream dewatering or depletion due to diversion of surface water and
excessive groundwater pumping, water quality degradation, and construction of impoundments. Incidental capture
of the Arkansas River shiner during pursuit of commercial bait fish species, and competition with the introduced
Red River shiner (

Notropis bairdi

) may also contribute to reduced population sizes. This proposal, if made final, will implement Federal protection
provided by the Act for 

Notropis girardi

. Critical habitat is prudent but not currently determinable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Arkansas River shiner was first discovered by A. I. Ortenburger in 1926 in the Cimarron River northwest of Kenton,
Cimarron County, Oklahoma (Hubbs and Ortenburger 1929). The Arkansas River shiner is a small, robust shiner with
a small, dorsally flattened head, rounded snout, and small subterminal mouth (Miller and Robison 1973, Robison and
Buchanan 1985). Adults attain a maximum length of 51 millimeters (mm) (2 inches (in)). Dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins
all have eight rays and there is usually a small, black chevron present at the base of the caudal fin. Dorsal coloration
tends to be light tan, with silvery sides gradually grading to white on the belly. The Arkansas River shiner historically
inhabited the main channels of wide, shallow, sandy-bottomed rivers and streams of the Arkansas River Basin. Adults
are uncommon in quiet pools or backwaters, and almost never occur in tributaries having deep water and bottoms of mud
or stone (Cross 1967). 

Adults prefer to orient into the current on the ``lee'' sides of transverse sand ridges and feed upon organisms washed
downstream (Cross 1967). Their food habits have not been recorded but their principal food items are presumed to be
small aquatic invertebrates (Gilbert 1978) or plankton (Sublette 

et al

. 1990). The Arkansas River shiner spawns in July, usually coinciding with flood flows following heavy rains (Moore
1944). The pelagic eggs drift with the swift current and hatching occurs within 24-48 hours. The larvae are capable
of swimming within 3-4 days; they then seek out backwater pools and quiet water at the mouths of tributaries where
food is more abundant (Moore 1944). Both Moore (1944) and Cross (1967) inferred that this species will not spawn unless
conditions are favorable to the survival of the larvae.

Maximum longevity is unknown, but Moore (1944) speculated that the species' life span is likely less than 3 years (age
class II) in the wild. The age structure of Arkansas River shiners collected from the Pecos River in New Mexico included
three, and possibly four, age classes (Bestgen 

et al

. 1989). The majority of the fish captured were juveniles (age class 0) and first-time spawners (age class I). Most
of the fish in spawning condition were age class I. Bestgen 

et al. 

(1989) thought mortality of post-spawning fish was extremely high based on the absence of age class I and older fish
from collections made after the spawning period (late July and August).

Historically, the Arkansas River shiner was widespread and abundant throughout the western portions of the Arkansas
River Basin in Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. There is one record from the Arkansas River at the mouth of Piney
Creek in Logan County, Arkansas (Black (1940), as cited in Robison and Buchanan (1988)). A record (one individual)
also exists for the Red River Basin in Oklahoma (Cross 1970), possibly originating from a release of bait fish by anglers.
Within the last 20 years, this species has disappeared from over 80 percent of its historic range and is now almost entirely
restricted to the Canadian (South Canadian) River in Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. A non-native population of
the Arkansas River shiner has become established in the Pecos River of New Mexico within the last 15 years (Bestgen


et al

. 1989). 

Recent surveys for the Arkansas River shiner were conducted at 155 localities within the Arkansas River Basin (Larson


et al

. 1991). Fish collections were made at 128 of 155 localities; the remaining 27 sites were dry. The surveys resulted
in the capture of 1,455 Arkansas River shiners from 23 localities: 14 in Oklahoma, 5 in Texas, and 4 in New Mexico. No
Arkansas River shiners were captured in Kansas. The decline of this species throughout its historic range may primarily
be attributed to inundation and modification of stream discharge by impoundments, channel desiccation by water
diversion and excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture, stream channelization, and introduction of non-native
species. 

The Arkansas River shiner began to decline in the Arkansas River in western Kansas prior to 1950 due to increasing water
diversions for irrigation and completion of John Martin Reservoir in 1942 (Cross 

et al

. 1985). The Arkansas River from Coolidge to near Great Bend, Kansas, is frequently dewatered (Cross 

et al

. 1985). Habitat alteration following construction of Kaw and Keystone reservoirs on the Arkansas River in Oklahoma,
in conjunction with completion of the McClellan-Kerr Navigation System in 1970, greatly reduced Arkansas River
shiner habitat in Oklahoma and Arkansas. The Arkansas River shiner no longer occurs in the Arkansas River in Arkansas,
Kansas, and Oklahoma. 

The Arkansas River shiner was once common throughout the Cimarron River and its tributaries (Pigg 1991). The abundance
of the Arkansas River shiner in the Cimarron River declined markedly after 1964 (Felley and Cothran 1981). In 1976,
the Red River shiner (

Notropis bairdi

) was first recorded from the Cimarron River (Marshall 1978). Since that time, the Red River shiner has essentially
replaced the Arkansas River shiner. Habitat alteration and resulting flow modification also contributed to the
decline of the species from the Cimarron River. A small, remnant population may still persist in the Cimarron River,
based on the collection of nine individuals since 1985. 

The Arkansas River shiner was first reported from the North Canadian (Beaver) River drainage in 1926 (Hubbs and Ortenburger
1929). Collections between 1947 and 1976 indicated that the Arkansas River shiner occurred in large numbers in the
river and some larger tributaries despite the construction of Optima and Canton reservoirs (Pigg 1991). This fish
was still sporadically collected from the North Canadian River until 1987. Several collection attempts at 15 localities
over the next 2 years failed to capture any Arkansas River shiners (Pigg 1991). In 1990, four specimens were collected
from the river south of Turpin, Beaver County, Oklahoma (Larson 

et al

. 1991; Jimmie Pigg, Oklahoma Department of Health, pers. comm., 1993). Commercial bait dealers were observed flushing
their tanks in the vicinity of the site where the Arkansas River shiners were captured and may have been responsible
for the unintentional release of this species back into the North Canadian River. The species has not been captured
from the North Canadian River since 1990 (J. Pigg, pers. comm., 1993). 

Historically, the species occurred in the Canadian (South Canadian) River from its confluence with the Arkansas
River near Sallisaw, Sequoyah County, Oklahoma as far upstream as the Sabinoso area in central San Miguel County,
New Mexico (Pigg 1991, Sublette 

et al

. 1990). Construction and operation of Ute and Conchas reservoirs in New Mexico, Lake Meredith in Texas, and Eufaula
Reservoir in Oklahoma altered or eliminated sections of riverine habitat and diminished the range of Arkansas River
shiners within the Canadian River. Eufaula Reservoir isolated Canadian River populations from the Arkansas River
and, in combination with Lake Meredith and Ute Reservoir, confined Arkansas River shiners to two restricted segments
of the Canadian River, one between Ute Dam and the upper reaches of Lake Meredith, and the other below Lake Meredith
to the upper reaches of Eufaula Reservoir. The reservoirs function as barriers, significantly inhibiting dispersal
and interchange between the two segments.

A non-native population of Arkansas River shiners has become established in the Pecos River in New Mexico, presumably
originating from the release of bait fish downstream of Sumner Dam in 1978 (Bestgen 

et al

. 1989). The species is presently known to occupy a portion of the Pecos River extending from Ft. Sumner to Carlsbad,
New Mexico. The largest populations, based on the number of fish collected, occur in the vicinity of Lake Arthur Falls.
Natural flow patterns in the Pecos River have been altered by reservoir releases and irrigation withdrawals and return
flows. Flow regimes in the Pecos River now mimic the intermittent flows formerly present within areas historically
supporting natural populations of Arkansas River shiners, and are presently serving to maintain habitat and provide
discharge pulses necessary for reproduction and survival of this population (Bestgen 

et al

. 1989). As demand for water increases in New Mexico, the success of this artificial population may decline or the population
may cease to exist. Protection of this artificial population would also conflict with efforts to manage native fish
populations in the Pecos River. The Pecos River supports populations of the federally threatened Pecos bluntnose
shiner (

Notropis simus pecosensis

) and once supported the proposed federally endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow (

Hybognathus amarus

). The establishment of Arkansas River shiners in the Pecos River is a potential threat to the Pecos bluntnose shiner
(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1992). Recovery of the native fish fauna of the Pecos River may eventually require
restoration of historic flow conditions and eradication of competitive, non-native fishes such as the Arkansas
River shiner. Management and recovery efforts for the Pecos bluntnose shiner and other fish species native to the
Pecos River will focus on the preservation of native species to the detriment of the Arkansas River shiner population.
Listing and protection of the Pecos River population of the Arkansas River shiner would conflict with the preservation
of the Pecos bluntnose shiner and possibly the Rio Grande silvery minnow. While the Pecos River population may be important
in efforts to supplement natural, native populations within the historic range of the species, protection of this
artificial population would not improve the status of the Arkansas River shiner within its historic range. Therefore,
the Service is not proposing to list the introduced population in the Pecos River. 

The Arkansas River shiner first received listing consideration when the species was included in the September 18,
1985, Review of Vertebrate Wildlife (50 

FR 

37958) as a category 2 candidate for listing. Category 2 comprises taxa for which information indicates that a proposal
to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability
and threats are not currently available to support proposed rules. A January 6, 1989, revised Animal Notice of Review
(54 

FR 

554) retained this status for the Arkansas River shiner. Detailed information on the status of the species was first
provided to the Service in 1989 by Pigg (1989). Additional information on the status of this species was obtained through
a partial status survey by Larson 

et al

. (1990). The Service subsequently prepared a status report on this species (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990).
In the November 21, 1991, Animal Candidate Review for Listing as Endangered or Threatened Species (56 

FR

 58804), the Arkansas River shiner was reclassified as a category 1 candidate. Category 1 comprises taxa for which
the Service has substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support proposals to list the
taxa as endangered or threatened. Additional status survey information was provided in Larson 

et al

. (1991) and Pigg (1991). 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the
Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal ``List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants''.
A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described
in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Arkansas River basin population of the Arkansas River
shiner (

Notropis girardi

) are as follows: 

A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range

. Once abundant and widely distributed throughout the Arkansas River basin, the Arkansas River shiner now inhabits
about 20 percent of its historic range. Navigation improvements on the Arkansas River by the U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers
(Corps) began in Arkansas in 1832, 4 years before Arkansas gained statehood (Corps of Engineers 1989). Initially,
construction projects generally consisted of small improvements, such as clearing and snagging operations, until
passage of the River and Harbor Act in 1946 authorized construction of the McClellan-Kerr Navigation System from
the Mississippi River upstream to Catoosa, Oklahoma. Project construction began in the 1950's and intensified during
the 1960's. Project segments from the Mississippi confluence upstream to Fort Smith, Arkansas, were completed by
1969. By 1970, the channel had been extended up the Arkansas River as far as Muskogee, Oklahoma, and was essentially
complete. The project included numerous bank stabilization and channel rectification projects, 17 locks and dams
(12 in Arkansas), annual channel maintenance, and port facilities. Several of the locks and dams are multipurpose
facilities, providing peak power generation. The Corps maintains a minimum channel depth of 3 meters (m) (9 feet (ft))
and minimum width of 76 m (250 ft). These modifications have eliminated suitable habitat and are presumably responsible
for the extirpation of the Arkansas River shiner within the State of Arkansas and contributed to the decline of the
species in Oklahoma. Buchanan (1976) failed to collect any Arkansas River shiners from the Arkansas River Navigation
System in Arkansas, and fish collections between 1972 and 1988 from the Arkansas River near Ft. Smith, Arkansas also
failed to produce any Arkansas River shiner specimens (Robison and Buchanan 1988). Arkansas River shiners were last
observed within the Arkansas River downstream of Muskogee in 1985 (Pigg 1991).

Numerous multipurpose impoundments, including three mainstem reservoirs on the Arkansas River and four mainstem
reservoirs on the Canadian River, have been constructed within the Arkansas River Basin. These impoundments have
inundated, dewatered, or otherwise altered considerable sections of riverine habitat once inhabited by Arkansas
River shiners. Inundation has eliminated Arkansas River shiner spawning habitat, isolated populations, and favored
an increased abundance of predators. Water releases from impoundments may be infrequent or non-existent, resulting
in dewatering of stream sections downstream of the reservoir. Where sufficient water is released to maintain downstream
flows, the releases generally alter the natural flow regime for considerable distances downstream of the impoundment,
establishing a stream environment unlike that which existed under pre-impoundment conditions. Physical changes
resulting from altered flows may include modifications to water velocity, wetted perimeter (amount of streambed
exposed to water at any given flow), water depth, streambed and bank erosion, and suspension and distribution of bed
and bank sediments. 
In 1952, the Arkansas River shiner was believed to inhabit the entire Arkansas mainstem in Kansas, but was already
suspected to be declining due to the construction of John Martin Reservoir 10 years earlier on the Arkansas River in
Bent County, Colorado (Cross 

et al. 

1985). By 1960, the species had disappeared from the Arkansas River mainstem west of Wichita, Kansas, and was absent
from the entire Kansas portion of the Arkansas mainstem by 1983 (Cross 

et al. 

1985). 
Arkansas River shiners were apparently abundant in the Arkansas River near Tulsa, Oklahoma, prior to construction
of Keystone Reservoir in 1964 (Pigg 1991). Following the addition of hydropower at Keystone Dam in 1968, the resultant
flow alterations severely depleted Arkansas River shiner populations. The Arkansas river shiner was last observed
from the section of the Arkansas River between Keystone Reservoir and Muskogee, Oklahoma, in 1982. Kaw Reservoir,
another Arkansas River mainstem impoundment, located upstream of Keystone Reservoir, became operational in 1976.
In 1989, hydropower was added to Kaw Dam. Shiners were last observed downstream of Kaw Reservoir in 1986 (Larson 

et al. 

1991, Pigg 1991). 
On the Canadian River, Lake Meredith and Eufaula Reservoir have impacted the Arkansas River shiner. Prior to completion
of Eufaula Reservoir, Arkansas River shiners were abundant in the Canadian River between the proposed dam site and
the Arkansas River (Pigg 1991). Arkansas River shiners have not been collected from this reach of the Canadian River
since the reservoir became operational in 1964. The disappearance of Arkansas River shiners below Eufaula Reservoir
has been attributed to rapid water level fluctuations occurring during hydropower generation and altered conditions
favoring an abundant predatory fish population (Pigg 1991). Lake Meredith was constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation
in 1965 and conservation storage is presently managed by the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority. Releases
from Lake Meredith are infrequent to non-existent (Williams and Wolman l984) and have considerably altered flows
in the Canadian River downstream of the reservoir. Historically, discharge at Canadian, Texas, located 121 kilometers
(km) (75 miles (mi)) below Lake Meredith, averaged 15.5 cubic meters per second (549 cubic ft per second (cfs)); however,
following completion of the reservoir, annual discharge has averaged only 2.5 cubic meters per second (87.7 cfs)
(Buckner 

et al. 

1985). Principal sources of water to the Canadian River below Lake Meredith are sewage effluent, tributary inflow,
and groundwater emergence. 
Reduced flows below Lake Meredith have considerably altered the morphology of the Canadian River and have reduced
the extent of suitable habitat for Arkansas River shiners. Stinnett 

et al.

 (1988) examined a 370 km (230 mi) stretch of the Canadian River and associated floodplain 72,843 hectares (179,995
acres) between the western Oklahoma border and the western Pottawatomie County line near Norman, Oklahoma. Quantification
of wetland areas between 1955 and l984 revealed that the amount of riverine wetlands (shoreline and open water) had
decreased by about 50 percent. Sandbar acreage alone had been reduced by 54 percent. Wetland and associated floodplain
changes were principally the result of hydrological modifications due to the influence of Lake Meredith (Stinnett


et al. 

1988). The lack of significant scouring flows permitted the encroachment of vegetation within the channel, reducing
channel width by almost 50 percent since 1955. Although Arkansas River shiners persist in the Canadian River downstream
of Lake Meredith, the reduction in available habitat has likely suppressed shiner populations. Habitat alterations
associated with reduced flows downstream of Lake Meredith are considered to be a significant, ongoing threat to the
continued existence of the Arkansas River shiner within the Canadian River. 
Other mainstem impoundments within the historic range of Arkansas River shiner include Ute and Conchas reservoirs
on the upper Canadian River, Optima and Canton reservoirs on the North Canadian River, and Great Salt Plains Reservoir
on the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River. Arkansas River shiner populations persist only below Ute Reservoir (Larson

 et al.

 1991, Pigg 1991). 
Groundwater is an extremely important source of water in western Oklahoma, western Kansas, and the Texas panhandle
(Stoner 1985, Texas Department of Water Resources 1984, Oklahoma Water Resources Board 1980, 1990). Withdrawals
from western Oklahoma aquifers account for about 80 percent of the State's total groundwater usage (Oklahoma Water
Resources Board 1990). Irrigation of croplands has diverted surface water and lowered groundwater tables throughout
southwestern Kansas and northwestern Oklahoma. Water tables receded from 3 m (10 ft) to more than 30 m (100 ft) over
much of southwestern Kansas during the period from 1950 to 1975 (Cross

 et al. 

1983). Between 1955 and 1980, declines in water levels by as much as 31 m (102 ft) have been recorded in the Ogallala Aquifer
in Oklahoma (Oklahoma Water Resources Board 1980). In 1960, there were about 400 groundwater wells in the Oklahoma
panhandle; by 1965 the number had risen to 975; and in 1974, the number of wells had risen to 2,067 (Oklahoma Water Resources
Board 1980). By 1988, there were an estimated 3,200 high capacity wells overlying the Ogallala Aquifer in western
Oklahoma alone (Oklahoma Water Resources Board 1990). At present, rainfall and runoff contribute little recharge
to the underlying aquifers. In Texas, withdrawals of groundwater in the Canadian River Basin were as much as 33 times
higher than the annual natural recharge in 1980, and irrigation return flows in the Basin are negligible (Texas Department
of Water Resources 1984). When groundwater is pumped faster than it is restored, water tables drop, channel seepage
ceases, and streams cease to flow. Under these conditions, suitable habitat to support Arkansas River shiner populations
is non-existent.

Surface water withdrawals constitute a small percentage of the total water used within the western sections of the
historic range of the Arkansas River shiner, primarily because of the limited number of impoundments and elevated
levels of chlorides. However, natural flows in the Cimarron River upstream of Waynoka, Oklahoma, are affected by
several diversions for irrigation. Dewatering and reduced base flows because of groundwater and surface water withdrawals
is considered a significant, ongoing threat to the Arkansas River shiner in southwestern Kansas, northwestern Oklahoma
and the Texas panhandle (Larson 

et al. 

1991, Cross 

et al. 

1985). 
Water quality in the Canadian River in Texas generally declines as the river flows eastward. The Canadian River traverses
oil and gas producing areas and receives municipal sewage effluent and manufacturing return flows, all of which degrade
water quality (Texas Department of Water Resources 1984). Water quality degradation is believed to have suppressed
Arkansas River shiner populations within affected reaches of the Canadian River. Water quality within the Canadian
River begins to improve as the river flows through the sparsely populated counties in western Oklahoma. Poor water
quality in the North Canadian River near Oklahoma City and in the Arkansas River at Tulsa are also believed to have contributed
to localized declines in Arkansas River shiner populations. The North Canadian River from western Oklahoma City
downstream to Eufaula Reservoir is considered to be the most nutrient-enriched stream in Oklahoma (Pigg 

et al. 

1992). The Arkansas River shiner has not been found in this section of the North Canadian River since 1975 (Pigg 1991).

The proposed Lake Meredith Salinity Control Project is designed to control brine seeping into the Canadian River
from a brine aquifer in New Mexico. The project could have an effect on the quantity and quality of flow in the Canadian
River between Ute Dam near Logan, New Mexico and Lake Meredith in Texas. The impacts of this project on Arkansas River
shiner populations have not yet been determined. Arkansas River shiner populations in this 219 km (136 mi) reach of
the Canadian River are isolated from other populations by Ute and Meredith reservoirs. Flow reductions in this reach
could severely deplete, or possibly extirpate, these populations. 
 
B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. 

Though not selectively harvested as a bait species, the inadvertent collection of Arkansas River shiners during
harvest of commercial bait species may limit population growth. While some harvest of bait species, either for commercial
or personal consumptive uses, occurs in New Mexico and Texas, the greatest threat to Arkansas River shiner from overutilization
occurs in the State of Oklahoma. 
In 1985, the Cimarron and South Canadian rivers produced over 55 percent of the bait fish harvested in Oklahoma, providing
over 20,846 kilograms (kg) (45,958 pounds (lbs)) of fish (Peterson 1986). Plains minnow (

Hybognathus placidus

), which may reach total lengths of 127 mm (5 in), was the primary species reported harvested by the commercial minnow
dealers. In 1991, the Cimarron and South Canadian rivers produced over 50 percent of the bait fish harvested in Oklahoma,
providing over 25,118 kg (55,376 lbs) of fish (Peterson 1992). Plains minnow was again reported to be the primary species
harvested. Although the percent of the total poundage harvested from the Cimarron and South Canadian rivers has declined
slightly since 1985, the amount, by weight, of fish harvested has increased by over 20 percent. Within the last 10 years
(1980-81 to 1991), the percent of the total harvest taken from the South Canadian and Cimarron rivers has varied
from 67 percent in 1982 (Peterson and Weeks 1983) to 46 percent in 1989 (Larson 

et al.

 1991). The amount of fish taken varied from over 37,762 kg (83,252 lbs) in 1982 to 19,147 kg (42,213 lbs) in 1989. The
lists of species harvested did not include Arkansas River shiners.

Larson 

et al.

 (1991) reported that there is no evidence that the species has been adversely affected by the commercial harvest of
bait fish. The reported capture of predominantly large species (plains minnows) and the continued existence of the
Arkansas River shiner in the South Canadian River, the drainage supporting the majority of the harvest, was the primary
evidence used in arriving at this conclusion. Larson 

et al.

 (1991) suggested that slender-bodied fishes such as the Arkansas River shiner would constitute only a small percentage
of the commercial harvest, assuming the commercial bait industry used large-mesh seines as the major mode of capture.
However, other evidence indicates that the Arkansas River shiner, while perhaps not a highly sought commercial species,
is being affected by the commercial bait industry. 

The rapid establishment of the Arkansas River shiner in the Pecos River, presumably from the release of bait fish,
indicates that a large number of fish were released in a single event. Otherwise, if Arkansas River shiners occur only
occasionally in the commercial harvest, several releases over a short period of time would be required to ensure that
a large enough population existed to facilitate natural reproduction. In either instance, the evidence would indicate
that shiners may occasionally occur in commercial catches in fairly large numbers. The capture of four individuals
in the North Canadian River in 1990 also suggests that Arkansas River shiners are occasionally being harvested by
commercial bait dealers. 

Lists of fish species reported captured by commercial bait dealers are not always accurate and likely fail to report
the capture of Arkansas River shiners. Based on the large percentage of golden shiners (

Notemigonus crysoleucas

) reported captured by commercial bait dealers in 1989, Larson 

et al.

 (1991) believed the list to be suspect, since no locality was encountered in their collections where golden shiners
comprised such a high proportion. In 1982, Peterson and Weeks (1983), stated that the river shiner (

Notropis blennius

) was the primary species harvested by commercial bait dealers in the seven river drainages for which they had data
(South Canadian, North Canadian, Red, Salt Fork of Red, North Fork of Red, Salt Fork of Arkansas, and Cimarron rivers).
However, the river shiner has not been recorded from the South Canadian, North Canadian, Salt Fork of Red, or North
Fork of Red rivers (Miller and Robison 1973). Larson 

et al.

 (1991), in their survey for Arkansas River shiners, also did not report capturing a single river shiner from 128 sampling
localities within the Arkansas River basin. 

Information provided by the commercial bait industry cannot reliably be used as evidence to suggest that commercial
bait harvest is not impacting Arkansas River shiner populations. The sheer numbers of fish collected from the South
Canadian River would imply that Arkansas River shiners could constitute a considerable percentage of the by-catch
taken during commercial harvest. While there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that commercial harvest has contributed
to the decline of the Arkansas River shiner, take of this species during commercial bait harvest may be significant
and suggests that the effect of this factor warrants further investigation. 

C. 

Disease or predation.

 No studies have been conducted on the impact of disease or predation upon the Arkansas River shiner; therefore, the
significance of these threats upon existing populations is unknown. There is no direct evidence to suggest that disease
threatens the continued existence of the species. Disease is not likely to be a significant threat except under certain
habitat conditions, such as crowding during periods of reduced flows, or episodes of poor water quality, such as low
dissolved oxygen or elevated nutrient levels. During these events, stress reduces resistance to pathogens and disease
outbreaks may occur. Parasites and bacterial and viral agents are generally the most common causes of mortality.
Lesions caused by injuries, bacterial infections, and parasites often become the sites of secondary fungal infections.

Some predation of Arkansas River shiners by largemouth bass (

Micropterus salmoides

), green sunfish (

Lepomis cyanellus

), channel catfish (

Ictalurus punctatus

), and other species undoubtedly occurs, but the extent is unknown. Plains fishes have evolved under adverse conditions
of widely fluctuating, often intermittent flows, high summer temperatures, high rates of evaporation, and high
concentrations of dissolved solids. These conditions are not favored by most large predaceous fish and tend to preclude
existence of significant populations of these species. However, alteration of historic flow regimes and construction
of reservoirs have created favorable conditions for some predatory species such as white bass (

Morone chrysops

) and striped bass (

M. saxatilis

). State and Federal fish and wildlife management agencies, through efforts to develop sport fisheries in these reservoirs,
have facilitated the expansion of some predatory species. The impact of predation is likely to be localized and insignificant,
particularly where habitat conditions upstream of mainstem reservoirs are not favorable to the long-term establishment
of large populations of predatory fish. 

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.

 The State of Kansas lists the Arkansas River shiner as a State endangered species. The Kansas Department of Wildlife
and Parks has designated portions of the mainstem Cimarron, Arkansas, South Fork Ninnescah, and Ninnescah rivers
as critical habitat for the shiner (Vernon Tabor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Kansas State Office, pers. comm.,
1993). A permit is also required for public actions that have the potential to destroy listed individuals or their
critical habitat. Subject activities include any publicly funded or State or federally assisted action, or any action
requiring a permit from any other State or Federal agency. Violation of the permit constitutes an unlawful taking,
a Class A misdemeanor, and is punishable by a maximum fine of $2,500 and confinement for a period not to exceed one year
(V. Tabor, pers. comm., 1993). Kansas does not permit the commercial harvest of bait fish from rivers and streams within
the State. 

The State of New Mexico lists the Arkansas River shiner as a State endangered species. This listing prohibits the taking
of the Arkansas River shiner without a valid scientific collecting permit but does not provide habitat protection.
The State of Oklahoma lists the Arkansas River shiner as a State threatened species, but, as in New Mexico, this listing
does not provide habitat protection. The States of Arkansas and Texas provide no special protection for the species
or its habitat. 

While Kansas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma protect the Arkansas River shiner from take and/or possession, only Kansas
addresses the problem of habitat destruction or modification. None of the States provide significant protection
from the potential introduction of competitive species. Listing under the Act would provide additional protection
and encourage active management through ``Available Conservation Measures'' discussed below. 

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

 The overall trend in the status of this species is characterized by dramatic declines in numbers and distribution.
The apparent isolation of self-sustaining populations of Arkansas River shiners to one river system renders the
remaining populations extremely vulnerable to any natural or manmade factors that might further reduce population
size. The occurrence of a single, catastrophic event, such as the introduction of competitive species, or a prolonged
period of low or no flow, would significantly increase the likelihood of extinction. 

The introduction and establishment of the Red River shiner, a species endemic to the Red River Drainage, into the Cimarron
River in Oklahoma and Kansas has had a detrimental effect on the Arkansas River shiner (Cross 

et al.

 1983, Felley and Cothran 1981). The Red River shiner was first recorded from the Cimarron River in 1976 (Marshall 1978).
The Red River shiner has since colonized the Cimarron River and frequently may be a dominant component of the fish community
(Cross 

et al.

 1983, Felley and Cothran 1981). The morphological characteristics, population size, and ecological preferences
exhibited by the Red River shiner suggest that competition for food and other essential life requisites occurs with
Arkansas River shiners (Cross 

et al.

 1983, Felley and Cothran 1981). The unintentional release of Red River shiners, or other potential competitors,
into the Canadian River by anglers or the commercial bait industry is a potentially serious threat and could lead to
decimation or extirpation of the remaining natural Arkansas River shiner populations.

The limited occurrence of Red River pupfish (

Cyprinodon rubrofluviatilis

) in the Canadian River drainage since 1969 (Pigg 

et al.

 1984) indicates that the release of at least one Red River endemic has already occurred in this drainage. While the
introduction of non-native fish does not fully account for the disappearance of Arkansas River shiners, particularly
outside of the Cimarron River, competition with introduced species can have a significant adverse impact on Arkansas
River shiner populations. 

The reproductive characteristics and specialized spawning and early life-history requirements of this species
intensify the effects of certain natural or manmade factors, such as drought. Successful reproduction of the Arkansas
River shiner appears to require precise flow conditions conducive to breeding and embryonic development. Spawning
is triggered, in part, by abrupt increases in stream flow during the late spring or summer (Cross 

et al.

 1983, Moore 1944). Stream flows favorable to spawning must be sustained over at least a 24 hour period to ensure complete
embryonic and larval development. As discussed under Factor A, suitable habitat conditions are becoming scarce
and where conditions are not favorable, rapid population declines have occurred. 

Declining populations of the Arkansas River shiner may also be due to poor survival of juveniles. Bestgen 

et al.

 (1989) observed that spawning in Arkansas River shiners appeared to be primarily limited to age class I individuals,
based on an absence of age class I and older fish from collections made after the spawning period. The apparent extremely
high post-spawning mortality observed in Arkansas River shiner populations in the Pecos River suggests that the
reproductive contribution of individuals in age class II or older is very limited. Thus, the continued existence
of Arkansas River shiner populations may be almost entirely dependent upon successful annual reproduction and subsequent
recruitment of age class 0 (juvenile) individuals into the population. The loss of a single reproductive event/cycle
would seriously reduce recruitment, and possibly lead to localized extinctions. The fragmentation of Arkansas
River shiner habitat by impoundments intensifies the effects of failed reproduction by hindering repopulation
following rapid declines or localized extinctions. 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the
preferred action is to list the Arkansas River basin population of the Arkansas River shiner as endangered. Endangered
status, which means that the species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range,
is appropriate for the Arkansas River shiner because of its significantly reduced range, including the apparent
extirpation of the shiner in Arkansas, Kansas, and throughout much of its historic range in Oklahoma. Threatened
status does not appear appropriate considering the extent of the species' population decline and the vulnerability
of the remaining populations. 



Critical Habitat 



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose
critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation
of critical habitat is not presently determinable for this species. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(2))
state that critical habitat is not determinable if information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts
of the designation is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification
of an area as critical habitat. 

Arkansas River shiners occur at scattered locations throughout the Canadian River. Specific habitat features,
such as substrate composition, water depths, and water velocities, preferred by Arkansas River shiners are unknown
and data explaining the distribution and abundance of Arkansas River shiners within a given segment of stream are
lacking. Without this information, designation of critical habitat is not possible because the Service cannot adequately
determine the precise constituent elements within specific areas that are essential to the survival and recovery
of the Arkansas River shiner. The Service has initiated studies, funded under the provisions of Section 6(d) of the
Act, which will determine and characterize the specific physical habitat requirements of the Arkansas River shiner.
Within 2 years from the date of publication of this proposed rule, the Service must designate critical habitat to the
maximum extent prudent (50 CFR 424.17(b)(2)).

Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and authorizes recovery
plans for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and
harm are discussed, in part, below.
Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed
or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires
Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species
is listed subsequently, Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund,
or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal
agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.
A number of Federal agencies have jurisdiction and r
