<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974: Computer Matching Program for the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem_U.S. Department of Agriculture
and State Welfare Agencies Administering the Food Stamp Program</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, USDA.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Third Notice of Computer Matching Programs for the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem_U.S. Department of Agriculture
and State welfare agencies administering the Food Stamp Program.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On June 16, 1993, (58 FR 33246) and again on November 29, 1993, (58 FR 62634), the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) provided notice of its intent to conduct a computer matching program with all 50
States as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. Not all of the States were fully prepared to
participate in the computer matching program at its inception and only those 28 States that had executed computer
matching agreements were included under the first notice. The second notice announced the participation of an additional
12 States. This third notice announces the participation of the remaining 13 States in the computer matching program.
Included are the States of Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Rhode
Island, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah.




The matching program will enable State agencies to determine appropriate periods of disqualification from participation
in the Food Stamp Program for intentional program violations. To assign appropriate periods of disqualification,
State agencies will match data on individuals recently determined to have committed intentional program violations
with an FNS-maintained, centralized data bank list of individuals previously disqualified. Then, based on the number
of times an individual has been disqualified, an appropriate period of disqualification will be assigned for the
latest violation.


The matching program will also enable State agencies to prevent the certification or detect the participation of
individuals who are in a disqualified status. At their option, State agencies may match the FNS-supplied data against
their records of applicants and/or recently-certified individuals to insure that those currently in a disqualified
status do not participate. Matches will be conducted in accordance with written agreements between USDA and each
of the State agencies.


This notice is required by Public Law No. 100-503, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988.
The information provided is in accordance with paragraph 6.c. of the Final Guidance Interpreting Pub. L. 100-503
issued by the Office of Management and Budget, 54 FR 25818 (June 19, 1989). A copy of this notice has been provided to
the Committee on Government Operations, U.S. House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs,
U.S. Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pub. L. 97-35, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, requires that individuals who intentionally
violate Food Stamp Program regulations more than once be assigned increasingly longer periods of disqualification
for each subsequent offense. To assign appropriate disqualification periods, State agencies must have access to
information on individuals who have previously been disqualified in other jurisdictions as well as their own. Although
Congress, in Pub. L. 97-35, did not specify a system for assuring State agencies access to information on disqualified
individuals, it did require State agencies to report disqualification actions to FNS. Thus, to enable States to act
on this information as Congress intended, FNS will make this information available to State agencies through the
Disqualified Recipient Subsystem.




FNS will act as the central collection point for data on disqualified individuals, which States will then access through
the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem. The data will include the name, social security number, date of birth, and
sex of disqualified individuals. If data in the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem indicates that an individual had
been disqualified previously, the information obtained from the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem will be verified
before a new period of disqualification is assigned. If the information in the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem
originated in another State, that State will be asked to verify the subject data. This procedure will also be followed
before any action is taken to deny an individual's application or terminate an individual's participation based
on a match with the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem.

Food Stamp Program regulations provide for notification and due-process rights for individuals adversely affected
by computer match programs.

Nebraska, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah.



Purpose:

for Food Stamp Program benefits.






Authority: 

7 U.S.C. 2015, the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended.



Files to be used in this matching program are:



(1) The FNS-maintained file of State-provided disqualification information is entitled ``Information on Persons
Disqualified from the Food Stamp Program'' and designated as USDA/FNS-5. This Privacy Act System of Records
consists of standardized records containing identifying information (first name, middle initial, last name; social
security number; date of birth; and sex) on individuals disqualified from the Food Stamp Program and information
identifying the location, date(s), and length(s) of any disqualification determined and imposed.

(2) State agency food stamp recipient information files for each State, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin
Islands.



Inclusive dates:



In accordance with section 2 of Pub. L. 100-503, 5 U.S.C. 552a(o)(2)(B) the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection
Act of 1988, the matching programs will begin no sooner than 30 days after the signed agreements are transmitted to
the Committee on Government Operations, U.S. House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs,
U.S. Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget. They will continue for 18 months, the maximum time period allowed
under section 2 of Pub. L. 100-503, 5 U.S.C. 552a(o)(2)(C). At the end of that period, with the approval of the
USDA Data Integrity Board, this matching program may be extended for an additional year without further notice.

Comments and inquiries should be addressed to: Cecilia Fitzgerald, Supervisor, State Management Section, State
Administration Branch, Program Accountability Division, Food and Nutrition Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,

In accordance with sections 353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the Commerce regulations, an interested party may request
in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested party must
specify for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a
review, and the requesting party must state why the person desires the Secretary to review those particular producers
or resellers. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer
if that producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which was produced in more than one country of origin,
and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which
reseller(s) and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.

Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, Room B-099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. The Department also

The Department will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping (Countervailing) Duty Administrative Review'', for requests received
by August 31, 1994. If the Department does not receive, by August 31, 1994, a request for review of entries covered by
an order or finding listed in this notice and for the period identified above, the Department will instruct the Customs
Service to assess antidumping or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond
for) estimated antidumping or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal
from warehouse, for consumption and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.

This notice is not required by statute, but is published as a service to the international trading community.

Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Construction of a Railroad By-Pass Between Masonville and Caskey,
Kentucky



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Army, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Fort Campbell, Kentucky, requires rail service to deploy rapidly throughout the world. The U.S. Army owns 17 miles
of track from Fort Campbell to the town of Hopkinsville, and approximately three miles of track in the town of Hopkinsville.
Currently, a lengthy switching procedure is required to move a train, necessary during contingency operations and
possibly during major exercises, to or from Fort Campbell. Fort Campbell cannot rapidly deploy the 101st Airborne
Division and other units with the existing switching restrictions in Hopkinsville. The U.S. Army proposes to by-pass
the city of Hopkinsville by purchasing land and constructing a six-mile track along a 100-foot wide corridor from
the Army owned track near the town of Masonville to the CSX, Incorporated mainline near Caskey. The scope of work includes
removing approximately seven miles of track and four bridges north of Masonville. The U.S. Army will reuse the rail,
ties and ballast in the new six-mile track. The precise track terminus north of Masonville will be developed during
the EIS process.



Proposed Alternatives



a. No action

b. Alternate rail corridors



Scoping



Comments received as a result of this notice will be used to assist the Army in identifying potential impacts to the
quality of the human environment and potential alternatives to the proposed action. Individuals or organizations
may participate in the scoping process by written comment or by attending a scoping meeting. The scoping meeting will
be announced by public notice to federal, state, and local officials, interest groups, and individuals. The public
notice will also be provided to the local media.

DUSDA 05



System name:


Human Radiation Research Review.



System location: 


Department of Defense Radiation Experiments Command Center, 6801 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22310-3398;
and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, Assistant to the Secretary of Defense
(Atomic Energy), 3010 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-3010. 



Categories of individuals covered by the system:


Individuals who were or may have been the subject of tests involving ionizing radiation or other human-subject experimentation;
individuals who have inquired or provided information to the Department of Energy Helpline or the Department of Defense
Human Radiation Experimentation Command Center concerning such testing.
Military and DoD civilian personnel who participated in atmospheric nuclear testing between 1945 and 1962 or the
occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are already included in the Defense Nuclear Agency's Nuclear Test Personnel
Review (NTPR) program and are not part of this effort. The Defense Nuclear Agency's system of records notice that covers
the NTPR is HDNA 010, entitled Nuclear Test Participants. However, inquiries referred from the Helpline that later
are determined to fall within this category will be included in the system. 



Categories of records in the system:


Information in the system includes an individual's name, Social Security Number or service number, last known or
current address, occupational information, dates and extent of involvement in an experiment, exposure data, medical
data, medical history of subject and relatives, and other documentation of exposure to ionizing radiation or other
agents. 
The system contains information abstracted from historical records, and information furnished to the Department
of Defense, Department of Energy or other Federal Agencies by affected individuals or other interested parties.

Records include human radiation experimentation conducted from 1944 to the present. However, experiments conducted
after May 20, 1974 (the date of issuance of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare Regulations for the Protection
of Human Subjects, 45 CFR part 46), may be covered by other systems of records.
Common and routine medical practices, such as established diagnostic and treatment methods involving incidental
exposures to ionizing radiation are not included within this system. Examples of such methods are panorex radiographs
for dental evaluations and thyroid scans for the evaluation and treatment of hypo/hyperthyroidism.



Authority for maintenance of the system:


10 U.S.C. 133, E.O. 12891 (January 15, 1994), E.O. 9397 (November 22, 1943).



Purpose(s):


For use by agency officials and employees, or authorized contractors, and other DoD components in the preparation
of the histories of human radiation experimentation; to conduct scientific studies or medical follow-up programs;
to respond to Congressional and Executive branch inquiries; and to provide data or documentation relevant to the
exposure of individuals.



Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and the purposes of such uses:


In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records or information
contained therein may specifically be disclosed outside the DoD as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as
follows: 

Information from this system of records may be disclosed to officials and contract personnel of the Human Radiation
Experimentation Interagency Working Group as well as other designated government agencies, for the purposes described
above. These agencies are the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Department of Justice; Department
of Energy; Department of Health and Human Services; Department of Veterans Affair; the White House Advisory Committee;
Central Intelligence Agency; and Office of Management and Budget. 
The `Blanket Routine Uses' published at the beginning of the Office of the Secretary of Defense's compilation of systems
notices apply to this system. 



Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system:

Storage:


Paper records in file folders, microfilm/fiche, computer magnetic tape disks, and printouts in secure computer
facilities.



Retrievability:


Records are retrieved by case number, name, study control number, Social Security Number, or service number.



Safeguards:


Access to or disclosure of information is limited to authorized personnel. Paper records filed in folders, microfilm/fiche
and computer printouts are stored in areas accessible only by authorized personnel. Buildings are protected by security
guards and intrusion alarm systems. Magnetic tapes are stored in a controlled area within limited access facilities.
Access to computer programs is controlled through software applications that require validation prior to use.



Retention and disposal:


Files will be retained permanently. They will be maintained in the custody of the command center until all claims have
been settled and then transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration.



System manager(s) and address:


Under Secretary of Defense of Acquisition and Technology, Assistant to the Secretary of Defense (Atomic Energy),
3010 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-3010.



Notification procedure:


Individuals seeking to determine whether information about themselves is contained in this system of records should

Contesting record procedures:


The OSD's rules for accessing records, for contesting contents and appealing initial agency determinations are
published in OSD Administrative Instruction 81; 32 CFR part 311; or may be obtained from the system manager.



Record source categories:


Information will be collected directly from individuals, as well as extracted from historical records to include
personnel files and lists, training files, medical records, legal case files, radiation and other hazard exposure
records, occupational and industrial accident records, employee insurance claims, organizational and institutional
administrative files, and related sources. The specific types of records used are determined by the nature of an individual's
exposure to radiation.

Abstract: 

On August 10, 1993, the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) was enacted. The legislation authorized
the Federal Direct Student Loan Program to make loans beginning July 1, 1994. On July 1, 1994 the regulations implementing
the Consolidation Loan Process were published. The repayment and consolidation rules satisfy the requirements
needed for the first year of this program.

<DOCTITLE>Kansas City Support Office, Buildings Energy Analysis Service; Notice of Solicitation of Grant Proposal.</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Department of Energy.




</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Kansas City Support Office (KCSO) is soliciting grant proposals to pursue innovative
concepts to develop a viable process for utilizing engineering students in a buildings analysis program. The program
will focus on a integrated (holistic) systems analysis and development of a management/recommissioning plan to
facilitate the implementation of recommendations. The analysis will include the operations, maintenance, and
restoration needs of heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, lighting, domestic water systems, and the energy
accounting procedures currently being used. The project team will also implement a utility accounting system in
cooperation with the participating building owner/operators to analyze historic and future utility usage. The
target facilities will be schools and other public institutional buildings in the four state KCSO region. The program
will pattern certain aspects after the DOE's Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Center (EADC) program but will emphasize
measurement of results, institutional partnerships, funding mechanisms to perpetuate the process, training requirements
and identification of public and private resources to assist clients in implementing the recommendations. The development
of means to sustain the process, assurance of implementation of recommendations, and measurable results are key
goals of the program. Projects shall be located in Federal Region VII consisting of the following states: Iowa, Kansas,
Missouri, and Nebraska. The successful grantee will be expected to present the pilot program results in a round-table
evaluation forum of appropriate stakeholders and governmental officials. Each proposal submitted will be reviewed
and evaluated against established qualification and evaluation criteria. The DOE grant will not exceed $65,000.
Cost sharing is not mandatory, but will be included in the evaluation criteria. Grant award is expected to be made by
September 30, 1994.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy hereby designates an additional portion of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) site near
Carlsbad, New Mexico, an Off-Limits Area in accordance with 10 CFR Part 860, making it a federal crime under 42 U.S.C.
2278a for unauthorized persons to enter into or upon that part of the WIPP site. If unauthorized entry into or upon the
designated portion of the site is into an area enclosed by a fence, wall, roof, or other standard barrier, conviction
for such unauthorized entry may result in a fine of not more than $100,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year
or both. If unauthorized entry into or upon the site is into an area not enclosed by a fence, wall, roof, or other standard
barrier, conviction for such unauthorized entry may result in a fine of not more than $5,000.

Pricing Policy For New And Existing Facilities Constructed By Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines;



NOTICE OF PUBLIC CONFERENCE AND OPPORTUNITY TO FILE WRITTEN COMMENTS 



July 28, 1994. 



Take notice that the Commission will convene a public conference in the above-captioned proceeding to consider the
methodologies to be used in setting rates for transportation service with regard to new and existing facilities constructed
by interstate natural gas pipelines. The Commission also will be accepting written comments prior to the conference.
The date and procedures for the conference will be established by a subsequent notice. Written comments may be filed
within 60 days of the date of this notice. 



I. Scope of Inquiry 



Historically, when pipelines have sought to enlarge their facilities, the Commission had a preference for rolling-in
the costs of the new construction into the pipeline's cost-of-service and establishing a single rate for both the
existing customers and the expansion customers (those customers obtaining capacity as a result of the new facilities).
The Commission found that rolled-in pricing would be appropriate when the new facilities were part of an integrated
system and provided system-wide benefits.

1

 When the new construction was not integrated into the pipeline's existing system, the Commission would approve incremental
pricing in which a separate cost-of-service is established for the existing and expansion facilities, and the prior
holders of capacity (existing shippers) and expansion shippers pay different rates. 





The Commission, however, became concerned about the effect of rolling-in the costs of new construction that is integrated
into the pipeline's existing system. The Commission was particularly concerned with the effects of expensive construction
because using rolled-in rates could result in disproportionate costs being imposed on existing customers when compared
with the benefits they receive from the expansion.

2

 The Commission was further concerned that rolling-in rates in this situation could conflict with its efforts to adopt
rate designs that promote economic efficiency by causing the pipeline's existing customers to subsidize the rates
paid by expansion customers. As a result of these concerns, the Commission, in its 

Great Lakes 

orders, required the pipeline to charge incremental prices for a system expansion based on a test in which the benefits
to existing customers were weighed against the costs of rolling-in the facilities (commensurate benefits test).






In 

TransCanada Pipelines Limited

 v. 

FERC,



3

 the court of appeals, however, remanded the Commission's determination to use incremental rates in 

Great Lakes. 

The court concluded that the Commission had not justified its focus on commensurate benefits in light of the Commission's
past approach of examining whether the new facilities were integrated into existing facilities and whether the facilities
provided system-wide benefits, qualitatively described. The court also expressed concern that the use of incremental
pricing may result in undue discrimination because facility expansion is caused not only by the demands of the new
customers, but by the continuing demands of the existing customers.

The Commission has been moving towards greater reliance on market forces both in its rates and certificate policies.
In Order Nos. 436
 and 636
, the Commission required pipelines to provide unbundled, open access transportation in order to promote greater
efficiency and increased competition among pipelines and their customers, two goals that can be affected by the pricing
policies used for new construction. In order to contribute to achieving these two goals, the Commission also required
pipelines to institute capacity release mechanisms and to adopt flexible receipt and delivery point policies. In
the competitive world of unbundled transportation, shippers have many more transportation options, and the prices
shippers pay for transportation on different pipelines has become a critically important aspect of competition
in the market. In the competitive capacity market created by Order Nos. 436 and 636, the development of consistent
pricing policies is important both for pipelines and their customers, because they need to know the rates that will
be charged in order to make appropriate decisions about the amount of capacity to build and to purchase. 






The Commission is interested in undertaking a comprehensive evaluation of its current pricing policies to determine
whether revisions are needed. One goal of this effort is to develop pricing policies for new construction that will
properly reflect cost responsibility and that will further efficiency and competition in the market and promote
the development of the industry. Another important goal is to identify how best to provide pipelines and their existing
and future customers with as much certainty as possible about whether projects will be approved and the rates customers
will be paying for capacity when pipelines expand. Unless pipelines and customers are aware of the rate implications
of expansions, they cannot make informed decisions about the amount of capacity to build and to purchase. 

As part of the inquiry into ways to provide greater certainty about project approvals and rates for new construction,
the Commission is interested in reexamining its current certificate and rates policies for new construction. As
a result of the increased reliance on market forces brought about by Order Nos. 436 and 636, the Commission has reevaluated
its certificate policies to place greater reliance on the market. The Commission has established procedures under
which pipelines can obtain construction certificates for projects that are not fully subscribed at the time of application.
First, pipelines may apply for optional certificates for undersubscribed projects under which the pipelines are
at risk for cost recovery.
 Second, if pipelines apply for a traditional certificate and have not been able to demonstrate that the project will
be fully subscribed under long term contracts, the Commission has permitted the construction to go forward by issuing
certificates containing conditions under which the pipeline is placed at risk for unsubscribed capacity.
 The Commission, however, has declined to issue at-risk certificates where companies have failed to demonstrate
support for a significant amount of the projected capacity.








The Commission's policy has been to determine whether to allow a rolled-in pricing methodology for new facilities
when pipelines have sought to recover the costs for these facilities in proceedings under  4 of the Natural Gas
Act (NGA), rather than when the pipelines have sought certificate approval for construction under  7 of NGA.
However, when a pipeline seeks incremental pricing treatment, the Commission generally addresses this issue in
the  7 certificate proceeding where a new facility or service is first proposed. The Commission has not made
rolled-in pricing determinations in certificate applications because, in  7 certificate proceedings, the
Commission is considering rates only for new service or customers and cannot change the rates of the pipeline's existing
customers.

10

 One effect of making rolled-in pricing determinations in  4 rate proceedings is that the decision is made after
the facilities are built and after the customers have determined whether to sign contracts for the facilities.





In a recent order in 

Northwest Pipeline Corporation

,

11

 the Commission sought to provide greater certainty about rate treatment by issuing a declaratory order in Northwest's
certificate proceeding providing a preliminary determination of rate design methodology. Based on the information
provided by Northwest in its application and in response to Commission data requests, the Commission found that rolled-in
rate treatment would be appropriate in a subsequent  4 rate filing to recover the facility costs, provided,
however, that Northwest could show in the  4 rate proceeding that the expansion facilities would provide the
system-wide benefits it alleged in the certificate application and that the rate impact of rolling-in the facilities
would be approximately the same as, and not materially greater than, that projected by Northwest.

The Commission is interested in obtaining the industry's views on the extent of contractual support for a project
that should be required before the Commission expends resources evaluating the project's rate and environmental
aspects. The Commission is concerned about authorizing activities that will affect the environment or confer eminent
domain powers on an applicant when the applicant offers no support (whether by way of contracts or precedent agreements)
for its proposal. The Commission, however, also is aware that some applicants, particularly new entrants to the market,
may not be able to obtain the financing needed to attract customers for their project without some indication by the
Commission that the project ultimately may be approved and, if so, at what price capacity will be available. 

Depending on the policy adopted for recovering expansion costs, the Commission is also interested in examining whether
its current policy of making rolled-in rate determinations in  4 rate proceedings may need to be revised. For
example, if the Commission were to adopt a specific policy (such as always pricing on a rolled-in or incremental basis)
or definitive criteria, the question of the proceeding (whether a  7 certificate or a  4 rate case) in which
to make the determination could be less important, since pipelines and customers would know in advance how the facilities
would be priced. However, if the Commission were to adopt more general criteria, such as a system-wide benefits or
commensurate benefits test, the Commission may need to consider whether and how to revise its current policies on
when and in what proceeding to make the determination. 

The Commission is establishing this conference to obtain views from all facets of the gas industry on issues relating
to the methods for recovering facility costs. The Commission discusses below some of the issues bearing on the determination
of pricing methodologies. The Commission is interested in hearing the industry's views on these issues, as well as
other issues related to facility cost recovery, in written submissions and in oral presentations at the conference.




II. Issues to be Considered 



A. Benefits And Effects Resulting From The Adoption Of Rolled-in Or Incremental Pricing 



The Commission is interested in receiving comments on the competitive effects of adopting rolled-in or incremental
pricing as well as other effects resulting from the choice of pricing methodology. The following are some of the questions
that will be considered. 

1. Which pricing methodology better reflects cost responsibility and provides better market signals about the appropriate
scale of construction? Will rolled-in pricing lead to overbuilding because the existing customers are contributing
to the costs of construction? On the other hand, does rolled-in pricing better avoid piecemeal expansions, and higher
overall costs, by permitting pipelines to build facilities to better serve future needs? Is Commission oversight
through its certificate regulation sufficient to prevent overbuilding? 

2. What is the effect of each pricing methodology on other national goals, such as promoting the use of natural gas or
protecting the environment? For example, which methodology would better permit the market to make the appropriate
fuel choice given environmental and other impacts of the choice? 

3. Does the choice of pricing methodology have a significant effect on competition among pipelines? For example,
does a new pipeline, whose prices reflect current construction costs, have difficulty competing against an existing
pipeline that can roll-in new facilities costs? If so, should this be a regulatory concern? 

4. Does the choice of pricing methodology have a significant effect on competition in the capacity release market?
For example, does an incremental shipper, whose rates reflect the current cost of construction, have difficulty
competing in the capacity release market with a shipper paying a pre-expansion rate? 

5. Does the adoption of any pricing methodology better comport with a regulatory regime that relies on private contracts
and market forces? For example, does the choice of pricing methodology affect business planning and the negotiation
of long-term contracts? How important is long-term contracting to the industry?

<TEXT>
 

6. Does charging shippers different prices for the same service under incremental pricing (vintage pricing) create
economic distortions or undue discrimination, as raised by the Court in 

TransCanada

? Commenters should consider the following questions.

a. Does vintage pricing create economic distortions and, if so, are such distortions greater or less than those associated
with rolled-in pricing? 

b. Should existing shippers be entitled to receive lower prices because they signed long-term contracts with the
pipelines when prices were lower? Commenters should address the terms and conditions relating to rate increases
that would exist in long term contracts in a competitive market for capacity. They also should address the prices existing
shippers should pay when their contracts expire. 

c. What price should a new shipper which acquires existing capacity (formerly priced at a pre-expansion rate) pay?
For example, if an existing shipper exercises a contractual right to reduce its contract demand freeing capacity
for a new shipper, should a new shipper pay the pre-expansion, the incremental, or some other rate for that freed-up
capacity? 

d. Are there methods of dealing with the vintage pricing issue? For example, should current shippers be able to release
capacity prior to the expansion at up to the proposed incremental rate? If current shippers are willing to release
some of their existing capacity prior to the expansion, the scale of the expansion could be reduced. Permitting current
shippers to release capacity also would ensure that all shippers would make their capacity determinations based
on incremental prices and that capacity would be allocated to those shippers valuing it the most. 



B. What Pricing Methodology Or Test Should The Commission Adopt For New And Existing Facilities? 



Given the economic effects of the potential choices, the Commission is interested in obtaining comments on the pricing
methodology or methodologies that should be used. Comments should not be limited to the rolled-in or incremental
methodologies used in the past, but should include potential alternative approaches, with a discussion of the benefits
of each approach. If the Commission were to continue its case-by-case approach to determining pricing methodology,
the Commission is interested in obtaining comments on the appropriate test that should be used in making this determination.
The following are some questions to be considered. 

1. What does the industry need in the way of new construction over the next decade (

e.g

., expansion of facilities, access to new market or supply areas, replacement of old facilities, connections between
existing facilities to create greater flexibility) and how do these needs bear upon the methodology or methodologies
used by the Commission to set rates for new construction?

2. Do changes in the industry warrant the adoption of a new approach to establishing pricing methodologies for new
or existing construction? For example, are there relevant differences between current and past expansions in terms
of the rate impact of the expansions or the customers served by the expansion (

e.g

., all the pipeline's customers rather than a subset)? What effect does the advent of open access transportation and
the unbundling of gas sales from transportation brought about by Order Nos. 436 and 636 have on the choice of pricing
methodology? 

3. To what extent should other aspects of rate design (

e.g

., unbundling, mileage-based rate design, seasonal rate design, production area rate design, or market based rates)
affect the Commission's policy on the choice between rolled-in and incremental rates?

4. Should the Commission continue to use general criteria, such as the extent of system-wide benefits, or should it
adopt discrete policies or guidelines for determining the appropriate methodologies. The following are some possible
options to be considered.

a. Different methodologies could be used depending on the type of construction, for example mainline expansions,
laterals, extensions beyond the existing termination point, or facilities directly connected to certain customers.


b. Thresholds could be set for determining which methodology to apply, for example, rolling-in costs for facilities
unless they would increase rates by more than a certain percentage. 

c. Rates for expansion customers could be set at the higher of rolled-in or incremental rates.

<TEXT>
 

5. Should the Commission consider options other than full rolled-in or incremental pricing of new facilities? The
following are some options to be considered.

a. Rates for expansion customers could be set based on the sum of incremental costs and a share of pre-expansion costs
to reflect the benefits expansion customers receive from existing facilities. The rates for existing shippers also
could be adjusted to reflect benefits received from the expansion. 

b. Rates could be set on an incremental basis, with the costs rolled-in after some specified period of time or rolled-in
gradually over time at a pre-determined level each year. 

c. Incremental rates could be used for the expansion customers, but as lower priced contracts for existing shippers
expire, their capacity would be rolled-in to the expansion capacity, thus reducing the incremental rate. 

d. Rolled-in rates could be used for expansions (or portions of expansions) built to serve existing markets and incremental
rates for expansions (or portions of expansions) used to serve new markets. 

6. If more general criteria are to be used in individual cases, what should the tests or criteria be? Among the issues
to be considered are: 

a. Should the Commission adopt a rebuttable presumption in favor of a particular pricing method and what test should
be used to overcome the presumption? 

b. Should the commensurate benefits test be used for approving rolled-in pricing or is it sufficient that existing
shippers obtain positive benefits? 

c. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each test, or is another formulation more appropriate? 

d. Do benefits need to be measurable? What weight should be given to various criteria, and how should non-measurable
criteria be valued? 

7. How should the Commission handle multiple expansions, in particular when an initial, expensive addition makes
subsequent additions less costly? 

For example, pure incremental pricing could cause customers to seek to delay making commitments until the later,
less expensive expansion in order to obtain lower rates, while rolled-in pricing could discourage construction
of the less expensive expansion because rates would be above the incremental cost of the project. 

a. Which of the options is preferable? 

b. Are there methods that could avoid both problems? 

c. Should the Commission adopt a policy under which the costs for expansions starting from a particular date are cumulated
or ``rolled-up'' to yield an average expansion rate? 



C. Should The Commission Revise Its Policies To Provide More Guidance On Construction Approvals And Rates In  7
Certificate Proceedings? 



The Commission is interested in reviewing its current policies relating to granting at-risk certificates and determining
the rate methodology for new projects to determine if changes in these policies are needed. For example, if the Commission
adopts more general policies for recovering the costs of new facilities, rather than a bright-line test, pipeline
customers may need notice of the rates they will be paying prior to the completion of the  4 proceeding in order
to make better informed decisions about the amount of capacity for which to contract. 

The Commission is interested in receiving comments on the following questions. 

1. What pricing methodology is most consistent with the Commission's at-risk certificate policy? 

a. Is there any reason to differentiate between at-risk construction and fully subscribed construction in terms
of the pricing methodology used for facility cost recovery? 

b. If rolled-in pricing is used, how should the at-risk condition be maintained? 

c. In light of the Commission's at-risk policy, should the optional certificate regulations be continued?

<TEXT>
 

2. What are the benefits or detriments of issuing preliminary determinations on certain aspects of a certificate
application (such as environmental issues and rates)? Are preliminary determinations useful in dealing with economic
aspects of a certificate proposal? What level of contractual or market support should be required to justify the issuance
of a preliminary determination? What time limitations, if any, should the Commission impose on submission of supplemental
evidence demonstrating contractual or market support? 
3. Should the Commission make a distinction in granting preliminary determinations depending on whether: (a) Market-based
rates are proposed; (b) the applicant is a new company; or (c) little or no new construction of facilities is involved?
What other distinctions, if any, should be made? 
4. What are the benefits and detriments of making pricing decisions in or coincident with certificate proceedings?

a. Should the Commission use the preliminary determination or declaratory order approach as in 

Northwest

? If so, what should be the burden of proof, what procedures should be used, and how binding should the determination
be on subsequent  4 proceedings? 
In particular, commenters should address whether to use abbreviated procedures to make the preliminary determination.
For example, the more abbreviated the procedures used during the certificate proceeding, the more quickly the determination
will be made. On the other hand, the use of abbreviated procedures may increase the risk that the full  4 proceeding
may reveal problems or difficulties that were not apparent during the certificate examination. In other words, should
the Commission provide certificate applicants with the choice of: (1) A fast-track procedure for applicants which
wish to charge incremental rates, or which otherwise have no need for an up-front determination of the rolled-in rate
treatment issue; or (2) a separate procedure for applicants which desire an up-front determination on rolled-in
rate treatment and are willing to accept the likely evidentiary burdens as well as the additional time likely to process
such an application? If so, how should these different tracks be designed? 
b. Should the Commission exercise its  5 authority in the certificate proceeding to establish rates for all
customers? 
c. Should the Commission require pipelines seeking rolled-in rate treatment to file a  4 proceeding along with
the certificate application? 
Commenters should address whether the filing should be a limited  4 filing examining only the expansion costs
and the pricing methodology for these costs or whether it should be a full  4 proceeding in which all the pipeline's
costs are examined. Would a limited  4 proceeding be appropriate when the pipelines agrees to file a full  4
proceeding within a stipulated time frame? 
d. Should the Commission be able to change the initial rate methodology adopted for facilities at a later point in time?
Does changing methodologies upset the goal of providing rate certainty? What criteria should the Commission use
in making such changes? 


D. Implementation Issues Related To Use Of Incremental Rates 


The Commission is interested in exploring a number of questions relating to the implementation of incremental rates.

1. How should the maximum rate for interruptible transportation be determined under incremental rates? 
2. The Commission has a policy that all shippers have a right to use all receipt and delivery points within the firm transportation
path to which the shipper is entitled or for which it is willing to pay. 
a. How does the charging of different rates (in terms of an expansion shipper paying incremental rates and a non-expansion
shipper paying pre-expansion rates) affect the flexible receipt and delivery point policy? Should non-expansion
shippers have access to points on the expansion facilities? And, at what rate? 
b. Should expansion shippers have access to points on the existing facilities? Is it equitable for existing non-expansion
shippers, who pay a pre-expansion rate, to have access to receipt and/or delivery points in competition with expansion
shippers paying a higher incremental rate at the same points? 
3. Are there other administrative burdens on the industry or the Commission that would be occasioned by incremental
rates? For example, pipelines now administer complex zone rate schedules. How much additional burden is created
by incremental rates? 


E. Questions Relating To Other Inquiries 


The Commission anticipates that it will initiate two other inquiries in the near future to address: (1) The performance
of the current Order No. 636 capacity release program and whether that program can be improved to make the present secondary
market in pipeline capacity more efficient; and (2) the relationship between the Commission's open access transportation
policies and the use of natural gas as a fuel for electric generation. 
1. How do incremental rates, with different customers paying different rates, affect the current capacity release
program and how should any problems or issues be handled? For example, what maximum rate should apply to shippers paying
different rates? 
2. If the Commission were to modify the current capacity release program (

e.g.,

 by eliminating the price cap or by allowing releases outside of the pipeline's Electronic Bulletin Boards), would
there be any effect that should be considered in deciding whether to apply rolled-in or incremental rates? Conversely,
would the Commission's decision to use either rolled-in or incremental rates require modification of the Commission's
regulations governing capacity release transactions? Or, will the secondary market, with or without modification,
work equally well under either rate approach? 
3. Would either rolled-in or incremental treatment of new facilities be most consistent with a policy designed to
facilitate the use of natural gas for the electric generation and cogeneration market? Please provide specific examples
to the extent available. 


III. Comment and Conference Procedures 


An original and 14 copies of comments on these issues should be filed with the Commission within 60 days after the date
of this notice. Comments should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, and should refer to Docket No. PL94-4-000. All written
comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for inspection in the Commission's
Public Reference Room at 941 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, during regular business hours. The Commission
will issue a subsequent notice of the date for the public conference and the procedures regarding presentations by
the public at the conference.

 Revised Procedural Guidance Document of the Advertising and Promotional Labeling Staff, Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research; Availability


Agency:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.



Action:

 Notice.




<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a revised guidance document prepared by
the ~~Advertising and Promotional Labeling Staff (APLS) within the Office of Establishment Licensing and Product
Surveillance (OELPS), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). This document revises the original
procedural guide. FDA revised the guide to address comments received and also to address the submission of promotional
materials for products reviewed under the regulations for accelerated approval.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA is making available a revised APLS Procedural Guidance document. This document supersedes the APLS Procedural
Guide that was announced in the 

Federal Register

 of August 9, 1993 (58 FR 42340). FDA revised the guide to address received comments and also to address requirements
for the submission of promotional materials for products reviewed under the regulations for accelerated approval
(21 CFR part 601 subpart E). 



 The APLS Procedural Guidance document details the approach that manufacturers and distributors should follow in
submitting advertising and promotional material for review by CBER, and APLS' approach in the review and evaluation
of this material. The APLS Procedural Guidance document also provides guidance on CBER's current interpretation
of the regulation requiring the reporting of important proposed changes in the labeling, specifically promotional
labeling, of biological products for which a license is in effect or for which an application for license is pending
(21 CFR 601.12). 
 In general, the changes to the original procedural guide respond to requests for additional clarification and guidance
in several areas involving biologic advertising and promotion. The term ``significant amendment'' has been changed
throughout the document to ``any supplement requiring a labeling change.'' A brief description of the types of supplements
that would require a labeling change has also been added. The guide also contains information on advertising and promotional
materials for products reviewed under the accelerated approval regulations (21 CFR part 601, subpart E). The revised
procedural guide also addresses the submission for pre-review of ``Coming Soon'' advertising as part of the introductory
campaign. FDA also clarifies when Part I versus Part II of the FDA form 2567 is used.
 As with other procedural guidance documents, FDA does not intend this revised document to be all-inclusive. Alternative
approaches may be warranted in specific situations, and certain aspects may not be applicable to all situations.
If a manufacturer believes that a procedure described in this guidance document is inapplicable to a particular product
and other procedures are appropriate for CBER's consideration, the manufacturer may wish to discuss the matter further
with the agency to prevent expenditure of money and effort on activities that later may be determined to be unacceptable
by FDA. CBER will continue to review advertising and promotional materials on a case-by-case basis. 
This document does not bind FDA and does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits on or for any person,
but is intended merely for guidance.
 Interested persons may submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments on this guide. Two
copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments and information
should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The APLS Procedural
Guidance and received comments are available for public examination in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m.
and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

FDA will consider any comments received in determining whether additional revisions to the guide are warranted.
FDA will announce the availability of any revised guidance statement in the 

Federal Register

.

Draft ``Points To Consider in the Manufacture and Testing Of Monoclonal Antibody Products For Human Use;'' Availability



Agency: 

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.




Action: 

 Notice.




<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a draft points to consider (PTC) document
entitled ``Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody Products For Human Use.'' The
draft PTC document is intended to assist sponsors and investigators of monoclonal antibody (mAb) products intended
for human use. This document revises a 1987 document entitled ``Points to Consider (PTC) in the Manufacture and Testing
of Monoclonal Antibody Products for Human Use.'' The updated version contains the general guidance from the Center
for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regarding monoclonal antibody product development, including information
to be submitted when filing an investigational new drug application (IND) and product license application (PLA).

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 FDA is announcing the availability of a draft PTC document entitled ``Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing
of Monoclonal Antibody Products for Human Use.'' The draft PTC document reflects the considerable experience that
has been gained through review of submissions since 1987 and discussions that have taken place at several national
and international meetings. The draft PTC document provides a discussion of topics that should be considered in the
development of monoclonal antibody products. At present, most monoclonal antibody (mAb) products are produced
by hybridoma cell lines through immortalization of antibody-producing cells by chemically-induced fusion with
myeloma cells. In some cases, additional fusions with other lines have created ``triomas'' and ``quadromas.'' CBER
anticipates an increase in recombinant and human antibodies in the future. The principles reviewed by the draft PTC
document may be applied in general to all hybridoma and heterohybridoma generated products, regardless of species
of origin.


The draft PTC document details the approach that sponsors and investigators should follow in product manufacturing
and testing, preclinical and clinical studies, and the information to be provided for review and evaluation of clinical
testing and licensing. The draft PTC document describes the characterization of purified, unmodified mAb which
is essential for manufacturing control of product, determination of potency and stability, and development of an
appropriate clinical development program. Special considerations for immunoconjugates (monoclonal antibodies
conjugated with toxins, drugs, radionuclides or other agents) are addressed. The draft PTC document also details
the considerations for combination products. Issues addressed in the draft PTC document include: (1) Quality control
and product testing including cell line qualification; (2) lot-to-lot quality control monitoring of bulk lots and
final product specifications; (3) stability of the product; and (4) quantitation and removal of a known contaminant.
The draft PTC document also addresses issues related to manufacturing changes, including those made either during
clinical development or subsequent to product approval. The draft PTC document discusses issues relating to: (1)
Preclinical studies including 

in vitro

 testing for cross-reactivity; (2) preclinical pharmacology; (3) safety; and (4) toxicity testing. With respect
to clinical studies, the draft PTC document discusses general study design for Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies, clinical
considerations involved in immunogenicity, dosimetry, and imaging agents for cancer. 
As with other PTC documents, FDA does not intend this draft PTC document to be all-inclusive and cautions that not all
information may be applicable to all situations. The draft PTC document is intended to provide information and does
not set forth requirements. The methods and procedures cited in the draft PTC document are suggestions. FDA anticipates
that sponsors and investigators may develop alternative methods and procedures, and discuss them with FDA. CBER
may find those alternative methods and procedures acceptable. FDA recognizes that advances will continue in the
area of monoclonal antibodies and that this document may become outdated as those advances occur. This PTC document
does not bind FDA and does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits on or for any private person, but
is intended merely for guidance.
Interested persons may submit written comments on the draft PTC document to the Dockets Management Branch (address
above). FDA anticipates revising the draft PTC document periodically in response to comments received or to reflect
advancements in monoclonal antibody therapies and products.

Canned Pineapple Fruit From Thailand 



Determination 



On the basis of the record 

1

 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines, pursuant to section 733(a) of the Tariff Act
of 1930 (19 U.S.C.  1673b(a)), that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is
materially injured by reason of imports from Thailand of canned pineapple fruit,

2

 provided for in subheading 2008.20.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to
be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). 






Background 



On June 8, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by Maui Pineapple Company,
Ltd., Kahului, HI, and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, alleging that an industry in
the United States is materially injured by reason of LTFV imports of canned pineapple fruit from Thailand. Accordingly,
effective June 8, 1994, the Commission instituted antidumping investigation No. 731-TA-706 (Preliminary).


Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith
was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of June 16, 1994 (59 FR 30951). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on June 29, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 

The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on July 25, 1994.

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review the presiding administrative
law judge's (ALJ's) initial determination (ID) in the above-captioned investigation terminating the investigation
on the basis of a settlement agreement. By its own terms, the temporary limited exclusion order issued in this investigation
expired with the termination of the investigation. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 4, 1993, Space Systems/Loral, Inc. (SSL) filed a complaint and a motion for temporary relief with the Commission
alleging violations of section 337 in the importation, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States
after importation of certain dielectric miniature microwave filters and multiplexers containing same. SSL's complaint
alleged infringement of claims 1, 3, 7-11, and 14 of U.S. Letters Patent 4,489,293 (the '293 patent). The motion
for temporary relief was limited to claims 1 and 14 of the '293 patent. 



The Commission instituted an investigation into the allegations of SSL's complaint, provisionally accepted SSL's
motion for temporary relief, and published a notice to that effect in the 

Federal Register

. 58 FR 60877-78 (November 18, 1993). The notice named Com Dev Ltd. (Com Dev) of Ontario, Canada as the only respondent.


On March 17, 1994, the ALJ issued an ID finding that there was reason to believe that there is a violation of section 337
in the importation, sale for importation, or sale in the United States after importation of the accused miniature
microwave filters. The Commission determined to modify the ID in one minor respect, and to affirm the ID in all other
respects. On April 18, 1994, the Commission, having determined that temporary relief was warranted issued a limited
temporary exclusion order directed against Com Dev. 59 FR 19210 (April 22, 1994). 
This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C.  1337, and  210.53(h)
of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure, 19 CFR 210.53(h). 
Copies of the public version of the ALJ's ID, and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this
investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the
Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone

ACTION:

 Notice.





In the Matter of: Certain Processes for the Manufacture of Skinless Sausage Casing and Resulting Product


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to deny two petitions for modification
of the limited exclusion order issued November 26, 1984, in the above-captioned investigation.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 18, 1994, counsel for Viskase Corporation, successor in interest to complainant in the above-captioned
investigation, filed a petition requesting, 

inter alia,

 modification of the limited exclusion order issued at the conclusion of the investigation. Specifically, the petition
requested that the Commission extend the term of the limited exclusion order in order to remedy alleged violations
of that order by Viscofan, S.A., respondent in the original investigation. On February 24, 1994, counsel for Teepak,
Inc., also filed a petition requesting, 

inter alia,

 modification of that exclusion order to extend its term. The Commission determined to apply a revised procedure,
similar to the procedure set forth in proposed final rule 210.76, published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52830, 52883), to its consideration of the two petitions. The revised procedure provided
that any person might file a response to the two petitions. Numerous requests for leave to file submissions beyond
those provided for in the revised procedure were received by the Commission. The Commission denied those requests.
In addition, an allegation concerning disclosure of confidential business information was made by counsel on behalf
of Teepak. The Commission, having investigated the allegation, determined that no confidential business information
was disclosed in the filings in this proceeding.


Having considered the petitions for modification, and the responses thereto, the Commission has determined to deny
the petitions. The Commission will shortly issue its views regarding this matter.
This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337, 19 U.S.C.
1335), and section 211.57 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 211.57).
Copies of the Commission's Order and opinion, the petitions and responses thereto, and all other nonconfidential
documents filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business
hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, S.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20436, telephone (202) 205-2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information
on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on (202) 205-1810.



By order of the Commission.

Women's Bureau; Announcement of Competition for Grant Applications for the Nontraditional Employment for Women
(NEW) Act Demonstration Programs for Fiscal Year 1994



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, Women's Bureau, Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Office (Washington, D.C.) of the Women's Bureau, U.S. Department of Labor, announces the second year
(Fiscal Year 1994) of competition to award up to six (6) grants to States for conducting demonstration projects which
provides women with a wider range of training opportunities in nontraditional fields.



The Act established a four-year, $6 million demonstration program to assist States in the development of exemplary
programs that train and place women in nontraditional occupations, with special emphasis on growth occupations
with increased wage potential.
The Department of Labor is to award, from funds available under Title IV of JTPA, $1.5 million per year for Fiscal Years
1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995; as stated, up to six grants per year may be awarded to States. Six grants were awarded in Fiscal
1992; five grants were awarded in 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background


Improving women's employment opportunities and other employment related equity and social issues that promote
women in the work force has been the driving force of the Women's Bureau since its inception in 1920. Within the Department
of Labor, the Director serves as the policy advisor on women's issues to the Secretary and DOL agencies charged with
improving the economic and workplace life of American workers. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Employment
and Training Administration and the Bureau co-administer the Nontraditional Employment for Women Act (NEW), with
the Bureau having responsibility for the demonstration program grants to States to promote higher wages for women
through NTO job training and placement.



Grant Authority



The demonstration program grants are authorized under the NEW Act, Public Law 102-235, signed December 1991,
effective July 1992. NEW amends the JTPA and, by reference, as subsequently amended by the Job Training Reform Amendments
of 1992.
The NEW demonstration program grant awards are funded from Title IV of JTPA. (JTPA discretionary money is transferred
to the Women's Bureau.) The funding is set at $1.5 million, annually, to make no more than six (6) awards for fiscal years
1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995.



First (1992) and Second (1993) Year NEW Awards



The first year of competition (Fiscal Year 1992) began September 1992 with the publication of the Solicitation for
Grant Applications (SGA) 

#

92-01 in the 

Federal Register

. Thirty-eight proposals were received in response to the SGA. Both a WB/ETA technical review panel and an OASAM Office
of Procurement Services cost review panel evaluated all proposals and was the basis for funding recommendations
to the Secretary. On January 19, 1993, grants were awarded to the District of Columbia, Louisiana, Maryland, Texas,
Washington, and Wyoming.
The second year of competition (Fiscal Year 1993) began in May 1993 with the publication of the Solicitation for Grant
Applications (SGA) 

#

93-03 in the 

Federal Register

. Thirty-two proposals were received in response to the SGA. Both a WB/ETA technical review panel and an OASAM Office
of Procurement Services cost review panel evaluated all proposals and was the basis for funding recommendations
to the Secretary. On December 6, 1993, grants were awarded to California, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and New Jersey.



II. Eligible Applicants



The State is the eligible applicant for a NEW demonstration grant award. The Governor of each State, as is the case with
JTPA Titles II and III, is the recipient of awards under the NEW Act. Governors in turn designate an agency at the State
level to administer JTPA for the State; that agency can apply for the NEW grants on behalf of the Governor and the State.



III. Funding Levels



The Department expects to make six awards to States, the maximum allowed under the NEW Act. Proposal (i.e., grant application)
funding requests should average $225,000. The total funding level is $1.5 million.

In addition to costs, the Department will consider geographic diversity (distribution) in making grant awards.




IV. Demonstration Program Overview 



This Solicitation for Grant Applications (SGA) is extended to States who are committed to the goals and objectives
of NEW. It asks them to develop, enhance and implement demonstration and exemplary programs to train and place women
in nontraditional occupations (NTOs). For women, NTOs are occupations where less than 25 percent of the persons employed
in an occupation or field of work are women. NTOs are generally characterized by employment growth and the potential
for above average earnings individualized for each local labor market. 

The ultimate goal of the NEW Act is to increase the earnings of women and, thereby, the self-sufficiency of women and
their families. To examine ways of accomplishing that goal, the New Act provides funding incentives in its demonstration
and exemplary program grants. States shall develop and implement projects/programs that illustrate, by their example,
effective ways to incorporate and sustain systemic change in the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) service delivery
system_the Private Industry Councils' (PICs) procedures and programming_to promote the training and placement
of women in NTOs to increase their employment and earnings. 

States applying for funds may develop new initiatives or enhancements to existing job training programs and services.
Grant funds are to develop and/or supplement, not supplant current funding to train and place women in NTOs.

Grant funds must not be used as ``replacement'' funds for activities that are currently funded through other Federal
programs; i.e., JTPA or Carl Perkins Vocational * * * NEW grant funds can be used in addition to, but
not instead of, other Federal funds to expand or enhance programs. Grantee projects serve as models and should be disseminated
for replication throughout the JTPA systems and within other education, training and employment programs in the
State. 

States have completed the development of their second two-year Governor's Coordination and Special Services Plans
(GCSSP). The GCSSP must include measurable goals for women in nontraditional training and placement, with particular
attention to implementation through the JTPA system as required by NEW. 

All States that apply for NEW grant funds must have and describe the measurable State goals for the implementation
of training and placing women in NTOs to be responsive to this SGA.

In addition, a high priority will be given to State proposals that provide evidence (in measurable outcomes for women)
of the State's prior and ongoing commitment to the goals and objectives of NEW to train and place women in local area-specific
nontraditional employment with above average earnings. Such commitment can be measured, in part, from State proposals
with (1) greater than average (15 percent of more) proportion of women's JTPA training for NTOs; (2) substantial employment
placement rate (85 percent or greater); and (3) wage rates above the local average. 

As required by the NEW Act's demonstration and exemplary programs legislation, the Women's Bureau will also consider
the following:

(1) the level of coordination between the JTPA and other resources available for training women in nontraditional
employment, i.e., Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA), Department of Housing and Urban, etc., and other Federal, State and local job training resources;


(2) the extent of private sector involvement in the development and implementation of training programs under the
JTPA; 

(3) the extent to which the initiatives proposed by a State supplement or build upon existing efforts in a State to train
and place women in nontraditional employment; 

(4) the extent to which a State is prepared to disseminate information on its demonstration training programs, and

(5) the extent to which a State is prepared to produce materials that allow for replication of such State's demonstration
training program. 

A State's operating entity for JTPA (as described above in II. Eligible Applicants) interested in submitting a grant
application for review under the FY 1994 competition should request a copy of SGA

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>







Omaha Public Power District, Fort Calhoun Station, Unit No. 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of Significant
Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) regarding submission of the report of annual radioactive liquid and gaseous effluents released
to unrestricted areas during the previous calendar year to the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD/the licensee),
for the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit No. 1, located in Washington County, Nebraska.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would exempt the licensee from the filing time requirements of 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) regarding
the submission of the report of annual radioactive liquid and gaseous effluents released to unrestricted areas during
the previous calendar year. By letter dated May 25, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2)
to allow the licensee to change the date specified in the technical specifications for submitting this report from
March 1 to before May 1, starting in 1995. These reports are required by 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) to be submitted at intervals
no greater than 12 months. Because of the change, the interval between the 1994 and the 1995 reports will be greater
than 12 months.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed exemption is needed to allow the licensee to implement the new requirements of the draft Generic Letter
regarding the new 10 CFR part 20 into its Technical Specification (TS) 5.9.4.a. The previous TS 5.9.4.a was based on
the old requirement that the report be submitted within 60 days after January 1 of each year (March 1). Approval of the
new TS will require this one time exemption to change the date of submission from March 1 to any date prior to May 1. This
exemption will not affect the information required to be submitted for the time period the report covers (the previous
calendar year's data); only the date the report is to be submitted would be changed.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



Our evaluation of the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) indicates that the granting of the exemption will
not affect the information required to be submitted or the time period the report covers. Therefore, the Commission
concludes that there are no measurable radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts associated with
the proposed exemption.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternatives will have either no environmental impact or will have a greater environmental impact. The principal
alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the environmental impacts attributed
to this facility and would result in precluding the licensee from changing its TS to be consistent with the new 10 CFR
part 20.



Alternate Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
(FES) for the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit No. 1, dated August 1972.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the Nebraska State official. The State official
had no comments regarding the NRC's proposed action.



Findings of No Significant Impact




The NRC staff has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based upon
the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated May 25, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the
Local Public Document Room located at the W. Dale Clark Library, 215 South 15th Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68102.

<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>


Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses
Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from July 11, 1994, through
July 22, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on July 20, 1994 (59 FR 37060).



Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, Opportunity For A Hearing



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By September 2, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material

County, South Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

June 29, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment will delete the requirement to perform alternate train testing to demonstrate that other,
similar, safety-related components are operable when components are found, or made, inoperable in the safety injection,
residual heat removal, and containment spray systems. The surveillance requirements, which the licensee refers
to as accelerated testing requirements, affect the following components: 

(a)Safety Injection (SI) pumps TS 3.3.1.2.b)
 
(b) Residual Heat Removal (RHR) Pumps (TS 3.3.1.2.c)

(c) SI and RHR flow paths (TS 3.3.1.2.e)

(d) Containment Spray (CS) (TS 3.3.2.2.a and b)

(e) CS flow paths (TS 3.3.2.2.c)



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated
because the availability of the subject components will not be reduced and the design and performance of the components
are not being changed. The subject components are provided to mitigate the consequences of analyzed accidents; therefore
their availability has no bearing on the probability of occurrence of these accidents.

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
This change deletes alternate train testing requirements which, if maintained, could result in loss of the safety
function. Elimination of the requirements will serve to ensure that one train of safety equipment is always available
to mitigate the consequences of an analyzed accident. The remaining surveillance requirements provide adequate
assurance that the components will be operable when required. Therefore the consequences of previously evaluated
accidents will not be increase.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated because these proposed changes do not introduce any new modes of operation or testing, and no physical changes
are being made to the plant. Therefore no new or different kind of accident could be initiated by this amendment.

3. The proposed revisions do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety since the routine testing
requirements that remain in the Technical Specifications provide adequate assurance that the components will be
operable when needed. Since the elimination of this accelerated testing will decrease component wear and improve
availability, the margin of safety should be increased. Since accelerated testing may still occur when component
problems involve a potential common mode failure, margins of safety associated with the components' abilities to
perform their design functions will not be affected. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 13, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would make several changes to the Administrative Controls in Section 6 of Technical Specifications
(TS) for Byron and Braidwood stations. The proposed changes include: (1) a change to the submittal frequency of the
Radiological Effluent Release Report, (2) a revision to the Shift Technical Advisor description, (3) clarification
of the Shift Engineer's responsibilities, and (4) editorial changes. The references to the Semiannual Radiological
Effluent Release Report are also revised in other sections of the TS.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
The proposed changes to Section 6 of Technical Specifications do not affect any accident initiators or precursors
and do not change or alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of
an accident. 

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and provide clarification. These changes provide consistency
with station procedures, programs, the Code of Federal Regulations, other Technical Specifications, and Standard
Technical Specifications. These changes do not impact any accident previously evaluated in the UFSAR. 

B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. There
are no changes to parameters governing plant operation; no new or different type of equipment will be installed. The
proposed changes are considered to be administrative changes. All responsibilities described in Technical Specifications
for management activities will continue to be performed by qualified individuals. 

C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The proposed changes do not affect the margin of safety for any Technical Specification. The initial conditions and
methodologies used in the accident analyses remain unchanged, therefore, accident analysis results are not impacted.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on the margin of safety of any Technical Specification.
They do not affect any plant safety parameters or setpoints. The descriptions for the Shift Technical Advisor and
Shift Engineer are clarified, however, include no reduction to their responsibilities. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

July 6, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.4.5, ``Steam Generators,'' and the associated
bases. Previously the NRC granted amendments to the TSs which authorized the use of selected steam generator sleeving
processes. In authorizing use of the processes, the amendments cited references to specific NRC approved vendor
technical reports, including revision number. The proposed changes reference the reports in generic terms as those
that have been approved by the NRC, subject to limitations and restrictions as noted by the NRC staff. While the licensee
will still have to request NRC approval for application of the technologies as referenced in vendor reports, the licenses
will not have to be amended each time. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed changes to the Steam Generator section of Technical Specifications do not affect any accident initiators
or precursors and do not alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences
of an accident. These changes are editorial changes to the requirements currently identified in the Technical Specifications.
The requirements approved by the NRC will not be reduced by this request. The proposed change maintains the administrative
controls necessary to ensure safe plant operation.

The original amendment requested tubesheet sleeves and tube support plate sleeves as an alternate tube repair method
for Bryon and Braidwood Units 1 and 2. The steam generator sleeves approved for installation use the Westinghouse
process (laser welded joints) or the Babcock & Wilcox Nuclear Technologies (BWNT) process of kinetically welded
joints. The sleeve configuration was designed and analyzed in accordance with the criteria of Regulatory Guide (RG)
1.121 and the design requirements of Section III of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code. Fatigue
and stress analyses of the sleeved tube assemblies for both processes produced acceptable results documented in
the current Westinghouse and BWNT Technical Reports. The proposed Technical Specifications change to allow the
use of the current NRC approved laser welded or kinetically welded sleeving process does not adversely impact any
other previously evaluated design basis accident or the results of these analyses. Therefore, the editorial changes
to the referenced sleeving Technical Reports will not increase the probability of occurrence of an accident previously
evaluated.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed changes are considered to be administrative changes. All the requirements described in Technical Specifications
``Acceptance Criteria'' for the Steam Generators will continue to be implemented as described in the current Technical
Reports.

Referencing the current Westinghouse or BWNT Sleeving Technical Reports currently approved by the NRC and subject
to the limitations and restrictions as noted by the NRC, has no effect upon any design transient or accident analyses.
The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. There
are no changes to parameters governing plant operation and no new or different type of equipment will be installed.

The use of the proposed sleeving processes will not introduce significant or adverse changes to the plant design basis.
Stress and fatigue analyses of the repair have shown the ASME Code and 
RG 1.121 allowable values are met. Implementation of the currently approved laser welded or kinetically welded sleeving
will continue to maintain the overall tube bundle structural integrity at a level consistent with that of the originally
supplied tubing. Repair of a tube with a sleeve does not provide a mechanism which would result in an accident outside
of the area affected by the sleeve. Any hypothetical accident as a result of potential tube or sleeve degradation in
the repaired portion of the tube is bounded by the existing steam generator tube rupture accident analysis. The tube
rupture accident analysis accounts for the installation of sleeves and the impact on current plugging level analyses.
The sleeve design does not affect any other component or location on the tube outside of the immediate area repaired.

Thus, the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change is administrative in nature and has no impact on the margin of safety of any Technical Specification.
Specific technical reports are no longer referenced in Technical Specifications. An editorial change is made to
TS referencing the current NRC approved vendor Technical Report, subject to the limitations and restrictions noted
by the NRC. The initial conditions and methodologies used in the accident analyses remain unchanged.

The laser welded and kinetically welded sleeving repair of degraded steam generator tubes has been shown by analysis
to restore the integrity of the tube bundle to its original design basis condition. The safety factors used in the design
of sleeves for the repair of degraded tubes are consistent with the safety factors in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel
Code used in steam generator design. The design of the tube sleeves has been verified by testing to preclude leakage
during normal and postulated accident conditions. Installation of either type of vendor sleeve using the current
approved process will continue to maintain the structural integrity of the steam generator tubes.

Thus, these changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Illinois




Date of amendment request: 

June 9, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would revise the LaSalle County Station, Units 1 and 2, Technical Specifications (TS), Appendix
A, in order to facilitate implementation of the Thermal Limits portion of the General Electric Average Power Range
Monitor (APRM)/Rod Block Monitor (RBM)/TS Improvement Program (ARTS).
Specifically, the proposed TS change will create power and flow dependent Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) and
Maximum Average Planar Linear Heat Generation Rate (MAPLHGR) limits, and other administrative changes.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because:

The probability of an accident previously evaluated will not increase as a result of this change, because no changes
to plant systems will occur. All changes are related to core monitoring software, and there will be no physical changes
to equipment.
 
The consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not increase as a result of the proposed changes. The power-
and flow-dependent MCPR and MAPLHGR limits incorporate sufficient conservatism so the safety limit MCPR [SLMCPR]
(operating limit MCPR [OLMCPR] for automatic flow control) and the fuel thermal-mechanical limits will not be violated
for any power and flow condition. Because these limits are protected during normal operation, the consequences of
any transient will not increase with this change in limit definition. General Electric has verified in Attachment
E that the introduction of Arts will not cause any change in the Licensing Basis PCT [Peak Centerline Temperature]
resulting from a Loss-Of-Coolant Accident [LOCA], nor any change in the results satisfying the other LOCA acceptance
criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 and Section 15.6.5 of NUREG-0800 (Standard Review Plan), which are: cladding oxidation,
metal-water reaction (hydrogen generation), coolable geometry and long-term cooling.
 
The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because:

Since no physical changes to any plant system are occurring, there will be no new or different types of accidents created
by this change. No interactions between equipment systems will be changed in any manner. 

The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because:

The power- and flow-dependent MCPR and MAPLHGR limits will sufficiently protect the SLMCPR (OLMCPR for automatic
flow control) and the fuel thermal-mechanical limits at all power and flow conditions. The ARTS limits conservatively
assure that all licensing criteria are satisfied without setdown of the flow referenced APRM scram and rod block trips.
The limits were developed using NRC approved methods, and satisfy the same NRC approved criteria that the APRM setdown
requirement does. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

July 13, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The requested amendments would allow the testing interval in Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement
4.6.2 for the air or smoke flow test through each containment spray header to be increased from 5 to 10 years. The licensee
states that the proposed amendments are consistent with NRC staff guidance contained in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements
to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements,'' and Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications
Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.'' In addition, the amendments
would also remove an obsolete footnote related to the Catawba Unit 1 first refueling. The licensee's application
jointly addressed both its Catawba and McGuire Nuclear Stations. This notice addresses those aspects applicable
only to the Catawba Station. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:





Criterion 1

The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Increasing the surveillance interval of TS [Technical Specification] 4.6.2d from five to
ten years will have no impact upon the probability of any accident, since the NS [containment spray] system is not accident
initiating equipment. Also, since Catawba's... flow test histor[y] support[s] making the proposed change, system
response following an accident will not be adversely affected. Therefore, the requested amendments will not result
in increased accident consequences. Deletion of the obsolete footnote as indicated in the Catawba TS markup is purely
an administrative change, and therefore will have no impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident.

Criterion 2

The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated above, the NS system is not accident initiating equipment. No new failure modes can be created
from an accident standpoint. The plant will not be operated in a different manner. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete
footnote has no bearing on any accident initiating mechanisms.

Criterion 3
 
The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins will
be unaffected by the proposed changes. The NS system will still be capable of fulfilling its required safety function,
since plant operating experience supports the proposed change. Finally, the proposed amendments are consistent
with the NRC position and guidance set forth in NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete
footnote will not result in any impact to plant safety margins.

Based upon the preceding analyses, Duke Power Company concludes that the requested amendments do not involve a significant
hazards consideration. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

South Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

December 8, 1993, as supplemented April 20, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

The amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.4 to address the need to bypass automatic initiation
of the Emergency Feedwater (EFW) system when the main feedwater pump discharge pressure is below actuation setpoint
during startup and shutdown in order to prevent inadvertent actuation. The proposed amendment is in response to NRC
Inspection Report 50-269, 50-270, 50-287/90-30 (Inspector Followup Item 90-30-02), which determined that the
existing TSs regarding initiation circuitry for the EFW system were inadequate. The amendments would also delete
operability requirements for the Emergency Condenser Cooling Water (ECCW) system. The licensee determined that
the ECCW system is not required to remove decay heat following any design basis event. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:





(1) [The amendment request would not] involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

Each accident analysis addressed within the Oconee FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] has been examined with respect
to changes proposed within this amendment request. The design basis of the Emergency Feedwater (EFW) System is to
supply feedwater to the steam generators in the event Main Feedwater is lost. The EFW system provides the required
flow rate to cool the RCS [reactor coolant system] down to the point at which the Decay Heat Removal System is designed
to operate. The EFW system is also designed to cool the RCS following a small break LOCA [loss of coolant accident].
Changes included within this amendment request are provided to clarify requirements for the operability of EFW.
Specifically, theses changes clarify that automatic initiation circuitry due to low main feedwater pump discharge
pressure or low hydraulic oil pressure may be bypassed when the reactor is shutdown to prevent inadvertent actuation.
In addition, these changes provide that if an EFW pump is inoperable due only to the inoperability of automatic initiation,
cooldown to below 250
 F is not necessary after the reactor is shutdown. Accident analysis for the loss of main feedwater, and subsequent
initiation of EFW, assumes initial conditions of the reactor at full power operation. The utilization of criticality
for this specific automatic initiation circuitry to be operable ensures the EFW system is operated within the boundaries
of design basis for Oconee while also providing a reasonable margin to prevent inadvertent actuation. It is not possible
to place this automatic initiation circuitry in service prior to exceeding 250
 F because the main feedwater pump discharge pressure is well below the initiation setpoint at this value. Manual
initiation circuitry operability is required prior to exceeding an RCS temperature of 250
 F. This change only clarifies existing configuration and control for the Oconee units and does not increase
the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

This change also removes the requirement for Emergency Condenser Cooling Water (ECCW) System operability for the
removal of decay heat using the secondary systems. The ability to provide flow through the condenser from the ECCW
system is a preferred method for decay heat removal. However, this mode of operation is not necessary to prevent or
mitigate any accident previously evaluated. The primary success path for decay heat removal following loss of station
power events, and thus loss of normal CCW flow, is the use of the turbine driven EFW pump providing flow to the steam generators
and heat removal via the main steam safety relief valves to the atmosphere. Analysis has shown that sufficient inventory
exists in secondary systems, as limited by Technical Specification 3.4.4, to provide for decay heat removal.

Therefore, this proposed change deletes the requirement for ECCW for secondary systems decay heat removal. The probability
or consequences of any design basis accident are not increased by this change. As such, this change will not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

(2) [The amendment request would not] create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any kind of
accident previously evaluated.

Changes included within this amendment request are provided to clarify existing requirements for operability of
the EFW System and remove the requirement for ECCW flow through the condenser for decay heat removal. Operation of
Oconee units in accordance with these Technical Specifications will not create any failure modes not bounded by previously
evaluated accidents. Previously evaluated accidents assume an initial condition of power operation for loss of
main feedwater events. Providing for automatic initiation prior to criticality ensures operation within the bounds
of design analysis. Previously evaluated accidents also assume the removal of decay heat, following loss of normal
CCW flow, to be via the main steam safety relief valves to the atmosphere which eliminates the need for ECCW operability.
Consequently, this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any kind of accident
previously evaluated.

(3) [The amendment request would not] involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The design basis of the EFW system is to supply feedwater to the steam generators in the event Main Feedwater is lost.
By providing clarification that manual initiation circuitry is operable prior to exceeding an RCS temperature of
250
 F and automatic initiation circuitry, due to low main feedwater discharge pressure or low hydraulic oil pressure,
is operable prior to criticality, there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety associated with this amendment
request. The ECCW system is designed to provide a means to remove decay heat without a loss of secondary side inventory.
However, analysis has shown that sufficient secondary side inventory exist, as specified by Technical Specification
3.4.4, to provide for coping with loss of station power events. Furthermore, even though this method of decay heat
removal is desirable, Oconee PRA [probabilistic risk assessment] studies do not model the loss of ECCW for accident
precursors since it is not required and margins of safety are not reduced if it is not available. Changes included within
this amendment request clarify existing requirements for the operability of secondary system for decay heat removal
based on previously evaluated accidents. As such, all margins of safety are preserved. Therefore, there will be no
reduction in any margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) sections 3.4.6.1 and 3.4.6.2 related to reactor
coolant system (RCS) operational leakage and leakage detection instrumentation. The proposed amendment would
revise the TSs to be in accordance with the standard TSs in NUREG-1431 in so far as the 
plant-specific design will allow. The proposed changes relate to the limiting conditions for operation and the surveillance
requirements for the four primary instruments used to detect RCS leakage. Changes are also proposed for the index
and definition sections. A new TS, section 3/4.5.4, is proposed to address reactor coolant pump seal injection flow.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The probability of occurrence of a previously evaluated accident, i.e., loss of coolant accident (LOCA), is not increased
because the ability of the plant operators to detect RCS leakage and take appropriate corrective action is not changed.
The proposed change will continue to ensure that diverse means for detecting extremely small leaks are available
to plant operators. In 
addition, the proposed amendment does not change the operational leakage limits. The seal injection flow limit is
not affected by this proposed change. Due to these three factors, the probability of occurrence of a LOCA is not increased.
The consequences of an accident previously evaluated are not significantly increased because the proposed changes
do not affect the ability of the various safety systems to perform their intended function. The leakage detection
monitors do not initiate any automatic function to mitigate the consequences of a LOCA. They provide an early indication
of RCS leakage. The operational leakage limits are not affected by this proposed change and they do not initiate any
automatic function to mitigate the consequences of a LOCA. The proposed change to the seal injection flow requirement
will continue to ensure that ECCS flow will be as assumed in the accident analyses.

Therefore, based on the continued ability of the leakage detection monitors and independent monitoring capabilities
to detect extremely small leaks, the fact that this proposed amendment does not change the operational leakage limits,
the seal injection flow limit is not affected by this proposed change, and that the proposed changes do not affect the
ability of the various safety systems to perform their intended functions, this proposed change does not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed amendment does not change the plant configuration in a way which introduces a new potential hazard to
the plant. Since design requirement[s] continue to be met and the integrity of the RCS pressure boundary is not challenged,
no new failure mode has been created. As a result, an accident which is different than any already evaluated in the Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) will not be created due to this change.

Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety since the operational leakage limits
will not be affected. Continued plant operation will not be permitted if operational leakage exceeds the current
technical specification limits. The operational leakage limits establish limits which ensure that any RCS leakage
does not compromise safety. The protection of the RCS pressure boundary from degradation and the core form [from]
inadequate cooling, in addition to preventing the accident analyses radiation release assumptions from being exceeded,
is the main purpose of the operational leakage limits. The ability to detect and quantify operational leakage allows
plant operators to perform actions to place the plant in a safe condition when leakage rate indicates possible RCS
pressure boundary degradation. The proposed change will continue to ensure that diverse measurement means are available
to provide the plant operators with an early indication of extremely small RCS leakage. Therefore, [the change is]
allowing action to be taken to place the plant in a safe condition when RCS leakage indicates possible RCS pressure
boundary leakage.

The proposed addition of the separate seal injection specification will not change the flow limit on seal injection.
The new specification will continue to ensure that seal injection flow is limited. This will ensure that sufficient
flow to the reactor core is provided during accident conditions. The proposed elimination of the Mode 4 applicability,
for seal injection flow specification, will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety since high
seal injection flow is less critical as a result of the lower initial RCS pressure and decay heat removal requirements
in Mode 4. 
Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Station, Unit 3, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana




Date of amendment request: 

June 6, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed admendment would revise the technical specifications (TSs) by relocating the seismic and meteorological
monitoring instrumentation and their associated requirements from the TSs to the Waterford 3 updated final safety
analysis report and plant procedures pursuant to the NRC final policy statement on TSs improvements for nuclear power
reactors. The final policy statement was published in the 

Federal Register 

on Thursday, July 22, 1993.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The proposed change relocates Seismic and Meteorological Monitoring Instrumentation requirements from the TS
to licensee controlled documents consistent with the NRC Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements.
Criterion 1 of the Policy Statement indicates that the TS should include installed instrumentation that is used to
detect, and indicate in the control room, a significant abnormal degradation of the reactor coolant pressure boundary.
This criterion is intended to ensure that the TS control those instruments specifically installed to detect excessive
reactor coolant system leakage. This criterion is not interpreted to include instrumentation used to detect precursors
to reactor coolant pressure boundary leakage (e.g., loose parts monitor, seismic instrumentation, valve position
indicators). Combustion Engineering and the NRC have previously determined that relocating Seismic and Meteorological
Monitoring Instrumentation requirements from the TS does not affect any material condition of the plant that could
directly contribute to causing or mitigating the effects of an accident.

Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change will not involve any design change or modification to the plant. The proposed change will not alter
the operation of the plant or the manner in which it is operated. Any subsequent change to the Seismic or Meteorological
Monitoring Instrumentation requirements will undergo a review in accordance with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59 to
ensure that the change does not involve an unreviewed safety question. 
Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

The proposed change will relocate Seismic and Meteorological Monitoring Instrumentation requirements from the
TS to licensee controlled documents subject to the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59. The proposed change will have no adverse
impact on any protective boundary or safety limit.

Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 22, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the technical specifications (TSs) to change three plant protection system
(PPS) trip setpoints to be consistent with the current setpoint/uncertainty methodology being implemented at Waterford
3. The change adjusts the affected TSs values in a more conservative direction.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



Implementing the proposed change will not affect any design basis accident. The revised trip and actuation setpoints
are based upon the same analytical limits that form the basis for the current trip and actuation setpoints. The design
basis for each trip and actuation setpoint was verified to be consistent with the appropriate accident analyses as
part of the process of revising the PPS setpoint analysis. The proposed changes in trip and actuation setpoints are
all in the conservative (away from the analytical limits) direction. Therefore, the proposed change will not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident.

Plant operation and the manner in which the plant is operated will not be altered as a result of implementing the proposed
change since no new system or design change is being implemented. Therefore, the proposed change will not create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The current safety margins of the affected trip setpoints and allowable values is preserved by the proposed change.
This is assured by retaining the current analytical limit for the affected parameters. Since the analytical limits
are not affected and the total channel uncertainty is increased, the margin of safety for the affected trip setpoints
and allowable values is preserved. Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves

Date of amendment request: 

June 22, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the technical specifications (TSs) to replace the generic control room outside
air intake (CROAI) radiation alarm/trip setpoint (less than or equal to 2x background) with a specific setpoint (less
than or equal to 4.09E-5). The new setpoint is based on radioactive material concentrations in the control room not
exceeding the derived air concentrations (DAC) occupational values listed in 10 CFR Part 20, Appendix B, Table 1,
Column 3.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The proposed change replaces the current CROAI radiation monitor alarm/trip setpoint of less than or equal to 2x background
with a fixed value independent of background radiation. The new setpoint will continue to provide protection to plant
personnel such that occupational radiation exposure is maintained within the limits of 10 CFR 20 during normal plant
operation, anticipated operational occurrences or design basis accidents.

Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change will replace the generic CROAI radiation monitor alarm/trip setpoint with a setpoint derived
from a site-specific calculation. The proposed change will not alter the operation of the plant or the manner in which
it is operated.

Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

The proposed change will replace the current CROAI radiation monitor setpoint with a new setpoint that will ensure
occupational radiation exposure will not exceed the DAC limits of 10 CFR 20. The proposed change has no adverse impact
on protective boundaries, safety limits, or margin of safety.

Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Date of amendment request: 

July 19, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications by relocating cycle-specific
parameter limits from the Technical Specifications to the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). Presently, the parameter
limits for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 are calculated using NRC-approved methodologies. These limits are evaluated
for every reload cycle and may be revised by a license amendment as appropriate, to reflect changes to cycle-specific
variables.
The curves to be relocated include (a) TS Figure 3.1-2, Rod Bank Insertion Limits versus Thermal Power curve, and (b)
TS Figure 3.2-2, K(Z) Normalized F

Q

(Z) as a Function of Core Height curve. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The removal of cycle-specific Rod Bank Insertion limits and the K(Z) curve from the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical
Specifications is administrative in nature and has no impact on the probability or consequences of any Design Bases
Event (DBE) occurrences which was previously evaluated. The determination of the Rod Bank Insertion limits and K(Z)
curve will be performed using methodology approved by the NRC and poses no significant increase in the probability
or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 

The Rod Bank Insertion limits and K(Z) curve will be evaluated every cycle to ensure proper compliance with the Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). These limits will be evaluated in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59, which ensures
that the reload will not involve an increase in the probability of occurrences or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 10 CFR 50.59 (2) states that a proposed change involves an unreviewed safety question (i) if the probability
of occurrence or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated
in the safety analysis report may be increased. Consequently, since any change to the reload core design analysis
must be evaluated relative to the more restrictive evaluation criterion of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The removal of the Rod Bank Insertion limits and K(Z) curve from the Technical Specifications is administrative in
nature and has no impact, nor does it contribute in any way to the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from
any accident previously evaluated. No new accident scenarios, failure mechanisms or limiting single failure events
are introduced as a result of the proposed change. 

The generation of the Rod Bank Insertion limits and K(Z) curve will be performed using NRC-approved methodology and
are submitted to the NRC, as a revision to the COLR, to allow the NRC staff to trend. The Technical Specifications will
continue to require operation within the core operating limits and appropriate actions will be taken if these limits
are exceeded. 

10 CFR 50.59 permits a licensee to make changes in the facility as described in the safety analysis report without prior
Commission approval, provided that the proposed changes does not involve an unreviewed safety question. 10 CFR 50.59
(2) states that a proposed change involves an unreviewed safety question (ii) if a possibility for an accident or malfunction
of a different type than any evaluated previously in the safety analysis report may be created. Consequently, since
any change to the reload core design analysis must be evaluated relative to the more restrictive evaluation criterion
of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The margin of safety is not affected by the removal of the Rod Bank Insertion limits and K(Z) curve from the Technical
Specifications. The methodology for the reload core design analysis have been approved by the NRC and does not constitute
a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

The supporting Technical Specification values are defined by the accident analyses which are performed to conservatively
bound the operating conditions defined by the Technical Specifications. The development of the limits for future
reloads will continue to conform to the methodology described in NRC approved documentation. In addition, each future
reload will involve a 10 CFR 50.59 review to assure that operation of the units within the cycle specific limits will
not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. 10 CFR 50.59 (2) states that a proposed change involves an unreviewed
safety question (iii) if the margin of safety as defined in the basis for any technical specification is reduced. Consequently,
since any change to the reload core design analysis must be evaluated relative to the more restrictive evaluation
criterion of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied.
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

July 19, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications and its associated BASES, which
address the maximum allowed reactor thermal power operation with inoperable main steam safety valves (MSSVs). Westinghouse
issued Nuclear Safety Advisory Letter (NSAL) 94-001 which notified the licensee of a deficiency in the basis of the
Turkey Point Technical Specification 3/4.7.1, which allows the plant to operate at reduced power levels with a specified
number of MSSVs inoperable. This amendment request corrects the allowable power level with inoperable MSSVs.
The licensee also proposed changes to the TS 3.7.1.1 applicability statement to indicate that, for mode 3 only, the
actions are required when the Reactor Trip System breakers are in the closed position and the Control Rod Drive System
is capable of rod withdrawal.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The new power range neutron flux high setpoint values will ensure that the secondary side steam pressure
will remain below 110 percent of the design value following a Loss of Load/Turbine Trip event, when one or more main
steam safety valves (MSSVs) are declared inoperable. The proposed change will not impact the classification of the
Loss of Load/Turbine Trip event as a Condition II probability event (faults of moderate frequency) per ANSI - N18.2,
1973. Accordingly, since the new power range neutron flux setpoints will maintain the capability of the MSSVs to perform
their pressure relief function associated with a Loss of Load/Turbine Trip event, there will be no effect on the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

In addition, the proposed change to the applicability statement of TS 3.7.1.1, will not effect the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the proposed plant condition with the reactor trip breakers
open and the rod control system not capable of withdrawing rods is an analyzed safe shutdown condition.
 
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant
equipment, and no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component. The new power range neutron
flux high setpoints will maintain the capability of the MSSVs to perform their pressure relief function to ensure
the secondary side steam design pressure is not exceeded following a Loss of Load/Turbine Trip event. Therefore,
since the function of the MSSVs is unaffected by the proposed changes, the possibility of a new or different kind of
accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created.

In addition, the proposed change to the applicability statement of TS 3.7.1.1, will not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, since the proposed plant condition with
the reactor trip breakers open and the rod control system not capable of withdrawing rods is an analyzed safe shutdown
condition.

(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications [do] not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
The algorithm methodology used to calculate the new power range neutron flux high setpoints is conservative and bounding
since it is based on a number of inoperable MSSVs per loop; i.e., if only one MSSV in one loop is out of service, the applicable
power range setpoint would be the same as if one MSSV in each loop were out of service. Another conservatism with the
algorithm methodology is with the assumed minimum total steam flow rate capability of the operable MSSVs. The assumption
is that if one or more MSSVs are inoperable per loop, the inoperable MSSVs are the largest capacity MSSVs, regardless
of which capacity MSSVs are actually inoperable. Therefore, since the power range neutron flux setpoints calculated
for the proposed changes using the algorithm methodology are more conservative and ensure the secondary side steam
design pressure is not exceeded following a Loss of Load/Turbine Trip event, this proposed license amendment will
not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

In addition, the proposed change to the applicability statement of TS 3.7.1.1, does not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety, since the proposed plant condition with the reactor trip breakers open and the rod control system
not capable of withdrawing rods is an analyzed safe shutdown condition.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied.
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications (TS) by revising Surveillance
Requirements 4.8.1.1.2e. and 4.8.1.1.2f., to delete the specific reference in the TS of the American Society for
Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing standard being used to meet TS testing requirements. The Emergency Diesel Generator
(EDG) fuel oil TS Surveillance Requirements will be replaced with a requirement to test the EDG fuel oil in accordance
with the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program.
The licensee proposes the addition of ACTION statements g. and h. of TS 3.8.1.1 to address the required action in the
event the diesel fuel oil does not meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications will permit the Technical Specification required testing
of Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) fuel oil in accordance with the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Diesel Fuel Oil Testing
Program. The proposed change will permit FPL to use more recent editions of the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) standards currently listed in Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements 4.8.1.1.2e. and 4.8.1.1.2f.
Prior to changing the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program, the proposed change will be evaluated pursuant to Title 10 Code
of Federal Regulations 50.59 (10 CFR 50.59), ``Changes, tests, and experiments.'' Title 10 CFR 50.59 permits a licensee
to make changes in the procedures as described in the safety analysis report without prior Commission approval, provided
that the proposed changes [do] not involve an unreviewed safety question.

Title 10 CFR 50.59(a)(2) states that a proposed change involves an unreviewed safety question (i) if the probability
of occurrence or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated
in the safety analysis report may be increased. Consequently, since any change to the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program,
including the ASTM standard or ASTM edition standard to be used to evaluate EDG fuel oil acceptability, the change
must be evaluated relative to the more restrictive evaluation criterion of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. The EDG fuel oil TS Surveillance Requirements will be replaced with a requirement
to test the EDG fuel oil in accordance with the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program.

ACTION statement g. of TS 3.8.1.1 is added to address the required action in the event the new fuel oil properties do
not meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. A failure to meet the API gravity, kinematic viscosity, flash
point or clarity limits is cause for rejecting the new fuel oil prior to the addition to the Diesel Fuel Oil Storage Tanks,
but does not represent a failure to meet the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) of TS 3.8.1.1, since the new fuel
oil has not been added to the storage tanks. Provided these new fuel oil properties are met subsequent to the addition
of the new fuel oil to the storage tanks, 30 days is provided to complete the analyses of the other fuel oil properties
specified in Table 1 of ASTM-D975-81, except sulfur which may be performed in accordance with ASTM-D1552-79 or ASTM-D2622-82.
In the event the other new fuel oil properties specified in Table 1 of ASTM-D975-81 are not met, ACTION statement g.
of TS 3.8.1.1 provides an additional 30 days to meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. This additional 30
day period is acceptable because the fuel oil properties of interest, even if they are not within limits, would not
have an immediate effect on EDG operation.

ACTION statement h. of TS 3.8.1.1 is added to address the required action in the event the stored fuel oil total particulates
does not meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. Fuel oil degradation during long term storage shows up as
an increase in particulate, due mostly to oxidation. The presence of particulate does not mean the fuel oil will not
burn properly in a diesel engine. The frequency for performing surveillance on stored fuel oil is based on stored fuel
oil degradation trends which indicate that particulate concentration is unlikely to change significantly between
surveillances.

Prior to changing the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program, FPL will need to determine if the proposed
program change is at least as, if not more, effective, in detecting unsatisfactory fuel oil. The EDGs will thus continue
to function as designed and the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents will be unaffected.

(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications will permit the Technical Specification required testing
of Emergency Diesel Generator fuel oil using more recent editions of the American Society for Testing and Materials
standards listed in Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements 4.8.1.1.2e. and 4.8.1.1.2f. Prior to changing
the edition of the previously approved ASTM standard being used to evaluate the EDG fuel oil, the proposed edition
standard will be evaluated pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59, ``Changes, tests, and experiments.'' Title 10 CFR 50.59 permits
a licensee to make changes in the procedures as described in the safety analysis report without prior Commission approval,
provided that the proposed changes does not involve an unreviewed safety question. Title 10 CFR 50.59(a)(2) states
that a proposed change involves an unreviewed safety question (ii) if a possibility for an accident or malfunction
of a different type than any evaluated previously in the safety analysis report may be created. Consequently, since
any change to the edition of the ASTM standard to be used to evaluate EDG fuel oil acceptability must be evaluated relative
to the more restrictive evaluation criterion of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

ACTION statement g. of TS 3.8.1.1 is added to address the required action in the event the new fuel oil properties do
not meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. A failure to meet the API gravity, kinematic viscosity, flash
point or clarity limits is cause for rejecting the new fuel oil prior to the addition to the Diesel Fuel Oil Storage Tanks,
but does not represent a failure to meet the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) of TS 3.8.1.1, since the new fuel
oil has not been added to the storage tanks. Provided these new fuel oil properties are met subsequent to the addition
of the new fuel oil to the storage tanks, 30 days is provided to complete the analyses of the other fuel oil properties
specified in Table 1 of ASTM-D975-81, except sulfur which may be performed in accordance with ASTM-D1552-79 or ASTM-D2622-82.
In the event the other new fuel oil properties specified in Table 1 of ASTM-D975-81 are not met, ACTION statement g.
of TS 3.8.1.1 provides an additional 30 days to meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. This additional 30
day period is acceptable because the fuel oil properties of interest, even if they are not within limits, would not
have an immediate effect on EDG operation.

ACTION statement h. of TS 3.8.1.1 is added to address the required action in the event the stored fuel oil total particulates
[do] not meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. Fuel oil degradation during long term storage shows up as
an increase in particulate, due mostly to oxidation. The presence of particulate does not mean the fuel oil will not
burn properly in a diesel engine. The frequency for performing surveillance on stored fuel oil is based on stored fuel
oil degradation trends which indicate that particulate concentration is unlikely to change significantly between
surveillances.

Prior to changing the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program, FPL will need to determine if the proposed
program change is at least as, if not more, effective, in detecting unsatisfactory fuel oil. Since the proposed changes
do not involve a change in the design of any plant system or component, and since the proposed changes will need to evaluate
the effect of any ASTM standard edition change on the level of EDG reliability, the change proposed will not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications will permit the Technical Specification required testing
of Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) fuel oil using more recent editions of the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) standards listed in Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements 4.8.1.1.2e. and 4.8.1.1.2f. Prior
to changing the edition of the previously approved ASTM standard being used to evaluate the EDG fuel oil, the proposed
edition standard will be evaluated pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59, ``Changes, tests, and experiments.'' Title 10 CFR 50.59
permits a licensee to make changes in the procedures as described in the safety analysis report without prior Commission
approval, provided that the proposed changes [do] not involve an unreviewed safety question. Title 10 CFR 50.59(a)(2)
states that a proposed change involves an unreviewed safety question (iii) if the margin of safety as defined in the
basis for any technical specification is reduced. Consequently, since any change to the edition of the ASTM standard
to be used to evaluate EDG fuel oil acceptability must be evaluated relative to the more restrictive evaluation criterion
of 10 CFR 50.59, then operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. 

ACTION statement g. of TS 3.8.1.1 is added to address the required action in the event the new fuel oil properties do
not meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. A failure to meet the API gravity, kinematic viscosity, flash
point or clarity limits is cause for rejecting the new fuel oil prior to the addition to the Diesel Fuel Oil Storage Tanks,
but does not represent a failure to meet the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) of TS 3.8.1.1, since the new fuel
oil has not been added to the storage tanks. Provided these new fuel oil properties are met subsequent to the addition
of the new fuel oil to the storage tanks, 30 days is provided to complete the analyses of the other fuel oil properties
specified in Table 1 of ASTM-D975-81, except sulfur which may be performed in accordance with ASTM-D1552-79 or ASTM-D2622-82.
In the event the other new fuel oil properties specified in Table 1 of ASTM-D975-81 are not met, ACTION statement g.
of TS 3.8.1.1 provides an additional 30 days to meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. This additional 30
day period is acceptable because the fuel oil properties of interest, even if they are not within limits, would not
have an immediate effect on EDG operation.

ACTION statement h. of TS 3.8.1.1 is added to address the required action in the event the stored fuel oil total particulates
[do] not meet the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program limits. Fuel oil degradation during long term storage shows up as
an increase in particulate, due mostly to oxidation. The presence of particulate does not mean the fuel oil will not
burn properly in a diesel engine. The frequency for performing surveillance on stored fuel oil is based on stored fuel
oil degradation trends which indicate that particulate concentration is unlikely to change significantly between
surveillances.

Prior to changing the Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program, FPL will need to determine if the proposed
program change is at least as, if not more, effective, in detecting unsatisfactory fuel oil. Since the proposed changes
will require a safety evaluation to assure that the reliability of the EDGs using fuel oil tested in accordance with
the different ASTM standard edition maintains the current margin of safety, the proposed changes do not involve a
reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied.
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

April 28, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.8.1.1, ``AC Sources Operating,'' and the
associated TS Bases for demonstrating the operability of the diesel generators (DGs), based upon three NRC guidelines:

A. Generic Letter (GL) 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements
for Testing During Power Operation.''
1. Delete from TS action statement a the requirement to test the DGs in the event of an inoperable offsite circuit.
2. Eliminate from TS action statement b the need to test the operable DG if the other DG became inoperable due to an inoperable
support system or an independently testable component in addition to the existing provision excluding preplanned
preventive maintenance or testing. Furthermore, if
the operable DG must be tested, it would be tested within 8 hours (rather than 24 hours) unless the absence of any potential
common mode failure for the remaining DG is demonstrated.
3. Also eliminate from TS action statement c the need to test the operable DG if the other DG became inoperable due to
an inoperable support system or an independently testable component in addition to the existing provision excluding
preplanned preventive maintenance or testing. In addition, the operable DG would not have to be tested if the absence
of any potential common mode failure for the remaining DG is demonstrated. A reference to TS action statement a would
be deleted because of the proposed change to TS action statement a described above.
4. Eliminate from TS action statement e the need to test the DGs when two offsite circuits are inoperable.
5. Revise TS 4.8.1.1.2.g.2 to allow the DG to be gradually loaded, as opposed to a fast loading of 60 seconds or less to
an indicated value of 6100-7000 kw. This change would extend gradual loading of DGs (that GL 93-05 recommends for routine
monthly surveillance) to the 6-month surveillance.
B. Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.9, Revision 3, ``Selection, Design, Qualification, and Testing of Emergency Diesel Generator
Units Used as Class 1E Onsite Electric Power Systems at Nuclear Power Plants,'' (insofar as this guide relates to reducing
DG stress and wear due to testing and the elimination of certain reporting requirements).
1. Incorporate into TS 4.8.1.1.2.a.4 the provision to perform routine monthly testing by gradually accelerating
the DG to operating speed, rather than requiring the DG to attain rated voltage and frequency within 11.4 seconds.
As a direct result of this proposed change, TS action statements b, c, and f would be revised to reference TS 4.8.1.1.2.g.1
instead of TS 4.8.1.1.2.a.4 in the event that an operable DG must be tested when the other DG is inoperable. This has
the effect of requiring the operable DG to be fast-started for testing pursuant to the action statement. 
2. In TS 4.8.1.1.2.h.7, separate the 24-hour endurance run from the hot restart test. As a result, create new TS 4.8.1.1.2.h.8
to require the hot restart test. The DG would be operated for a minimum of 2 hours at a load of 6800-7000 kw, and the DG would
be shut down. Within 5 minutes of shutdown, the DG would be restarted and required to attain rated voltage and frequency
within 11.4 seconds. Delete existing TS footnote ## (which provides for reperforming the hot restart test without
repeating the 24-hour endurance test) which is no longer required. Renumber existing TSs 4.8.1.1.2.h.8, .9, .10,
.11, and .12 to accommodate the addition of new TS 4.8.1.1.2.h.8. 
3. Delete TS 4.8.1.1.3, ``Reports.'' (This is also in accordance with the Improved Technical Specifications, Revision
0, dated September 28, 1992).
4. In TS 4.8.1.2, ``A. C. Sources Shutdown,'' delete the reference to deleted TS 4.8.1.1.3.
C. NUMARC 87-00, Revision 1, ``Guidelines and Technical Bases for NUMARC Initiatives Addressing Station Blackout
at Light Water Reactors,'' (insofar as it relates to the test frequency for a problem DG). Specifically, TS Table 4.8-1,
``Diesel Generator Test Schedule,'' would be revised to incorporate the test schedule of Section D.2.4.4 of Appendix
D to NUMARC 87-00, Revision 1. Under the proposed schedule, testing pursuant to TS 4.8.1.1.2.a would be conducted
monthly provided the number of valid failures in the last 25 demands for a given DG is no more than 3. If the number of valid
failures is 4 or more, testing would be conducted at least once per 7 days (but at intervals of no less than 24 hours) until
7 consecutive failure-free starts from standby conditions and load-run demands have been performed. Note that both
NUMARC 87-00, Revision 1, and RG 1.9, Revision 3, use and define the terms ``start demand, start failure, load-run
demand, and load-run failure'' rather than the old RG 1.108 terminology of valid tests. In fact, Section D.2.4.4 of
Appendix D to NUMARC 87-00 refers to the last 25 ``demands'' rather than tests. Therefore, the proposed change to TS
Table 4.8-1 would count valid failures in terms of demands rather than valid tests. The criteria for determining the
number of valid failures and demands would be in accordance with RG 1.9, Revision 3.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes affect the required actions in response to inoperable offsite and onsite ac sources,
surveillance requirements for the emergency diesel generators, and reporting requirements for diesel generator
failures. The proposed changes are based on the recommendations of Regulatory Guide 1.9, Revision 3, NUMARC 87-00,
Revision 1, and Generic Letter 93-05. They are expected to result in improvements in diesel generator testing and
failure reporting and reduce diesel generator aging due to excessive testing. As such, the proposed changes should
result in improved diesel generator reliability, thereby providing additional assurance that the diesel generators
will be capable of performing their safety function. Therefore, the proposed changes will not significantly increase
the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes affect the action and surveillance requirements for the onsite and offsite ac sources.
Accordingly, the proposed changes do not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant
equipment, and no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component nor has any new limiting failure
been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
 
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes are based
on existing regulatory guidance. Under the proposed changes, the emergency diesel generators will remain capable
of performing their safety function, and the effects of aging on the diesel generators will be reduced by eliminating
unnecessary testing. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

GPU Nuclear Corporation, Docket No. 50-320, Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit No. 2, (TMI-2), Dauphin County,
Pennsylvania




Date of amendment request: 

October 9, 1991.


Description of amendment request: 



Facility Operating License No. 

DPR-73, a possession only license for the TMI-2 facility, held by General Public Utilities Nuclear Corporation (GPU
Nuclear), expires November 4, 2009. The proposed amendment would extend the expiration date of 

Facility Operating License No. 

DPR-73 for TMI-2 to April 19, 2014. No other changes to the license or the Technical Specifications are proposed.
The TMI-2 facility is currently in long term storage. GPU Nuclear, the licensee, has named this storage period Post
Defueling Monitored Storage or PDMS. The licensee plans to maintain TMI-2 in PDMS until Three Mile Island Nuclear
Station Unit No. 1 (TMI-1) permanently ceases operation, at which time both TMI-1 and TMI-2 will be decommissioned
simultaneously. The TMI-1 Operating License expires on April 19, 2014. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



10 CFR 50.92 provides the criteria which the Commission uses to perform a No Significant Hazards Consideration. 10
CFR 50.92 states that an amendment to a facility license involves No Significant Hazards if operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed modification of the expiration date of the TMI-2 License does not involve any physical changes to the
facility. All that is involved is an extension of the time TMI-2 would be in a monitored storage condition. Based on
this, GPU Nuclear concludes that the proposed change does not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Accident
evaluations for PDMS are provided in the PDMS Safety Analysis Report (SAR) and the PDMS Final Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement, Supplement 3 (PEIS) dated August 1989. These documents evaluated monitored storage of TMI-2 for
extended periods of time and provide for surveillances to ensure monitored storage conditions are appropriately
maintained. The PDMS PEIS specifically evaluated monitored storage until 2014. No evaluated accident has a probability
or consequence that are increased significantly during the period 2009 to 2014 over the period before 2009. Therefore,
it can be concluded that this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. As previously
stated, the act of modifying the expiration date of the TMI-2 License does not involve any physical changes to the facility
and therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety during PDMS. The surveillances identified in the PDMS SAR
will be performed to ensure that the facility is maintained in the condition defined by the SAR. These conditions and
surveillances will continue to apply during the extended license. Therefore, there will not be a reduction in the
margin of safety.

Based on the above analysis, it is concluded that the proposed changes involve No Significant Hazards Consideration
as defined by 10 CFR 50.92.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

which is presented below:



)The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. No physical changes will result from this amendment. These changes revise audit requirements

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would add Operability Requirements, Limiting Conditions for Operations (LCO) and Surveillance
Requirements for the Control Building Chillers.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1) The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the requested revisions do not affect any FSAR analysis involving these systems.

The proposed revision only adds LIMITING CONDITIONS for OPERATION (LCO) and Surveillance Requirements (SR) for
the Control Building Chillers. These additions will provide assurance that the affected systems will be OPERABLE
when required.

2) The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because there is no equipment or design change associated with this change. The proposed amendment only
adds LCOs and SRs for the Control Building Chillers.

3) The proposed amendment will not involve any reduction in a margin of safety. The safety function of the Control Building
Chillers is to remove the design basis heat load under all normal and emergency conditions. The addition of LCOs and
SRs for the Control Building Chillers ensures they will be OPERABLE when required.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to

Linn County, Iowa




Date of amendment request: 

June 30, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify the surveillance testing of the Emergency Service Water (ESW) system by deleting
the flow rate test and the requirement to test the pumps each week when river water temperature exceeds 80
 F and by adding a surveillance regarding the Cedar River (Ultimate Heat Sink) water temperature.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. No physical changes will result from this amendment. The ESW system will still maintain its
ability to support various safety related equipment which is designed to mitigate the consequences of certain accidents
and transients. These safety related systems play no part in the probability of these accidents or transients occurring.
Since the ESW system will continue to fully support the cooling requirements of the safety related equipment which
mitigate the consequences of certain accidents and transients, this amendment will not affect the consequences
of these accidents and transients. The re-analysis of the component heat loads assumed worst case conditions and
involved conservative assumptions. Our continuing program for monitoring heat exchanger performance, which was
established in response to Generic Letter 89-13, ``Service Water System Problems Affecting Safety-Related Equipment,''
will continue to verify that the individual components are capable of performing their design function. Therefore,
the proposed amendment does not involve a change in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2) The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated. The safety function of the ESW system is unchanged. The revised flow requirements for the system have been
established using conservative assumptions and worst case heat loads and are appropriately documented in the FSAR
and plant procedures. This amendment will result in no physical changes to the ESW system and therefore, will not affect
its ability to continue to provide reliable cooling water. Consequently, the proposed license amendment does not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3) The proposed amendment will not reduce the margin of safety. The re-analysis of the ESW flow rate requirements and
component heat loads was performed using conservative assumptions and maximum component heat loads. The actual
operation of the ESW system will not be changed. Any degradation of ESW pump performance would be detected by the IST
program which requires quarterly testing of these pumps and monitoring of the pump's differential pressure and flow.
Deleting the requirement to perform the surveillance each week when river water temperature exceeds 80
 F will not reduce the margin of safety because even at a river water temperature of 95
 F, the required ESW flow to supply all the branches is well below the normal system flow rate of approximately
1100 gpm. Deleting the weekly surveillance will eliminate unnecessary testing of the ESW pumps, thereby reducing
wear on the pumps. Adding a surveillance requirement for river water temperature will formalize the recording of
water temperature every hour to assure acceptable ESW performance.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to
determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-220, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1, Oswego County, New
York 




Date of amendment request: 

June 30, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.2.7.1, ``Primary Coolant System Pressure Isolation
Valves.'' Specifically, TS Table 3.2.7.1, ``Primary Coolant System Pressure Isolation Valves,'' would be revised
to add Shutdown Cooling System (SCS) check valves 38-165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, and 172 each with a maximum allowable
leakage rate of less than or equal to 0.375 gpm. The proposed amendment would add the check valves in lieu of replacing
the SCS isolation valves with ones that are 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Type C air testable. The added check valves would
provide high pressure/low pressure interfaces between the high pressure Reactor Coolant System and the low pressure
Core Spray System. The addition of the check valves will allow utilization of the Core Spray System as a seal water system
for sealing the Shutdown Cooling isolation valves as permitted by Section III.C.3 of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change requires the addition of Primary Coolant System pressure isolation valves for the prevention
of an intersystem LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident]. The proposed addition does not affect operation of either the
Shutdown Cooling or Core Spray Systems. These changes do not alter any accident initiators or precursors and therefore
does not affect the probability of a previously evaluated accident.

Testing these valves in accordance with Specification 3.2.7.1 provides assurance that the Core Spray System will
not be damaged by an overpressurization event which could lead to potential loss of integrity of the system and subsequent
release of radioactivity. Thus, the addition of the valves would not increase the consequences of any accident. Therefore,
the operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed addition of Primary Coolant System pressure isolation valves, although a physical change, does not
alter the initial conditions used for any design basis accident. The check valves provide the high pressure/low pressure
isolation between the Reactor Coolant and Core Spray Systems. These valves will be subject to leak rate testing in
accordance with Specification 3.2.7.1. This ensures that an intersystem LOCA is prevented. The proposed change
has no effect on operation of either the Shutdown Cooling or Core Spray Systems. Therefore, the design capabilities
of these systems are not challenged in a manner previously assessed so as to create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident. Accordingly, operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change which requires the addition of Primary Coolant System pressure isolation valves, ensures proper
isolation of a high pressure/low pressure interface between the Reactor Coolant and Core Spray Systems. The pressure
isolation valves will be leak tested in accordance with Specification 3.2.7.1. This provides assurance that the
Core Spray System will not be damaged by an overpressurization event and will not result in loss of integrity of the
system. Thus, the results of any event previously analyzed remains unchanged. Therefore, the operation of Nine Mile
Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

County, Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

April 18, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change will revise the current surveillance frequency which verifies area temperature limits at least
once per 12 hours. The revised surveillance requirement will verify area temperature limits at least once per 7 days
when the data-logger alarm is operable, or at least once per 12 hours when the data-logger alarm is inoperable. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


...The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the change would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed change reduces the frequency at which area temperature monitoring must be verified when the temperature
data-logger alarm function is operable. For conditions where the temperature data-logger alarm function is inoperable,
the frequency at which normal ambient temperature is verified remains unchanged. In addition, the proposed change
does not affect any system, equipment, or component credited in any previous accident evaluation, any environmental
qualification or post-accident profiles. Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 

The proposed change does not alter or affect the design, function, failure mode, or operation of the plant. There is
no change to the way in which the plant is operated and, therefore, no increase in the probability of plant operation
with any area temperature outside of its limits. Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. 
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change does not challenge or affect the performance of any of the protective boundaries, revise temperature
limits in the technical specifications, or perform any modifications that would increase the likelihood of technical
specification temperature limits being exceeded. The proposed change requires the data-logger alarm function
to be operable in order to relax the surveillance frequency. This alarm function provides continuous monitoring
that would detect temperature excursions prior to the current surveillance which does not credit operability of
the data-logger alarm function. Also, the proposed change does not increase the interval for which temperatures
could exceed technical specification limits. Therefore, the proposed change does not cause a reduction in the margin
of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 30, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change revises the Technical Specifications to change the trip setpoint for the 4kV bus undervoltage
relay (for the grid degraded voltage) from its current value of [greater than or equal to] 3710 volts to its new setting
of [greater than or equal to] 3730 volts.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


...The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the change does not:


1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed change involves the modification of the undervoltage relay setpoint from 3710V to 3730V. The protection
provided by this system in unaffected and is still in accordance with the guidance provided in NRC Branch Technical
Position PSB-1. This refinement increases the Technical Specification minimum trip setpoint for the degraded voltage
relays on the 4kV safety buses. It does not detrimentally affect the safe operation of the plant, nor does this proposed
modification increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The actual trip setpoints
of the subject relays do not require any changes and are currently conservatively set at 3745V. The allowable value
of [greater than or equal to] 3706V remains unchanged. This slightly higher than required setting was chosen by NNECO
to provide added margin should an undervoltage condition be present. This higher setting will not cause more actuations
of the ESF [engineered safety feature] systems.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

The undervoltage protection system is provided to address the concerns identified in NRC Branch Technical Position
PSB-1 by providing a scheme to detect the loss of offsite power at the class 1E buses, and a second level of undervoltage
protection to protect class 1E equipment. The change in the setpoint will not affect the ability of this circuitry
to detect a loss of offsite power or to respond to an undervoltage condition.

Since the equipment will operate as previously described in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report], and there are
no physical plant modifications required (the current setting at the undervoltage relay is 3745V), the proposed
amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.


3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

These relays do not cause a loss of offsite power, nor do they cause a degraded voltage condition. These relays react
to conditions that have been placed upon the Plant. In the event that a degraded voltage condition exists on the 4kV
safety buses, alarms in the control room alert the operators of this condition. In addition, the Connecticut Valley
Electric Exchange (CONVEX), the system dispatch center for generation and VAR/voltage control, is aware of the minimum
voltage requirements for the three nuclear plants at the Millstone station and has a minimum target switchyard voltage
of 345kV. Under normal operation conditions the switchyard voltage would have to degrade below 328kV before one of
the 4kV safety buses would start to enter the degraded voltage level and trip the degraded voltage circuit. These administrative
controls help preclude a degraded voltage condition on the 4kV safety buses prior to actuation of the degraded voltage
protection circuits.

The proposed change of the 4kV degraded voltage minimum trip setpoint to 3730V from 3710V will not result in any physical
relay setting change. The existing trip setting for the 4kV degraded voltage relays have been conservatively set
at 3745V, while the existing allowable value remains unchanged at 3706V. 

The response times or actuation logic of the degraded voltage protection circuit remains unaffected, therefore
revising the trip setpoint value in the Technical Specifications will not involve a significant reduction in the
margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

January 29, 1993, as revised June 15, 1994.


Description of amendment requests: 

The proposed amendments would change core exit thermocouple action statements.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

The purpose of the post accident monitoring equipment is to display unit variables that provide information required
by the control room operators during accident situations and as such help limit the consequences of an accident. The
proposed changes, which will allow continued plant operation with less than four core exit thermocouples per core
quadrant, have no impact on the probability of an accident because they are only used in response to accident situations.

Continued plant operation with the core exit thermocouple system in the degraded condition as allowed by the proposed
core exit thermocouple action statements would not affect the operators ability to monitor for inadequate core cooling
following an accident. At least two core exit thermocouples would be operable per core quadrant, a minimum of four
thermocouples would be available in the center region of the core and at least one thermocouple would be available
in each quadrant of the outside core region. The smaller size of the Prairie Island core, and therefore higher density
of thermocouples per unit of core area, provides additional assurance that core exit temperatures can be adequately
monitored with a reduced number of core exit thermocouples.

Alternate means of monitoring for inadequate core cooling would also be available. These include the reactor vessel
water level indication system, the subcooling margin monitors and wide range reactor coolant system temperature.

The combination of the remaining operable core exit thermocouples and the alternate monitoring capability will
ensure that the operators ability to identify inadequate core cooling in a timely manner and take appropriate corrective
action will not be impaired, and therefore; the proposed changes will have no significant impact on the consequences
of an accident.

The core exit thermocouples perform no active role in the mitigation of an accident. Their inoperability will not
affect the operability of any engineered safety features equipment or that equipments ability to mitigate the consequences
of an accident.

Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the proposed changes will not significantly affect the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed.

There are no new failure modes or mechanisms associated with the proposed changes. The proposed changes do not involve
any modification of plant equipment or any changes in operational limits. The proposed changes only modify the requirements
for instrumentation used to monitor plant parameters during an accident. The core exit thermocouples are passive
monitoring devices, their failure or inoperability cannot result in a plant accident of any kind.

Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated, and the accident analyses presented in the Updated Safety Analysis
Report will remain bounding.

3. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Continued plant operation with the core exit thermocouple system in the degraded condition as allowed by the proposed
core exit thermocouple action statements would not affect the operators ability to monitor for inadequate core cooling
following an accident. At least two core exit thermocouples would be operable per core quadrant, a minimum of four
thermocouples would be available in the center region of the core and at least one thermocouple would be available
in each quadrant of the outside core region. The smaller size of the Prairie Island core, and therefore higher density
of thermocouples per unit of core area, provides additional assurance that core exit temperatures can be adequately
monitored with a reduced number of core exit thermocouples.

Alternative means of monitoring for inadequate core cooling would also be available. These include the reactor vessel
water level indication system, the subcooling margin monitors and wide range reactor coolant system temperature.

The combination of the remaining operable core exit thermocouples and the alternate monitoring capability will
ensure that the operators ability to identify inadequate core cooling in a timely manner and take appropriate corrective
action will no be impaired.

Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the proposed changes will not result in any reduction in the plant's margin
of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve
no significant hazards consideration.

Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania




Date of amendment request: 

June 30, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

This amendment would relocate selected recirculation and control rod block instrumentation setpoints from Technical
Specifications (TS) Table 3.3.6-2, and Section 3/4.4.1 to the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR), thereby revising
TS Section 6.9.1.9 to document relocation of these items into the COLR. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The TS change proposed is the relocation of the recirculation pump Motor-Generator (MG) set mechanical and electrical
stop and control rod block recirculation flow upscale trip setpoint values to the COLR. No physical plant equipment
change is proposed. The TS requirements for the setpoints and the associated surveillance requirements remain unchanged.
Only the location of the setpoint values will be changed. The subject setpoint values will become cycle depend[e]nt
and will be determined by NRC approved methods, as are the balance of setpoints and thermal limits found in the COLR.
However, the subject setpoint values are not modified as part of this TS change.

Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The TS changes proposed are the relocation of the recirculation pump MG set mechanical and electrical stop and control
rod block recirculation flow upscale trip setpoint values to the COLR. No physical plant equipment change is part
of the proposed TS changes. The TS LCOs and surveillance requirements remain unchanged. The only change proposed
is the relocation of the subject setpoint values as noted above. These setpoint values have been determined in accordance
with previously NRC approved methods and assure sufficient operating margins in accordance with existing core design
methodology. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated.

3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The following TS BASES were reviewed for potential reduction in the margin of safety:

3/4.2 Power Distribution Limits

3/4.3.6 Control Rod Block Instrumentation
 
3/4.4.1 Recirculation System

The margin of safety, as defined in the TS BASES, will not be reduced. The proposed TS changes do not affect existing
accident analyses or design assumptions, nor do they impact any safety limits of the plant, since they are administrative
in nature.

Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

Description of amendment request: 

This amendment will change the Technical Specification 4.0.5 for each unit to reflect NRC's policy with respect to
relief requests for the inservice inspection programs. Specifically, the change would clarify the fact that relief
requests for impracticable testing or surveillance requirements can be implemented prior to the Commission approval
of such requests. 

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below: 



1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature in that the changes eliminate any possibility of misinterpretation
of the ASME Code requirements that allow for a utility to submit relief requests to the Commission within one year and
allows for the implementation of these request[s] prior to Commission review and approval. The relief requests are
based on and provide for alternative testing based on industry practice that provides an equivalent level of quality
and safety as the Code requirement. The Commission will still provide acceptance of the relief requests in writing.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. Create the possibility or a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

No new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting
failure been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes
do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. 

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not adversely impact the plant's ability to meet applicable
regulatory requirements related to inservice testing or inspection. The proposed changes eliminate any possible
misinterpretation of the Code requirements regarding relief requests and do not reduce the protection of public
health and safety. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 17, 1994 as supplemented July 13, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would change the requirement to perform the Channel Functional Test of the Power Operated
Relief Valve (PORV) position indication from quarterly to every 18 months and to exempt the PORV Block Valve position
indication from performance of the channel Function Test if the PORV Block Valve is shut as required to isolate a PORV
that cannot be manually cycled. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

A change from quarterly (Q) to at least every 18 months (R) may appear to be non-conservative, at first; however, by
extending the surveillance requirement to cycle the PORV during non-power conditions, the change eliminates the
potential risk and consequences of having the valve sticking open at power or not fully closing (leaking). Therefore,
by extending the surveillance the probability and consequences of any previously analyzed accident is reduced,
since the testing would now be conducted in a non-power condition, and the margin to safety is increased. Consequently,
a net safety gain is realized by eliminating or minimizing these risks.

The added note for PORV block valve is included for consistency and alignment between the surveillance requirement
under this T/S (Table 4.3-11) with that of T/S surveillances 4.4.3.2 and 4.4.5.2 for Units 1 and 2 respectively.

Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a physical or procedural change to any structure, component,
or system that significantly affects accident/malfunction probabilities or consequences previously evaluated
in the UFSAR.

2. Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not introduce any design or physical configuration changes to the facility which could create
new accident scenarios.

3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

As stated in response to question number 1 above, the proposed changes do not eliminate the required T/S surveillance
requirements. The first change eliminates the need to cycle the PORV valves through one complete cycle of full travel
at power. The second change allows for not having to perform a surveillance on a valve that it is being used as an isolation
point. The valve has been closed to comply with requirements of another T/S action statement. Therefore, the probability
and consequences of any previously analyzed accident is reduced, thus increasing the margin to safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

March 29,1994 (TS 340)


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment to the Unit 3 Technical Specifications adds a limiting condition for operation and a surveillance
requirement for a load shedding logic being added by a design change to Unit 3. The load shedding logic is being added
to ensure that the maximum capacity of the Unit 3 Emergency Diesel Generators is not exceeded during a postulated loss
of offsite power event concurrent with a design basis accident.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

This proposed change establishes a surveillance testing requirement and limiting condition for operation for the
Unit 3 480-volt load shedding logic system. This Technical Specification change will not introduce any new failure
mode and will not alter any assumptions previously made in evaluating the consequences of an accident. Accordingly,
this change does not affect any design limiting safety system settings or operating parameters. Furthermore, the
change does not modify or add any accident initiating events or parameters. Therefore, these proposed changes do
not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

This proposed change establishes a limiting condition for operation and a surveillance requirement for the Unit
3 480-volt load shedding logic system. The addition of a limiting condition for operation and surveillance requirement
will not adversely affect the operation of Unit 3 or the manner in which it is operated. Furthermore, the change does
not create a failure mode that can lead to an accident of a different type than previously evaluated. Therefore, the
proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The addition of a limiting condition for operation and surveillance requirement will not reduce the margin of safety.
The testing of the 480-volt load shedding logic on an 18-month interval is consistent with BWR/4 (NUREG-1433) Standard
Technical Specifications. These are based on the guidance set forth in NRC Regulatory Guide 1.108, ``Periodic Testing
of Diesel Generator Units Used as Onsite Electric Power Systems at Nuclear Power Plants.'' The addition of a limiting
condition for operation establishes a minimum acceptable level of performance for the 480-volt load shedding logic
system. Thus, the ability of the Emergency Diesel Generators to supply power during a loss of offsite power coincident
with a design basis accident is assured.

Furthermore, no reductions in the requirements or setpoints of the equipment supplied by the Emergency Diesel Generators
are made which could result in a reduction in the margin of safety. Therefore, this proposed change does not involve
a reduction in the margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

TU Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-445 and 50-446, Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, Somervell
County, Texas




Date of amendment request: 

February 23, 1994


Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed changes would revise the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES), Units 1 and 2, Technical Specifications
(TS) to (1) allow a one-hour allowed outage time (AOT) following discovery of a closed cold leg injection accumulator
discharge isolation in Modes 1, 2, or 3; (2) eliminate the redundant requirement to reverify accumulator boron concentration
following fill from the refueling water storage tank (RWST); (3) relocate the accumulator water level and pressure
channel analog channel operational test (ACOT) and channel calibration from the CPSES Technical Specifications
to an administratively controlled program; (4) change the accumulator limits to analysis values rather than indicated
values; and (5) reduce the inspection frequency following containment entries.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident.

The current requirement to immediately open a cold leg accumulator discharge isolation valve (or shut down the unit)
upon discovery that the valve is closed is modified by the requested change to provide a one hour allowed outage time
(AOT) prior to requiring a unit shutdown. This change is consistent with NUREG-1431. The currently required action
is more restrictive than that required by CPSES Technical Specification 3.0.3, that specifies the action required
if an LCO [Limiting Condition for Operation] and its associated action requirements are not met and which provides
a one hour AOT prior to taking steps to place the plant in Mode 3 within the following 6 hours. Following this requested
change, the required actions for an accumulator declared inoperable due to a closed discharge isolation valve will
be identical to those actions required for inoperability for other reasons, with the exception of the accumulator
boron concentration being out of specification that has an AOT of 72 hours. Changing the AOT from ``immediate'' to
one hour does not affect the probability of an accident. The only previously evaluated accident that is potentially
impacted is the Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). With all valves open and thus all accumulators available, a potential
LOCA is bounded by the existing accident analyses. With one accumulator discharge isolation valve closed and thus
one accumulator not available, the consequences of a LOCA could be more severe; however, this requested amendment
does not create this scenario. In other words, although the change in AOT may slightly increase the probability that,
were a LOCA to occur, an accumulator would not be available (see the response to [number] 3 below), it does not involve
a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The requirement to test the accumulator boron concentration following a 101 gallon or greater solution volume increase
is modified by the requested change to exclude volume additions from the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST). Since
the RWST boron concentration must be confirmed to satisfy the limits for the accumulators, there is no impact on the
probability or consequences of any accident.

The relocation of the accumulator water level and pressure channel ACOT and Channel Calibration from CPSES Technical
Specifications to an administratively controlled program is essentially an administrative change. Because proper
tests will still be performed, there is no impact on the probability or consequences of any accident.

The requested change to reduce the containment debris inspections from ``at the completion of every entry'' to ``[a]t
least once daily'' will require fewer inspections and is consistent with SR [Surveillance Requirement] 4.6.1.3
for the containment air locks. The accident of concern is a LOCA and these inspections have no impact on the probability
of a LOCA. Performing fewer inspections would slightly increase the possibility that, should a LOCA occur, there
could be debris in containment which could be transported to and partially clog the containment sump. However, inspecting
at least daily if containment entries have been made is adequate and is justified by the reduced total radiation exposure
for plant personnel. The inspections conducted at least daily assures that there is not a significant increase in
the consequence of any accident.

The requested changes do not modify the existing LCOs for Technical Specifications 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 with the exception
of the replacement of ``indicated'' values with analysis values in LCO 3.5.1, consistent with the relocation of the
SRs for accumulator instrumentation. The requested changes are consistent with NUREG-1431 and GL 93-05, and, as
such, have already been generically assessed by the NRC. It is concluded that the requested changes do not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated
accident.

The only requested change that modifies current operation of the plant is the requested one hour alowed outage time
for action following discovery of a closed cold leg accumulator discharge isolation valve. The requested one hour
completion time to open the valve continues to ensure that prompt action will be taken to return the inoperable accumulator
to an operable status, minimizing the potential for exposure of the plant to a LOCA under this condition. In addition,
as LCO 3.5.1a will continue to require that the accumulator discharge isolation valve be open with power removed from
the valve operator, the probability of the discharge isolation valve being closed in Modes 1, 2, or 3 will remain low.
This change in current operation does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

The requested slight reduction in the containment inspection frequencies specified in SR 4.5.2 only serves to reduce
the number of unnecessary inspections. It does not make substantial changes to the inspection requirements, nor
does it change the method of performing these requirements. Thus, the requested change does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident.

No significant changes to the limiting conditions for operation of the accumulators or the emergency core cooling
system are requested as part of this amendment request. The requested changes do not involve any physical changes
to the plant. The requested changes are consistent with NUREG-1431 and GL 93-05, and, as such, have already been generically
assessed by the NRC. Thus, the requested changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The only requested change that modifies current operation of the plant is the requested one hour allowed outage time
for action following discovery of a closed cold leg accumulator discharge isolation valve. As noted in the response
to [number] 1 above, this requested change in AOT does not significantly affect the probability or consequences of
an accident, but does increase the possibility that, should a LOCA occur, one of the accumulators may not be available
to help mitigate the consequences of the accident. However, the requested one hour completion time to open the valve
continues to ensure that prompt action will be taken to return the inoperable accumulator to an operable status, minimizing
the potential for exposure of the plant to a LOCA under this condition. In addition, as LCO 3.5.1a will continue to require
that the accumulator discharge isolation valve be open with power removed from the valve operator, the probability
of the discharge isolation valve being closed in Modes 1, 2, or 3 will remain low. Considering the controls above and
the fact that the requested action statement is consistent with TS 3.0.3, it is concluded that the requested change
does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The requested slight reduction in the containment inspection frequencies specified in SR 4.5.2 only serves to reduce
the number of unnecessary inspections conducted and reduce the personnel exposure associated with the inspections.
As adequate inspections will continue to be conducted, this requested change does not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

No significant changes to the limiting conditions for operation of the accumulators or the emergency core cooling
systems are requested as part of this amendment request. The requested changes are consistent with NUREG-1366, NUREG-1431
and GL 93-05, and, as such, have already been generically assessed by the NRC. Thus, it is concluded that the requested
changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

County, Texas




Date of amendment request: 

April 22, 1994


Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed amendments would revise the technical specifications by changing the frequency of auxiliary feedwater
pump operational testing from monthly to quarterly.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences or a previously
evaluated accident.

Because the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps are provided to mitigate certain accidents, altering the test frequency
of the pumps will not impact the probability of an accident. The Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps will continue to
be tested quarterly on a staggered basis to the same standards applied to safety-related pumps as defined by ASME Section
XI. Satisfactory completion of the testing in accordance with the Code is used as verification that safety-related
pumps will be available to perform their intended function. Quarterly testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater System
pumps on a staggered basis, therefore, will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable
of performing its intended function. It is thus concluded that the requested change will not involve a significant
increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

Changing the surveillance test frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps does not involve any physical modification
of the plant or result in a change in a method of operation. Therefore, it is concluded that the requested change does
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Changing the surveillance testing frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not affect any safety limits
or any limiting safety system settings. System operating parameters are unaffected. The availability of equipment
required to mitigate or assess the consequence of an accident is not reduced; in fact the availability is increased
because the system is rendered inoperable on a quarterly basis to perform pump testing, rather than a monthly basis.
Further, vibration testing being the most effective early indication of gradual pump degradation continues to be
performed on the same frequency. Quarterly testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater pumps on a staggered basis in accordance
with the criteria specified in the ASME Section XI code provides adequate assurance that the Auxiliary Feedwater
System pumps are capable of performing their intended function. Thus, its [sic] is concluded that the requested change
does not involved [sic] a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves

County, Texas




Date of amendment request: 

April 25, 1994


Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed amendments would revise the technical specifications to reduce the number of fast starts currently
required by surveillance requirements for the emergency diesel generators (EDGs).


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident.

This change reduces the number of ``fast starts'' required on the EDGs and allows the EDGs to be tested using ``slow
starts.'' Reducing the number of ``fast starts'' (required to start in 10 seconds or less) will reduce the wear on the
EDGs primarily by minimizing coking of fuel in the cylinder and preventing premature wearing of the turbocharger
thrust bearing. This increases engine reliability and availability. A ``slow start'' may require that the EDG be
taken out of service to perform the test if the EDG start time is not 10 seconds or less. TU Electric feels that testing
the ``fast start'' capability of the EDG every 184 days will maintain its present level of reliability. The period
of time in which the EDG is actually inoperable due to testing (i.e., may not start and be ready to load in 10 seconds)
is quite short. Overall the reliability and the availability of the EDG will be increased.

The impact of the EDGs on the postulated accidents is directly related to their reliability and availability. Therefore,
the proposed reduction in the number of ``fast starts'' does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of any previously evaluated accident.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated
accident. 
The revised testing allowed by this Technical Specification change does not create a new or different kind of accident.
The EDGs are primarily accident mitigation components. The potential failure of EDGs have already been assessed
in the CPSES design.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The only aspect of this change that could adversely affect the margin of safety is the potential impact on the start
time of the engine. The start time of the engine is not expected to exceed the assumption in the accident analyses except
possibly in the short period of time required to perform the ``slow start'' test. If the EDG does not start in 10 seconds
or less under these conditions, the EDG is declared inoperable, as allowed by the Technical Specifications, to perform
the ``slow start'' test. Because these periods of inoperability are only implemented as allowed by the Technical
Specifications, there is no impact on the margin of safety. The margin of safety established by the assumed EDG availability
will be enhanced by the increased reliability and availability of the EDGs.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

County, Texas




Date of amendment request: 

April 25, 1994


Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed amendments would revise the technical specifications by updating the unit staff qualification requirements
to Regulatory Guide 1.8, Revision 2, ``Qualification and Training of Personnel for Nuclear Power Plants,'' and by
relocating administrative control of training from the technical specifications to the Final Safety Analysis Report.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident.

This proposed amendment involves a consolidation of previous unit staff qualification requirements into one source
document, and a relocation of training requirements to a more appropriate license basis document. The qualification
requirements of the unit staff remains the same as the existing requirements, and the relocation of the training requirements
does not change the scope of the program as it now exists. The relocated training program requirements retain adequate
administrative and regulatory controls to ensure the plant is not placed in an unanalyzed condition.

These changes are administrative in nature. They remain within the assumptions of the current accident analysis.
As a result, they do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated
accident.

These changes are administrative in nature. They merely consolidate qualification requirements and relocate training
requirements. The relocated program requirements retain adequate administrative and regulatory controls to ensure
the plant is not introduced to an unreviewed safety question.

These changes are administrative in nature. They do not introduce any new initiating events. As a result, they do not
create a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a signficant reduction in a margin of safety.

These changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on actual plant protection or safety actuation systems,
or the assumed actions performed in accordance with normal, abnormal, or emergency operating procedures. There
are adequate regulatory and plant configuration controls existing to ensure there is no impact on the plant margin
of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin




Date of amendment request: 

April 21, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) by adding
requirements for the steam exclusion system. The new TS addresses the steam exclusion system (TS 3.15) and the surveillance
on the steam exclusion system (TS 4.15). This system was not previously addressed by the TS.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



A) TS 3.15 Steam Exclusion System (New)
 
The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:

1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The intent of this new specification is to specify the operability requirements for the Steam Exclusion System and
to demonstrate the acceptability of removing the Steam Exclusion System from service for short periods of time.

The proposed change will not significantly increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The accident
under consideration is a high energy line break outside of containment. Allowing a steam exclusion boundary to be
inoperable for a short period of time has no effect on the probability of occurrence of a high energy line break outside
of containment.

The proposed change will not significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Again,
the accident under consideration is a high energy line break outside of containment. Calculations conclude that
the core damage frequency for a high energy line break outside of containment with a non-redundant steam exclusion
boundary open is 2.57E-8 per 12-hour period. Further conservative assumptions of one non-redundant steam exclusion
boundary being open 12 hours per day, 5 days per week, 52 weeks per year results in a core damage frequency of 6.68E-6
per year. This analysis was conservatively calculated taking minimal credit for mitigating the accident, and is
considered to be an acceptable level of risk on an annual basis. A safety factor of five was applied to NUREG/CR-4550
data to determine the initiating event frequency of a high energy line break. This calculation supports the conclusion
that this addition to the Technical Specifications will not result in a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an high energy line break outside of containment.

Furthermore, calculations conclude that the core damage frequency for a high energy line break outside of containment
with one of two redundant steam exclusion boundaries open is 4.62E-10 per 72-hour period. Further conservative assumptions
of one redundant steam exclusion damper being open 24 hours per day, 5 days per week, 52 weeks per year results in a core
damage frequency of 4.00E-8 per year. This analysis was conservatively calculated taking minimal credit for mitigating
the accident, and is also considered to be an acceptable level of risk on an annual basis. Again, a safety factor of five
was applied to NUREG/CR-4550 data to determine the initiating event frequency of a high energy line break. This calculation
also supports the conclusion that this addition to the Technical Specifications will not result in a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an high energy line break outside of containment.

Specific requirements for the Steam Exclusion System do not currently exist in the Technical Specifications. Addition
of TS 3.15 is an enhancement to the Kewaunee Technical Specifications, and providing this information for the plant
staff and operators will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,
nor will it adversely affect the health and safety of the public.
 
2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints or overall plant performance.
Therefore, it cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

Addition of the specification is an enhancement to the Technical Specifications and does not alter input to the safety
analysis. Furthermore, the supporting analysis demonstrates an acceptable level of risk for removing components
from service for limited periods of time. Therefore, it will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Additionally, the proposed change is similar to example C.2.e(ii) in 51 FR 7751. Example C.2.e(ii) states that changes
that constitute an additional limitation, restriction or control not presently included in the TS's are not likely
to involve a significant hazard.

B) S 4.15 Steam Exclusion System (New) 

The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not:

1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed change will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
The accident under consideration is a high energy line break outside of containment. The performance of periodic
surveillance requirements, testing which verifies that components in the Steam Exclusion System are operating
properly, cannot significantly increase the probability or consequences of a high energy line break, nor will it
adversely affect the health and safety of the public.

2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints or overall plant performance.
Therefore, it cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

Addition of the specification is an enhancement to the Kewaunee Technical Specifications and does not alter input
to the safety analysis. Therefore, it will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Additionally, the proposed change is similar to example C.2.e(ii) in 51 FR 7751. Example C.2.e(ii) states that changes
that constitute an additional limitation, restriction or control not presently included in the TS's are not likely
to involve a significant hazard.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

May 26, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) Sections
2.3, 3.6, and 4.6 by correcting minor typographical errors and format inconsistencies. These changes are being proposed
as a part of the licensee's ongoing effort to revise each section of the KNPP TS to achieve a consistent format and to
convert the entire document to Word Perfect. In addition, changes to the basis for TS Sections 2.3, 3.6, and 4.6 have
also been proposed.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not:

1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
These proposed changes involve the conversion of the TS to the Word Perfect format now being used at WPSC. Minor typographical
errors and format inconsistencies were corrected. These proposed changes are administrative in nature; accordingly,
these proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration. Additionally, the proposed changes
are similar to example C.2.e.(i) in 51 FR 7751. Example C.2.e.(i) states that changes which are purely administrative
in nature; i.e., to achieve consistency throughout the Technical Specifications, correct an error, or a change in
nomenclature, are not likely to involve a significant hazard.

10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)



During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 

Federal Register 

notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By September
2, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Company, et al.; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3; Receipt of Petition
for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 and 2.202</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that by letter of May 27, 1994, Thomas J. Saporito, on behalf of himself and Florida Energy Consultants,
Inc. (petitioners), has raised numerous concerns regarding the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (Palo Verde)
operated by the Arizona Public Service Company (licensee). He supplemented his original petition, raising additional
issues on July 8, 1994. Petitioners request that the NRC (1) institute a show cause proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202
for the modification, suspension, or revocation of the Palo Verde operating licenses; (2) issue a notice of violation
against the licensee for continuing to employ The Atlantic Group (TAG) as a labor contractor at Palo Verde; (3) investigate
alleged material false statements made by William F. Conway, Executive Vice President at Palo Verde, during his testimony
at a DOL hearing (ERA Case No. 92-ERA-30) and that, in the interim, the NRC require that he be relieved of
any authority over operations at Palo Verde; (4) investigate the licensee's statements in an August 10, 1993, letter
from Mr. Conway to NRC Administrator, Mr. Bobby H. Faulkenberry, regarding Mr. Saporito, in which the licensee said
that Mr. Saporito gave materially false, inaccurate, and incomplete information on his application for unescorted
access to Palo Verde, so that as a result of that event, he lacks trustworthiness and reliability for access to Palo

Verde; (5) investigate pursuant to 10 CFR 50.7 the circumstances surrounding the February 1994 termination of licensee
employee Joseph Straub, a former radiation protection technician at Palo Verde, to determine if his employment was
illegally terminated by the licensee for having engaged in ``protected activity'' during the course of his employment;
(6) require that the licensee respond to a ``chilling effect'' letter regarding the circumstances surrounding Mr.
Straub's termination from Palo Verde and whether any measures were taken to ensure that his termination did not cause
a chilling effect at Palo Verde; and (7) initiate appropriate actions to require the licensee to immediately conduct
eddy current testing on all steam generators at Palo Verde, because the steam generator tubes were recently subjected
to cracks.


As bases for these requests, petitioners allege that (1) a show cause proceeding is necessary because the public health
and safety concerns alleged are significant and to permit public participation to provide NRC with new and relevant
information; (2) past practices of TAG demonstrate that employees of TAG were retaliated against for having raised
safety concerns while employed at Palo Verde; (3) citations to testimony from transcripts and numerous newspaper
articles (appended as exhibits to the petition), demonstrate that Mr. Conway's testimony is not credible; (4) statements
in the August 10, 1993, letter are inaccurate and materially false and characterize Mr. Saporito as an individual
lacking trustworthiness and reliability for access to Palo Verde, so that such negative characterizations have
blacklisted him from continued employment in the nuclear industry, which is all in retaliation for him raising safety
concerns about operations at Palo Verde; thus, petitioners ask that these statements be rescinded; (5) an investigation
into the termination of Mr. Straub is warranted in view of the fact that the licensee has engaged in similar illegal
conduct in the past where the NRC has required the licensee to pay fines; (6) Mr. Straub is entitled to reinstatement
with pay and benefits pending the NRC's investigation into his termination to offset any chilling effect his termination
had on the Palo Verde workforce; and (7) the stress corrosion and cracking in the steam generators is a recurring problem
of which the licensee is aware and has failed to properly correct, in addition to cooling tower problems, so that the
NRC should be concerned about proper maintenance of safety systems and equipment there.

On July 8, 1994, petitioners filed a supplement raising six additional issues. Petitioners request that the NRC (1)
institute a show cause proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 for the modification, suspension or revocation of the Palo
Verde operating licenses for Units 1, 2 and 3; (2) modify the Palo Verde operating licenses to require operation at
86% power or less; (3) require the licensee to submit a No Significant Hazards safety analysis to justify operation
of those units above 86% power; (4) take immediate action (e.g. confirmatory order) to cause the licensee to reduce
operation to 86% power or less; (5) require the licensee to analyze a design basis SGTR event to show that the offsite
radiological consequences do not exceed a small fraction of the limits of 10 CFR Part 100; and (6) require the licensee
to demonstrate that its emergency operating procedures for SGTR events are adequate and the plant operators are sufficiently
trained in emergency operating procedures.


As bases for these requests, petitioners allege that (1) the licensee experienced a steam generator tube rupture
in the free span area on Unit 2 on March 14, 1993; (2) during a January, 1994 inspection on Unit 2, 85 axial indications
were identified, the longest indication being 7.5 inches; (3) more extensive testing will confirm the existence
of circumferential crack indications in the expansion transition area; (4) in May 1994, steam generator sludge from
Units 1 and 2 indicates a lead content of 4,000-6,000 ppm, which is unusually high, accelerates the crevice corrosion
process, and is believed to be caused by a feedwater source deficiency; (5) the licensee failed to properly implement
operational procedures regarding the March 14, 1993 steam generator tube rupture event, citing eight instances;
(6) the licensee's failure to comply with approved procedures in the above event is indicative of a problem plant that
warrants further NRC action; (7) the NRC is aware of additional licensee weaknesses regarding the steam generator
tube event, citing four instances; (8) the licensee cannot assure that the radiation dose limits are satisfied for
applicable postulated accidents; (9) the licensee is not maintaining an adequate level of public protection in that
the offsite dose limits will be exceeded during a steam generator tube rupture; (10) the licensee cannot demonstrate
that a Palo Verde unit can safely shut down and depressurize to stop steam generator tube leakage prior to a loss of reactor
water storage tank inventory; (11) steam generator tubes are an integral part of the reactor coolant boundary, and
that tube failures could lead to containment bypass, and therefore must be carefully considered by the NRC and the
licensee, (12) the licensee cannot demonstrate compliance with 10 CFR part 50, Appendix A, which establishes the
fundamental requirements for steam generator tube integrity; (13) the licensee has failed to comply with NRC requirements
under NUREG-0800 to show that in the case of a steam generator tube rupture event, the offsite conditions and
single failure do not exceed a small fraction of the limits of 10 CFR part 100; and (14) the licensee has posed an unacceptable
risk to public health and safety by raising power on all three Palo Verde units above 86%, considering the severe degradation
of the steam generator tubes.

This request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR   2.206 and 2.202 of the Commission's regulations. The
request has been referred to the Director of the Office of Enforcement and the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation. In a letter of July 26, 1994, the petitioners' requests that the Commission take immediate action to require
eddy current testing on all Palo Verde steam generators, and reduce operation of the Palo Verde units to 86% power or
less, have been denied. As provided by  2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this request within a reasonable
time. A copy of the petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and local public document room a the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix,
Arizona 85004.

<DOCTITLE>Otho Jones (DBA Jones Inspection Services), Alderson Oklahoma; Order to Cease and Desist Use and Possession of Regulated
Byproduct Material in NRC Jurisdiction (Effective Immediately) </DOCTITLE>



I



Jones Inspection Services is the holder of Radioactive Material License ARK-740-BP-1-94
issued by the state of Arkansas, an NRC Agreement State. The license authorizes Jones Inspection Services to possess
and use sealed radioactive sources in various radiographic exposure devices at temporary job sites in the state of
Arkansas. 10 CFR 150.20 of the NRC's regulations grants a general license to Agreement State licensees to conduct
the same activities in non-Agreement States provided that the NRC is notified and the other provisions of 10 CFR 150.20
are followed. 



II



On July 14, 1994, an NRC investigation was conducted to determine whether Jones Inspection Services was using regulated
byproduct material in NRC jurisdiction without NRC authorization. Based on interviews with Otho G. Jones, the sole
proprietor of Jones Inspection Services, and on documents obtained from the Central Oklahoma Oil and Gas Company,
the investigation confirmed that Jones Inspection Services, which does not hold an NRC license, had illegally used
and possessed regulated byproduct material in Oklahoma, a non-Agreement State in which the NRC maintains regulatory
authority over such material. The NRC's investigation determined that Jones Inspection Services stored radiographic
exposure devices in Oklahoma from at least January 1, 1994, to July 1994, and that these devices has been used to perform
industrial radiography in Oklahoma from April 1, 1994, to June 27, 1994 for Central Oklahoma Oil and Gas Company. The
investigation also determined that these activities were conducted without NRC authorization. Specifically,
the investigation found that Jones Inspection Services did not hold an NRC license as required by 10 CFR 30.3 and that
Otho Jones did not notify the NRC, in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 150.20, that he planned to conduct radiography
at temporary job sites in NRC jurisdiction.
 Thus, these activities were not subject to inspection by the NRC to assure the protection of the public health and safety.






In a signed statement Mr. Jones provided the NRC investigator, he said he did not know he had to notify the NRC and did
not know to whom the information should be provided. However, Mr. Jones also said ``I did think to call the NRC about
reciprocity, but I am afraid of the NRC and did not want me more hassel [sic] so I chose not to call them about working in
Oklahoma.'' Furthersome, as indicated in the footnote, Mr. Jones was the sole proprietor of Tumbleweed X-Ray Company
in September 1991 when that company was issued an NRC order specifically suspending its authority to conduct radiography
activities in Oklahoma and other states in which NRC maintained regulatory authority. 

On July 21, 1994, the NRC issued a Confirmatory Action Letter (CAL 4-94-70) which described voluntary
commitments made by Mr. Jones to discontinue the use of three radiographic exposure devices in his possession and
to transfer the devices to authorized recipients or authorized locations. Mr. Jones informed NRC Region IV personnel
on the same date that he had already transferred two devices to an NRC licensee in the state of Oklahoma and was preparing
to ship a third device to the manufacturer. 



III



Based on the above, it appears that Otho G. Jones, the sole proprietor of Jones Inspection Services, he willfully violated
NRC requirements and, notwithstanding his voluntary actions to transfer three radiographic exposure devices,
was and may continue to be in violation of NRC requirements by possessing regulated byproduct material in NRC jurisdiction
without authorization, i.e., without either an NRC license or a general license authorizing the use of this material
in the state of Oklahoma. This is prohibited by section 81 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended, and by 10
CFR 30.3, which state that, (except for persons exempt as provided in 10 CFR parts 30 and 150), no person shall possess
or use byproduct material except as authorized in a specific or general NRC license. 

Improper handling of the byproduct material can result in unnecessary exposure to radiation. The Atomic Energy Act
and the Commission's regulations require that the possession of licensed material be under a regulated system of
licensing and inspection. Given the current circumstances surrounding Mr. Jones' possession of the byproduct material
and the facts associated with Mr. Jones' former company (i.e., Tumbleweed X-Ray Company) to whom Mr. Jones was the
sole proprietor in 1991 and to which an NRC order was issued suspending its authority to conduct radiography activities
in Oklahoma and other states, Mr. Jones has not demonstrated that he will comply with NRC requirements. 

Consequently, it appears that Mr. Jones is either unwilling or unable to comply with NRC requirements and without
Mr. Jones having an NRC license, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public
will be protected. Therefore, the public health, safety, and interest require that Otho Jones and Jones Inspection
Services be required to cease and desist unauthorized possession of regulated byproduct material and to provide
certification to the NRC that all regulated byproduct material has been transferred to authorized recipients or
authorized locations. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the violation described
above is such that the public health, safety, and interest require that this Order be immediately effective. 



 IV 



Accordlingly pursuant to section 81, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR part 30 and 10 CFR part 150, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that Otho
G. Jones shall:

B. For all regulated byproduct material that is transferred in accordance with the above terms, and all material that
was transferred between July 14, 1994, and the date of this Order:

1. Within 10 days of the date of this Order, certify in writing to the NRC Regional Administrator, Region IV at the address
in B.2 below, under oath or affirmation, that such material was transferred, and provide documentation showing the
date of transfer and the recipient of the material; and

2. The certification required in B.1 above must be sent to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, 611 Ryan Plaza
Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, Texas 76011.

C. Mr. Jones shall cease and desist from possession and use of regulated byproduct material in NRC jurisdiction unless
authorized in accordance with 10 CFR 30.3 or 10 CFR 150.20.

The Regional Administrator, Region IV, may, in writing, relax or rescind this order upon demonstration by the Licensee
of good cause.

Toledo Edison Company, Centerior Service Company and The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company; Withdrawal
of Application for Amendment to Facility Operating License 



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of the Centerior Service Company
(the licensee) to withdraw its March 30, 1994, application for proposed amendment to Facility Operating License
No. NPF-3 for the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 1, located in Ottawa County, Ohio. 

The proposed amendment would have modified the technical specifications by adding a new technical specification
for Limiting Condition for Operation 3/4.4.12, Pilot Operated Relief Value and Block Valve, including associated
Bases and Surveillance Requirements. 

The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the 

Federal Register 

on April 28, 1994 (59 FR 22015). However, by letter dated July 14, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed changes.


For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment and the licensee's letter dated
March 30, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available for public
inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public
document room in the Rochester Public Library, 115 South Avenue, Rochester, New York 14610.

<USDEPT>PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Request for Extension of Approval Under the Paperwork Reduction Act; Collection of Information Under 29 CFR Part
2674, Notice of Insolvency</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for extension of OMB approval.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has requested extension of approval
by the Office of Management and Budget for a currently approved collection of information (1212-0033) contained
in its regulation on Notice of Insolvency (29 CFR Part 2674). The collection of information involves notices that
must be given by the plan sponsor of a multiyear pension plan under certain adverse financial circumstances described
in the regulation. Current approval of the collection of information expires on September 30, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This collection of information is contained in the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (``PBGC's'') regulation
on Notice of Insolvency (29 CFR 2674).





Section 4245(e) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') requires that the sponsor of a
multiemployer pension plan that is in reorganization notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the PBGC, and certain
third parties (

i.e., 

contributing employers, employee organizations representing participants, and plan participants and beneficiaries)
whenever the plan is or may become ``insolvent'' for a plan year (that is, unable to pay full benefits when due during
that plan year). The plan sponsor must also notify the same parties of the level of benefits that will be paid during
each insolvency year. Section 4245(e)(4) provides that these notices (except for the notices to the Secretary of
the Treasury) are to be given in accordance with rules promulgated by the PBGC.

Section 4245(e) requires two types of notice to the PBGC: a ``notice of insolvency,'' stating the plan sponsor's determination
that the plan is or may become insolvent, and a ``notice of insolvency benefit level,'' stating the level of benefits
that will be paid during an insolvency year. (The notices also go to certain third parties.) The Notice of Insolvency
regulation prescribes the contents of these notices, the manner in which they must be given, and the time limits for
their issuance.

The PBGC uses the information it receives to estimate cash needs for financial assistance to troubled plans. Without
this regulation, the notices required by ERISA section 4245 would be inconsistently given and of varying quality,
as plan sponsors applied their individual interpretations to the law. Further, PBGC financial assistance to troubled
plans would likely be delayed by delays in notification.

The PBGC has requested extension of approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for this collection of information
(1212-033), which is currently approved by OMB through September 30, 1994. The PBGC estimates that three plans
will be affected by this regulation each year and that each of these plans will spend 6 hours preparing the required
notices. This amounts to an annual burden on the public of 18 hours.




Issued at Washington, DC, this 28th day of July 1994.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Concerning
Chinese Wall Procedures for Designated Dealers


July 27, 1994.


I. Introduction and Background


On March 17, 1994 the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed a proposed rule change with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The proposed rule change would require specialists to establish the appropriate functional separation to their
operations while maintaining and enforcing written procedures to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information
by employee, affiliated individual and proprietary accounts.





Notice of the filing of this proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on June 21, 1994.
 No comment letters were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission has determined to approve the proposal.





II. Description


The CSE is proposing to require Exchange Designated Dealers (``specialist'') to establish the appropriate functional
separation to their operations while maintaining and enforcing written procedures designed to prevent the misuse
of material, non-public information by employee, affiliated individual and proprietary accounts. The proposed
rule further requires that a copy of such procedures be provided to the Exchange for review and approval, and sets forth
specific guidelines for designated dealers to follow in adopting, maintaining and enforcing Chinese Wall procedures.
Finally, the proposal requires that the Exchange specialist firm obtain prior
 written approval of the Exchange that it has complied with the requirements in establishing functional separation
as appropriate to the operation and that it has established proper compliance and audit procedures to ensure the maintenance
of the functional separation.






The proposal identifies certain minimum procedural and maintenance requirements. First, the associated or affiliated
person can have no influence on specific specialist trading decisions. Second, material, non-public corporate
or market information obtained by the associated or affiliated person from the issuer may not be made available to
the specialist. Third, clearing and margin financing information regarding the specialist may be routed only to
employees engaged in overseeing operations of the affiliated or associated persons and specialist entities.
In addition, the proposal places limitations on the information which may pass between a broker affiliated with an
associated or affiliated person and the specialist, such that they are limited to that exchange of information which
would occur in the normal course of his trading and ``market probing'' activity. The specialist may divulge to such
an affiliated broker information regarding market conditions in speciality stocks that he would make available
in the normal course of specializing to any other broker, and in the same manner. The proposal permits an affiliated
or associated person to ``popularize''
 a specialty stock provided it makes adequate disclosure about the existence of possible conflicts of interest.




The proposal, moreover, provides specific procedures that will apply if a specialist becomes privy to material,
non-public information. In such a case, the specialist must promptly inform his firm's compliance officer, or other
designated official, of the communication and seek guidance from the officer or official as to what procedures he
should follow or what other action should subsequently be followed. The compliance officer or official must maintain
appropriate records, including a summary of the information received by the specialist and a description of the action
taken by the compliance officer or other official.
Finally, the Exchange has established certain procedures to monitor compliance, including the examination of the
Chinese Wall procedures established by the Exchange specialist firms and surveillance of proprietary trades effected
by an affiliated or associated person and its affiliated or associated specialist firm. The Exchange will also monitor
the trading activities of affiliated or associated persons and affiliated or associated specialist in the specialist
firms' speciality stocks in order to monitor the possible trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information
through the periodic review of trade and comparisons reports generated by the Exchange.

III. Discussion 



The Commission has determined that the CSE's proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it promotes just and equitable principles of trade and protects
investors and the public interest. Further, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii)
 in that it aids in assuring fair competition among brokers and dealers. 




The Commission recognizes that significant conflicts of interest can arise between a specialist operation and any
associated or affiliated persons, which, if not addressed by appropriate Chinese Wall procedures and the adequate
surveillance of such procedures, could result in potential manipulative market making activity and informational
advantages benefitting the specialist, specialist unit, or customers of either, all in contravention of Section
6(b) of the Act.
 The Commission further believes that the procedures the Exchange intends to implement with respect to approving
and monitoring the Chinese Wall address these concerns, and therefore are consistent with the requirements of the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. 





The Commission initially addressed the necessity and viability of Chinese Walls in approving the amendments to New
York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') Rules 98 and 193 respectively, which created
the present Chinese Wall scheme in effect on those exchanges.
 At that time, the Commission expressed its belief that it is also desirable for the regional exchanges to consider
requiring specialists affiliated with integrated firms to establish adequate Chinese Walls and generally to review
the efficacy of their surveillance and compliance regarding those specialists. The Commission previously had recognized
the use of Chinese Walls in a number of instances regarding the establishment of an organizational separation between
different departments of a broker-dealer as one of the several means of preventing the interdepartment communication
of material, non-public information.








The NYSE/Amex Order noted that, for example, in view of the diverse functions performed by a multi-service firm and
the material, non-public information that may be obtained by any one department of the firm, the firm often may be required
to restrict access to information to the department receiving it, in order to avoid potential liability under Sections
10(b) and 14(c) of the Act
 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. Moreover, two years after approval of the Amex's and NYSE's Chinese
Wall procedures, Congress enacted the Insider Training and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (``ITSFEA''),
designed primarily to prevent, deter, and prosecute insider trading.
 Among other provisions, ITSFEA created a specific requirement for broker-dealers to maintain procedures designed
to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information.
 In response to the promulgation thereof, many firms redrafted their internal Chinese Wall procedures to ensure compliance.









The Commission restates its understanding that a number of firms with regional specialist operations have established
Chinese Wall procedures between the specialist and its affiliated firm. Nevertheless, such procedures have not
necessarily been adopted by all specialist affiliates, have not been adopted pursuant to any specific regional exchange
requirements, and have not been subject to specific exchange surveillance and oversight. Consistent with the NYSE/Amex
Order, the Commission has continued to encourage the regional exchanges to adopt Chinese Wall procedures.






The NYSE/Amex Order, in addressing the need for regional exchange to participate in the regulation of affiliations
between specialist operations and diversified broker-dealer firms, took into account the fact that regional exchanges
differ from the primary exchanges in terms of order flow and market information. While noting that overall regional
exchange volume is small compared to primary market volume, and that regional exchange pricing of orders is generally
derived from primary market quotations, the Commission expressed its concern that the diversion by a large broker-dealer
of all or a significant portion of order flow in specialty stocks to an affiliated regional specialist could raise
certain regulatory concerns similar to those raised by such affiliations on the primary exchanges. Moreover, the
Commission noted that even if regional exchange specialists continue to set their prices based on primary market
quotations, a regional specialist affiliated with an integrated retail firm could obtain significant access to
material, non-public information. 

The Commission continues to believe that Chinese Walls, with effective controls, may be useful in restricting information
flow between the various departments of broker-dealers. The Commission had monitored the NYSE and Amex Chinese Wall
rules since their inception, and generally believes they have proven effective in the context of specialists and
affiliated approved persons. 

The Commission believes the CSE proposal effectively addresses the potential for market abuses resulting from the
ongoing relationship between specialists and associated or affiliated persons. These factors, along with the specialist's
existing statutory duty to maintain a fair and orderly market, should combine to enhance the effectiveness of the
proposed Chinese Wall. 

Finally, the Commission notes that the structural adequacy of the Chinese Wall is only one part of evaluating whether
the procedures established by the Exchange will detect and deter potential improper activity by either the approved
person or the specialist. Appropriate surveillance procedures are critical to ensure the Chinese Wall is maintained.
To this end, the 
Exchange has submitted to the Commission proposed procedures for monitoring the Chinese Wall.
 The Commission also notes that the Exchange has represented that it believes that it has adequate staffing capacity
to monitor compliance and conduct independent reviews of member firms. 





IV. Conclusion 


In view of the above, the Commission has concluded that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of
the Act, and that it is appropriate to approve the Chinese Wall Procedures for Designated Dealers. 

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change be, and is hereby approved.

 


For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to the delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(A)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Application to Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Bush Industries, Inc., Class A Common
Stock, $.10 Par Value) File No. 1-13190</DOCTITLE>



July 28, 1994.



Bush Industries, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration includes the
following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its Class A Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company 's Class A Common Stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business
on July 14, 1994 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its Class A Common Stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct
and indirect cost and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its securities on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its Class A Common Stock and believes that dual
listing would fragment the market for its Class A Common Stock.

Any interested person may, on or before August 18, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been
made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the
protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc., et al.; Application</DOCTITLE>



July 28, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1994 (the ``Act'').





APPLICANTS: 

The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. (the ``Trust''), the Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust Inc. (``Multimedia''), and Gabelli
Funds, Inc. (``GFI'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested under section 17(b) from section 17(a) and pursuant to section 17(d) and rule 17d-1.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to permit the Trust to transfer a portion of its assets to Multimedia, a newly formed, wholly-owned
subsidiary that is a registered investment company and to distribute to the Trust's shareholders the stock of the
subsidiary received in exchange for the transfer of assets.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations




1. The Trust is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. GFI is the investment adviser to the
Trust. The Trust seeks long-term growth of capital primarily through investment in equity securities. Income is
a secondary objective of the Trust. When the Trust commenced operations, it stated in its prospectus that, as a non-diversified
investment company, the Trust could concentrate investments in individual issues to a greater degree than a diversified
investment company.

2. The Board of Directors of the Trust has taken several steps in order to seek to reduce any discount between the trading
price of the Trust's shares and the Trust's net asset value. The Board of Directors of the Trust has authorized the purchase
of Trust shares in the open market whenever a discount of 10% or more exists. Additionally, the Board has adopted a ``10%
payout'' policy.
 while the Board of Directors of the Trust believes that the adoption of this policy has ameliorated the discount at
which the Trust's shares trade, GFI, in managing the Trust's assets with a view toward assuring that the Trust will
be able to meet its 10% payout policy on a consistent basis, has diversified the Trust's investments to a greater extent
than required under the Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.





3. Multimedia was incorporated on March 31, 1994 and filed a notification of registration on Form N-8A on April
8, 1994 to register under the Act as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Multimedia filed
a registration statement under the Act on Form N-2 on July 8, 1994. The Trust owns 10,000 shares of Multimedia's
common stock, constituting all the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of Multimedia.
 These shares were issued in respect of the Trust's contribution to Multimedia of $100,000 of initial capital. The
person who currently serve as directors of the Trust are the directors of Multimedia, and the principle executive
officers of the Trust hold the same officers with Multimedia.





4. Multimedia's primary investment objective is long-term growth of capital. However, unlike the Trust, which attempts
to achieve this objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of equity securities of companies in a wide variety
of industries, Multimedia will concentrate its investments in common stock and other securities of foreign and domestic
companies in telecommunications, entertainment, media, and publishing industries.


5. The Board of Directors of the Trust has approved, subject to exemptive relief and subsequent shareholder approval,
the contribution of up to 10% of the Trust's net assets (but in any event not less than $60 million in order to satisfy
the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange) to Multimedia. It is anticipated that the contributed assets
will consist largely or exclusively of cash and short-term fixed income instruments. All the shares of the common
stock of Multimedia then will be distributed by the Trust as a dividend to its shareholders at a rate of one share of Multimedia
Trust common stock for every ten shares held of the Trust. The contribution of the Trust assets to Multimedia and the
subsequent distribution of Multimedia shares to the Trust shareholders is referred to herein as the ``Transaction.''
Application will be made to list Multimedia's shares for trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

6. GFI will serve as investment adviser to Multimedia. The advisory fee structure for Multimedia will be the same as
that approved by the Trust shareholders at the Trust's 1994 annual meeting of shareholders held on June 27, 1994.






7. The Board of Directors of the Trust believes that the Transaction will result in the following benefits to Trust
shareholders: (a) Shareholders will receive shares of an investment company with a more concentrated portfolio
and a different risk-return profile than the Trust; (b) shareholders will acquire Multimedia shares at a much lower
cost than is typically the case for a newly-organized closed-end equity fund since there will be no underwriting discounts
or commissions; and (c) Multimedia will distribute substantially all of its annual net income and capital gains to
shareholders at year end, and consequently Multimedia may be more fully invested in equity securities than the Trust.
Multimedia does not intend to adopt a dividend policy similar to the Trust's 10% payout policy. The Board of Directors
believes that the benefits of the Transaction outlined above outweigh the costs of the Transaction.

<TEXT>
 

8. The Trust does not expect that it will recognize significant taxable gain on its contribution of cash and securities
to Multimedia in exchange for shares of Multimedia. Multimedia has been advised by counsel that the distribution
of shares of Multimedia to Trust shareholders likely will be a taxable event for Trust shareholders and, under certain
circumstances, will be a taxable event for the Trust. However, the Transaction is not expected to increase significantly
the total amount of taxable distributions received by Trust shareholders for the year in which the Transaction is
consummated and is not expected to result in the recognition of significant taxable gain by the Trust.

9. The costs of organizing Multimedia and effecting the distribution of Multimedia's shares to the Trust's shareholders,
including the fees and expense of counsel and accountants and printing, listing, and registration fees, are estimated
to be approximately $250,000 and will be borne by Multimedia. The Trust will bear the costs of soliciting its shareholders'
approval of the Transaction. The costs incurred in connection with the application for exemptive relief will be allocated
between the Trust and Multimedia on the basis of their net assets, after giving effect to the Transaction. Costs incurred
in connection with the organization of Multimedia will be amortized on a straight-line basis for a five-year period
beginning at the commencement of operations of Multimedia. In addition, Multimedia will incur operating expenses
on an ongoing basis, including legal, auditing, transfer agency, and custodian expenses that, when aggregated with
the fees payable by the Trust for similar services after the distribution, will likely exceed the fees currently payable
by the Trust for those services. It is not expected that the Transaction will have significant effect on the annual
expenses of the Trust as a percentage of its assets.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. The Trust may be viewed as an affiliated person of Multimedia under section 2(a)(3) of the Act since the Trust will
own 100 percent of Multimedia's voting securities until the consummation of the Transaction. Multimedia may similarly
be considered an affiliated person of the Trust since 100 percent of Multimedia's voting securities will be owned
by the Trust. The Trust and Multimedia also may be viewed as affiliated persons of each other to the extent that they
may be deemed to be under the common control of GFI.

2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act makes it unlawful, among other things, for any affiliated person of a registered investment
company to sell any securities or other property to the registered company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful,
among other things, for such an affiliated person to purchase securities or other property from the registered company.

3. As a result of the affiliation between the Trust and Multimedia, section 17(a)(1) would prohibit the Trust's ``sale''
to Multimedia of a portion of the Trust's assets and Multimedia's ``sale'' to the Trust of securities issued by Multimedia,
although the latter transaction arguably may be excepted by section 17(a)(1)(B). Section 17(a)(2) would prohibit
Multimedia's ``purchase'' from the Trust of such portion of the Trust's assets. It is also possible that section 17(a)
may apply with respect to the Trust's 

pro rata

 distribution of Multimedia securities to any Trust shareholder holding more than 5% of Trust shares.

4. Applicants request an exemption pursuant to section 17(b) of the Act from the provisions of section 17(a) of the
Act in order to permit the Trust to effect the Transaction. Section 17(b) authorizes the SEC to issue such an exemptive
order if certain conditions are met.

5. Applicants also seek an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 thereunder. Section 17(d) and rule 17d-1
thereunder generally prohibit, among other things, transactions in which a registered investment company and any
affiliated person of such a company may be deemed to be acting jointly. Applicants request an order pursuant to rule
17d-1 to the extent that the participation of the applicants in the Transaction may be deemed to constitute a
prohibited joint transaction.

6. Applicants assert that the terms of the Transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair
and reasonable and involve no element of overreaching. Applicants state that the proposed sale by the Trust of a portion
of its assets to Multimedia in exchange for the securities of Multimedia will be based on the fair value of those assets
as computed on the day of the proposed transfer. Applicants further state that such assets are anticipated to consist
largely or exclusively of cash and short-term fixed income instruments and thus will likely pose few, if any, issued
with respect to valuation. Similarly, applicants assert that Multimedia stock distributed by the Trust in the Transaction
will be valued based on the value of Multimedia's assets. ``Value'' for those purposes will be determined in accordance
with the provisions of section 2(a)(41) of the Act and rule 2a-4 thereunder.

7. Applicants state that the Transaction will be consistent with stated investment policies of the Trust and Multimedia
as fully disclosed to shareholders. The distribution of Multimedia shares will not change the position of the Trust's
shareholders with respect to the underlying investments that they then own; such investments simply will be held
through two closed-end non-diversified investment companies with the same investment objectives rather than one.
Thus, the effect of the Transaction is consistent with the information contained in past disclosure documents of
the Trust. A proxy statement/prospectus of the Trust and Multimedia will be used, following the issuance of the exemptive
relief, to solicit the approval of the Trust shareholders of the Transaction. Moreover, the Trust's shareholders
will have the opportunity to vote on the Transaction after having received extensive disclosure concerning the Transaction.

8. Applicants state that the Transactions will not place any of the Trust, Multimedia, or existing shareholders of
the Trust in a position less advantageous than that of any other of such persons. The Trust's assets transferred to
Multimedia (and the shares received in return) will be based on their fair value as computed on the day of the transfer
in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The shares of Multimedia will be distributed as a dividend to the shareholders
in the same investment posture immediately following the Transaction as before.
9. Applicants also assert that the Transaction comports with the policies underlying rule 17a-8, which exempts
from section 17(a) a merger, consolidation, or purchase or sale of substantially all of the assets involving registered
companies which may be affiliated persons, or affiliated persons of an affiliated person, solely by reason of having
a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. While the Trust and Multimedia will be affiliated
briefly because of the Trust's ownership of Multimedia, the only potential affiliation after the distribution will
be a commonality of investment adviser, directors, and certain officers. The Trust's Board of Directors, including
a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the Trust, have made the following findings required
by rule 17a-8: (a) that participation in the Transaction is in the best interests of the Trust; and (b) that the
interests of the existing shareholders of the Trust will not be diluted as a result of its effecting the transactions.
In addition, as required by rule 17a-8, such findings, and the basis upon which the findings were made, will be
recorded fully in the minute book of the Trust.
10. Accordingly, applicants believe that the standards of sections 17(b) and 17(d) and rule 17d-1 thereunder
are met.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (McDonald's Corporation, Common Stock,
No Par Value, With Attached Rights) File No. 1-5231 </DOCTITLE>



July 26, 1994. 



McDonald's Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Pacific Stock Exchange Inc. (``PSE'').


The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:


According to the Company, its Board of Directors of the Company (the ``Board''), pursuant to lawfully delegated authority,
unanimously approved resolutions on May 27, 1994, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the PSE.
The decision of the Board was based upon the belief that the listing of the Common Stock on the PSE was no longer beneficial
to the Company due to minimal volume of trading of Company shares on the Exchange. Further, an adequate market exists
for trading of the Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). 

Any interested person may, on or before August 16, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been
made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the
protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

Stock, $.01 Par Value; 61/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2003) File No. 1-11144</DOCTITLE>



July 28, 1994.



Regency Health Services, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock and the debentures are listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock and the debentures commenced trading on
the NYSE at the opening of business on April 5, 1994 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading
on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its common stock and the debentures from listing on the Amex, the Company considered
the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock and the debentures
on the NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its stock and believes
that dual listing would fragment the market for the common stock.

Any interested person may, on or before August 18, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

Applicant's Representations



1. The Applicant was originally established by Southwestern Life Insurance Company as a separate account pursuant
to the insurance laws of the State of Texas on February 14, 1986.

2. On February 28, 1986, the Applicant registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. On that same date, the
Applicant filed a registration statement on Form S-6 under the Securities Act of 1933 (File No. 33-3662).
The registration statement was declared effective on October 7, 1987. The Applicant never made an initial public
offering of its securities.

3. The Applicant has not transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are securityholders
of the Applicant.

4. The Applicant has not made any distributions to securityholders.

5. The Applicant has no assets, debts, or other liabilities outstanding.

6. The Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings (other than this deregistration proceeding).

7. The Applicant has no securityholders.

8. The Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it intend to engage, in any business activity other than that necessary
for the winding-up of its affairs.



Applicant's Conclusion



Based on the facts set out above, Applicant represents that it has never made a public offering of its securities, has
not more than 100 securityholders for purposes of Section 3(c)(1) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, and does
not propose to make a public offering or engage in business of any kind. Applicant therefore requests an order pursuant
to Section 8(f) of the 1940 Act declaring that it has ceased to be an investment company.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Index of Administrator's Decisions and Orders in Civil Penalty Actions; Publication</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of publication.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice constitutes the required quarterly publication of an index of the Administrator's decisions and orders
in civil penalty cases. The FAA is publishing an index by order number, an index by subject matter, and case digests
that contain identifying information about the final decisions and orders issued by the Administrator. Publication
of these indexes and digests is intended to increase the public's awareness of the Administrator's decisions and
orders and to assist litigants and practitioners in their research and review of decisions and orders that may have
precedential value in a particular civil penalty action. Publication of the index by order number, as supplemented
by the index by subject matter, ensures that the agency is in compliance with statutory indexing requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Administrative Procedure Act requires Federal agencies to maintain and make available for public inspection
and copying current indexes containing identifying information regarding materials required to be made available
or published. 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). In a notice issued on July 11, 1990, and published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 29148; July 17, 1990), the FAA announced the public availability of several indexes and summaries that provide
identifying information about the decisions and orders issued by the Administrator under the FAA's civil penalty
assessment authority and the rules of practice governing hearings and appeals of civil penalty actions. 14 CFR Part
13, Subpart G. The FAA maintains an index of the Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty actions organized
by order number and containing identifying information about each decision or order. The FAA also maintains a subject-matter
index, and digests organized by order number.





In a notice issued on October 26, 1990, the FAA published these indexes and digests for all decisions and orders issued
by the Administrator through September 30, 1990. 55 FR 45984; October 31, 1990. The FAA announced in that notice that
it would publish supplements to these indexes and digests on a quarterly basis (

i.e.

, in January, April, July, and October of each year). The FAA announced further in that notice that only the subject-matter
index would be published cumulatively, and that both the order number index and the digests would be non-cumulative.

Since that first index was issued on October 26, 1990 (55 FR 45984; October 31, 1990), the FAA has issued supplementary
notices containing the quarterly indexes of the Administrator's civil penalty decisions as follows:







In the notice published on January 19, 1993, the Administrator announced that for the convenience of the users of these
indexes, the order number index published at the end of the year would reflect all of the civil penalty decisions for
that year. 58 FR 5044; 1/19/93. The order number indexes for the first, second, and third quarters would be non-cumulative.

As noted at the beginning of the digests, 

the digests do not constitute legal authority, and should not be cited or relied upon as such. The digests are not intended
to serve as a substitute for proper legal research. Parties, attorneys, and other interested persons should always
consult the full text of the Administrator's decisions before citing them in any context.



The Administrator's final decisions and orders, indexes, and digests are available for public inspection and copying
at all FAA legal offices. (The addresses of the FAA legal offices are listed at the end of this notice.)

In addition, the Administrator's decisions and orders have been published by commercial publishers and are available
on computer databases. (Information about these commercial publications and computer databases is provided at
the end of this notice.)

Digests



(Current as of June 30, 1994)



The digests of the Administrator's final decisions and orders are arranged by order number, and briefly summarize
key points of the decision. The following compilation of digests includes all final decisions and orders issued by
the Administrator from April 1, 1994, to June 30, 1994. The FAA will publish noncumulative supplements to this compilation
on a quarterly basis (e.g.,

 April, July, October, and January of each year).



These digests do not constitute legal authority, and should not be cited or relied upon as such. The digests are not
intended to serve as a substitute for proper legal research. Parties, attorneys, and other interested persons should
always consult the full text of the Administrator's decisions before citing them in any context.



In the Matter of Pan American Airways, Inc.



Order No. 94-11 (4/21/94)



Appealed Dismissed.

 Complainant withdrew its notice of appeal, and as a result, the Administrator dismissed its appeal.



In the Matter of David D. Bartusiak



Order No. 94-12 (4/28/94)





Appeal Dismissed.

 Respondent failed to perfect his appeal by filing an appeal brief, and has failed to show good cause for this failure.
Respondent's appeal is dismissed.



In the Matter of John G. Boyle



Order No. 94-13 (5/19/94)





Appeal Dismissed.

 Complainant's appeal was dismissed in a previous order. Respondent's appeal, however, remained active. Respondent
has now withdrawn its notice of appeal, and therefore, its appeal is dismissed also.



In the Matter of B&G Instruments, Inc.



Order No. 94-14 (6/9/94)





Appeal Dismissed.

 Respondent has withdrawn its appeal. Respondent's appeal is dismissed.



In the Matter of Anthony F. Columna



Order No. 94-15 (6/15/94)





Notice of Appeal Construed as Appeal Brief.

 Respondent failed to file an appeal brief. His notice of appeal, however, satisfies the requirements for an appeal
brief. Complainant is granted 35 days from the service date of this order to file a reply brief.



In the Matter of Martha Phyllis Ford



Order No. 94-16 (6/15/94)





Appeal Dismissed.

 Complainant has withdrawn its appeal. Complainant's appeal is dismissed.



In the Matter of TCI Corp.



Order No. 94-17 (6/22/94)





Appeal Dismissed.

 Complainant sought a ruling that the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) does not apply to cases arising under the Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act. The law judge already ruled that TCI was not entitled to attorney's fees under the EAJA
because the FAA's case against TCI was ``substantially justified.'' Thus, the FAA's appeal was moot, and would be
dismissed.



In the Matter of Phyllis Jones Luxemburg



Order No. 94-18 (6/22/94)





No Error in Granting Motion for Decision.

 Respondent argued that the law judge erred in granting Complainant's motion for decision and assessing a $1,000 civil
penalty for smoking on an aircraft when the no-smoking signs were lit without considering Respondent's reply to Complainant's
motion. The law judge waited until after Respondent's deadline for filing a reply had expired before he issued his
order. Respondent failed to file either a reply or a request for extension of time before the deadline, and she has failed
to show good cause for this failure. The law judge committed to error in this regard.



Stress and Advanced Age Not Mitigating Factors.

 Respondent argued that the sanction of $1,000 should be reduced because of several mitigating factors, including
the stress she was under at the time of the incident and her advanced age. Neither stress nor advanced age justify a reduction
in a civil penalty for an intentional violation of the regulations.



Sanction Reduced.

 The only justification the agency attorney offered the law judge for imposing the maximum civil penalty of $1,000
was that the 

Giuffrida

 case also involved smoking in the cabin when the no-smoking signs were lit and the Administrator imposed the maximum
penalty of $1,000 in that case. However, 

Giuffrida

 actually involved smoking in the lavatory. Complainant concedes that Respondent's violation, involving smoking
in the cabin when the no-smoking signs are lit, does not pose as great a threat to safety as smoking in the lavatory. A
civil penalty of $700 more closely reflects the gravity, nature, and extent of Respondent's violation.



In the Matter of Pony Express Courier Corp.



Order No. 94-19 (6/22/94)





Sanction Increased.

 Although several complaint allegations were dismissed, the Administrator increased the civil penalty assessed
against Respondent to the full $40,000 sought in the complaint because those allegations that were established were
serious enough to warrant the full requested civil penalty. The $40,000 civil penalty was substantially less than
the maximum civil penalty possible. The law judge's reduction of the civil penalty to $30,000 was inappropriate because
the law judge made several findings concerning the serious and wilful nature of Respondent's violations of the Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act, and Respondent did not establish any mitigating factors.



In the Matter of Conquest Helicopters



Order No. 94-20 (6/22/94)





Remand Due to Errors of Law.

 The Administrator remanded this case to the administrative law judge for a hearing solely to determine the appropriate
amount of civil penalty, after finding errors in the law judge's reasons for reducing the civil penalty to $4,500.



Closing Arguments.

 The law judge's finding that a civil penalty over $4,500 would result in financial hardship for Respondent was based
entirely on statements made by Respondent during closing arguments, and not on evidence.



Number of Flights.

 Once the law judge determined that Respondent made two flights, he should have found that each flight was a separate
violation.



In the Matter of Mark L. Sweeney



Order No. 94-21 (6/22/94)





Reconsideration Denied.

 The Administration denied Respondent's petition to reconsider the Administrator's prior decision assessing Respondent
a $2,500 civil penalty for failing to see and avoid another aircraft, creating a collision hazard, and careless or
reckless operation. Respondent raised no new arguments and cited no law in his petition.



In the Matter of Jimmy Lee Harkins



Order No. 94-22 (6/29/94)





Dismissal Affirmed.

 The Administrator affirmed the decision of the administrative law judge to dismiss Respondent's request for hearing
because Respondent failed to file an answer. On appeal Respondent failed to show good cause for his failure to file
an answer.

Integrity of the Civil Penalty Process.

 Though the $5,000 civil penalty assessed is not insignificant, especially when imposed on an individual respondent,
in this case there was no basis in the record to do other than affirm the law judge's decision. Procedural rules must
be enforced in a non-arbitrary manner to ensure the integrity of the civil penalty process, even where this results
in severe consequences.


In the Matter of Ezekuiel G. Perez


Order No. 94-23 (6/27/94)




Appeal Brief Construed.

 Letter Respondent sent to the administrative law judge after dismissal of Respondent's case for failure to file an
answer, was construed by the Administrator as a timely notice of appeal and an appeal brief. In his letter, which was
timely filed, Respondent alleged that he had filed an answer but had only sent it to agency counsel. Complainant was
given 35 days to file a reply brief.


In the Matter of Todd M. Page


Order No. 94-24 (6/29/94)




Appeal Dismissed.

 Respondent failed to perfect his appeal by filing an appeal brief, and has failed to show good cause for this failure.
Respondent's appeal is dismissed.


Commercial Reporting Services of the Administrator's Civil Penalty Decisions and Orders


In June 1991, as a public service, the FAA began releasing to commercial publishers the Administrator's decisions
and orders in civil penalty cases. The goal was to make these decisions and orders more accessible to the public. The
Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty cases are now available in the following commercial publications.





AvLex,

 published by Aviation Daily, 1156 15th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005, (202) 822-4669;

is placing the decisions on CD-ROM. Finally, the Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty cases are
available on the following computer databases: Compuserve; Fedix; and GENIE.
The FAA has stated previously that publication of the subject-matter index and the digests may be discontinued once
a commercial reporting service publishes similar information in a timely accurate manner. No decision has been made
yet on this matter, and for the time being, the FAA will continue to prepare and publish the subject-matter index and
digests.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement: Marion County, West Virginia</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FHWA, is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a
proposed highway project in Fairmont, West Virginia. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FHWA, in cooperation with the West Virginia Division of Highways will prepare an environmental impact statement
(EIS) on a proposal to build a new expressway in Fairmont, West Virginia. The proposed project could involve construction
of a new facility which would begin at the Pleasant Valley Interchange of I-79, cross either the Monongahela
River or the Tygart Valley and West Fork Rivers, utilize a railroad right-of-way that runs along Fairmont adjacent
to the Monongahela River, and end at U.S. 19 south of Rivesville. The project length is approximately six miles. Improvements
in the corridor are considered necessary to reduce congestion in downtown Fairmont, to improve traffic flow, and
to create a better environment for economic development. 



Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action; (2) improvements to existing routes; (3) alternate
alignments at both ends and (4) alternate designs for the portion utilizing railroad right-of-way. 

Following the publishing of this notice of intent in the 

Federal Register,

 a formal scoping meeting will be held to provide other Federal and State agencies an opportunity to review the proposed
project and to provide early input as to the areas of concern. The draft EIS and other pertinent materials will be made
available for public and agency review and comment prior to a public hearing. 

To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided here.

B.A.T. Incorporated; Grant of Petition for Temporary Exemption From Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208


B.A.T. (``Battery Automated Transportation'') Inc. of West Valley City, Utah, petitioned to be exempted from Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 

Occupant Crash Protection

 for Geo Metro sedans that it converts to electric power. The basis of the petition was that an exemption will facilitate
the development and field evaluation of low-emission motor vehicles.
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on May 25, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 27100).
This notice grants the petition.
Petitioner has already been excused from compliance with the crash test provision of Standard No. 208 by NHTSA Temporary
Exemption No. 93-3 which expires August 1, 1995 (see 58 FR 45549). Although that exemption is not vehicle-specific
by its terms, petition had been made only on behalf of 1993 model Ford Ranger pickup trucks to be converted to electric
power. Thus, rather than providing the petitioner with an interpretation that the current exemption extends to sedans
as well as pickups, NHTSA concluded that the public should be offered an opportunity to comment on B.A.T.'s latest
request.
As before, the basis of the petition is that a temporary exemption would facilitate the development and field evaluation
of a low-emission motor vehicle, as provided by 49 CFR 555.6(c). The petitioner will not manufacture more than 2,500
vehicles during any 12-month period that the exemption is in effect.
Although the Geo Metro is certified by its original manufacturer as conforming with all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards, petitioner has determined that the vehicles may not conform, after their modification,
with ``the requirements of crash tests of'' Standard No. 208 

Occupant Crash Protection. 

The petitioner intends to make arrangements with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to do computer simulated
crash testing. Any changes that are shown to be necessary will be incorporated in all future versions ``and will voluntarily
be retrofitted in earlier units.''
Although the petitioner has not provided specific arguments that an exemption would not unreasonably degrade the
safety of the vehicle, it believes that electric vehicles are safer because they carry no flammable substances and
do not have ``a very hot catalytic converter close to the gasoline tank.'' B.A.T. conversions do not ``emit hydrogen
gas from the batteries due to the addition of hydrocaps which catalyze any hydrogen gas formed when charging or discharging.''
Further, ``BAT `Ultra Force' catalyst sharply reduces any gassing that might otherwise occur.''

Finally, the petitioner argued, granting the exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act because the vehicles ``are non polluting * * * and therefore can
be a major means of improving the quality of the air we breathe.''

One comment was received on the petition, from William Bohn of Marysville, Washington. Mr. Bohn is the owner of a 1989
Geo Metro and a 1970 BMW 2002 EV conversion. He questions ``whether the safety of the vehicle has been compromised by
the addition of the battery pack in regards to braking, steering, and suspension'' as he fears ``that the added weight
of the battery pack is beyond the capacity that the car was originally tested.'' However, he concedes that the converter
``may have reduced the total weight load by using 12V batteries in series vice the more common 6V series pack'', and
that the converter may also ``have increased the suspension's capacity, and improved the brakes to better accommodate
the increased weight.''

The agency has reviewed Mr. Bohn's comment. It notes that neither B.A.T. nor another petitioner who converts Geo Metro
vehicles (e.g., Solectria) has asked for a temporary exemption from the braking standard, Standard No. 105. NHTSA
interprets this as indicating that these converters of Geo Metros have assured themselves that the conversions continue
to meet Standard No. 105. As for its effect upon ``steering'', NHTSA is unsure of the exact nature of Mr. Bohn's concern,
whether it goes to the steerability of the vehicle or something else. Solectria has requested an exemption from Standard
No. 204 

Steering Control Rearward Displacement

 whereas B.A.T. appears to believe that its alterer's certification will cover compliance with this standard after
conversion. The suspension of a vehicle is not the subject of a safety standard. If the increased weight should result
in a safety related defect, the converter will be subject to the notification and remedy provisions of the Vehicle
Safety Act.

As NHTSA noted in granting B.A.T.'s previous petition:





``* * * it is manifestly in the public interest for small manufacturers to engage in the converting of internal combustion
engines to electric power, and for this agency to take appropriate steps to encourage these endeavors, provided that
they are consistent with motor vehicle safety. Exemptions for conversions allow field evaluations by their purchasers
and modifications by the converters that respond to the evaluations.'' (58 FR at 45550).





Those reasons, of course, still exist, and once again support a finding by the Administrator that an exemption from
S5.1 of Standard No. 208 will facilitate the development and field evaluation of a low emission motor vehicle, and
that the exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the objectives of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act. The exemption provided will allow the petitioner to broaden its product range from trucks to passenger
cans, and contribute to the development of its expertise in vehicle conversion.

Petitioner was not specific as to the extent that its conversion may not conform with Standard No. 208, although NHTSA
assumes that the converted Metro will continue to be equipped with its original restraints. In this sense, an exemption
would not, in the words of the statute, ``unreasonably degrade'' the safety of the Geo conversion.

B.A.T. did not request a specific time period for its exemption, and in its absence, NHTSA is providing one that will
expire on August 1, 1995. First, this is the termination date of Exemption No. 93-3 granted B.A.T. for its Ford
Ranger conversions, and if the company finds it necessary to petition for renewals of both exemptions, they may be
made under the cover of one petition. Secondly, an exemption for this time period will allow B.A.T. to schedule and
complete its compliance verification testifying with the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories. Finally, NHTSA notes
that General Motors will introduce a substantially revised Geo Metro for the 1995 model year, and because of this,
B.A.T. will have to decide whether to terminate its program of Metro conversions after the 1994 model year, or, if it
decides to continue with the Metro, to reevaluate its conversion compliance status.

In consideration of the foregoing, B.A.T. Inc. is hereby granted NHTSA Temporary Exemption No. 94-4, expiring
August 1, 1995, from S5.1 of 49 CFR 571.208 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 

Occupant Crash Protection.

<DOCTITLE>Chrysler Corporation; Petition for Renewal of Temporary Exemption From Three Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards</DOCTITLE>



Chrysler Corporation of Highland Park, Michigan, has petitioned for a renewal of NHTSA Temporary Exemption No. 92-1,
expiring August 31, 1994 (57 FR 27507) which was granted covering three Federal motor vehicle safety standards, for
electric-powered multipurpose passenger vehicles (``TEVan''). As of June 10, 1994, the company has produced 52
TEVans under the exemption. Its petition for renewal was accompanied by a copy of its original petition, and NHTSA
interprets this as an indication that the company is repeating its original requests and arguments.

The TEVan is an electrically driven version of the Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager multipurpose passenger vehicle.
If the exemption is renewed, modifications will be made to production Dodge and Plymouth vans manufactured between
September 1, 1994 and August 31, 1996. Although a successor to the current van will be introduced within this time frame,
``electric conversions of that new platform will not be ready for production initially'' and Chrysler is planning
``to produce the current TEVan versions until the new electric conversion units are ready for introduction.'' The
TEVan was developed in cooperation with the Electric Power Research Institute, U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium,
and the United States Department of Energy. The basis for the petition was that a temporary exemption would facilitate
the development and field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle, as provided by 49 CFR 555.6(c). The vehicles
use electric motors powered by nickel-iron or other equivalent batteries that replace the internal combustion engine.
According to Chrysler, the TEVans meet the California Air Resource Board zero emission requirements, and are low-emission
vehicles as defined by section 123(g) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.

The TEVan differs from regular production vans as follows: the internal combustion engine, transmission, coolant
system, power brakes, gasoline fuel system, and power steering system have been replaced by an electric drive motor,
a nickel-iron or equivalent battery pack, a micro-processor based battery management system, a controller-converter-charger
unit, a two-speed manual/automatic transmission, and electric-motor-driven pumps for the vacuum power brakes
and the hydraulically assisted power steering. Finally, the hot water heater/defroster unit is replaced by an electric
resistance type heating/defrosting system.

The TEVan is based on production vehicles certified as complying with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. However, it does not comply with the portions of the standards indicated below.

1. Standard No. 101, 

Controls and Displays.

S5.1. The TEVan is equipped with a state-of-charge gauge to serve as an indicator of reserve battery power, rather
than the fuel gauge required by the standard.

2. Standard No. 102, Transmission Shift Lever Sequence, Starter Interlock, and Transmission Braking Effect.

S3.1.2. The requirement for transmission braking effect is met by regenerative braking, in which the electric motor
becomes a generator, recharging the batteries and dissipating energy in the process. Regenerative braking can be
switched off at the option of the driver to restore steering control on slippery surfaces.

S3.1.3. The starter interlock mechanism is deleted since there will be no electric starting motor.

S3.1.4. The automatic transmission shift mechanism is replaced with an electric switch control device that operates
in a similar manner.

3. Standard No. 105, Hydraulic Brake Systems

S5.1. The performance of the service brake system is predicated on the use of the regenerative characteristic of the
drive motor to augment the power-assisted hydraulic wheel brakes. The motor, driven through the transmission by
the mass of the coasting vehicle, functions as a generator to dissipate energy through charging the drive batteries.
Chrysler has never conducted tests using regenerative braking, however, tests of a conventionally powered weighted
simulation of the TEVan indicate that the TEVan will meet the stopping distance requirements of S5.1.1. In the fade
and recovery test, S5.1.4, t
