On April 28, 1994, counsel for Shanghai Perfumery and CFTD submitted public information concerning surrogate values
for factors of production for coumarin. On May 20, 1994, petitioners provided the Department with Indian prices for
certain factors used in the production of coumarin, and on July 15, 1994, counsel for the remaining participating
respondents submitted information regarding surrogate values.

On May 13 and 19, 1994, the Department issued supplemental questionnaires to all producers and exporters in the investigation
except China Tuhsu. On June 9, 1994, counsel for Shanghai Perfumery and CFTD advised the Department that it was withdrawing
its representation of the companies. On May 27 and June 9, we received responses to our supplemental questionnaires
from all respondents except Shanghai Perfumery, CFTD, and China Tuhsu. On June 23, 1994, Changzhou Chemical submitted
minor revisions to its factors of production data.

On May 27, 1994, the Department issued a questionnaire to all respondents except China Tuhsu regarding the issue of
separate rates. Responses were received from Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Native, and Tianjin Chemical on June 13, 1994
(see, ``Separate Rates'' section below).

On June 20, 1994, petitioners, pursuant to section 353.16 of the Department's regulations, amended the petition
in this investigation to allege the existence of critical circumstances with respect to imports of coumarin from
the PRC. On June 22, 1994, the Department sent letters to Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native requesting
information on volume and value of shipments of the subject merchandise to the United States. We received their responses
on July 12, 1994.

On July 15, 1994, we sent supplemental ``Separate Rates'' questionnaires to Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals,
and Tianjin Native.



Scope of Investigation



The product covered by this investigation is coumarin. Coumarin is an aroma chemical with the chemical formula C

 that is also known by other names, including 2H-1-benzopyran-2-one, 1,2-benzopyrone, cis-o-coumaric acid lactone,
coumarinic anhydride, 2-Oxo-1,2-benzopyran, 5,6-benzo-alpha-pyrone, ortho-hydroxyc innamic acid lactone,
cis-ortho-coumaric acid anhydride, and tonka bean camphor.

All forms and variations of coumarin are included within the scope of the investigation, such as coumarin in crystal,
flake, or powder form, and ``crude'' or unrefined coumarin (

i.e.

 prior to purification or crystallization). Excluded from the scope are ethylcoumarins (C

) and methylcoumarins (C

). Coumarin is classifiable under subheading 2932.21.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.



Period of Investigation



The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993.



Separate Rates



Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have each requested a separate, company-specific rate. Their
respective business licenses each indicate that they are owned ``by all the people.'' As stated in the Final Determination
of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the People's Republic of China (59 FR 22585, 22586, May 2, 1994)
(``Silicon Carbide''), and the Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the People's
Republic of China (59 FR 28053, May 31, 1994 (``Sebacic Acid''), ``ownership of a company by all the people does not
require the application of a single rate.'' Accordingly, these three respondents are eligible for consideration
for separate rates.

To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes
each exporting entity under a test arising out of the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers
from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (``Sparklers'') and amplified in Silicon Carbide. Under
the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate rates only where respondents can demonstrate the absence
of both 

de jure

 and 

de facto

 governmental control over export activities.

1. Absence of De Jure Control 



The respondents in this investigation have submitted a number of documents to demonstrate absence of 

de jure 

control, including three enactments indicating that the responsibility for managing enterprises ``owned by all
of the people'' is with the enterprises themselves and not with the government. These are the ``Law of the People's
Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (``1988 Law'');
``Regulations for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved
on August 23, 1992 (``1992 Regulations''); and the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,''
approved on December 21, 1992 (``Export Provisions''). 

The 1988 Law and 1992 Regulations shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The 1988 Law
provides that enterprises owned ``by the whole people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible
for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers, and purchase their own goods and materials. The 1988
Law also has other provisions which support a finding that enterprises have management independence from the government.
The 1992 Regulations provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make
their own production decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits
(Article II); sell their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions
(Article XIII); dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire their employees without government approval
(Article XVII). 

The Export Provisions list those products subject to direct government control. Coumarin is not included in the Export
Provisions list and does not, therefore, appear to be subject to the export constraints of these provisions. 

The existence of these enactments indicates that Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native are not 

de jure 

subject to governmental control. However, there is some evidence that the provisions of the above-cited laws and
regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see ``PRC
Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' in Foreign Broadcast Information Service-China-93-133 (July
14, 1993)). Therefore, the Department has determined that an analysis of 

de facto 

control is critical to determining whether respondents are, in fact, subject to governmental control. 



2. Absence of De Facto Control 



The Department typically considers four factors in evaluating whether each respondent is subject to de facto governmental
control of its export functions: (1) Whether the export prices are set by or subject to the approval of a governmental
authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements; (3) whether
the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management; and (4)
whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding disposition
of profits or financing of losses (see Silicon Carbide and Sebacic Acid). 

Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have each asserted that (1) it establishes its own export prices;
(2) it negotiates contracts without guidance from any governmental entities or organizations; (3) its management
operates with a high degree of autonomy and there is no information on the record that suggests central government
control over selection of management; and (4) it retains the proceeds of its export sales, and has the authority to
sell its assets and to obtain loans. In addition, questionnaire responses indicate that company-specific pricing
during the POI does not suggest any coordination among exporters (

i.e.,

 the prices for comparable products differ among companies). This information supports a preliminary finding that
there is a 

de facto 

absence of governmental control of export functions. 

Consequently, Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have preliminarily met the criteria for the
application of separate rates. We will examine this issue in detail at verification and determine whether the questionnaire
responses are supported by verifiable documentation. 

There are two additional issues relating to governmental control that we will consider further for purposes of our
final determination. First, Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have indicated that the appointments
of their general managers are subject to approval by the local Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureaus (local
Bureaus). Second, each of the responding exporters has reported that they are ``administratively subject to'' the
local Bureaus. While the significance of the involvement of the local Bureaus is unclear, the respondents have reported
that the local bureaus do not control the key functions of the enterprises. However, we will examine at verification
the precise nature of the authority that the local Bureaus exercise over the enterprises. 



Nonmarket Economy Country Status 



The PRC has been treated as a nonmarket economy country (NME) in all past antidumping investigations (see, 

e.g.

, Sebacic Acid and Silicon Carbide). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn
our former determinations. Therefore, in accordance with section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as
an NME for purposes of this investigation.

<DOCNO> FR940804-2-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940804-2-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Where the Department is investigating imports from an NME, section 773(c)(1) of the Act directs us to base FMV on the
NME producers' factors of production, valued in a comparable market economy that is a significant producer of the
merchandise. Section 773(c)(2) of the Act alternatively provides that where available information is inadequate
for using the factors of production methodology, FMV may be based on the export prices for comparable merchandise
from market economy countries at a comparable level of economic development. 

For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have relied on the methodology provided by section 773(c)(1) of
the Act to determine FMV. The sources of individual factor prices are discussed under the FMV section, below. 



Surrogate Country 



Section 773(c)(4) of the Act requires the Department to value the NME producers' factors of production, to the extent
possible, in one or more market economy countries that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that
of the NME country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that
India is the country most comparable to the PRC in terms of overall economic development (see Memorandum from David
Mueller, Director Office of Policy, to Gary Taverman, Director of Division I of Office of Antidumping Investigations,
dated March 10, 1994). In addition, there is evidence on the record that coumarin is produced in India. 



Fair Value Comparisons 



To determine whether sales of coumarin from the PRC to the United States by Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and
Tianjin Native were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value
(FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. 



United States Price 



We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
directly by the Chinese exporters to unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States.


For those exporters that responded to the Department's questionnaire and were found to be eligible for a separate
rate, we calculated purchase price based on packed, FOB foreign-port prices to unrelated purchasers in the United
States. As necessary, we made deductions for foreign inland freight, containerization, loading, port handling
expenses, foreign inland and marine insurance, valued in a surrogate country. We were unable to obtain surrogate
value information for ocean freight, so we valued ocean freight on international shipping rates between the PRC and
U.S. ports, as quoted by a market-economy shipping company. (For a complete analysis of USP deductions, see the Calculation
Memorandum for this investigation). 



Foreign Market Value 



In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, we calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories
in the PRC which produced the subject merchandise for the three exporters. The factors used to produce coumarin include
materials, labor, and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate
values from India and Indonesia for the different inputs. We made adjustments to materials costs for the recovery
of by-products, where applicable. In determining which surrogate value to use for valuing each factor of production,
we selected, where possible, from publicly available, published information (public information). For a complete
analysis of surrogate values, see the Calculation Memorandum for this investigation. 

We used surrogate transportation rates to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the
coumarin factories, and between factories and exporters/ports. In those cases where a respondent failed to provide
any information on transportation distances, we applied, as best information available, the farthest distance
reported for the input in the public version of questionnaire responses. 

To value certain raw materials, we used public information from Chemical Business of India for July-October
1993, and India Chemical Weekly for July-November 1993. For raw materials not listed in Chemical Business of
India, or India Chemical Weekly, we used the Monthly Trade Statistics of Foreign Trade of India, Volume II_Imports
(Indian Import Statistics) for April 1992-March 1993. We adjusted the factor values to the POI using wholesale
price indices published in International Financial Statistics (

IFS

) by the International Monetary Fund. For materials sourced from market-economy countries and purchased in convertible
currencies, we applied the actual purchase price paid during the POI, or the time period closest to the POI. No product-specific
public information pertaining to India or any other potential surrogate country was available for certain raw materials.
With respect to these raw materials, we have used, privately researched Indian price quotes, Indian import statistics
for categories that include the specific raw materials (

i.e.

, ``basket'' categories), or Indonesian import statistics. (For a complete analysis of raw material valuations,
see the Calculation Memorandum for this investigation).

<DOCNO> FR940804-2-00010 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940804-2-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To value electricity, we used public information from the Electric Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region
(January 1993) published by the Asian Development Bank. We selected this source because it provides an electricity
rate for industrial use during the POI from India, our preferred surrogate country. To value water, we have used public
information for India from the Water Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region (November 1993) which is
also published by the Asian Development Bank. To value coal, we used Indian Import Statistics. We adjusted the factor
values to the POI using wholesale price indices published in the IFS.

To value hourly labor rates in India, we used the International Labor Office's 1993 Yearbook of Labor Statistics and
Country Reports: Human Rights Practices for 1990.

To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages based on relevant data from The Reserve Bank of India Bulletin
(RBI), December 1993. We based our overhead percentage calculations on the RBI summary income statement data applicable
to the chemical manufacturing industry, and adjusted to reflect an energy-exclusive overhead percentage. For selling,
general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, we calculated percentages based on the RBI summary income statement
data. We used the calculated SG&A percentages because they were greater than the ten percent statutory minimum.
For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of materials, labor, factory overhead, and SG&A expenses,
because the RBI percentage was less than eight percent. We added packing based on Indian values obtained from Indian
Import Statistics.



Best Information Available (BIA)



Because information has not been presented to the Department to prove otherwise, any PRC company that did not respond
fully to the Department's questionnaires or otherwise did not participate in this investigation, are assumed to
be under government control, and, therefore, are not entitled to separate dumping margins. In the absence of responses
from those companies that did not fully respond to the Department's questionnaire, and other PRC exporters during
the POI, we are basing the All Other rate on BIA, pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act (see Silicon Carbide). In determining
what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower
margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and more adverse margins for those respondents
which did not cooperate in an investigation. When a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form
required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department
to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated
rate of any respondent in the investigation (see Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled
Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel
Plate From Belgium (58 FR 37083, July 9, 1993). In this investigation, since some PRC exporters failed to respond to
our questionnaire, we are assigning to them the highest margin based on information submitted in the petition (see
Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Coumarin from the People's Republic of China, 59 FR 3841, January
27, 1994). This rate applies to all exporters other than those responding exporters that are receiving separate rates.



Critical Circumstances



Petitioners allege that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of coumarin from the PRC. Section
733(e)(1) of the Act provides that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist
if:

(A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or

(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of investigation at less than its fair value, and 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940804-2-00011 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940804-2-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period. 

Regarding criterion (A) above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more (in purchase price situations)
as sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping (see Silicon Carbide). Since the preliminary estimated dumping margins
for exporters of coumarin in the PRC are in excess of 25 percent, we can impute knowledge of dumping to the importers
of the subject merchandise. 

Regarding criterion (B) above, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(f), we generally consider the following factors in determining
whether imports have been massive over a short period of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal
trends (if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports. If imports during
the period immediately following the petition increase by 15 percent over imports during a comparable period immediately
preceding the filing of a petition, we consider them massive pursuant to section 353.16(f)(2) of the Department's
regulations. Three respondents have responded to the Department's request for the quantity and value of monthly
exports to the U.S. To determine whether there have been massive imports of coumarin from the PRC, we compared each
respondent's volume of shipments for the period following the petition (January through June 1994) to the period
immediately preceding the petition (July through December 1993). Based on an analysis of these export data, we find
that imports from Tianjin Chemical and Tianjin Native have been massive, while imports from Jiangsu Native have not
been massive. 

With respect to share of domestic consumption, the information available to us at this time does not allow us to evaluate
whether the increase in absolute volume of coumarin shipments can be accounted for by a change in domestic consumption.


For Tianjin Chemical and Tianjin Native, because the preliminary dumping margins are sufficient to impute knowledge
of dumping, and because we have found that imports of coumarin have been massive, we preliminarily determine that
critical circumstances do exist for these two exporters. 

With respect to Jiangsu Native, because we have found that imports of coumarin have not been massive, we preliminarily
determine that critical circumstances do not exist for this exporter. 

As regards the firms covered by the ``All Others'' rate, we have used BIA as the basis for determining whether critical
circumstances exist for non-respondent exporters. The BIA margin exceeds the 25 percent threshold for imputing
a knowledge of dumping to the importers of the merchandise. In addition, we have adversely assumed, as BIA, a massive
increase in imports from these non-respondent exporters. We, therefore, determine that critical circumstances
also exist for these exporters.

Period of Investigation 



The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993. 



Case History 



Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 27, 1994), the following events have occurred.


On February 11, 1994, the U.S. Embassy in Brazil provided the Department with volume and value statistics for Brazilian
SSB producing firms. On February 14, 1994, Instituto Brasileiro de Siderugica, the association for the iron and steel
industry in Brazil, submitted volume and value data on behalf of its members. 

Also on February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 

On February 28, 1994, the Department sent its antidumping questionnaire to Acos Villares, S.A. (Villares). This
company accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the
POI, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b). On March 1, 1994, the Department received a letter from Villares stating
that it would not participate in this investigation. No questionnaire responses were submitted. 

On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes
one class or kind of merchandise. (

See

 May 11, 1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) 

On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination
until July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c) and (d). 



Best Information Available 



Because Villares failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we based our determination on BIA pursuant
to section 776(c) of the Act. 

As BIA, we are assigning 19.43 percent, the highest margin among the margins alleged in the petition, in accordance
with the two-tiered BIA methodology under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon a respondent who
refuses to cooperate or otherwise significantly impedes the proceeding, and as outlined in the Antifriction Bearings
(Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping
Duty Administrative Review (56 FR 31692, 31704, July 11, 1991). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has
been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit (

see Allied Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 94-1112 (June 30, 1994); and 

Allied Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States, 

996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993); 

see also Krupp Stahl, AG et al. 

v. 

United States, 

822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)). 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) (19 U.S.C. 1673b(d)(1)) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service
to suspend liquidation of all entries of SSB from Brazil, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this
notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this
notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which
the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price as shown below. The suspension
of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. 



 


ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry, before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination. 



Public Comment 



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments must be submitted, in at least ten copies, to
the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than November 8, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than
November 15, 1994. In addition, a public version and five copies should be submitted by the appropriate date if the
submission contains business proprietary information. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public
hearing, if requested, to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal
briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be held, if requested, at 3:00 p.m. on November 17, 1994, at the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Room 1414, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington DC, 20230. Parties should confirm by
telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before the scheduled time. 

Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099 within ten days of the date of publication of this notice.
Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address and telephone number; (2) the number of participants; and
(3) a list of issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral presentation will be limited to arguments
raised in the briefs. 

This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(f)) and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

Period of Investigation 



The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993. 



Case History 



Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 27, 1994), the following events have occurred.


On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 

On February 25, 1994 we named Grand Foundry, Limited (Grand Foundry) and Mukand, Limited (Mukand) as respondents
in this investigation, and on February 28, 1994, we issued antidumping questionnaires to these companies. These
companies accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the
POI. 

On February 26, 1994, Isibars, Limited (Isibars), an Indian producer/exporter of subject merchandise which was
not selected as a mandatory respondent, requested that it be allowed to participate in the investigation as a voluntary
respondent. On March 9, 1994, we sent Isibars a brief questionnaire requesting sales volume and value data and noted
that based upon Isibars response we would determine if it was appropriate to issue a complete questionnaire to the
company. On March 14, 1994, Isibars submitted its response to this questionnaire. Subsequently, on March 15, the
Department issued Isibars a questionnaire, noting its policy with respect to voluntary respondents. On March 28,
1994, Isibars requested via facsimile a 30-day extension in order to respond to the Department's questionnaire.
On March 28, 1994, we granted Isibars a partial extension contingent upon receipt of an officially filed extension
request. However, because Isibars never submitted such an extension request or a response to any section of our questionnaire,
we never deemed it to be a mandatory respondent. 

On March 4, 1994, Akai Impex Ltd. (Akai), another Indian producer/exporter of subject merchandise, requested that
it be allowed to participate in the investigation. Subsequently, on March 7, 1994, we sent Akai a brief questionnaire
requesting sales volume and value data and noted that based upon Akai's response we would determine if it was appropriate
to issue it a questionnaire. Akai's response to this questionnaire was received on March 14, 1994. Our examination
of this response revealed that Akai had not made sales of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI,
and on this basis, we denied its request for voluntary respondent status on March 17, 1994. 

On March 23, 1994, we received a response to Section A of the Department's questionnaire from Grand Foundry. In that
response, respondent reported that it made no sales of export-quality merchandise in the home market during the POI.
On April 4, 1994, we received petitioners' comments on Grand Foundry's Section A response. On April 5, 1994, the Department
determined that Grand Foundry's third country sales to Germany were the appropriate basis for foreign market value
(FMV), pursuant to 19 C.F.R. 353.49. 

On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we received rebuttal comments
on this issue. On May 11, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes one class or kind of merchandise. (See May 11, 1994,
Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) 

On April 22, 1994, we received a response to Sections B and C of the Department's questionnaire from Grand Foundry.
On May 4, 1994, we received petitioners' comments regarding Grand Foundry's responses to Sections B and C. On May 10,
1994, we issued a supplemental questionnaire to Grand Foundry. Grand Foundry submitted its supplemental response
on June 20, 1994. Mukand never responded to any section of our antidumping questionnaire. 

On April 26, 1994 the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination until
July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 C.F.R. 353.15(c) and (d). 

On May 25, 1994, petitioners alleged that Grand Foundry sold the subject merchandise in Germany at prices below its
cost of production (COP). Respondent rebutted the allegation on June 2, 1994. Petitioners supplemented their original
allegation on June 7, 1994. On June 15, 1994, we determined that petitioners' allegation provided a reasonable basis
to believe or suspect below cost sales, pursuant to section 353.51(a) of the Department's regulations. Accordingly,
we initiated a sales below cost investigation for Grand Foundry on June 15, 1994, and subsequently issued Section
D of the Department's questionnaire on June 16. On July 8, 1994, Grand Foundry requested an extension of time until
August 1, 1994, to respond to Section D of the questionnaire. The Department granted such an extension on July 12, 1994.


Also on July 12, Grand Foundry requested that the Department postpone the final determination until 135 days after
the date of publication of the Department's preliminary determination, if that determination is affirmative. 



Best Information Available 



In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, we have determined that the use of best information available (BIA) is
appropriate for Mukand. Mukand did not respond to the Department's questionnaire issued on February 28, 1994. Because
Mukand failed to answer the Department's questionnaire, we find it has not cooperated in this investigation.

As BIA, we are assigning the highest margin among the margins alleged in the petition, in accordance with the two-tiered
BIA methodology under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon a respondent who refuses to cooperate
or otherwise significantly impedes the proceeding, and as outlined in the Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered
Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review (56 FR 31692, 31704, July 11, 1991). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (

see Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 94-1112 (June 30, 1994); and 

Allied Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States,

see also Krupp Stahl, AG et al. 

v. 

United States, 

822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)). 



Such or Similar Comparisons 



We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar
merchandise. We made fair value comparisons on this basis. In accordance with the Department's standard methodology,
we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the third country
market to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix
V to the antidumping questionnaire, on file in Room B-099 of the main building of the Department. 

We altered the order of the SSB grades specified within the grade criterion of Appendix V to account for certain other
SSB grades which respondent sold in the third country market during the POI, but which were not taken into account in
Appendix V. 

We also reversed the order of the size and shape criteria in Appendix V. In our original questionnaire issued on February
28, 1994, the fifth and sixth matching criteria were shape and size, respectively. However, based on the advice of
our in-house technical expert, we reversed the order of these two criteria. Subsequently, Acciaierie Valbruna (Valbruna),
a respondent in the concurrent antidumping investigation of SSB from Italy requested that the Department reconsider
the reversal of these criteria in Appendix V. Specifically, Valbruna argued that the distinguishing factor of SSBs
as compared to all other stainless steel products is that they can be supplied in a variety of shapes and that the COP
and price of SSBs are influenced significantly more by shape than size. In light of the arguments raised by Valbruna,
we reversed the hierarchy of these criteria to reflect the order in our original Appendix V. Although the issue was
not raised by any interested party in the instant investigation, we reversed the order of these criteria to ensure
consistent treatment of respondents in performing product comparisons across all concurrent SSB investigations.




Fair Value Comparisons 



As discussed above, we are using BIA with regard to Mukand and thus did not make fair value comparisons with regard to
this company. For the remaining company, Grand Foundry, we made fair value comparisons as discussed below. 

To determine whether sales of SSB from Grand Foundry to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared
the United States price (``USP'') to the FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value''
sections of this notice. In accordance with 19 C.F.R. 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade, where
possible. 



United States Price 



We based USP on purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise
was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States before importation and because exporter's sales price methodology
was not otherwise indicated. 

We calculated PP based on packed CNF prices to unrelated customers. In accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the
Act, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign brokerage (including containerization, foreign inland
freight and port charges) and ocean freight. 



Foreign Market Value 



In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SSB in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of SSB to the volume of third country sales of SSB in accordance with
section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that Grand Foundry had a viable home market
with respect to sales of SSB during the POI. However, based on Grand Foundry's claim that its home market sales made
during the POI consisted only of SSB scrap and rejects and that its U.S. sales during the same period consisted only
of first (or export) quality SSB, we determined that third country sales would be a more appropriate basis for FMV.
(See April 5, 1994 Decision Memorandum To Richard W. Moreland From The Team Re: Appropriate Basis for FMV.) 

In order to select the appropriate third country in this case, we examined three factors in accordance with 19 C.F.R.
353.49(b): (1) The degree of similarity in terms of physical characteristics between the products sold in the United
States and the individual third country markets; (2) the volume of sales in each third country market relative to that
in the United States; and (3) the similarity of the market organization and development between the U.S. market and
third country market. Based on these factors, we selected sales to Germany as the appropriate basis on which to calculate
FMV.

<DOCNO> FR940804-2-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940804-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.46, we calculated FMV based on CIF or CNF prices charged to unrelated customers in Germany.


In light of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v. 

United States,

 13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to
its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we will adjust for those expenses under the
circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a) and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2),
as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from FMV under
the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market foreign brokerage
(including containerization, foreign inland freight, loading and port fees), ocean freight, and marine insurance.


Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made further circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences
in credit expenses, and bank charges (including bank interest, courier charges and commissions) between the U.S.
and third country markets. We recalculated credit expenses to reflect the revised short-term interest rate reported
by respondent. We deducted third country commissions and added U.S. indirect selling expenses capped by the amount
of third country commissions. 

We also deducted third country packing and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.
We made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, in
accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. 



Cost of Production 



Based on petitioner's allegation, and in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, the Department initiated an investigation
to determine whether Grand Foundry made third country sales of subject merchandise at prices below its COP, and over
an extended period of time. Although Grand Foundry's COP questionnaire response will be received too late for consideration
for the preliminary determination, it will be verified and considered for the final determination. 



Currency Conversion 



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. See 19 CFR 353.60(a). 



Verification 



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination. 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of SSB from India, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or
withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping
margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The estimated
preliminary dumping margins are as follows:

ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination. 



Postponement of Final Determination 



Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on July 12, 1994, Grand Foundry, a significant producer of the subject
merchandise, requested that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation, the
Department postpone its final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of an affirmative preliminary
determination. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), because our preliminary determination is affirmative, and no compelling
reasons for denial exist, we are postponing the final determination until the 135th day after the date of publication
of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. 



Public Comment 



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than November 8, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than November

Period of Investigation 



The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993. 



Case History 



Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 26, 1994), the following events have occurred.


On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 

On February 28, 1994, we named Acciaierie Valbruna S.r.l. (Valbruna) and Foroni S.p.A. (Foroni) as respondents in
this investigation and issued antidumping questionnaires to both companies. These companies accounted for at least
60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b).
We presented the questionnaire to Valbruna at its facility in Vicenza, Italy, on March 3, 1994, and to Foroni at its
facility in Gorle Minore, Italy, on March 7, 1994. 

We received responses to Section A of the Department's questionnaire on March 21, 1994, from Foroni and on March 22,
1994 from Valbruna. 

On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we received rebuttal comments
on this issue. On May 11, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes one class or kind of merchandise. (See May 11, 1994,
Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) 

On March 31, 1994, we sent Sections A through D of the Department's questionnaire to Cogne S.p.A. (Cogne) because it
requested that it be included in the investigation as a voluntary respondent. On April 14, 1994, Cogne notified the
Department that it had decided not to participate as a voluntary respondent in the investigation. 

On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination
until July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c) and (d). 

On April 29 and May 2, 1994, we received responses to Sections B and C of the Department's questionnaire from Foroni
and Valbruna, respectively. 

On May 18, 1994, petitioners alleged that Valbruna sold the subject merchandise in Italy at prices below its cost of
production (COP). Petitioners supplemented their original allegation on June 3, 13, and 22, 1994. Respondent rebutted
the allegation on May 24, June 9, 15, 27, and 28, 1994. On June 24, 1994, we determined that petitioners' allegation
provided a reasonable basis to believe or suspect below cost sales, pursuant to section 353.51(a) of the Department's
regulations. Accordingly, we initiated a sales below cost investigation for Valbruna on June 24, and issued Section
D of the Department's questionnaire on the same date. 

On May 20, 1994, we issued a supplemental questionnaire to both respondents. Valbruna submitted its supplemental
response on June 6, 1994, and Foroni on June 8, 1994. 

On July 19, 1994, Valbruna requested an extension of time until August 5, 1994, to respond to the Section D questionnaire.
The Department granted such an extension on July 20, 1994. 

Also, on July 20, 1994, respondent Valbruna requested that, in the event of an affirmative determination in this investigation,
the Department postpone the final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination
in the 

Federal Register

. 



Such or Similar Comparisons 



We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar
merchandise. We made fair value comparisons on this basis. In accordance with the Department's standard methodology,
we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market to
compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to
the antidumping questionnaire, on file in Room B-099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce.

We altered the order of the SSB grades specified within the grade criterion of Appendix V to account for certain other
SSB grades which Foroni sold during the POI, but which were not taken into account in Appendix V. 
 We also reversed the order of the size and shape criteria in Appendix V. In our original questionnaire issued on February
28, 1994, the fifth and sixth matching criteria were shape and size, respectively. However, based on the advice of
our in-house technical expert, we reversed the order of these two criteria. Subsequently, Valbruna requested that
the Department reconsider the reversal of these criteria in Appendix V. Specifically, it argued that the distinguishing
factor of SSBs as compared to all other stainless steel products is that they can be supplied in a variety of shapes and
that the COP and price of SSBs are influenced significantly more by shape than size. In light of the arguments raised
by Valbruna, we reversed the hierarchy of these criteria to reflect the order in our original Appendix V. 


Fair Value Comparisons 


To determine whether sales of SSB from Italy to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United
States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade,
where possible. 


United States Price 


Foroni 


All of Foroni's U.S. sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United States. Therefore,
we based USP on exporter's sales prices (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. In accordance with section
772(d) of the Act, we calculated ESP based on FOB warehouse and FOB port prices to unrelated customers in the United
States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign brokerage, ocean freight (including foreign inland
freight and loading/unloading charges), U.S. brokerage and handling, U.S. inland freight, U.S. import duties,
and export taxes. For those sales of subject merchandise with FOB U.S. port sales terms, we made no deduction for the
U.S. inland freight charges reported in respondent's U.S. sales listing. 
We also deducted credit expenses, warranty expenses, product liability premiums, quality control expenses, and
commissions paid to an employee, in accordance with section 772(e)(2) of the Act. We also deducted U.S. indirect selling
expenses, including pre-sale warehousing costs incurred in the United States, advertising, and inventory carrying
costs. 
We did not make an adjustment for payroll taxes reported by Foroni for the preliminary determination because Foroni
did not provide sufficient explanation as to how these expenses should be treated. We will review these expenses at
verification and reconsider the issue for the final determination. In addition, we made no adjustment for U.S. packing
expenses because Foroni claims that it does not pack the subject merchandise and, therefore, did not report this expense.



Valbruna 


For Valbruna, we based USP on both ESP and purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772 of the Act, because Valbruna
made sales both before and after importation into the United States. We calculated both PP and ESP based on packed prices
to unrelated customers. In accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act, for both PP and ESP sales we made deductions,
where appropriate, for ocean freight (including foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, marine insurance
and foreign brokerage and handling), U.S. import duties, U.S. merchandise processing and harbor maintenance fees,
U.S. inland freight, U.S. brokerage and handling, and containerization expenses (including drayage, stripping,
and storage expenses). We added freight income (

i.e.,

 freight charges paid by the customer but not included in the gross price) to both ESP and PP sales. 
For ESP sales only, we further deducted credit expenses and warranty expenses, in accordance with section 772(e)(2)
of the Act. We also deducted indirect selling expenses incurred in Italy on sales to the United States, as well as indirect
selling expenses incurred in the United States, and inventory carrying costs. We recalculated indirect selling
expenses incurred in the United States to reflect respondent's reported methodology. 
We also made an adjustment to USP for the value-added tax (VAT) paid on the comparison sales in Italy in accordance with
our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in 

Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. 

v.

 United States,

 Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT October 7, 1993). (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Calcium Aluminate
Cement, Cement Clinker and Flux from France, 59 FR 14136, March 25, 1994). 


Foreign Market Value 


In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SSB in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of SSB to the volume of third country sales of SSB in accordance with
section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that both respondents had viable home markets
with respect to sales of SSB during the POI. 


Foroni 


We calculated FMV based on ex-factory prices charged to unrelated customers in the home market. 
Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we deducted credit expenses and quality control expenses. We also deducted home
market indirect selling expenses capped by the sum of U.S. commissions and indirect selling expenses (including
inventory carrying costs), in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b). 
We made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, in
accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940804-2-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940804-2-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We did not make an adjustment for VAT for Foroni based on its claim that it and its home market customers qualify for exemptions
under the Italian VAT program. 
We also made no adjustment for home market packing expenses because Foroni claims that it does not pack the subject
merchandise and, therefore, did not report this expense. 


Valbruna 


We calculated FMV based on packed prices charged to related and unrelated customers in the home market. For purposes
of the preliminary determination, we included arm's-length sales to related customers, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.45.

We deducted cash discounts. We added freight income (i.e., freight charges paid by the customer but not included in
the gross price) to both ESP and PP sales. 
In light of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

V. 

United States

, 13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to
its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we will adjust for those expenses under the
circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a) and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2),
as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from FMV under
the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market inland freight (including
inland insurance). We adjusted for pre-sale warehousing charges associated with pre-sale movement charges in the
ESP offset. 
For comparison to ESP sales, we also deducted credit expenses and home market commissions from FMV. We then deducted
home market indirect selling expenses capped by the sum of U.S. indirect selling expenses and inventory carrying
costs. 
For comparison to PP sales, we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for differences in credit expenses and warranty
expenses, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). We also deducted home market commissions from FMV and added to FMV the U.S.
indirect selling expenses capped by the amount of home market commissions. 
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we considered pre-sale warehousing expenses to be indirect selling
expenses because respondent has not adequately demonstrated that such expenses are directly attributable to particular
sales of the subject merchandise. 
We also did not allow Valbruna's claim of imputed VAT expenses. While there may be an opportunity cost or income associated
with the payment of VAT, that fact alone is not a sufficient basis for the Department to make an adjustment. (See Final
Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfur Dyes, Including Sulfur Vat Dyes, from the United Kingdom, 58
FR 3253, January 8, 1993.) 
For both ESP and PP sales, we deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section
773(a)(1) of the Act. 
We made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, in
accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. 
We adjusted for VAT in accordance with our practice. (See the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above.)



Cost of Production 


Petitioners alleged that Valbruna made home market sales of subject merchandise at prices below its COP. Based on
petitioners' allegation, and in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we initiated a COP investigation to determine
whether Valbruna made home market sales at prices below its COP over an extended period of time. Although Valbruna's
COP questionnaire response will be received too late to be considered for the preliminary determination, it will
be verified and considered for the final determination.

Currency Conversion 



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. See 19 CFR 353.60(a). 



Verification 



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination. 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of SSB from Italy, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or
withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping
margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average
dumping margins are as follows: 



 


ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry, before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination. 



Postponement of Final Determination 



Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on July 20, 1994, respondent Valbruna, a significant producer of the
subject merchandise, requested that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation,
the Department postpone its final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of an affirmative preliminary
determination. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), because our preliminary 
determination is affirmative, and no compelling reasons for denial exist, we are postponing the final determination
until the 135th day after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. 



Public Comment 



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than November 9, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than November
16, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to give interested parties
an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be held on
November 18, 1994 at 9:30 a.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, room 1414, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue,
NW., Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before
the scheduled time. 

Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice

Period of Investigation 


The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993. 


Case History 


Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 27, 1994), the following events have occurred.

On February 4, 1994, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo provided the Department with the names of the firms producing SSB in Japan.
To supplement this data, on February 7, 1994, counsel for respondents submitted volume and value statistics for eight
Japanese companies. 
On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 
On February 28, 1994, the Department sent its antidumping questionnaire to Aichi Steel Works, Ltd. (Aichi), Daido
Steel Co., Ltd. (Daido), and Sanyo Special Steel Co., Ltd. (Sanyo). These firms accounted for at least 60 percent of
the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b). On
March 7, 1994, the Department met with company officials from Aichi, Daido and Sanyo at the Japanese Ministry of International
Trade and Industry in Tokyo. At this meeting each of the three named respondent companies stated that they did not intend
to participate in our investigation. No questionnaire responses were submitted. 
On March 11, 1994, the Department received a request from an additional Japanese producer of SSB, Abe Bright Shaft
Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Abe Bright), to be a voluntary respondent in this investigation. On March 11, 1994, we sent
a questionnaire to Abe Bright. On April 4, 1994, Abe Bright submitted a letter withdrawing its request to participate
as a voluntary respondent in this investigation. 
On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes
one class or kind of merchandise. (

See

 May 11, 1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) 
On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination
until July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15 (c) and (d). 


Best Information Available 


Because the three named respondents failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we based our determination
on BIA pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act. 
As BIA, we are assigning 61.47 percent, the highest margin among the margins alleged in the petition, in accordance
with the two-tiered BIA methodology under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon a respondent who
refuses to cooperate or otherwise significantly impedes the proceeding, and as outlined in the Antifriction Bearings
(Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping
Duty Administrative Review (56 Fr 31692, 31704, July 11, 1991). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has
been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (see 

Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 94-1112 (June 30, 1994); and 

Allied Signal Aerospace Co.

 v. 

United States,

 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993); see also 

Krupp Stahl AG, et al.

 v. 

United States,

 822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)). 


Suspension of Liquidation 


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) (19 U.S.C. 1673b(d)(1)) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service
to suspend liquidation of all entries of SSB from Japan, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this
notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this
notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which
the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price as shown below. The suspension
of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.

ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry, before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination. 


Public Comment 


In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments must be submitted, in at least ten copies, to
the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than November 8, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than
November 15, 1994. In addition, a public version and five copies should be submitted by the appropriate date if the
submission contains business proprietary information. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public
hearing, if requested, to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal
briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be held, if requested, at 2:00 p.m. on November 17, 1994, at the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Room 1414, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington DC 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone
the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before the scheduled time. 
Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099 within ten days of the date of publication of this notice.

(3) a list of issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral presentation will be limited to arguments
raised in the briefs. 
This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(f)) and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

Period of Investigation 



The (POI) is July 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993. 



Case History 



Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 26, 1994), the following events have occurred.


On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 

On February 25, 1994, we named Roldan, S.A. (Roldan) and Acenor, S.A. (Acenor) as respondents in this investigation
and on February 28, 1994, issued antidumping questionnaires to both companies. These companies represent 100 percent
of U.S. imports of subject merchandise from Spain during the POI. We presented the questionnaire to Roldan at its facility
in Madrid, Spain on March 7, 1994, and to Acenor at its facility in Bilbao, Spain on March 10, 1994. 

We received Roldan's response to Section A of the Department's questionnaire on March 28, 1994. We received Roldan's
responses to Sections B and C of the Department's questionnaire on April 21, 1994. We received Acenor's responses
to Sections A, B, and C of the Department's questionnaire on May 18, 1994. 

On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation of such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we received rebuttal comments
on this issue. On May 11, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes one class or kind of merchandise. (See May 11, 1994,
Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) 

On May 27, 1994, the Department rescinded the COP investigations against Roldan and Acenor that were initiated on
January 19, 1994, because the Department had reason to believe that petitioners did not base their cost allegations
on information reasonably available to them. (See May 27, 1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from David
L. Binder Re: Rescinding the COP investigations for Acenor and Roldan.) 
On June 13, 1994, the Department re-initiated COP investigations against Roldan and Acenor based on the allegations
submitted by petitioners on May 9, 1994, and May 24, 1994, pursuant to section 19 CFR 353.51(a) (1994). (See June 13,
1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford from Richard Moreland Re: Petitioners' Allegations of Sales Below
the Cost of Production for Roldan and Acenor.) We received Roldan's and Acenor's responses, to Section D of the Department's
questionnaire on June 23, and June 27, 1994, respectively. 

On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination
until 
July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, in accordance with sections 19 CFR 353.15 (c) and (d).

<PARENT> FR940804-2-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

On July 13, 1994, the Department issued to each respondent a supplementary questionnaire regarding Section D of the
Department's original questionnaire. The due dates for Acenor's and Roldan's supplementary responses have been
extended until August 3 and August 4, 1994, respectively. Consequently, this information will be received too late
for purposes of the preliminary determination, but will be analyzed, verified, and considered for the final determination.


On July 26, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), respondents requested that the Department postpone the final determination
until 135 days after the date of publication of the Department's preliminary determination, if that determination
is affirmative. 



Such or Similar Comparisons 



We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar
merchandise. We made fair value comparisons on this basis. In accordance with the Department's standard methodology,
we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market to
compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to
the antidumping questionnaire, on file in Room B-099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce. 

We altered the order of the SSB grades specified within the grade criterion of Appendix V to account for certain other
SSB grades which Roldan sold during the POI, but which were not taken into account in Appendix V. 

We also reversed the order of the size and shape criteria in Appendix V. In our original questionnaire issued on February
28, 1994, the fifth and sixth matching criteria were shape and size, respectively. However, based on the advice of
our in-house technical expert, we reversed the order of these two criteria. Subsequently, Acciaierie Valbruna (Valbruna),
a respondent in the concurrent antidumping investigation of SSB from Italy, requested that the Department reconsider
the reversal of these criteria in Appendix V. Specifically, it argued that the distinguishing factor of SSBs as compared
to all other stainless steel products is that they can be supplied in a variety of shapes and that the COP and price of
SSBs are influenced significantly more by shape than size. In light of the arguments raised by Valbruna, we reversed
the hierarchy of these criteria to reflect the order in our original Appendix V. Although the issue was not raised by
any interested party in the instant investigation, we reversed the order of these criteria to ensure consistent treatment
of respondents in performing product comparisons across all concurrent SSB investigations. 



Related Party Sales 



On April 21, 1994, Roldan reported sales made to both related and unrelated distributors, and unrelated end users
in the home market. We compared related party prices to unrelated party prices using the test set forth in Appendix
II to Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value; Certain Cold-rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Argentina,
58 FR 37062 (July 9, 1994), and determined that the sales made to related parties were not at arm's length. We subsequently
requested that Roldan and Acenor report all sales made by their related parties to the first unrelated customer in
the home market. These sales, reported on June 29, and July 1, for Acenor and Roldan, respectively, were submitted
too late to be properly analyzed for use in the preliminary determination. 

On June 13, 1994, Roldan submitted a revised home market sales listing including Roldan's sales to both related and
unrelated parties. However, for the preliminary determination we did not use portions of the revised sales listing
containing related party sales because we found certain discrepancies between the related party sales data contained
in respondent's original and revised responses. However, we intend to clarify these discrepancies prior to verification
and consider respondent's revised related party sales listing for the final determination based on verification
findings. Therefore, for purposes of the preliminary determination, we only used the portion of Roldan's sales listing
pertaining to sales made directly to unrelated parties in our analysis. 

For Acenor, we compared prices to a related party with prices to unrelated parties using the test referenced above
and determined that the sales made to the related party were not at arm's length. Accordingly, we used only sales made
directly to unrelated parties reported in Acenor's June 29, 1994, sales listing. 



Fair Value Comparisons 



To determine whether sales of SSB from Spain to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United
States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade,
where possible. 



United States Price 



For both Roldan and Acenor, we based USP on purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because
the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States before importation and exporter's
sales price methodology was not otherwise indicated. 

We made an adjustment to USP for the value-added tax (VAT) paid on the comparison sales in Spain, in accordance with
our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in 

Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993). (See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Calcium Aluminate
Cement, Cement Clinker and Flux from France, 59 FR 14136, March 25, 1994). 

We re-calculated the VAT for both Roldan and Acenor because the methodology they employed in reporting the VAT was
not clearly defined. The VAT will be examined at verification and re-analyzed for the final determination. 



Roldan 



We calculated PP based on CIF delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where
appropriate, for foreign brokerage and handling, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S.
brokerage and handling (including insurance), U.S. inland freight and U.S. import duties. 

We made no adjustment for freight charge differentials claimed by Roldan because of the lack of data on the record concerning
the nature of the adjustment claimed. We intend to obtain further information and to verify the reported data. We will
revisit this issue in our final determination based on verification findings. 



Acenor 



We calculated PP based on ex-factory packed prices to unrelated customers. Accordingly, we made no adjustments to
these reported prices. 



Foreign Market Value 



In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SSB in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of SSB to the volume of third country sales of SSB in accordance with
section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that both respondents had viable home markets
with respect to sales of SSB during the POI.

Cost of Production 



Petitioners alleged that Roldan and Acenor were selling in the home market at prices below COP in the petition filed
in this investigation. The Department initiated COP investigations for both respondents on January, 19, 1994. However,
as stated above, the Department rescinded the original COP investigations. After reviewing petitioners' revised
allegations, we re-initiated COP investigations. We requested that respondents reply to Section D of our antidumping
questionnaires issued on February 28, 1994. Roldan and Acenor submitted their responses to Section D of our questionnaire
on June 23, and June 27, 1994, respectively. On July 13, 1994, the Department sent Roldan and Acenor a Section D deficiency
questionnaire. 

In order to determine whether home market prices were below COP within the meaning of section 773(b) of the Act, we calculated
COP based on the sum of the respondents' cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses and home market packing
costs. We compared individual home market prices with the COPs. We tested the home market prices on a product-specific
basis using Roldan's sales to unrelated customers from the database received on June 13, 1994, and Acenor's sales
to unrelated customers from the database received on June 29, 1994. We compared model-specific COP to reported prices
that were net of movement charges. 

Following our standard practice, where we found over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices
above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales because we determined that the respondent's below-cost sales
were not made in substantial quantities. If between ten and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were
at prices above the COP, we discarded only the below-cost sales if made over an extended period of time. Where we found
that more than 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices below the COP and were sold over an
extended period of time, we disregarded all sales for that model and calculated FMV based on constructed value (CV),
in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act. 

If sales below cost occurred in three or more months of the POI, they are considered to be made over an extended period
of time. For sales made in less than three months of the POI, the extended period of time is the number of months in which
the sales occur. (See, 19 U.S.C. 1677b(b)(1)). 

Roldan and Acenor provided no indication that the disregarded sales were at prices that would permit recovery of all
costs within a reasonable period of time and in the normal course of trade. (See, 19 U.S.C. 1677b(b)(2)). 



Constructed Value (CV) 



We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit.
In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act we: (1) Included the greater of respondents' reported
general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM, as appropriate and; (2) for profit, we used the
statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses. 



Roldan 



For purposes of calculating FMV, we used the sales from Roldan to its unrelated customers and CV, as described above.


For price-to-price comparisons, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices, inclusive of packing to unrelated
customers in the home market. 


In light of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

V. 

United States, 

13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir., 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to
its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we adjust for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale
provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a) and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2), as appropriate.
Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from the FMV under the circumstance-of-sale
provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market inland freight (including inland insurance).


For both price-to-price comparisons and comparisons to CV, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate,
for differences in credit expenses, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). We re-calculated home market and U.S. credit
expenses because Roldan reported an average interest rate for a seven-month period, rather than the six-month POI.
In addition, for those sales with missing shipment dates and payment dates, we calculated credit expenses based on
the average payment period for the respondent's sales reported with shipment and payment dates. 

We did not make a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for commissions claimed by Roldan that were paid to its parent company
for export sales services performed by the parent company's commercial department. We also did not adjust for commissions
paid by Roldan to the U.S. subsidiary of its parent company for marketing Roldan's products in the United States. We
consider these payments to be intra-company transfers not tied directly to sales of the subject merchandise. Furthermore,
we have no appropriate benchmark against which to test whether the commission arrangements between Roldan and its
related party commissionaires are at arm's length. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value; Coated
Groundwood Paper from Belgium, Finland, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, 56 FR 56359, November 4, 1992.) 

We also deducted home market packing and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.

For price-to-price comparisons only, we also made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical
characteristics of the merchandise in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. We adjusted for VAT in accordance
with our practice. (

See

 the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above.) 
We made no adjustment for freight charge differentials claimed by Roldan because of the lack of data on the record concerning
the nature of the adjustment claimed. We intend to obtain further information and to verify the reported data. We will
revisit this issue in our final determination based on verification findings. 


Acenor 


For purposes of calculating FMV, we used the sales from Acenor to its unrelated customers and CV, as described above.


For price-to-price comparisons, we calculated FMV based on packed, ex-factory and delivered prices, where applicable.
We made an adjustment for home market inland freight (including inland insurance), where applicable, under the circumstance-of-sale
provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a), as described above. 

For price-to-price comparisons and comparisons to CV, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate,
for differences in credit expenses, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). We re-calculated home market and U.S. credit
expenses because Acenor reported its U.S. imputed credit expense in pesetas and its calculation overstated this
expense because of an error in decimal placement. In addition, for those sales with missing shipment dates and payment
dates, we calculated credit expenses based on the average payment period for the respondent's sales reported with
shipment and payment dates. 

We also deducted home market packing and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.


For price-to-price comparisons only, we also made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical
characteristics of the merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. We adjusted for VAT in accordance
with our practice. (See the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above.) 



Currency Conversion 



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. See 19 CFR 353.60(a). 



Verification 



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination. 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of SSB from Spain, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or
withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping
margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average
dumping margins are as follows:

ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry, before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination. 



Postponement of Final Determination 



Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on July 26, 1994, respondents accounting for all exports to the United
States during the POI requested that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation,
the Department postpone its final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of an affirmative preliminary
determination. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), because our preliminary determination is affirmative, and no compelling
reasons for denial exist, we are postponing the date of the final determination until the 135th day after the date of
publication of this notice in the

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of report; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In May 1994, the Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel (FIRP), which was established by NIST to study issues
and recommend actions which the Federal Government can take to address the short- and long-term issues of interworking
and convergence of networking protocols, issued its final report. An interagency study group composed of nine Federal
government agency staff members, the Panel was appointed at the request of the Office of Management and Budget in collaboration
with the Federal Networking Council and the Federal Information Resources Policy Council.



The Panel concluded that no single networking protocol suite meets the full range of government requirements for
data internetworking. The Panel recommended that Federal government agencies select standards based on their interoperability
needs, existing infrastructure, costs, marketplace products, and status as standards. In addition, the Panel made
other recommendations concerning Federal internetworking as a component of the National Information Infrastructure
(NII).

NIST has proposed changes to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 146-1, Government Open Systems
Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), and FIPS 179, Government Network Management Profile (GNMP), based on the recommendations
of the Panel concerning government use of open voluntary standards for network protocols.

NIST solicits the views of industry, the public, and State and local governments concerning the Panel's recommendations
on long-term issues related to internetworking. The Report of the Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel can
be obtained in any of the following ways:

On June 27, 1994, an application was filed by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game for Modification 4 to Permit 795 (P503A)
for a take of listed species as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the
NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-222).
Permit 795 was issued on July 29, 1992, and subsequently modified three times, as authorized by the ESA. The permit
authorizes scientific research and enhancement activities involving listed Snake River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus
nerka) through December 31, 1997.
For Modification 4 of this permit, IDFG will release approximately 500 more of the progeny of the listed Redfish Lake
1991 sockeye outmigrants (artificially spawned in 1993) into two net pens in Redfish Lake in 1994 only. Modification
3 of this permit authorizes the release of up to 9,000 of these fish in 1994. Also in 1994, IDFG will release approximately
450 more listed sockeye fingerlings (1993 brood progeny of Redfish Lake anadromous sockeye that returned in 1993)
into net pens in Redfish Lake. Modification 3 authorizes the release of up to 1,200 of these fish in 1994. All of the juveniles
will be released from the net pens into Redfish Lake in September-October, 1994.
Also for Modification 4, IDFG will release additional progeny of the adult, listed, Snake River sockeye salmon that
returned to Redfish Lake in 1991. In 1994 only, approximately 4,000 listed, artificially propagated, juveniles
will be released directly into Redfish Lake as presmolts in November-December, 1994 and allowed to overwinter under
natural conditions in the lake. These releases were not considered for Modification 3 because the fish developed
quicker than IDFG anticipated and because the 1991 adults matured and spawned at unusual times. IDFG plans to culture
these fish to reach a target size consistent with the size of the juveniles authorized to be released from the net pens
in Redfish Lake.
Notice is hereby given that on July 27, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification 4
to Permit Number 795 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein.
Issuance of this modification, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such modification: (1) Was applied
for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is/are the subject of this permit;
(3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance
with and is subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits.
The application, permit, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following
offices, by appointment:
Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910-3226 (301-713-2322);
and
Environmental and Technical Services Division, NMFS, NOAA, 911 North East 11th Ave., Room 620, Portland, OR 97232

 Notice. 












</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Douglas Ingoldsby of Nutritech, Inc., has petitioned the Commission for an exemption from the child-resistant packaging
requirements for dietary supplements containing iron, 16 CFR 1700.14(a)(13). The exemption would be for unflavored,
unsweetened powders. The petition contends that child-resistant packaging is not needed for this product because
a child would gag before ingesting a toxic amount. The Commission solicits written comments concerning the petition
from all interested parties.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Commission has docketed correspondence from Douglas Ingoldsby of Nutritech, Inc., as a petition for an exemption
from the child-resistant packaging requirement for certain dietary supplements containing iron that is codified
at 16 CFR 1700(a)(13). That requirement applies to supplements containing ``an equivalent of 250 mg or more of elemental
iron, from any source, in a single package in concentrations of 0.025 percent or more on a weight to volume basis for
liquids and 0.05 percent or more on a weight-to-weight basis for nonliquids * * *.'' Mr. Ingoldsby
requests that the Commission exempt ``an unsweetened, unflavored, bland multi-vitamin, mineral, amino acid powder
that contains no colorings, flavoring agents, [or] sweeteners of any kind and is virtually unpalatable until mixed
with juice.'' Petitioner contends that child-resistant requirements for this product are unnecessary because,
until it is mixed with juice, it is so unpalatable that a child will gag before ingesting a toxic amount. 



The Commission solicits comment on the issues presented by the petition. Comments on the petition should be received
in the Office of the Secretary by October 3, 1994. 

Interested parties may obtain a copy of the petition by writing or calling the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product
Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207; telephone (301) 504-0800. A copy of the petition is available for
inspection from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, in the Commission's Public Reading Room, room 501, 4330

II. The Parties



3. The ``staff'' is the staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an independent regulatory agency of the United
States established pursuant to section 4 of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2053.

4. S&D is a limited partnership created on December 24, 1987, under the laws of the State of New York, with its principal
offices located at 1200 Shames Drive, Westbury, New York. The sole general partner of S&D is Gem Fulfillment Corp.,
1530 McDonald Ave., Brooklyn, New York. The president of Gem Fulfillment Corp. is David Weldler. The limited partners
of S&D are Jerry Williams and Steven Brown. S&D is engaged in the business of importing general merchandise
for resale to other companies.



III. Allegations of the Staff



5. In 1988, S&D imported approximately 698,000 ``Santa Bear'' stuffed toy animals from China. The toys are subject
to, but some failed to comply with, the Commission's Small Parts Regulation, 16 CFR part 1501, in that when tested by
the staff in 1990 under 16 CFR 1500.52, (a) one or more parts of some of the tested toys separated and (b) one or more of
the parts that separated from the tested toys fit completely within the test cylinder, as set forth in 16 CFR 1501.4.
Accordingly, some of the Santa Bears present a ``mechanical hazard'' within the meaning of section 2(s) of the FHSA,
15 U.S.C. 1261(s). 

6. Most of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above were sold to the public by Raffoler, Ltd., a mail order business
that is owned by Jerry Williams and Stephen Brown and is located at the same address as S&D.

7. Some of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above are a ``hazardous substance'' pursuant to section 2(f)(1)(D)
of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(f)(1)(D). Some of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above are also a ``banned hazardous
substance'' pursuant to section 2(q)(1)(A) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C.  1261(q)(1)(A); and 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(9).

8. On November 7, 1990, the staff sent a certified letter to S&D advising the firm that the Santa Bear contains small
parts and is considered to be a banned hazardous substance. Notice was provided that continued sale of the product
is prohibited by section 4 of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263, and is punishable by penalties described in section 5 of the Act,
15 U.S.C.  1264. At this time, S&D had an unsold inventory of approximately 110,000 Santa Bears.

9. On November 15, 1990, S&D attempted to return its inventory of Santa Bears to the import agent from whom S&D
had purchasedthe goods. On November 20, 1990, the import agent advised S&D that it would not accept return of the
Santa Bears.

10. In or around early December 1990, an employee of S&D asked a third party to attempt to find prospective purchasers
of the Santa Bears. The third party found a prospective purchaser and so advised the employee of S&D. The sale of
the Santa Bears was consummated and S&D received proceeds from the sale in the form of credit from the import agent
for goods previously purchased and for goods to be purchased in the future.
 
11. After receipt of the certified letter of November 7, 1990, from the staff, as described in paragraph 8 above, S&D
knowingly caused the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of its remaining inventory
of approximately 110,000 Santa Bears, in violation of section 4(a) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263(a), and for which a civil
penalty may be improved pursuant to section 5(c) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1264(c).



IV. Response of S&D Importing Co.



12. S&D denies the allegations of the staff set forth in paragraphs 5 through 11 above, including the allegations
that it has knowingly caused the introduction into commerce of the aforesaid banned hazardous toys and that it has
violated the FHSA.



V. Agreement of the Parties



13. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has jurisdiction over S&D and the subject matter of this Settlement
Agreement and Order under the following Acts: Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. 2051, 

et seq.,

 and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, 15 U.S.C. 1261, 

et seq.

($175,000). Payment of the civil penalty shall settle fully all claims by the United States Gvernment arising out
of the staff's allegations set forth in paragraphs 5 through 11.
15. The Commission does not make any determination that S&D violated the FHSA. The Commission and S&D agree
that this Settlement Agreement is entered into for the purposes of settlement only.
16. Upon final acceptance of this Settlement Agreement by the Commission and issuance of the Final Order, S&D
knowingly, voluntarily and completely, waives any rights it may have in this matter (1) to an administrative or judicial
hearing, (2) to judicial review or other challenge or contest of the validity of the Commission's actions, (3) to a
determination by the Commission as to whether S&D failed to comply with the FHSA as alleged, and (4) to a statement
of findings of fact and conclusions of law.
17. For purposes of section 6(b) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2055(b), this matter shall be treated as if a compliant had issued;
and, the Commission may publicize the terms of the Settlement Agreement and Order.
18. Upon provisional acceptance of this Settlement Agreement and Order by the Commission, this Settlement Agreement
and Order shall be placed on the public record and shall be published in the 

Federal Register

request not to accept the Settlement Agreement and Order within 15 days, the Settlement Agreement and Order will be
deemed finally accepted on the 16th day after the date it is published in the 

Federal Register

.
19. The parties further agree that the Commission shall issue the attached Order incorporated herein by reference;
and that a violation of the Order shall subject S&D to appropriate legal action.
20. No agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation not contained in this Settlement Agreement
and Order may be used to vary or to contradict its terms.

22. By their signatures set forth below, Raffoler, Ltd., a corporation, and Jerry Williams and Stephen Brown, individually,
agree to serve as guarantors of payment to the Commission of the civil penalty specified in paragraph 14 of this Settlement
Agreement.

<DOCTITLE>Request for Nominations to the Inland Waterways Users Board </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), DOD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 302 of Public Law 99-862 established the inland Waterways Users Board. The Board is an independent Federal
advisory committee. Its eleven members are appointed by the Secretary of the Army. This notice
is to solicit nominations for five appointments or reappointments to two-year terms that will begin January 1, 1995.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The selection, service and appointment of board members are covered by provisions of Section 302 of Public Law 99-662.
The substance of those provisions is as follows: 

Selection. 

Members are to be selected from the spectrum of commercial carriers and shippers using the inland and intracoastal
waterways, to represent geographical regions and to be representative of waterway commerce as determined by commodity
ton-mile statistics. 

Service. 

The Board is required to meet at least semi-annually to develop and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army
on waterways construction and rehabilitation priorities and spending levels for commercial navigation improvements,
and report its recommendations annually to the Secretary and the Congress. 

Appointment. 

The operation of the Board and appointment of its members are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Public
Law 92-463 as amended) and Departmental implementing regulations. Members serve without compensation, but
their expenses due to Board activities are reimbursable.


The considerations specified in Section 302 for the selection of the Board members, and certain terms used therein,
have been interpreted, supplemented, or otherwise clarified as follows: 

Carriers and Shippers. 

The law uses the terms ``primary users and shippers.'' Primary users has been interpreted to mean the providers of
transportation services on inland waterways such as barge or towboat operators. Shippers has been interpreted to
mean the purchasers of such services for the movement of commodities they own or control. Individuals are appointed
to the Board, but the must be either a carrier or a shipper, or represent a firm that is a carrier or shipper. For that purposes
a trade or regional association is neither a shipper or primary user. 

Geographical Representation. 

The law specifies ``various'' regions. For the purpose of selecting Board members, the waterways subjected to fuel
taxes and described in Public Law 95-502, as amended, have been aggregated into six regions. These are: (1) the
Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries above the mouth of the Ohio; (2) the Lower Mississippi River and its tributaries
below the mouth of the Ohio and above Baton Rouge; (3) the Ohio River and its tributaries; (4) the Gulf Intracoastal
Waterway in Louisiana and Texas; (5) the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed
waterways east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed waterways including the Tennessee-Tombigbee, plus the
Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway below Norfolk; and (6) the Columbia-Snake River System and Upper Willamette. The
intent is that each region shall be represented by at least one board member, with that representation determined
by the regional concentration of the individual's traffic on the waterways. 

Commodity Representation. 

Waterway commerce has been aggregated into six commodity categories based on ``inland'' ton-miles shown in 

Waterborne Commerce of the United States. 

In rank order they are: (1) Farm and Food Products; (2) Coal and Coke; (3) Petroleum, Crude and Products; (4) Minerals,
Ores, and Products; (5) Chemicals and Allied Products; and (6) All other. A considerable in the selection of Board
members will be, that the commodities carried or shipped by those individuals or their firms will be reasonably representative
of the above commodity categories. 
Reflecting preceding selection criteria, the present representation by Board members is as follows: 
The five members whose terms expire December 31, 1994, include one shipper representative representing the Upper
Mississippi River region (Region 1) and farm and food products, ethanol and coal; one shipper representative representing
the Lower Mississippi River region (Region 2), and farm and food products; one carrier representative representing
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Louisiana and Texas (Region 4), and petroleum and petroleum products; one carrier
representative representing the Ohio River region (Region 3), and coal and coke, minerals, and metals, petroleum

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i), it intends to issue on a noncompetitive basis a grant to Vanderbilt
University, Nashville, TN, to continue providing academic training and sufficient on-the-job training to interns
to enable them to function as professionals in environmental remediation and waste treatment resulting from the
decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The period of performance for the grant will be three
years. The estimated cost is $833,973. First year funding will be $150,000. 




procurement request no.: 

05-940R22343.000.




project scope: 

Vanderbilt University's May 27, 1994 application is for continuation of effort begun on a previous grant. This internship
program provides six people a year with the proper academic training and sufficient on-the-job training to enable
them to function as professionals in environmental remediation and waste treatment resulting from the decontamination
and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The grant, which supports the Student Assisted Remediation Program
in Environmental Management, plays a major role in meeting the objective of providing young, trained personnel to
enter the fields of environmental remediation and waste treatment. At the end of the first year of academic work, the
students are assigned for three months to a DOE-owned contractor-operated facility or to a DOE prime contractor to
gain first-hand experience in the field. To date, most of the graduating students have chosen to work in the areas for
which they have trained, thereby meeting the primary objective of the program. In view of the nation's environmental
consciousness related to cleanup of Department of Energy facilities, it is clear that the increase in the number of
skilled personnel trained in environmental remediation and waste treatment as a result of the Vanderbilt University
Internship Program will aid in strengthening the Department's position of assuring that contaminated site are properly
decontaminated and decomissioned in an efficient and timely manner. In order to maintain continuity of a long-range
program that began in 1984, eligibility for this award is restricted to Vanderbilt University.

<DOCTITLE>Skykomish River Hydro; Intent to Conduct Environmental Scoping Meetings and Site Visit</DOCTITLE>


July 29, 1994.


The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for a license of the proposed Martin
Creek Hydroelectric Project, Project No. 10942-001. The Martin Creek Hydroelectric Project is located on
Martin Creek, about 7 miles east of Skykomish, Washington, in King County.
The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on this hydroelectric project in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act.
In the EA, we will consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable
alternatives, and will include an economic, financial, and engineering analysis.
The draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration by the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.


Scoping Meetings


Staff will hold two scoping meetings. A scoping meeting oriented towards the public will be held on August 24, 1994
at 6 p.m., at the Skykomish School, 100 Railroad Avenue, Skykomish, Washington. A scoping meeting oriented towards
the agencies will be held on August 25, 1994 at 9:30 a.m., at the Conference Room_Skykomish River Hydro, 1422 130th
Avenue NE., Bellevue, Washington.
Interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend either or both meetings and assist the
staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA.
To help focus discussions at the meetings, a scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed in the EA will
be mailed to agencies and interested individuals on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the scoping document will also
be available at the scoping meeting.


Objectives


At the scoping meetings the FERC staff will: (1) identify preliminary environmental issues related to the proposed
project; (2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (3)
identify reasonable alternatives to be addressed in the EA; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available
information, especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and
the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the
staff's preliminary views.


Procedures


The scoping meetings will be recorded by a court reporter and all statements (oral and written) will become part of
the formal record of the Commission proceedings on the Martin Creek Hydroelectric Project. Individuals presenting
statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record.
Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EA.
Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,
may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meetings. In addition, written scoping comments
may be filed with Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC
20426, until September 30, 1994.
All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Martin Creek Hydroelectric
Project, FERC Project No. 10942-001.
Intervenors_those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties)_are reminded of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document
on each person whose name appears on the official service list. Further, if a party or interceder files comments or
documents with the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular
resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document on that resource agency.


Site Visit


A site visit to the Martin Creek Hydroelectric Project is planned for August 24, 1994. Those who wish to attend should
plan to meet at 10 a.m. at the Skyriver Inn in Skykomish, Washington, and shortly thereafter, leave for the project
site located about 7 miles away. For more details, contact Mr. Lon Covin, Skykomish River Hydro, at (206) 455-0234.
Any questions regarding this notice may be directed to Mr. Carl Keller, Environmental Coordinator at FERC, (202)

NGT states that the proposed abandonment contemplated the agreement by NGT and PNG to enter into a Capacity Lease Agreement
affecting a portion of the facilities to be transferred pursuant to which NGT would continue to provide services to
the City of Winfield, Kansas for the remainder of the term of the then current service agreement between NGT and Winfield.


It is stated that Winfield protested the application and requested a hearing, raising concerns with respect to continuation
of the jurisdictional service to Winfield following the expiration of the Capacity Lease and as to the jurisdictional
status of the arrangement. NGT states that it and PNG have engaged in discussions to resolve Winfield's concerns and
those presented by the Commission staff at the May 19, 1994, technical conference convened in this proceeding. It
is stated that those negotiations have resulted in the agreement in principle of NGT, NorAm and UtiliCorp to amend
the Acquisition Agreement. 

NGT states that the primary purpose of the amendment will be to delete certain facilities from the list of facilities
to be conveyed to UtiliCorp and to delete the Capacity Lease from the arrangement. It is stated that the deleted facilities,
which are more particularly described in the amended application, will be retained by NGT, allowing it to continue
to provide direct transportation service to the City of Winfield, Kansas.

2. Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation



[Docket No. CP94-6-001]



Take notice that on July 21, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), 5400 Westheimer Court,
Houston, Texas 77056-5310, filed in Docket No. CP94-6-001 an amendment (Amendment) to its original
application filed in the captioned proceeding on October 1, 1993, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for
a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the installation of incremental pipeline and compression
facilities necessary for Texas Eastern to render an incremental firm transportation service for CNG Transmission
Corporation (CNG). Texas Eastern states that it filed the Amendment to revise the proposed facilities necessary
to render the service for CNG and to revise the proposed initial rates to be charged for the incremental service for
CNG, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.


Texas Eastern states that the revised initial rate is the result of an increase requested by CNG and agreed to by Texas
Eastern in the quantities on gas to be transported for CNG and the facility changes. 

In the original application, Texas Eastern proposed to construct and operate certain replacement pipeline and compression
facilities to increase its mainline transmission capacity between the existing interconnection with CNG at the
Crayne Farm meter station, in Waynesburg County, Pennsylvania, and the existing interconnection of Texas Eastern's
system with CNG's Line PL-1, near the Chambersburg Compressor Station in Chambersburg County, Pennsylvania.
Texas Eastern proposed to provide an incremental 100,000 Dekatherms per day (Dth/d) of transportation capacity
for CNG. Texas Eastern states that CNG proposed to utilize this capacity to render firm transportation service for
CNG customers served off of CNG's PL-1 Line.






Instead of the facilities additions set forth in Section V of the original application, Texas Eastern requests authorization
to: 

(a) Install, own and operate a 6,500 horsepower compressor addition at Texas Eastern's existing compressor station
at Uniontown, in Greene County, Pennsylvania; 

(b) Construct, install, own and operate 9.71 miles of 36-inch replacement pipeline on Texas-Eastern's Line No. 1
between the existing Uniontown and Bedford Compressor Stations in Fayette County Pennsylvania;
 





(c) Construct, install, own and operate 4.22 miles of 36-inch replacement pipeline on Texas Eastern's Line No. 1 between
the existing Bedford and Chambersburg Compressor Stations in Bedford County, Pennsylvania; and 

(d) Charge an incremental reservation rate of $7.343 per Dth, as a NGA section 7(c) initial rate separately stated
as part of Texas Eastern's Part 284 FT-1 Rate Schedule. 

Texas Eastern submits that the Amendment reflects the increase in firm transportation service to CNG from an MDQ of
100,000 Dth/d to 105,000 Dth/d, and the changed location and quantity of replacement pipeline necessary to provide
the corresponding increase in firm capacity for CNG. Texas Eastern states that CNG has informed it that CNG intends
to notify the Commission in the near future that CNG intends to render 105,000 Dth/d of firm downstream transportation
service for the CNG customers.

Texas Eastern proposes to build the facilities in order to provide the incremental 105,000 Dth/d capacity required
to render such service. The facilities proposed will be ready for service by November 1, 1995. It is estimated that
the total capital costs of the proposed compression and pipeline facilities in 1995 dollars, is $39,899,000. 

For the Part 284 service to be rendered to CNG pursuant to Texas Eastern's existing Rate Schedule FT-1 using the
new capacity contemplated in the application, Texas Eastern proposes to charge CNG, as a NGA section 7 initial charge,
an incremental Reservation Charge separately stated as part of Texas Eastern's Part 284 Rate Schedule FT-1
rates. Based upon the annual cost of the proposed facility additions, Texas Eastern proposes an initial monthly Reservation
Charge of $7.343 per Dth/d for the firm incremental transportation services beginning November 1, 1995.

3. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation


[Docket No. CP94-675-000]
 


Take notice that on July 21, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, S.E.,
Charleston, West Virginia 25314, filed in Docket No. CP94-675-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205
and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization
to: (1) reassign quantities of gas to be delivered at Virginia Natural Gas Company (VNG) delivery points

3

, and (2) construct and operate various appurtenant facilities along Columbia's transmission pipeline system to
accommodate the delivery shifts, under Columbia's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83-76-000
pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 





Columbia proposes to perform the reassignment of deliveries without affecting any of its other customers since Columbia
has sufficient capacity on its existing pipeline system to accomplish the task. The total volumes to be delivered
do not exceed the total volumes authorized prior to the request. However, due to current operational restrictions,
the following appurtenant facility modifications, normally done pursuant to Section 2.55(a) of the General Policy,
must be made to accommodate the reassignment and subsequent station Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO) changes.




_Revamp the Measuring Station No. 802750, located on the discharge side of the Bickers Compressor Station in Greene
County, Virginia. 

_Replace the regulator inlet piping to Goochland Measurement and Regulation Station No. 831076 in Goochland County,
Virginia. 

_Install regulation on Line VM-107 at Mainline Valve No. 8 in Goochland County, Virginia. 

_Install regulation from Line VM-108 to Line VM-107 at Mainline Valve No. 12 in Chesterfield County, Virginia.


_Replace a 3-inch regulator setting with a 6-inch regulator setting at Petersburg regulator Station in Prince George
county, Virginia. 

_Replace a 6-inch regulator setting with a 4-inch regulator setting at Newport News No. 2 Measurement and Regulation
Station in James City County, Virginia.




The estimated cost of the appurtenant facility modification is $1,897,500, including the ``gross-up'' due to taxes.
VNG will reimburse Columbia 100% for the construction. The anticipated in-service date for the modification and
subsequent reassignment of deliveries is November 1, 1994. Columbia says that it will comply with all of the environmental
requirements of Sections 157.206(d) prior to the construction of any facilities.

5. Algonquin Gas Transmission Corporation


[Docket No. CP94-684-000]



Take notice that on July 26, 1994, Algonquin Gas Transmission Corporation (Algonquin), 1284 Soldiers Field Road,
Boston, Massachusetts 02135, filed in Docket No. CP94-684-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205,
157.212, and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212 and 157.216)
for authorization to construct and operate facilities at three existing metering and regulating stations to increase
the capacity for deliveries at those stations to Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Ed) and to abandon
the facilities that are replaced by the new facilities, under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP87-317-000,
pursuant to Sections 7(c) and 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with
the Commission and open to public inspection. 

It is stated that Con Ed is a shipper under several of Algonquin's rate schedules, and has requested increased delivery
capacity at three existing points of interconnection between Con Ed and Algonquin for deliveries under Algonquin's
tariff. Algonquin states that Con Ed has requested the construction of appurtenant facilities at existing meter
stations in Peekskill, Cortlandt, and Yorktown, New York. It is indicated that the construction will involve changes
to regulators, meter run headers, meter tubes, heater piping, relief valves, and station instrumentation. Algonquin
states that these facility changes will allow increased maximum daily deliveries at the Peekskill Station from 15,937
million to 19,364 million Btu, at the Cortlandt Station from 3,562 million Btu to 4,002 million Btu, and at the Yorktown
Station from 3,562 million Btu to 19,434 million Btu. Algonquin estimates that the facility changes will cost $427,600,
which will be reimbursed by Con Ed upon the two parties finalizing an appropriate agreement. 

Algonquin states that it has sufficient system delivery flexibility to accomplish these deliveries without detriment
or disadvantage to its other customers. It is also indicated that Algonquin's tariff permits Algonquin, at its option
and with the customer's consent, to add facilities and to be reimbursed by the customer for the cost of those facilities.

<USBUREAU>Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Process for Evaluating the Suitability of the Yucca Mountain Site for Development as a Repository for High-Level
Radioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Department of Energy.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Through this Notice, the Department of Energy makes four announcements regarding the process for evaluating the
suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for development as a repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent
nuclear fuel. 1) The Department announces the availability of Summary Reports of the May 21, 1994 stakeholder meeting
held in Las Vegas, Nevada. 2) The Department announces its decision to use the Siting Guidelines (10 CFR Part 960) as
they currently exist. 3) The Department announces the availability of a draft description of the process for evaluating
the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for public comment. 4) The Department announces stakeholder meetings
to elicit the views of the general public on the proposed process and particularly the proposed opportunities for
external involvement. The Department invites interested parties to provide written comments during the term specified
in this Notice.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Summary Reports 


The Department of Energy (Department) held a public meeting on May 21, 1994, in Las Vegas, Nevada (59FR19680). The
purposes of the meeting were to follow-up on a previous stakeholder meeting held in August 1993; to update stakeholders
on Yucca Mountain site characterization activities; and to provide an opportunity to discuss the development of
a process to evaluate the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for development as a repository. Through this Notice,
the Department announces that the Summary Reports of the meeting are available upon request. 

II. Decision on the Use of 10 CFR Part 960 

Issued in 1984, DOE's 10 CFR Part 960 siting guidelines cover all phases of the siting process including the screening
and comparison of several sites in order to select three for detailed characterization as potential repository sites.
The Department has considered a range of options concerning the application of the guidelines, from revising them
through the rulemaking process to simply continuing to use them in their present form and has found that the guidelines
are applicable to the site suitability process. The Department has decided that it will not amend the siting guidelines.
Therefore, in making suitability decisions that are required at this stage of the siting process, the Department
will use the guidelines as they are currently written. Their use, however, will be subject to the programmatic changes
and reconfiguration provided in the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987. Because the Amendments Act eliminated
all of the pre-characterization stages by requiring the Secretary to proceed with site characterization at Yucca
Mountain and to cease investigation of all other potential sites for the first repository, comparative evaluation
is no longer relevant. Accordingly, the Program will not utilize the comparative portions of the guidelines for purposes
of the suitability assessment of the Yucca Mountain site. This means that the Program will not make specific evaluations
of the favorable and potentially adverse conditions since these tests are primarily for use in comparing sites. 



III. Availability of the draft description of the process for evaluating the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site


The Department is developing a process for evaluating the suitability of the Yucca Mountain Site for a repository
for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel. Through this Notice, the Department announces that a draft description
of the proposed process is available for public comment. Written comments on the draft description of the proposed
process are due as set forth near the beginning of this notice. 

IV. Stakeholder Meetings 

As part of the comment process discussed above, two day-long public meetings have been scheduled as set forth near
the beginning of this notice. The meeting will provide an opportunity for representatives from the DOE to explain
the draft description of the process and to receive the views and comments of the public on the proposed process and,
in particular, opportunities for public involvement.

<ACTION>
action:

 Notice of permits.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing, as a direct final action, 5-year Phase I Acid Rain Permits
to 39 utility plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by
promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated
final rules implementing the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On November 18, 1993, EPA published a notice of proposed
revisions to rules regarding Phase I substitution and reduced utilization plans (sections 404 (b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B)
of the Act). On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced
utilization issues.


In today's action, EPA is issuing permits that are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement. Except as noted below,
EPA approves for 1995-1999 all compliance options for which EPA deferred action for 1996-1999 in the draft
permits. In addition, except as noted below, the numbers of substitution and compensating unit allowances allocated
to each unit for 1995-1999 are identical to the numbers of allowances allocated to each unit for 1995 in the draft
permits. The additional allowances discussed below, according to the settlement, are a one-time allocation and
entail a simultaneous deduction of an equal number of allowances in a future year. Upon activation of conditionally-approved
plans, substitution or compensating unit allowances are allocated for the remaining years the plan is in effect.
EPA issues the following permits:
Brayton Point in Massachusetts.


Mount Tom in Massachusetts:

 10,708 substitution allowances for each year and 736 additional allowances to unit 1 upon activation of substitution
plan, and 736 additional allowances if the unit becomes affected for nitrogen oxides (NO

X

Announcement of Cooperative Agreement to the World Health Organization 



Summary 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of funds for fiscal year (FY) 1994
for a cooperative agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO) for research initiatives related to chronic
disease prevention and health promotion. Annually, chronic diseases are responsible for significant illness,
death, economic cost, and diminished quality of life for millions of individuals worldwide. Improving methods of
reaching and sustaining healthy lifestyles, promoting health education and disease prevention, and reducing high-risk
activities which result in disease infection will result in significant reduction in mortality and morbidity. Approximately
$312,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund this program. It is expected that the award will begin on or about September
29, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject
to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability
of funds. 

The purpose of this program is for WHO to coordinate the dissemination of comprehensive chronic disease information
and health promotion programmatic expertise among relevant agencies, nations, and health-care professionals
worldwide. Findings from this project will be useful in further reducing the excessive burden of chronic disease
mortality in the United States and in improving the provision of care through more simple and less expensive forms
of technology, as well as contributing immeasurably to reducing the excessive burden of chronic disease mortality
throughout the world. 

The CDC will collaborate in the design of research protocols, assist in the analysis and interpretation of data generated
from each project, provide, as needed, other programmatic consultation and guidance in support of the program, provide
continuing updates on scientific and operational developments in the areas of categorical and comprehensive chronic
disease prevention and control, participate in the development of plans for the sharing and dissemination of program
and research data and information, and assist in defining the scope, the development, and dissemination of plans
for chronic disease prevention, research, and control. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve the quality
of life. This announcement focuses on the priority areas of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. (For ordering
a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section 

Where to Obtain Additional Information

Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point Systems; Invitation to Participate in a Voluntary HACCP Pilot Program for
the Food Manufacturing Industry 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that it intends to conduct a pilot program in which volunteers
from the food manufacturing industry will use the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system. This pilot
program is intended to provide information that FDA can use in deciding whether to propose to adopt and, should it decide
to do so, in developing and implementing a regulatory system in which food manufacturers are required to operate based
on HACCP principles. FDA expects that the pilot program will involve a small number of firms making products presenting
a range of risks. FDA is inviting individual firms that wish to participate in this program to submit letters of interest.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 

et seq

), FDA acts to help ensure that foods in interstate commerce are safe. To achieve this goal of safe foods, FDA engages
in a range of activities, including providing guidance about measures that manufacturers can take to ensure the safety
of their products. One such measure is the adoption of HACCP, a systematic approach to the identification and control
of biological, chemical, and physical hazards associated with the production of a particular food. HACCP is recognized
as being particularly effective in limiting the risks from the hazards presented by food processing because each
firm tailors the HACCP approach to fit its specific product, processing, and distribution conditions. For example,
the low-acid canned food regulations contained in part 113 (21 CFR part 113) incorporate the principles of HACCP in
a manner designed to prevent 

Clostridium botulinum

 outgrowth and toxin production in thermally processed, low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers.



In the 

Federal Register

 of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142), FDA published a proposal to establish regulations to require the implementation
of HACCP programs by the seafood industry. The agency is now considering action to extend HACCP beyond seafood to the
other food products, domestic and imported, that it regulates. Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA intends to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) that requests comments on the application
of HACCP to the food industry. After the comments to the ANPRM are evaluated and as FDA gathers information from the
pilot program that is the subject of this notice, the agency may begin rulemaking to expand HACCP to other segments
of the food industry.
To collect information on how HACCP might be implemented in the food industry, FDA is announcing a pilot program designed
to provide insight into the problems, costs, and benefits of developing and implementing HACCP for firms that produce
a variety of food products. This program will also provide the agency with information on the implications for the
agency of implementing a HACCP system. The agency invites individual firms to submit letters of interest in participating
in this voluntary program. FDA will select firms with a goal of ensuring that the participants in the program produce
products that present a range of potential hazards, have a range of scientific capabilities, have processing facilities
of varying sizes, and have a range of HACCP experience. FDA anticipates that this program will provide the selected
firm as well as the agency with extremely useful practical experience.

The potential benefits to industry from participation in the pilot program include: (1) An opportunity to work with
FDA to determine how best to apply HACCP in the firm's particular plant or segment of the food industry, (2) the chance
to engage in a scientific dialogue with FDA, (3) an opportunity to contribute to the development of sound regulatory
policy relative to food safety hazards, and (4) an opportunity to learn how firms can reduce the likelihood of recalls
or seizures.
 Participation in this pilot program offers several benefits to FDA and to the consumer: (1) Experience gained during
this program may allow the agency to generalize what it has found and to make its insights available to the whole food
industry, (2) the agency will gain experience that it can rely on in deciding whether HACCP is practicable for the food
industry as a whole, and (3) the agency will be able to determine how it can better focus its monitoring of food safety
to concentrate on areas of greatest public health need. Moreover, the agency intends to make a summary of the results
of the pilot program publicly available, which should help other firms, both inside and outside the segments of the
food industry represented in the program, to develop and implement their own HACCP programs, should they choose to
do so, or should the agency require that they do so. This will also serve to increase public understanding of, and involvement
in this new food safety regimen. 
FDA requests that individual firms submitting letters of interest provide information concerning the nature of
their products, the size of their processing facility, the processing techniques that they use to manufacture their
products, their scientific capability (e.g., research and development programs, quality control laboratories),
and the extent to which, and how, they employ HACCP (e.g., Does the firm have valid HACCP plans? Is it operating under
those plans? If not, does the firm have the capability to develop and implement HACCP plans?). FDA will consider these
factors in reviewing the letters of interest as a basis for identifying a limited number of individual firms that,
in the judgment of the agency, are best suited to participate in the program. After a list of potential participants
has been compiled, FDA will review the regulatory status and inspectional history of each firm on the list. 
FDA will meet with the firms that have expressed an interest in participating in the program. At this meeting, FDA will
present the details of the voluntary HACCP pilot program. If a firm is still interested in participation in the program,
it will be visited by the team of FDA employees that will be responsible for the pilot program (the FDA HACCP Pilot Core
Team) and by representatives of the local FDA district office. Representatives of a trade association may also participate
in the visit if invited by the firm. The purpose of the visit will be to allow FDA to assess how well the firm fits within
the agency's goals for the pilot program and to review the firm's HACCP plan, if one exists. Based on the results of these
visits, the FDA HACCP Pilot Core Team will select the firms that will participate in the program. Because FDA's resources
are limited, only a few firms can be selected.
Each firm selected to participate in the pilot program will be expected to design, develop, and implement its own HACCP
program tailored to control the hazards presented in producing its products and by its processing facility. FDA will
assist each firm that it selects in developing a HACCP program that, at minimum, includes: An employee training program
on HACCP principles; a written general sanitation program that the firm will use to maintain its production facility
in a sanitary manner, in accordance with FDA's regulation, ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing,
Packing, or Holding Human Food'' (21 CFR part 110); and a written HACCP plan based upon the HACCP principles outlined
by the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food for each product covered by the program.
FDA will expect each firm that participates in the program to agree to: (1) FDA review of its HACCP program before the
firm participates in the pilot program, (2) FDA HACCP-based inspections of its processing facility, (3) FDA review
of the firm's regularly scheduled internal monitoring to determine the degree of compliance with the HACCP plan,
and (4) use of its own resources to accomplish assigned efforts (e.g., developing HACCP plans, training employees
on the HACCP principles, conducting audits of HACCP programs) during the course of the program. 
FDA intends to implement this program on a carefully controlled basis. Within 6 weeks of the date that a firm is accepted
and operational in its HACCP program, FDA will conduct an initial verification inspection to determine the firm's
compliance with its HACCP program. The firm will be expected to submit monthly verification reports to the FDA HACCP
Pilot Core Team for evaluation. FDA will conduct subsequent verification inspections as appropriate.
 Interested firms are invited to submit a letter of interest to Office of Policy, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives
(HFS-4), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington,
DC 20204. Letters of interest must be submitted by October 3, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Current List of Laboratories Which Meet Minimum Standards To Engage in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies and
Laboratories That Have Withdrawn From the Program </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, HHS (Formerly: National Institute on Drug Abuse, ADAMHA,
HHS).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR 11979, 11986).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 




If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Pub. L. 100-71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged in Urine
Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct urine
drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of performance
testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in an every-other-month
performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 



Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are 

not 

to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter
of certification from SAMHSA, HHS (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 

In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; extension of comment period. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The public comment period for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Rangeland Reform '94 is hereby extended

Policy Act of 1969 by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), with the cooperation of the Department
of Agriculture, Forest Service. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service are proposing to change policies and regulations within their
Federal rangeland management programs. These actions are intended to improve and restore a significant portion
of rangeland ecosystems and to improve and maintain biodiversity, while providing for sustainable development
on lands administered by the two agencies. The two agencies are also proposing to revise the formula used to determine
fees charged for grazing livestock on Federal lands in the 17 western states. 




The Bureau of Land Management, with the cooperation of the Forest Service, has prepared a draft EIS analyzing the environmental
effects of the proposed changes in their rangeland management programs. The draft EIS is a national-level, programmatic
analysis. It documents the ecological, economic, and social impacts that would result from alternative fee formulas
and from reforming, or not reforming, other elements of the Federal rangeland management program. Five management
alternatives are considered in detail: Current Management (No Action); BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action; Livestock
Production; Environmental Enhancement; and No Grazing. Seven grazing fee formula alternatives are also analyzed:
Current Public Rangeland Improvement Act (PRIA) (No Action); Modified PRIA; BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action;
Regional Fees; Federal Forage Fee; PRIA with Surcharges; and Competitive Bidding.

Abstract: 

Individuals who may not physically use certain unique or significant resources may hold some value for their existence

the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies Program have shown that the operation of Glen Canyon Dam affects downstream
natural and cultural resources in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Grand Canyon National Park. If individuals
hold passive-use value for resources affected by the timing and amount of the releases from the dam, the magnitude
of these values could be influenced by changes in the way the dam is operated. A small (pilot) test survey was completed
earlier (OMB clearance number 1006-0013). Data obtained during the pilot test supported the hypothesis that
members of the general public hold passive-use value for these resources and that the magnitude of these values may
change across operational alternatives. A full scale (final) survey is now proposed. Information for the final survey
will be collected from a random sample of the U.S. population in an effort to quantify passive-use value for a range
of dam operation strategies. This information will be available for use by decision makers as they assess the trade-offs
between recreation benefits, power production benefits, and passive-use benefits associated with different strategies
for operating Glen Canyon Dam.



Reason for Expedited Review: 

Data collected under this information has been requested for possible consideration in reaching a Record of Decision
on the final Glen Canyon Dam Environmental Impact Statement (GCDEIS). The Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 stipulates
the completion of the final GCDEIS by October 30, 1994. In order to meet this schedule, it will be necessary to begin
survey administration as soon as clearance is obtained.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of a Draft Recovery Plan for the Carolina Heelsplitter for Review and Comment</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

ACTION: 

Notice of document availability and public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a technical/agency
draft recovery plan for Carolina heelsplitter (

Lasmigona decorata

). This rare freshwater mussel inhabits cool, slow-moving, small- to medium-sized streams and rivers. The Carolina
heelsplitter currently has a very fragmented, relict distribution but historically was known from several locations
within the Catawaba River and Pee Dee River systems in North Carolina and the Saluda and Pee Dee River systems in South
Carolina. The species is presently know to be surviving in only four streams_Waxhaw Creek (Catawba River system)
Union County, North Carolina; Goose Creek (Pee Dee River system), Union County, North Carolina; Lynches River (Pee
Dee River system), Chesterfield, Lancaster, and Kershaw Counties, South Carolina; and Flat Creek (Pee Dee River
system), a tributary to the Lynches River in Lancaster County, South Carolina. It has been reduced to a few short reaches
of each of these streams, primarily as a result of impoundments and general deterioration of water quality resulting
from siltation and other pollutants contributed by poor land use practices. The Service solicits review and comment
from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery
effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States.
Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for recognizing
the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures
needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.

) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

The primary species considered in this draft recovery plan is the Carolina heelsplitter (

Lasmigona decorata

). The area of emphasis for recovery actions is the upper Catawba River and Pee Dee River systems in south-central North
Carolina and north-central South Carolina and the Saluda River system in northwestern South Carolina Habitat protection,
reintroduction, and preservation of genetic material are major objectives of this recovery plan.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.







Authority: 

The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

Response to Public Comments



Pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h))(``APPA''), the
United States of America hereby files its Response to Public Comments.



I. 



Introduction



The United States has carefully reviewed the comments submitted on the proposed Final Judgment and remains convinced
that entry of the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest. 



II.



Background



This action was commenced on April 28, 1994, when the United States filed a complaint alleging that the defendant's
proposed merger violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18. On the same date, the United States
submitted a proposed Final Judgment and a Stipulation between the United States and the dependents pursuant to which
the United States and the defendants consented to entry of the proposed Final Judgment. The Stipulation provides
that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court after completion of the procedures required by the APPA.



III.



Compliance With the APPA



Upon publication of this Response in the 

Federal Register

, the procedures required by the APPA prior to entry of the proposed Final Judgment were completed, and the Court is
free to enter the proposed Final Judgment. 



IV.



Response to Public Comments



The Department has received two comments relating to the proposed Final Judgment. The first comment, filed by K. Lawrence
Kemp, a bankruptcy trustee, was filed on behalf of Dennis F. Gianotti, the owner of GTV, a regional sports video programming
company which has filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
The second comment was submitted by GTE Service Corporation, on behalf of its affiliated domestic telephone operating
companies and GTE Laboratories Incorporated. 

The issue of the standard of judicial review, raised by the comments, will be discussed below in Section IV(C).

<TEXT>
 

A. K. Lawrence Kemp 



Mr. Kemp submitted a copy of an antitrust complaint that has been filed on behalf of Mr. Gianotti and GTV. The complaint
alleges that KBL Sports Network, Inc. and the defendants have attempted to monopolize sports television programming
of collegiate athletics for cable distribution in Western Pennsylvania by interfering with Mr. Gianotti's and GVT's
exclusive rights to produce and distribute such programming. Among other allegations, the complaint alleges that
defendants refused carriage of GTV programming as part of an attempt to monopolize. Mr. Kemp asserts that for the reasons
alleged in the aforementioned complaint, he objects to the proposed Final Judgment. 

The proposed Final Judgment does not directly address issues relating to competition among firms seeking television
production and distribution rights for sports events.
 The Department has no basis for a general concern that the proposed transaction will lessen competition among firms
competing for television rights for sports events. However, to the extent that defendants discriminate against
non-affiliated programming in the selection, terms, or conditions of carriage, such conduct is encompassed within
the proposed Final Judgment. 





Section IV(A) of the proposed Final Judgment enjoins defendants' cable systems and multichannel subscription television
distributors (``MSTDs'') from discriminating against non-affiliated video programmers in the selection, terms,
or conditions of carriage, where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. This provision
does not create an automatic right of access for any individual video programmer to any of defendants' individual
MSTDs, nor is it intended to inhibit good faith negotiations between defendants and unaffiliated programmers regarding
the terms and conditions of carriage. However, where the effect of discrimination by defendants is to restrain competition,
such conduct is prohibited. 

In addition, Section IV(C) extends the prohibitions set forth in Section IV(A) to prevent defendants from seeking
or supporting, with respect to any MSTD in which defendants have any financial interest but do not control, conduct
that would violate Section IV(A) if engaged in by defendants. 

By prohibiting conduct by defendants that might restrain competition in the provision of video programming, the
Department believes that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger alleged in the Complaint will be fully
remedied. The Department's view as to the sufficiency of this relief also rests on the existence of Sections 12 and
19 of the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act, Pub. L. 102-385, 106 Stat. 1460 (1992) (``1992 Cable
Act''), and its implementing Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'') regulations, as well as the judgments
recently entered in 

U.S. 

v. 

Primestar Partners, L.P., et al.


 and 

State of New York, et al. 

v. 

Primestar Partners, L.P., et al.


 (``Primestar cases''). 






B. GTE Service Corporation 



GTE supports the entry of the proposed Final Judgment but argues that its duration is too short. In addition, GTE expresses
concern that the proposed Final Judgment would allow defendants to withdraw highly appealing programming from distribution_and
specifically from competing systems_upon expiration of the proposed Final Judgment. 

GTE recommends (1) that the term of the existing provisions of the proposed Final Judgment be increased from five to
seven years; and (2) that upon expiration of this seven year period, defendants should be restrained from withdrawing
any programming from distribution in a particular market unless that market is found to be subject to ``effective
competition'' within the meaning of Section 623(l)(1) of the 1992 Cable Act 
 or unless such programming is withdrawn from all markets, specifically including any and all systems in which defendants
have an interest. 





In the 

Competitive Impact Statement, 

the United States explains why it limited the term of the proposed Final Judgment to five years. The five year term reflects
the United States' ``recognition that this industry is one that has experienced major changes in MSTD technologies
that are on-going, and the effects of the 1992 Cable Act and its implementing FCC regulations.''
 The United States continues to believe that for this transaction in this industry, with changing technology, substantial
new entry as well as recent and substantial government regulation, a term of five years is a sufficient period of time
and is in the public interest. 





The United States also believes that it is in the public interest not to place additional restrictions upon defendants
after the expiration of the proposed Final Judgment. Federal antitrust laws as well as the 1992 Cable Act and its implementing
FCC regulations should provide adequate protection against potential anticompetitive behavior in programming
distribution upon expiration of the proposed Final Judgment. 



C. Standard of Judicial Review 



The APPA requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the United States are subject to a
sixty-day comment period, after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment ``is
in the public interest.'' In making that determination, the court may consider: 

(1) The competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement
and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered,
and any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940804-2-00117 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940804-2-00068 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the
violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination
of the issues at trial.



15 U.S.C. 16(e) (emphasis added). The courts have recognized that the term ``public interest'' ``take[s] meaning
from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.''

 465 U.S. 1101 (1984). Since the purpose of the antitrust laws is to ``preserv[e] free and unfettered competition as
the rule of trade,'' 

Northern Pacific Railway Co. 

v

 United States,

 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958), the focus of the ``public interest'' inquiry under the Tunney Act is whether the proposed final
judgment would serve the public interest in free and unfettered competition. 

United States 

v

 Waste Management, Inc.,

 1985-2 Trade Cas.  66,651, at 63,046 (D.D.C. 1985). In conducting this inquiry, ``the Court is nowhere
compelled to go to trial or to engage in extended proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the benefits
of prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree process.''
 Rather, absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty, the Court, in making the public
interest finding, should * * * carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive
impact statement and its responses to comments in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under
the circumstances.








United States 

v

 Mid-America Dairymen, Inc.,

 1977-1 Trade Cas.  61,508, at 71,980 (W.D. Mo. 1977).


It is also unnecessary for the district court to ``engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve
the public.'' 

United States 

v

 Bechtel Corp.,

 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), 

cert. denied,

 454 U.S. 1083 (1981). Precedent requires that



[t]he balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must
be left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public
interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree.
The court is required to determine not whether particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether
the settlement is ``within the reaches of the public interest.'' More elaborate requirements might undermine the
effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree.

A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and
discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they




waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable
risk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving
of cost and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the
litigation.





United States

 v. 

Armour & Co.,

 402 U.S. 673, 681 (1971).




The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate
every conceivable anticompetitive effect of a merger or whether it mandates certainty of free competition in the
future. The court may reject the agreement of the parties as to how the public interest is best served only if it has ``exceptional
confidence that adverse antitrust consequences will result * * *'' 

United States

 v. 

Western Electric Co.,

 993 F.2d 1572, 1577 (D.C. Cir. 1993).

Court approval of a final judgment requires a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required for
a finding of liability. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose
on its own, as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is `within the reaches of public interest.'''
 Under the public interest standard, the Court's role is limited to determining whether the proposed decree is within
the ``zone of settlements'' consistent with the public interest, not whether the settlement diverges from the Court's
view of what would best serve the public interest. 

United States

 v. 

Western Electric Co.,

 993 F.2d at 1576 (quoting 

United States

 v. 

Western Electric Co.,

 900 F.2d 283, 307 (D.C. Cir. 1990).





Clearly, there has been no showing that the proposed settlement constitutes an abuse of the Department's discretion
or that it is not within the zone of settlements consistent with the public interest. The proposed Final Judgment would
enjoin defendants' cable systems and other multichannel subscription television distributors from discriminating
against non-affiliated video programmers in the selection, terms, or conditions of carriage where the effect of
such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. Defendants also would be enjoined, with respect to their video
programming, from refusing to license on nondiscriminatory terms to any competing multichannel subscription television
distributor where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. The Department believes that
entry of the proposed Final Judgment willfully remedy the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger alleged
in the Complaint, by prohibiting conduct by defendants that might restrain competition in the provision of video
programming or multichannel subscription television distribution.

Factual Background 


10. Gianotti was engaged in the business of producing television programs primarily for use on cable television and
primarily of a sports nature. 
11. On or about October 19, 1989, Gianotti entered into a written agreement with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic
Department for the production of certain sports telecasts. The Agreement was for a term of two years from October 21,
1989, to October 21, 1991. The Agreement gave exclusive broadcast and cable distribution rights to Gianotti. The
Agreement provided for an exclusive 30-day negotiating period following October 21, 1991. 
12. During the term of the said Agreement, Gianotti produced various sports television programs involving University
of Pittsburgh athletic events and arranged for the viewing of such programs through KBL. 

13. Gianotti provided KBL with a copy of his said Agreement with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department
prior to the first cable distribution of such a program. 
14. Although Gianotti's dealings were formally with KBL, he was paid for programming by checks of TCI mailed to his
address is Pennsylvania from TCI's office. 
15. Before the end of the term of the said agreement, in August, 1991, KBL successfully negotiated directly with the
University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department to provide for the production of the same sports events covered by the
said Agreement. 
16. In the spring of 1991, in order to harm Gianotti's chances of extending his contractual relationship with the University
of Pittsburgh, KBL refused to provide cable distribution of University of Pittsburgh men's baseball games and other
sports events such as auto racing from Gianotti. 
17. In a concerted effort to take over Gianotti's business, KBL cancelled his Steeler Talk Show and replaced it with
its own Sports Beat. 

18. KBL directly approached and contracted with advertisers developed by Gianotti, such as Carriage Limousine and
Coors Beer. 
19. In February, 1991, in a meeting between William Craig, a managerial employee of KBL, and Gianotti, William Craig
told Gianotti that KBL would not distribute any University of Pittsburgh athletic events unless KBL could distribute
men's basketball. When Gianotti offered to produce men's basketball, William Craig rejected the offer and advised
him that KBL wanted to negotiate that directly with the University of Pittsburgh.

<TEXT>
 

20. At and after the meeting, Gianotti offered to buy or barter time to get his programs distributed by defendant, but
KBL refused to quote him a price.

21. KBL is and was owned directly or indirectly by TCI. 

22. TCI directly or indirectly (through its subsidiary TCI of Pennsylvania, Inc.) dominated the Metropolitan Pittsburgh
cable television market by having approximately half the cable television subscribers in the said market. 

23. Because KBL was owned by TCI and/or Liberty (the two of which were related) which had more than half the cable subscribers
in this area, KBL could and did exercise market power over collegiate sports television programming in the Metropolitan
Pittsburgh area. 

24. The existence of market power by KBL and TCI is evidenced by the following: 

(a) One of TCI's subsidiaries, TCI of Pennsylvania, refused to deal with TCS, an entity which first acquired cable
television transmission rights to Pittsburgh Pirate baseball games. 

(b) TCI through various of its subsidiaries refused to deal with Sportschannel, an entity which offers sports programming
of national and regional interest. If TCI of Pennsylvania had carried Sportschannel, Sportschannel would have competed
with KBL for rights to regional sports events. 

(c) KBL reasonably believed it could impose a seat fee on commercial establishments such as bars which provide a television
set for its patrons to watch programs on KBL and actually did impose such a fee. 

(d) KBL refused to deal with Gianotti on programming it previously found acceptable for the sole purpose of eliminating
him as an intermediary between sports programming sources such as the University of Pittsburgh and other programming
sources on the one side and KBL and the cable television systems on the other. 

(e) KBL and/or TCI is now attempting to acquire the Pittsburgh Pirates so that it can control broadcast, telecast and
cable casting of Pirate games. 

(f) TCI became a co-owner of K-Prime Partners, Limited Partnership also known as Primestar on February 8, 1990, in
an effort to dominate video sports programming. 

(g) TCI through its subsidiary TCI of Pennsylvania, Inc., has had the only cable television service within the City
of Pittsburgh between 1984 and the present. 

(h) In December, 1993, TCI of Pennsylvania had approximately 385,000 cable television subscribers in the Metropolitan
Pittsburgh area, more than half the total subscribers in this area. 

(i) TCI directly or indirectly through a subsidiary bought the City of Pittsburgh cable television franchise from
Warner Cable Corp. in 1984 for approximately $93,400,000.00. 

(j) The Chief Executive Officer of TCI is John Malone, who also owns 50.4% of the common stock of Liberty Media, Inc.,
a Colorado business corporation. TCI and Liberty Media through their various subsidiaries have 10 million cable
television subscribers, more than 25% of the total number of cable television subscribers of the United States.

(k) John Malone, TCI and Liberty Media during the past two decades have embarked on a course of conduct designed to control
cable television and by acquiring control over programming sources, technology and franchises. In particular,
TCI and Liberty have, during this period of time acquired

(1) 22% of Turner Broadcasting which provides TBS, TNT, CNN and the Cartoon Network. 

(2) 49% of QVC

(3) 49% of the Discovery Channel 

(4) 42% of the Home Shopping Network

(5) 33% of Court TV

(6) 21% of Home Team Sports

(7) 68% of SportsCom

(8) 18% of Black Entertainment Network

(9) 90% of Encore

(10) 15.6% of The Family Channel 

(11) 15% of Interactive Network

(1) In addition TCI and/or Liberty Media have become involved in partnerships or joint ventures in The Children's
Channel, the Parliamentary Channel, TeleWest, The Sega Channel and Viewer Controlled Cable Television.

(m) In April, 1993, KBL acquired exclusive broadcast rights for 4 years for the Pittsburgh Penguins for approximately
$22,000,000.00. This acquisition enabled KBL to sell rights to certain games to broadcast stations such as KDKA-TV
and to institute pay-per-view as to certain games. 

(n) KBL also acquired exclusive television broadcasting rights to the Pittsburgh Pirates. 

(o) KBL, after contracting with the University of Pittsburgh for men's basketball, was able to charge an additional
fee to cable system operators for such programming, a fee over and above the regular charge for KBL programming 

25. John Malone, through TCI and its subsidiaries and liberty Media and its subsidiaries has engaged in an effort to
exercise monopolistic control over programming sources by the above acquisitions and by encouraging independent
programming sources, such as The Learning Channel, to merge into entities over which they have control such as, The
Discovery Channel.

26. The elimination of GTV as a programming source enabled KBL, an entity controlled by Malone, TCI and/or Liberty
Media, to deal directly with the University of Pittsburgh on terms favorable to defendants for basketball by tying
the acceptance of minor sports programming to basketball.

Count I



27. By its conduct Defendants have violated 15 U.S.C.  1 in that KBL has, by contracting directly with the University
of Pittsburgh Athletic Department to produce and distribute sports events covered by the Agreement with Gianotti,
restrained trade and commerce by interfering with Gianotti's opportunity to do business with the University of Pittsburgh.

28. One of the purposes of KBL said conduct was to monopolize sports television production of collegiate athletics
for cable distribution in Western Pennsylvania in violation of 15 U.S.C.  2. 

29. Another of the purposes of KBL said conduct was to tie the distribution of men's basketball to the distribution
of other sports events in order to deprive others from an opportunity to telecast or distribute by cable men's basketball
programs.

30. Defendants' conduct had a substantially adverse affect on competition in that it eliminated a major cable television
programming source and left Defendants in the position to exercise market power over the origination of sports programming
for cable television in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area.

31. KBL is capable of monopolizing this market because of its relationship with TCI of Pennsylvania, Inc., which has
more than half the cable subscribers in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area.

32. In this instance and in the past, defendants and their affiliated corporations have used refusals to deal with
program sources as a means to exercise their market power to control programming sources.

33. The various actions taken by defendants and their affiliated corporations have decreased competition by eliminating
Gianotti and possibly others such as TCS and possibly discouraging them and others from entering this expanding market.

34. Although broadcast television stations also show some local sports events, they are restrained by two factors:

(a) Because of their necessity to maintain certain minimum numbers of viewers and correspondingly certain minimum
advertising rates, they cannot show minor collegiate athletic events or other sports and non-sports programming
not designed to appeal to significant segments of the Viewing population.

(b) Defendants through their acquisition of exclusive rights to University of Pittsburgh Basketball, the Pittsburgh
Penguins and the Pittsburgh Pirates now control which of these events can be shown on regular broadcast stations.
For example, WPXI Channel 11 had to contract with KBL to be able to show certain University of Pittsburgh Basketball
games.

35. Because of the conduct of defendants, Gianotti was forced out of the business he was building which in 1990 generated
gross receipts of $325,102.65 and a net profit to him of $12,273.80.

36. Gianotti was the largest source of independent local video programming in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan area between
1988 and 1990.

37. Had defendants not so conducted themselves, Gianotti's business would have grown and he would have been able to
earn far more than $50,000.00.

38. The fair market value of Gianotti business prior to the said course of conduct of defendants was in excess of $100,000.00.

39. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 15 plaintiffs are entitled to recover threefold the damages sustained plus prejudgment
interest plus attorneys fees.

Wherefore, Plaintiffs request judgment against Defendant for $300,000.00 plus interest from October 21, 1991,
at the federal judgment rate plus reasonable attorneys fees.



Count II



40. In violation of 15 U.S.C. 18, KBL acquired an asset of Gianotti in the form of his exclusive right to negotiate a renewal
of his contract with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department, where the effect of such acquisition substantially
lessened competition by driving Gianotti out of business chilling interest in entry into this market by others, depriving
advertisers and sports teams of alternatives and tended to create a monopoly in the production of sports television
programming for cable distribution.

41. Because of the conduct of defendants, Gianotti was forced out of the business he built up which in 1990 generated
gross receipts of $325,102.65 and a net profit to him of $12,273.80.

42. Had defendants not so conducted themselves, Gianotti's business would have grown and he would have been able to
earn far more than $50,000.00.

43. The fair market value of the Gianotti's business prior to the said course of conduct of defendants was in excess

interest plus attorneys fees.

Wherefore, Plaintiffs request judgment against Defendant for $300,000.00 plus interest from October 21, 1991,
at the federal judgment rate plus reasonable attorneys fees.



Count III



45. By dealing directly with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department before the expiration of the exclusive
negotiating period under the Department's contract with Gianotti, KBL tortiously interfered with his advantageous
contractual and business relationship with the Department.

46. By dealing directly with Gianotti's advertisers such as Carriage Limousine and Coors Beer, KBL tortiously interfered
with his advantageous business relationships with them.

47. Because of the conduct of KBL, Dennis F. Gianotti was forced out of the business he built up which in 1990 generated
gross receipts of $325,102.65 and a net profit to him of $12,273.80.

48. Had KBL not so conducted itself, Gianotti's business would have grown and he would have been able to earn far more
than $50,000.00.

49. The fair market value of the Gianotti's business prior to the said course of conduct of defendants was in excess
of $100,000.00.

Wherefore, Plaintiffs demand compensatory damages of at least $100,000.00 and such punitive damages as the court
deems just.

United States District Court for the District of Columbia
Civil Action No. 94-0948


Comments of GTE


GTE Service Corporation, on behalf of its affiliated domestic telephone operating companies and GTE Laboratories
Incorporated (GTE), herewith respectfully submits these Comments to the proposed Final Judgment in the above-captioned
action.


I. Introduction


Although the proposed Final Judgment (hereinafter, Consent Decree) is a worthy attempt to stem the anti-competitive
conduct rampant in the cable industry today_of which Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) and Liberty Media Corp. (Liberty)
are major players_it suffers from two primary flaws. First, the term of the Consent Decree is clearly inadequate.
Second, the Consent Decree would permit TCI/Liberty to withdraw high appealing programming from distribution_and
specifically from competing systems_upon expiration of the term of the Consent Decree. To remedy these flaws, GTE
recommends: (1) That the term of the existing provisions of the Consent Decree be increased to seven years, and (2)
that upon expiration of this seven year period, TCI/Liberty should be restrained from withdrawing any programming
from distribution in a particular market unless that market is found to be subject to ``effective competition'' within
the meaning of Section 623(l)(1) of the Act
 or unless such programming is withdrawn from all markets, specifically including any and all systems in which TCI
or Liberty has an interest.




II. Statement of Facts


Currently, the distribution of multichannel video programming is overwhelmingly dominated by the cable industry.
Cable systems are accessible to ninety-six percent of television households in American and over sixty percent of
those households subscribe. Annual cable revenues now exceed twenty-one billion dollars, and the industry has been
increasingly controlled by large Multiple Systems Operators (MSOs), including TCI and Liberty.
 From the customer's perspective, ninety-nine percent of all cable customers have only one cable operator to choose
from.
 As the industry exists today, the transport of video programming to consumers is a monopoly service.








The most promising potential competition to entrenched cable interests comes from local exchange carriers (LECs),
including GTE's domestic telephone operating companies. While LECs are presently prohibited from providing video
programming to customers in their own service territories,
 recent action by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allows LECs to provide common carrier transport of
the video signals of unaffiliated programmers, know a video dialtone (VDT).
 While LECs look forward to providing consumers with a competitive alternative to incumbent cable operators like
TCI and Liberty, these operators have fought vigorously to stave off competition at every turn.








III. The Consent Decree Must be Modified


To its credit, the Consent Decree seeks to discourage TCI/Liberty's anti-competitive conduct with respect to multichannel
subscription television distributors (MSTDs) and video programming providers (VPVs).
 However, TCI/Liberty's existing monopoly position, the cable industry's long history of anti-competitive conduct,
coupled with their current attempts to derail all potential competition, present a clear and present danger that
the provisions of the Consent Decree will be woefully inadequate. In particular, the restraints imposed by the Consent
Decree appear to be lifted at the very point in time when competition will likely be becoming a reality.




A consent decree is not merely a private contract between the parties; it is a judicial decree backed by the contempt
power of the Court. Thus, in approving the decree, ``the Court performs a judicial function and is called upon to decide
whether it is equitable to enter the decree as proposed by [the parties].'' 

United States 

v. 

Carter Products

, 

Inc.

, 211 F.Supp. 144, 147-48 (S.D.N.Y. 1962). The decree ``must be scrutinized carefully and approved, both as
to form and content, by the court entering it, prior to such entry.'' 

Esso Corp. 

v. 

United States, 

340 F.2d 1000, 1005 (9th Cir. 1965). Indeed, the Court is required ``to make an independent determination of the propriety
and equity of the decree proposed.'' 

United States 

v. 

F.&M. Schaefer Brewing Co., 

1968 Trade Cas. (CCH) 

 

 72,345 (E.D.N.Y. 1967).

As presently proposed,the Consent Decree fails this standard. Because the Consent Decree does not adequately serve
the public interest, it must be modified or rejected by the Court. 

See, e.g., United States 

v. 

AT&T, 

552 F. Supp. 131,216 (D.D.C. 1982); 

State of New York 

v. 

Dairylea Cooperative, 

547 F.Supp. 306, 308 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). It is therefore incumbent upon the Department of Justice, consistent with its
responsibilities under the Tunney Act,
 to seek modification of the Consent Decree before any request for entry of judgment is made to the Court.

The development of viable competition to entrenched monopoly cable interests is wholly contingent upon two requirements:
competitors' access to appealing programming, and use of existing and proposed distribution networks. To be viable,
a competitor must be able to assemble an attratctive package of programs to offer to consumers and have the ability
to distribute its offerings. Because of these requirements, the merged TCI-Liberty entitles constitute a bottleneck_if
not a stranglehold_upon the development of viable competition in the video marketplace. Only the closest scrutiny
of the merged entity's conduct will ensure that the public interest is served in the development of effective alternatives
to cable.

The primary flaw in the Consent Decree is its term. The five-year period proposed is simply inadequate. The video dialtone
facilities proposed by LECs_the principal potential competition to cable_will not reach a payback point for least
seven years.
 During this period, as nascent competition to cable more fully develops, LECs' video dialtone networks may be particularly
vulnerable to anti-competitive conduct by TCI/Liberty. Indeed, as actual competition develops toward the end of
this period, TCI/Liberty will have even greater incentives to engage in anti-competitive conduct to stem the loss
of market share. In order to cure this deficiency, the term of the Consent Decree must be not less than seven years.





A transition period is also necessary as the Consent Decree period comes to an end. In particular, at that point, it
would be in TCI/Liberty's interest to withdraw appealing programming from competitive systems and packages. To
prevent this from happening, the Consent Decree must be modified to prohibit TCI/Liberty from withdrawing any programming
from a particular market unless the market in question is found to be subject to ``effective competition,'' as defined
by Section 623(l)(1) of the Act. Of course, TCI/Liberty might have legitimate reasons for the withdrawal of some programming.
Therefore, this prohibition would not apply to the extent that TCI/Liberty also withdrew the same programming from
all systems in which it has an interest. Once withdrawn, this programming could not be made subsequently available
to any TCI/Liberty system unless made generally available to all MSTDs under similar terms and conditions.

In addition to these serious deficiencies, the Consent Decreee allows TCI/Liberty broad latitude for 

de facto 

discrimination. For example, TCI/Liberty could construct a price per volume table so that most local packagers could
not afford appealing programming. TCI/Liberty could also set the volume price for programming high, charge this
high price to its own systems and utilize the greater profit to reward those systems meeting market retention and growth
incentive objectives. In essence, TCI/Liberty could provide its own systems with both incentives and a discount.
Careful scrutiny on a going-forward basis is therefore required if TCI/Liberty is to be restrained from crushing
developing competition.

Without rectification of these inadequacies, the court will not be able to affirmatively find ``the propriety and
equity of the decree proposed.'' Since the Consent Decree, as presently proposed, does not serve the public interest,
it must be modified or rejected by the Court.



IV. Conclusion



For the reasons stated hereinabove, GTE beleives that the Department must withdraw its stipulation to the Consent
Decree 

unless 

(1) the term of the existing provisions of the Consent Decree be increased to at least seven years, and (2) upon expiration
of this seven year period, TCI/Liberty is further restrained from withdrawing any programming from distribution
unless such programming is similarly withdrawn from all markets, specifically including all systems in which TCI
or Liberty has an interest, or the specific market from which it is withdrawn has been found to be subject to ``effective
competition'' within the meaning of Section 621(l)(1) of the Act.

<DOCTITLE>Controlled Substances: Proposed Aggregate Production Quotas for 1995 </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed aggregate production goals for 1995.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes initial 1995 aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II of
the Controlled Substances Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) requires that the Attorney General establish aggregate
production quotas for each basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedules I and II. This responsibility
has been delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The
Administrator, in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6,
1994).





The quotas are to provide adequate supplies of each substance for: (1) The estimated medical, scientific, research,
and industrial needs of the United States; (2) lawful export requirements; and (3) the establishment and maintenance
of reserve stocks. 

In determining the below listed proposed 1995 aggregate production quotas, the Deputy Administrator considered
the following factors: (1) Total actual 1993 and estimated 1994 and 1995 net disposals of each substance by all manufacturers;
(2) estimates of 1994 year end inventories of each substance and of any substance manufactured from it and trends in
accumulation of such inventories; and (3) projected demand as indicated by procurement quota applications filed
pursuant to  1303.12 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 

Pursuant to  1303.23(c) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Deputy Administrator of the DEA will,
in early 1995, adjust aggregate production quotas and individual manufacturing quotas allocated for the year based
upon 1994 year-end inventory and actual 1994 disposition data supplied by quota recipients for each basic class of
Schedule I or II controlled substance. 

Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970
(21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby
proposes that the aggregate production quotas for 1995 for the following controlled substances, expressed in grams
of anhydrous acid or base, be established as follows: 






Aggregate production quotas for all other Schedules I and II controlled substances included in   1308.11
and 1308.12 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations are established at zero. 

All interested persons are invited to submit their comments and objections in writing regarding this proposal. A
person may object to or comment on the proposal relating to any of the above-mentioned substances without filing comments
or objections regarding the others. If a person believes that one or more of these issues warrant a hearing, the individual
should so state and summarize the reasons for this belief. 

In the event that comments or objections to this proposal raise one or more issues which the Deputy Administrator finds
warrant a hearing, the Deputy Administrator shall order a public hearing by notice in the 

Federal Register

, summarizing the issues to be heard and setting the time for the hearing. 

The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C., 601, 

et seq

. The establishment of annual aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated
by law and by international treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large
manufacturers, their impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator
has determined that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

<DOCTITLE>Avner Kauffman, M.D.; Denial of Application for Registration</DOCTITLE>


On April 7, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Avner Kauffman, M.D., (Respondent), 12620 S. Harlem Avenue, Palos Heights,
Illinois 60463. The Order to Show Cause sought to deny Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration,
alleging that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21
U.S.C. 823(f).
The Order to Show Cause asserted in part that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest
in light of his 1985 felony conviction for delivery of a controlled substance. Respondent's previous DEA Certificate
of Registration was revoked by the DEA in September 1985. The Order to Show Cause further alleged that following the
revocation of Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, he continued to prescribe controlled substances in
violation of the Controlled Substances Act.
Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the allegations raised in the Order to Show Cause and the matter
was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On September 29 and 30, 1992, a hearing was
held in Chicago, Illinois. On September 22, 1993, the administrative law judge issued her opinion, recommended ruling,
findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision. Neither the Government nor Respondent filed exceptions to the
recommended ruling. On October 22, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record in this proceeding
to the Administrator. Having considered the record in its entirety, and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, the Deputy Administrator
hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below.
At the hearing, a lieutenant from the Illinois State Police testified that on January 27, 1984, he purchased 2.2 grams
of cocaine from Respondent during an undercover investigation. The next contact between the two occurred on January
31, 1984, when the lieutenant spoke to Respondent on the telephone. During the conversation, Respondent informed
the lieutenant that he would sell the lieutenant half an ounce of cocaine for $1,100. Respondent and the lieutenant
met later that day, but Respondent was unable to deliver the cocaine as discussed. Respondent, however, gave the lieutenant
six tablets of Seconal, a Schedule II controlled substance. Respondent did not conduct a physical examination of
the lieutenant and the Seconal was not provided for any medical purpose. Additionally, Respondent offered to provide
the lieutenant with Quaaludes, then a Schedule II controlled substance. During their meeting, Respondent also informed
the lieutenant that he had once smuggled a kilogram of cocaine from Florida; had previously lost about $30,000 worth
of cocaine in bad drug deals; and could obtain another kilogram of cocaine for $50,000 if the lieutenant were interested.
The lieutenant and Respondent next spoke on February 1, 1984, to discuss another cocaine purchase. At a meeting later
that night at Respondent's office, the lieutenant bought 14 grams of cocaine from Respondent for $1,100. During the
meeting, Respondent commented on the quality of the cocaine and promised that it was better than the cocaine previously
sold to the lieutenant. The lieutenant testified that this was the last time he purchased cocaine from Respondent,
although he attempted additional undercover buys on several occasions.
Respondent was arrested on February 9, 1984. Following his arrest, Respondent stated that he had purchased cocaine
``10-15'' times and had smoked cocaine. Respondent was indicted on March 2, 1984, on three counts of delivery
of a controlled substance. Respondent pled guilty to one count and was sentenced on February 1, 1985, to three years
probation and a $3,000 fine.
As a result of his conviction, on March 23, 1984, the Illinois Department of Registration and Education summarily
suspended Respondent's controlled substance license. In June 1985, Respondent entered into a Consent Agreement
suspending Respondent's medical license but staying the suspension, placing him on probation and suspending his
controlled substance license for five years. Respondent was further ordered to perform 120 hours of volunteer medical
service for each year of probation, to continue psychiatric treatment, and to file biennial reports certifying compliance
with these conditions. Based on his lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances, the then-Administrator
of the Drug Enforcement Administration revoked Respondent's previous DEA Certificate of Registration, effective
September 23, 1985.

Respondent's Illinois Physician and Surgeon License expired on July 31, 1987. He continued to practice medicine
but did not renew his license until December 1988. In April 1990, the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation
(IDPR) issued an order finding that Respondent had practiced medicine without a license, reprimanded him, and imposed
a $1,000 fine. At the hearing in this matter, Respondent admitted that he had a made a mistake by not renewing his license
immediately. 


Respondent filed an application for registration with the 
DEA on June 8, 1990. At that time, a DEA investigator conducted 
a pharmacy survey for the period 1988-1990. The investigator 
found that five prescriptions for controlled substances had been 
called in to local pharmacies, allegedly by Respondent, after his 
DEA Certificate of Registration was revoked. Some prescriptions 
 contained the names and DEA registration numbers of other doctors 
and had Respondent's name crossed out on the prescription. One 
prescription contained Respondent's retired DEA registration 
number and another contained Respondent's revoked DEA 
registration number. Respondent testified during the hearing in 
this matter that he may have authorized the prescriptions and 


 explained that he mistakenly thought that he was permitted to 
prescribe controlled substances. Respondent added that in late 
1990, after consulting his attorney, he ``completely stopped'' 
authorizing prescriptions for controlled substances. 

 


An investigator with IDPR testified that in 1991 he began an 
investigation of Respondent after receiving a complaint from a 
 local pharmacist. The pharmacist was concerned about 
Respondent's use of the non-controlled substance Stadol. The 
pharmacist found Respondent's purchases of Stadol unusual for a 
pediatrician. Testimony was presented at the hearing regarding 
Respondent's alleged misuse of Stadol. However, as the 
administrative law judge correctly noted, Stadol is not a 
controlled substance. Therefore, these allegations were not 
granted great weight by either the administrative law judge or 
the Deputy Administrator. 



Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), the Deputy 
Administrator may revoke a DEA Certificate of Registration or 
deny an application for registration if he determines that the registration would be inconsistent with the public
interest. Section 823(f) requires that the following factors be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate
State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing, or
conducting research with respect to controlled substances: (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal
or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; 


 (4) compliance with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other
conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. 


The Deputy Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors when determining whether an application
should be denied or a registration revoked. See Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S., 51 FR 17556 (1986); Anne L. Hendricks,
M.D. 51 FR 41030 (1986). The administrative law judge correctly found that all these factors were relevant to a determination
of whether Respondent's registration would be in the public interest. 


The Deputy Administrator finds that the Illinois licensing board, IDPR, has taken action against Respondent on more
than one occasion. IDPR summarily suspended Respondent's controlled substance license based on his felony conviction
and later reprimanded him for practicing without a license. The Deputy Administrator also finds that Respondent's
past conduct indicates a cavalier attitude towards the dispensing and prescribing of controlled substances. Providing
the undercover officer with Seconal for no legitimate medical purpose reveals a serious lack of judgment, as does
Respondent's explanation for his continued prescribing of controlled substances following the revocation of his
DEA Certificate of Registration. Respondent's felony conviction for distribution of cocaine again evidences a
dangerous indifference for the law. This conviction, along with Respondent's failure to abide by DEA regulations,
proves that 



 Respondent cannot be trusted to comply with laws relating to controlled substances. 

The Deputy Administrator agrees with the administrative law judge that, after considering the applicable factors
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), Respondent's registration would not be in the public interest and adopts her recommended
decision in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant
to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that
Avner Kauffman's application for registration be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective August 4, 1994.

Timothy H. Reese, M.D. Denial of Application 



On September 29, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Timothy H. Reese, M.D. (Respondent), of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, proposing
to deny his application for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f).

Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was
placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing
was held in Arlington, Virginia, on May 18, 1993. On March 8, 1994, in her findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended
ruling, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's application for DEA registration be denied.
No exceptions were filed by either party. 

On April 8, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator
has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final
order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. 

The administrative law judge found that the Respondent is an emergency room physician who completed a three-year
residency in family practice in 1977, and then became affiliated with medical groups that provided emergency room
coverage for various hospitals. Respondent also maintained a small, private practice until April 1989. 

In 1984, an investigator for the Ohio State Medical Board (Board) obtained from a pharmacy various prescriptions
for controlled substances written by Respondent. Most of the prescriptions bore the address of Respondent's residence,
and were written for members of Respondent's family. The investigator interviewed some of Respondent's family members
that were purportedly issued prescriptions by the Respondent, and they denied ever receiving prescriptions for
him. 

Thereafter, the Board subpoenaed Respondent's patient records, however, Respondent indicated that they had been
destroyed. Respondent was then requested to appear before the Board to explain why he wrote the prescriptions at issue.
In his deposition before the Board, Respondent states that he did not know what controlled substances were, what schedules
certain controlled substances were in, and that he wrote these prescriptions mainly for weight loss. In 1986, the
Board's investigation of Respondent concluded with no charges being filed.

In 1989, a sergeant with the Columbus (Ohio) Police Department, Narcotics Bureau (Narcotics Bureau), was informed
by local pharmacists of their suspicions regarding prescriptions issued by the Respondent. The prescriptions were
for large quantities of controlled substances, typically Dilaudid. The pharmacists were unfamiliar with the patients
bringing in the prescriptions, and the patients named on the prescriptions did not have local addresses.


The pharmacists further informed the Narcotics Bureau sergeant that the physician's telephone number listed on
some of the prescriptions was disconnected, and that other prescriptions bore telephone numbers either at emergency
rooms in Pennsylvania, or a residence in Westerville, Ohio. A confidential informant later advised the Narcotics
Bureau that Respondent wrote prescriptions to members of his family and friends, and they in turn returned the prescribed
drugs to Respondent, who used them to treat his wife's heroin addiction. As a result of this information, the Narcotics
Bureau seized a number of Dilaudid prescriptions issued by Respondent from local pharmacies.

The investigation by the Narcotics Bureau also revealed that: One of the individuals that attempted to fill a controlled
substance prescription was seen by the pharmacist driving a car registered to Respondent's address; several of the
individuals did not reside at the address listed on their prescriptions; an individual stated that she used cocaine
while in Respondent's home, sold cocaine to Respondent, and was offered cocaine by the Respondent to fill a prescription,
which she refused; Respondent asked the same individual to fill a prescription for Dilaudid, and the individual later
prepared syringes of Dilaudid and water that Respondent's wife injected; all of the telephone numbers for Respondent
on the prescriptions corresponded to emergency rooms in Pennsylvania. Respondent testified at the hearing, that
someone falsified his signature on the prescriptions found by the Narcotics Bureau.


Respondent testified that after he and his wife separated in April 1989, and he moved from their Westerville, Ohio
residence, he believed that his wife continued to live in the residence until her eviction for non-payment of rent.
Respondent further testified that he left behind all of his belongings, including prescription pads printed with
the address of his residence.


In August 1989, a DEA diversion investigator observed the wife's eviction from Respondent's home. Among the items
removed from the home and subsequently recovered by DEA, were drug paraphernalia items, including a white powder
substance in a plastic container and pipes containing residue. The items later tested positive for sodium bicarbonate,
oxycodone, and cocaine. The Narcotics Bureaus sergeant testified at the hearing that despite the information disclosed
by the investigation, the Respondent was not criminally charged because he moved out of the State of Ohio.

Following Respondent's relocation to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on October 26, 1989, DEA informed him that
he was under investigation for diverting Dilaudid. In response to this information, Respondent surrendered his
DEA registration.

On March 31, 1991, Respondent executed an application for DEA registration, and answered affirmatively, the question
regarding whether he had ever surrendered a previous registration. DEA then initiated a pre-registration investigation
of the Respondent. The investigation revealed that, in 1990, when Respondent began working for a physicians' group
that provided medical services, he informed his employer that he was registered with DEA, and provided his surrendered
registration number. DEA later obtained Respondent's application for employment at a health care facility in Mount
Pleasant, Pennsylvania, where Respondent was associated as an emergency room physician. In response to a question
on the application for employment regarding his registration status, Respondent again stated that he held a current
DEA registration, and listed his surrendered registration number. DEA also discovered numerous prescriptions
issued by Respondent in 1990 and 1991, in which he repeatedly used his surrendered DEA registration number.

Respondent testified that his wife used heroin and cocaine, that she was taking methadone, and that she had access
to his DEA number. Respondent also testified that he has never abused drugs, been charged with using drugs, or kept
drug paraphernalia in his home. Respondent acknowledged however that he never informed his employers of the surrender
of his DEA registration, because his lack of registration would preclude his employment. Respondent further acknowledged
that he wrote prescriptions for controlled substances after the surrender of his DEA registration because his work
required him to do so, and that he needed his DEA registration to continue his career as an emergency room physician.

Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), the Deputy Administrator may deny any application for such registration, if he determines
that the continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. In determining the public interest,
the following factors are considered:


(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.


(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing controlled substances.


(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the distribution, or dispensing of
controlled substances.


(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.


(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.

It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on any one or a combination of the factors and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. See


Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D.,

 Docket No. 88-42, 54 FR 16422 (1989).

In considering whether grounds exist to deny Respondent's application for DEA registration, the administrative
law judge found factors two, four and five relevant in light of evidence regarding Respondent's falsification of
employment applications, representing that he held a DEA registration after he had surrendered the registration;
and, Respondent's issuing of prescriptions for controlled substances using his surrendered DEA registration number.


The administrative law judge found, that despite Respondent's explanations regarding his falsifying employment
applications and writing prescriptions with a surrendered DEA registration number, Respondent showed no remorse,
and appeared to consider his actions justified by exigent circumstances. The administrative law judge also found
with respect to the prescriptions for Dilaudid, that Respondent's testimony was not responsive nor particularly
credible. The administrative law judge further found that Respondent's admission that other persons, including
his wife whom Respondent knew to be a drug abuser, had access to his prescription pads, showed that Respondent had little
respect for the responsibilities of being a DEA registrant. 

Judge Bittner concluded that the preponderance of the credible evidence established that it is unlikely that Respondent
would competently or reliably discharge the obligations inherent in a DEA registration, and further concluded that
it would not be in the public interest to grant his application. Therefore, the administrative law judge recommended
that Respondent's application for DEA registration be denied.

The Deputy Administrator having considered the entire record adopts the administrative law judge's findings of
fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and
0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that the application for registration, executed by Timothy H. Reese, M.D., be,
and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective August 4, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>James H. Sanders, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>


On October 12, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to James H. Sanders, M.D. (Respondent), of Barbourville, Kentucky.
The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Sanders' DEA Certificate of Registration, AS6935918, and deny any pending
applications for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent was not currently
authorized to handle controlled substances in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and that Respondent's continued registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).
The Order to Show Cause alleged that: Since 1986, DEA received complaints regarding Respondent's excessive prescribing
of controlled substances to individuals for no legitimate medical reason; between December 1991 and September 1992,
DEA conducted an undercover investigation during which Respondent prescribed controlled substances to undercover
agents upon request without performing any physical examination or taking a medical history; during the investigation,
Respondent was observed prescribing controlled substances to other individuals in the same manner as he issued prescriptions
to the undercover agents; in October 1992, DEA conducted a prescription survey of five pharmacies in Barbourville,
Kentucky, which revealed that between April 1, 1992 and October 29, 1992, Respondent prescribed 229,090 dosage units
of controlled substances; and on December 9, 1992, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, State Board of Medical Licensure
(Board) seized 43 patient records from Respondent's office.
The Order to Show Cause further alleged that on January 21, 1993, the Board issued an Order of Temporary Suspension
suspending Respondent's license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. On March 2, 1993, the Board
lifted the suspension of Respondent's medical license, however, his controlled substances privileges remained
suspended. As a result, Respondent is no longer authorized by state law to handle controlled substances.
Respondent, through counsel, filed a request for a hearing on the issues raised by the order to Show Cause, and the matter
was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On November 19, 1993, the Government filed a motion
for summary disposition, which was accompanied by a letter from the General Counsel to the Board, dated October 20,
1993, as to the status of Respondent's controlled substance privileges in Kentucky. The Government argued that since
Respondent is not currently authorized in the Commonwealth of Kentucky to handle controlled substances, DEA could
not continue to maintain his registration.
On December 14, 1993, Respondent filed a response to the Government's motion, asserting, in substance, that Respondent's
state license had been temporarily restricted to limit his ability to prescribe controlled substances and that on
February 22, 1994, the Board would reach a final decision regarding Respondent's privileges to practice medicine
in Kentucky.
On December 20, 1993, the administrative law judge issued a Memorandum to Counsel affording Respondent until March
15, 1994, to file a statement as to the status of his authority to handle controlled substances in Kentucky. No such
statement has been filed.
On April 7, 1994, in her opinion and recommended decision, the administrative law judge found that the Respondent
did not deny that his state license to practice medicine has been restricted. The administrative law judge therefore,
granted the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration
be revoked.
On May 10, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator
has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final
order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.
The Deputy Administrator adopts the opinion and recommended decision of the administrative law judge in its entirety.
The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly
authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f)
and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See 

James H. Nickens, M.D., 

57 FR 59847 (1992); 

Elliott Monroe, M.D., 

57 FR 23246 (1992); 

Bobby Watts, M.D., 

53 FR 11919 (1988).
The administrative law judge properly granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. It is well-settled
that when no question of fact is involved, or when the facts are agreed upon, a plenary, adversary administrative proceeding
involving evidence and cross-examination of witnesses is not obligatory. The rationale is that Congress does not
intend administrative agencies to perform meaningless tasks.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Changes in the Chicago Basket


July 28, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on July 22, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange submits the following proposed rule change to amend the first paragraph of Interpretation and Policy
.01 of Rule 3 of Article XXXVI. The remainder of Interpretation and Policy .01 would remain unchanged. Specifically,
the changed language is as follows:



Additions are 

italicized

; deletions [bracketed]
.01 The Chicago Basket (CXM)



The Exchange will trade a basket of stocks based upon the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's stock index XMI futures contract
(the ``Merc Futures Contract''). The CXM will consist of the stocks included in the Merc Futures Contract in a fixed
quantity of [25] 

5

 shares of each of the stocks included in the futures contract.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of the proposed change is to reduce the size of the Chicago Basket (``CXM'') from 25 shares of each component
stock to 5 shares of each component stock, in order to permit more entities and persons to be able to trade the CXM basket.
The rules that permit the CXM basket to be traded on the Exchange were submitted for Commission approval and were approved
on October 15, 1993.





The CXM basket would not be comprised of a new fixed quantity of shares (5 instead of 25) of each of the stocks included
in a futures contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This XMI futures contract is based on the American
Stock Exchange's Major Market Index (``MMI''). The MMI is a broad-based, price-weighted index currently based on
20 stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.


2. Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments to and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CHX. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CHX-94-18
and should be submitted by August 25, 1994.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change Relating to Clearance and Settlement Requirements for NASD Member Firms That Are Market Makers in the Nasdaq
Stock Market or the OTC Bulletin Board

 

 Service</DOCTITLE>



July 28, 1994.



On May 23, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The rule change amends Section 7 of Part V to Schedule D of the NASD By-Laws
 and Section 4 of the OTC Bulletin Board

 

 Service (``OTCBB'') Rules
 relating to clearance and settlement requirements of NASD member firms functioning as market makers in the Nasdaq
Stock Market (``Nasdaq'') or the OTCBB.








Under the rule as amended, market makers will either be required to utilize the facilities of a registered clearing
agency that uses a continuous net settlement system or, if both parties to a transaction agree, to settle the transaction
``ex-clearing.'' The rule change applies to market makers in Nasdaq securities as well as to OTCBB market makers whose
transactions in OTCBB securities are clearing eligible.

Notice of the proposed rule change, together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission release
 and by publication in the 

Federal Register

.
 No comments were received in response to the Notice. This order approves the proposed rule change.






As the NASD indicated in its rule filing, the Automated Confirmation Transaction Service (``ACT'') is the primary
facility for collecting, processing, and disseminating transaction reports on Nasdaq securities as well as equity
issues quoted in the OTCBB.
 ACT also facilitates the clearance and settlement of inter-member transactions by locking-in trade details for
transmission to the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'').
 The generation of locked-in trades by ACT enhances the overall efficiency of the clearance and settlement process
and virtually eliminates a member's risk exposure respecting uncompared trades. These benefits cannot be realized,
however, unless the broker-dealers on both sides of the trade have some form of participation in a registered clearing
agency.








The rule change will increase participation in registered clearing agencies due to the elimination of the ``25 mile
exception'' from Section 7(a) in Part V of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws.
 Prior to the amendment, the ``25 mile exception'' allowed market makers in SmallCap

SM

 securities, that did not participate in the Small Order Execution System'' SOES'') and were located more than 25 miles
from a clearing facility, to bypass the requirement of clearing and settling transactions through a registered clearing
agency. The rule, as amended, eliminates this exception and requires market makers in Nasdaq securities to utilize
the facilities of a registered clearing agency that uses a continuous net settlement system, unless both parties
to a transaction agree to settle the transaction ``exclearing.''





Participation in registered clearing agencies will also increase due to the imposition of clearance and settlement
requirements on market makers in OTCBB securities.
 Market makers in these securities will be required to clear and settle transactions that are clearing eligible
 through the facilities of a registered clearing agency that uses a continuous net settlement system, unless both
parties to a transaction agree to settle the transaction ``exclearing.''






The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. As a result of the amendment, parallel requirements
will exist for the two largest equity market segments in which NASD members function as market makers and utilize ACT
for trade reporting and comparison purposes.
 The Commission finds that the rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements of Sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b)(6), and 17A(a)(1)
of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) contains the Congressional findings that have guided development of the National Market
System. These findings include a directive to apply state-of-art data processing and communications techniques
to achieve more efficient and effective market operations and to ensure the economical execution of securities orders.
Similarly, Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities association
be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and
processing information with respect to, and facilitation transactions in securities. Finally, Section 17A(a)(1)
reflects the statutory goals of a national system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions. These
goals include the application of new data processing and communications techniques to create the opportunity for
more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement.





The Commission finds that the new clearance and settlement requirements are consistent with the foregoing statutory
provisions. In sum, the rule change will further the objectives of minimizing risk exposure from uncompared trades
and fostering optimal usage of ACT to lock-in the details of individual trades prior to their submission to a registered
clearing agency.








It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change, SR-NASD-94-28 be, and hereby
is, approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to Restrictions on Orders in Multiply Traded Options Entered by Specialists and Registered Options Traders
for Execution on Other Exchanges</DOCTITLE>



July 29, 1994.



On December 14, 1992, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act;''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change relating to restrictions on entering orders in multiply traded options. Notice of the proposal
appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on March 12, 1993.
 One comment letter was received opposing the proposed rule change,
 to which the Phlx responded.
 This order approves the Exchange's proposal.









Description of Proposal



The Phlx proposes to adopt Advice B-12, which would extend the prohibitions contained in Phlx Rule 1014 and Phlx
Advice B-4, regarding off-floor opening orders for options traded on multiple exchanges. Currently, Commentary
.14 to Phlx Rule 1014 and Phlx Advice B-4 prohibit a Registered Options Trader (``ROT'') from placing an opening
order for their market functions account from off-floor. The Phlx now seeks to restrict Phlx ROTs and specialists
from sending orders which would establish or increase a position in registered options to other exchanges from off
of the Phlx options trading floor. Before an opening order initiated from the Phlx equity options floor may be sent
to another market for execution, it must first clear the crowd at the Phlx when the bid or offer of the order is on or between
the Phlx disseminated market.
 Pursuant to the proposal, ROTs and specialists would be required to place their off-floor opening positions in their
customer accounts, regardless of whether the execution of such orders occurs on the Phlx or on another exchange.
 The fine schedule for proposed Advice B-12 would run on a three year cycle, such that repeat violations within
a three-year period would result in escalating fines.

Comment Letter



The CBOE believes that the Phlx proposal raises implications regarding the multiple listing of options which should
be dealt with on a uniform basis by the options exchanges.
 Specifically, the CBOE believes that the proposal would allow Phlx specialists and ROTs, who enter transactions
from the Phlx options floor, to obtain ``good faith'' margin treatment for options transactions executed on other
exchanges even if there is little or no activity in those options on the Phlx and the transactions have no relationship
to the specialists' and ROTs' performance at the Phlx. As a result, the CBOE believes that multiple listing could be
used as a means of giving the floor members of options exchanges preferred access to options traded on other exchanges
without regard to whether there is any meaningful competition in those options between the exchanges.
 The CBOE suggests that specialists and ROTs should be required to effect a certain percentage (

e.g.

, 75%) of their contract volume in a class of options on the exchange on which they act as a specialist or ROT before being
entitled to effect transactions on other exchanges in that options class through their market functions accounts.








Phlx Response



The Phlx refutes the arguments raised by the CBOE.
 The Phlx states that by seeking to ensure that Phlx floor traders conduct their market making functions from the Phlx
equity options floor where they can best meet their affirmative and negative market making obligations, the proposal
merely brings the Phlx's rules into line with the existing rules of the other options exchanges, including the CBOE's.
As a result, the Phlx contends that the proposal does not raise the implications contemplated by the CBOE of ``disparate,
competitive treatment by the different options exchanges.''







Additionally, the Phlx argues that it has rules in place addressing the competitive concerns raised by the CBOE. Pursuant
to Phlx Advice B-3, ROTs are required to trade in person, and not through the use of orders, the greater of 1,000
contracts or 50% of their contract volume on the Exchange in each quarter.
 Additionally, at least 50% of a ROT's trading activity in each quarter must be in assigned options classes. Proposed
Advice B-12 does not alter the application of Advice B-3. As a result, the Phlx argues that specialists
and ROTs would not be able to obtain good faith margin treatment for a significant number of transactions executed
on other markets relative to the number of trades that they must execute on the Phlx equity options floor, regardless
of the level of trading activity in their assigned options classes at the Phlx.







Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5)
 in that the proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable
principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission finds that the
proposal is a reasonable extension of the Phlx's existing rules by according the same treatment to all transactions
initiated from off the Phlx floor, without regard to whether the transactions are executed on the Phlx or another exchange.
The Commission agrees with the Exchange that this restriction should serve to ensure that Phlx floor traders are conducting
their market making activities from on the floor where they can best meet their affirmative and negative market making
obligations.

The Commission appreciates the concerns raised by the CBOE; however, the Commission believes that the Phlx has adequate
rules and procedures to ensure that Exchange ROTs and specialists can obtain market-maker treatment for options
trades executed on other exchanges only where they perform a real market-making function for such options on the Phlx
floor. First, under Section 11(b) of the Act,
 Rule 11b-1 thereunder
 and Phlx Rule 1014, specialists and ROTs are required to engage in a course of dealings in a manner reasonably calculated
to contribute to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. This ensures that trades by such persons are for the purposes
of fulfilling market-making obligations under the Act. Secondly, Exchange Advice B-3 minimizes the opportunity
for ROTs to obtain good faith margin for a significant number of trades executed on other exchanges. By requiring that
the greater of 1,000 contracts or 50% of their contract volume be executed on the Exchange in each quarter
 and that at least 50% of their contract volume be in assigned classes in each quarter. Advice B-3 effectively
ensures that market-makers will not be able to use the Phlx floor simply to send orders to other markets but instead
will have substantive obligations that ensure they are acting as a bona fide market-maker.









In summary, the Commission notes that only market makers who are conducting bona fide market making activity on the
Phlx floor are entitled to good faith margin treatment for their options transactions. As a result of the above, the
Commission does not believe that the current proposal would result in disparate, competitive treatment by the options
exchange, as envisioned by the CBOE.








It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PHlx-92-12) is hereby approved.







For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Relating to its Order and Decorum Regulations</DOCTITLE>



July 28, 1994.



I. Introduction



On March 10, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend Regulation 4 (``Order'') of the Exchange's Rule 60 order and decorum regulations.
On March 31, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 On June 22, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change.









The proposed rule change was published for comment in the Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34244 (June 22, 1994),
59 FR 33314 (June 28, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change
as amended.



II. Description of the Proposal



The Phlx is amending Regulation 4 of the Exchange's order and decorum regulations,
 which were adopted pursuant to Phlx Rule 60 (``Assessments for Breach of Regulations'').
 Regulation 4, Paragraph (i) (redesignated Paragraph (a)) currently prohibits members/participants or employees
of a member/participant from engaging in disorderly conduct on the trading floor, and imposes fines for violations
thereof. In addition to a general prohibition against disorderly conduct in Paragraph (a), Subparagraphs (ii) through
(iv) currently impose specific fines for abuse of the paging system, possession of firearms, and various degrees
of fighting, including inciting physical abuse, minor acts of physical abuse and major acts of physical abuse.

<TEXT>
 

The Phlx is amending Regulation 4, Paragraph (a) to prohibit indecorous conduct on the trading floor which is disruptive
to the conduct of business on the floor. The Exchange is also adopting Sub-Paragraph (iv) to Regulation 4 to impose
a fine ranging from $500 to $1,000 for abusive, derisive or harassing treatment directed at any person while on the
floor, which, in the view of two floor officials, could constitute a public embarrassment to the Exchange.
Finally, the Exchange is adopting Paragraph (b) to Regulation 4 stating that any acts described in paragraph (a) which
are deemed particularly egregious, or where an individual has established a pattern of order violations, may be referred
by two floor officials to the Business Conduct Committee where additional fines and other sanctions may be imposed
pursuant to Phlx Rule 960. As a result of this adopted language, similar language which currently follows the paragraph
addressing physical abuse in Regulation 4 is being deleted to apply the new paragraph to all violations of Regulation
4.
The Exchange believes that the amendment is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with
Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors and
the public interested by ensuring an orderly and decorous environment on the trading floor for Exchange business
to be conducted. The proposal is also consistent with Section 5(b)(6), in that Regulation 4, as amended, would continue
to provide that members of the Exchange be appropriately disciplined for violations of the rules of the Exchange.


III. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with the requirements
of Sections 6(b)(5), (6) and (7) of the Act.





The Commission believes that the Phlx's amendments are a reasonable measure which should help to ensure the orderly
operation of the Exchange floor. The proposal addresses the operational concerns by explicitly prohibiting indecorous
conduct that is disruptive to business on the Exchange's trading floor. The Commission believes that the amendment
to Regulation 4 should contribute to the Phlx's efforts to ensure the efficient, undisrupted conduct of business
on the Exchange and provide a trading floor environment free from conduct that could distract or interfere with market
activity. As a result, the rule change should enhance the members' ability to engage in transactions in securities
and, thereby, protect investors and the public interest.
The Commission believes that the proposed amendments provide appropriate penalties for violations of Regulation
4. Specifically, the adopted range of fines ($500 to $1,000) that can be imposed for abusive, derisive or harassing
conduct on the floor which is determined by two floor officials to constitute a public embarrassment to the Exchange
is reasonable in relation to the infractions in question because of the Phlx's interest in ensuring the safety of its
floor personnel and the undisrupted conduct of business on the Exchange. Moreover, because the rule change defines
the scope of prohibited conduct, provides notice to members, provides a right of appeal, and is tailored to serve a
legitimate Exchange regulatory interest to ensure that trading can continue undisrupted on the Phlx floor, the proposal
provides fair and reasonable procedures for the regulation of trading floor conduct.
The Commission also believes that it is appropriate for the Exchange to retain discretion to pursue formal disciplinary
proceedings in accordance with Phlx Rule 960 for egregious violations or where an individual has established a pattern
of order violations. This will enable the Exchange to seek stiffer sanctions where warranted by the scope and nature
of the violative conduct. The Commission, however, emphasizes that when an Exchange investigation results in a full
disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Rule 960, all procedural rights provided in the Rule would apply.







It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Phlx-94-14) is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Changes to Amend the Philadelphia Depository
Trust Company's and the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia's By-Laws Regarding the Composition of the Respective
Boards of Directors and Nominating Committees</DOCTITLE>



July 27, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on July 14, 1994, the Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (``Philadep'') and the Stock
Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia (``SCCP'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-Philadep-94-01 and SR-SCCP-94-03) as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by Philadep and SCCP. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested parties.





I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Changes



The proposed rule changes respectively amend Philadep By-Laws Article IV, Section 2 and Article III, Section 4 and
SCCP By-Laws Article IV, Section 2 and Article III, Section 4. These sections set forth the requirements for the composition
of the Boards of Directors and Nominating Committees.



II. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statements Regarding the Proposed Rule Changes



In their filings with the Commission, Philadep and SCCP included statements concerning the purpose of and the basis
for the proposed rule changes and discussed any comments received on the proposed rule changes. The text of these statements
may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Philadep and SCCP have prepared summaries, as set forth in
sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of these statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of and the Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Changes



In order to ease the administrative burden, Philadep and SCCP propose to amend their By-Laws to remove the requirement
that the two Vice Chairmen of the Board of Governors of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'') serve as ex-officio
members of the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors. The proposed amendments will install the Chief Operating Officer
of the PHLX both as an ex-officio member of the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors and as the Vice Chairman of the Philadep
and SCCP Boards. The proposed amendments will reduce the requisite number of PHLX Governors who must serve on the Philadep
and SCCP Boards of Directors from a majority of the fifteen to seventeen Directors to six of the Directors. The proposed
amendments will change the term of office for the Boards of Directors for the purpose of qualifying PHLX Governors
as Philadep and SCCP Directors.






Presently, under Article III Section 4(a) of the Philadep and SCCP By-Laws, the Nominating Committee must consist
of five ex-officio members of the Board of Directors and two other persons appointed by the Chairman of the Board. Under
the proposed rule change, the number of members on the Nominating Committee will consist of four ex-officio members
of the Board of Directors and three other persons appointed by the Chairman of the Board.

As composed under the proposed rule changes, the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors will continue to provide the
PHLX, as the sole shareholder of both Philadep and SCCP, with adequate representation. The PHLX will be represented
by both senior exchange staff personnel and members of the PHLX Board of Governors, who typically also represent Philadep
and SCCP participant firms. In accordance with Philadep's and SCCP's amendment processes delineated in By-Law Article
XI, the Chairman of the PHLX Board of Governors, as agent for the sole shareholder and parent corporation, has signed
a unanimous consent in lieu of a special meeting to effectuate the foregoing changes.

The proposed rule changes comply with Section 17A of the Act insofar as they will aid Philadep and SCCP in assuring the
fair representation of shareholders and participants in the selection of directors and in the administration of
affairs.






B. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Burden on Competition



Philadep and SCCP do not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose any burden on competition.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. To Establish
a Northbound Trading Linkage With the Montreal Stock Exchange</DOCTITLE>



July 28, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 7, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The BSE seeks to commence northbound trading pursuant to its linkage with the Montreal Stock Exchange (``ME'').



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



Securities markets are becoming increasingly international, reacting to many of the same economic and political
events that affect the rest of the world. The globalization of these markets is driven by several factors, but advances
in automation and telecommunications have propelled its rapid growth. Factors driving this globalization include
investors' desire to enter foreign markets, the growth of large institutional funds needing to decrease risk by diversifying
investments in other countries, and regulatory changes that opened markets to foreign broker-dealer firms and their
customers. 

Effective international securities markets require efficient and valuable systems for order routing and execution,
information dissemination, and clearance and settlement. Most major and emerging markets have automated or plan
to automate all or some of these functions to take advantage of efficiency, competition and market expansion opportunities.

The Commission in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25284 stated that the international securities market should
feature efficient structures for quotation, price and volume dissemination concerning securities and derivatives
markets traded worldwide.
 A critical step in achieving a worldwide securities market information system would be the creation and maintenance
of international linkages between the automated information systems of the various national securities markets.
Such a link was established between the BSE and the ME in 1984 for orders in U.S. stocks transmitted southbound from
Montreal to Boston. This rule proposal is designed to complete the ``loop'' with orders in Canadian stocks being routed
northbound from Boston to Montreal.







The proposed rule change seeks to commence northbound trading pursuant to the trading linkage previously established
with the ME.
 This would provide an additional means for U.S. customers to place orders in Canadian stocks with U.S. brokers for
execution on the ME. These orders would be entered into the broker/dealers' order-match systems which are linked
to the BSE's BEACON system. BEACON would receive and log the details of the order and pass it on to the ME's automated
order-routing and execution system. The order would contain the terms for the price, if any, stated in Canadian dollars,
and an identifier indicating that its transmission is for the ME. The ME system would also log the order and direct it
to the specialist's electronic book for action. These orders will be treated as would any other order sent to the ME
floor.





Upon execution, the customer report would be sent from the specialist's book through the ME system to the BEACON system,
with both systems logging in the details of the report, then to the broker/dealer's order-match system. BEACON will
essentially function as a conduit for the benefit of member firms who today conduct this business through correspondents.
While BEACON will keep detailed records of all traffic, it will not function as an execution system for Canadian stocks,
nor show quotes in Canadian stocks, and it will not be advertised as such.

<TEXT>
 

The trades would be cleared pursuant to the BSE member's agreement with a Canadian correspondent to clear and settle
trades at the Canadian Depository for Securities (``CDS'') on their behalf. BSE members would give up a valid CDS account
at execution and would be treated like a customer of the Canadian correspondent. This is the clearing arrangement
that U.S. broker/dealers currently utilize in clearing trades in Canadian stocks.

The ME is an affiliate member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') and as such has elected to participate
in the ISG investigative procedures.
 This structure will enhance the level of cooperation between the BSE and ME surveillance departments with regard
to transactions executed through the link, as is currently done today with southbound orders. Essentially, each
northbound trade will be entered into the ME's electronic book and will therefore be subject to the ME's on-line stock
trading monitoring system (``SECMA''). The ME currently focuses its trading reviews on insider trading, trading
on non-public market information (``front running''), price manipulation (Market fraud of various types), short
squeeze, short sales down ticking, normal course issue of bid up ticking, and restrictions on trading by members involved
in a distribution.





In conducting these types of trading reviews, the ME utilizes price alerts, volume alerts, exception reports based
on high-lows and closing prices, as well as other technical information analysis and graphics that are available.



2. Statutory Basis



The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(5) in that the rule is designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to,
and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the BSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-BSE-94-01

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board Relating to Reports of Sales or Purchases, and Procedures for Reporting Inter-dealer Transactions Pursuant
to Rule G-14</DOCTITLE>





July 28, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 20, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSRB-94-9).
The proposed rule change is described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Board. The
Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Board is filing a proposal to amend Board rule G-14, concerning reports of sales or purchases, and procedures
for reporting inter-dealer transactions (hereafter collectively referred to as ``the proposed rule change'').
 The proposed rule change states that it is the duty of brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers to report
transactions in municipal securities to the Board or its designee, and describes procedures for reporting.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The texts of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Board has prepared summaries, set forth in Section (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



(a) Purpose



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to achieve a certain degree of transparency in the municipal securities
market in a cost-effective manner by collecting and disseminating information on inter-dealer transactions. Under
the proposed rule change, aggregate data about market activity and certain volume and price information about frequently
traded securities would be disseminated to promote investor confidence in the market and its pricing mechanisms.
In addition, all transaction information collected would be made available to regulatory agencies responsible
for enforcement of Board rules as a means to assist in the inspection for compliance with, and the enforcement of, Board
rules.

The proposed rule change is a first step to increase transparency in the municipal securities market. After gaining
experience with the collection and dissemination of inter-dealer transactions, the Board's future steps would
include adding institutional and retail customer information, and moving toward the ultimate goal of making available
transaction information that is both comprehensive and contemporaneous.



Background.

 The municipal securities market has grown dramatically in recent years. At the same time, retail investors have entered
the market in increasing numbers. These factors have increased the need for access to information on municipal securities
trading in the market, including information which may help to establish more accurate valuation of individual municipal
securities.
 Recognizing this need, the Board has adopted long-term goals and priorities for action, among which is the goal of
providing market participants with more information about the value of securities.







Similarly, the staff of the Division of Market Regulation of the Commission has stated:




The Staff believes that the degree of transparency in the municipal securities market is not adequate, and should
be increased to better inform investors in their dealings with broker-dealers and to make the market more efficient.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940804-2-00149 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940804-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the equities markets, quotations, trade prices and volumes are reported publicly for all securities listed on
the exchanges and in the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (``Nasdaq'') System. The
Commission has noted at least three benefits to the equities markets from transparency: enhanced investor protection,
market liquidity, and market efficiency.
 The Board believes that these same benefits would be desirable in the municipal securities market.






The Pilot Program for Transaction Reporting.

 In 1993, the Board announced its plan to undertake a pilot program to collect and publish information on transactions
occurring in the inter-dealer market for municipal securities (the ``pilot program''). The Board has designed the
pilot program to take into account the distinctive aspects of the municipal securities market that distinguish it
from the exchange-listed and Nasdaq markets. A primary distinguishing characteristic of the municipal securities
market is the large number of outstanding issues. There are approximately 1.2 million municipal securities that
are distinct, non-fungible entities for purposes of trading and reporting. In addition, the municipal securities
market lacks any core group of issues that trade frequently and consistently over sustained periods of time. While,
on any given day, a certain number of municipal securities are traded frequently, the identity of these frequently
traded issues is continually changing over time. A third distinguishing characteristic is that, in the municipal
securities market, most issues are purchased by ``buy and hold'' investors relatively quickly after initial issuance.
When frequent trading does occur in an issue, it generally occurs immediately after issuance and then subsides within
a week to 10 days.





In the markets covered by Nasdaq and the National Association of Securities Dealer's (``NASD's'') recently inaugurated
Fixed Income Pricing System (``FIPS'') for high-yield fixed-income corporate securities,
 displays of data about a security are organized based on firm quotations. The Board believes that a different concept
is needed for municipal securities, since firm two-sided quotations exist only for very few municipal securities
at any given time. There are several reasons for this. For most municipal securities, there is only a small ``float''
of securities available to be the subject of trading. This small ``float'' is a primary disincentive to market making.
In addition, the tax treatment of borrowing tax-exempt securities (along with the small floats) effectively prevents
short-sales of an issue. This denies potential market makers a technique that otherwise could be used to manage risks.
Finally, the traditional ``buy and hold'' philosophy of most tax-exempt purchasers simply does to provide the incentive
or create the need for continuous, two-sided quotations traditionally offered by market makers in equity securities.




The Board has designed the transaction reporting pilot program to provide the public with price and volume information
in a way that reflects the unique aspects of the municipal securities market. The pilot program will make information
available in the form of a daily, public report containing volume and pricing information for the inter-dealer market
(``daily report''). The issues that will be reported individually each day will be those that traded at or above a threshold
number of times on the previous business day. Initially the threshold will be four trades per day. As trading in an issue
increases, it will be reported; as an issue's trading frequency decreases, it will be replaced by others that are trading
frequently. In this way, the daily report will reflect the ever-changing pattern of trading activity in the universe
of some 1.2 million municipal securities. The pilot program will make information on all inter-dealer trades in municipal
securities available to the Commission and other regulatory agencies to assist in the inspection for compliance
with and the enforcement of Board rules.

Requirement to Report.

 There is currently no affirmative requirement for public reporting of transactions in municipal securities. In
its present form, the Board's rule G-14 does not require the reporting of transactions in municipal securities,
but does require that any such report represent a legitimate trade. The rule requires a dealer that distributes or
publishes a report of a transaction in a municipal security to know or have reason to believe that the transaction was
actually effected and to have no reason to believe that the transaction was fictitious or in furtherance of any fraudulent,
misleading or deceptive purpose.
The proposed rule change would impose a duty upon dealers to report inter-dealer transaction information to the Board
or its designee. It states that such information would be used to make public reports and would be provided to the Commission,
the NASD, and bank regulatory organizations charged with enforcing Board rules, 

i.e.

, the Comptroller of the Currency in the case of national banks, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
in the case of state member banks of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'')
in the case of other banks insured by the FDIC.


Reporting Procedures.

 Brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers would report transactions under Rule G-14 Transaction
Reporting Procedures, which are also part of the proposed rule change. The transaction reporting procedures designate
the NSCC as the Board's agent to receive transaction information. NSCC is a clearing agency registered with the Commission
under Section 17A of the Act and is the central facility for automated comparison processing for inter-dealer municipal
securities transactions. Automated comparison is the process by which each party to an inter-dealer trade ensures
that its contra-party knows the terms of the trade and will be ready to settle, on those terms, on settlement date. In
general, the automated comparison process requires each dealer in a transaction to submit information on a trade
(

e.g.

, price, quantity, contra-party) to a comparison system operated by a clearing agency registered with the Commission.
This information is then matched (``compared'') by computer in the comparison system and the results reported back
to each dealer.
Currently, pursuant to the Board's rule G-12(f)(i), dealers must use the facilities of a registered clearing
agency to compare all inter-dealer transactions in securities with CUSIP numbers. Since NSCC and all other registered
clearing agencies offering municipal securities comparison services are linked by automated interfaces, it will
be possible for transactions to be submitted to NSCC by submitting them to any such clearing agency. Accordingly,
the proposed procedures state that dealers may provide transaction information to NSCC or any other registered clearing
agency linked with NSCC for the purpose of automated comparison. Dealers may submit transaction information directly
or through an agent that is a member of the registered clearing agency.
 Thus, under the proposed rule change, dealers would not be required to submit transaction data to a separate reporting
system and should not incur additional operational costs to fulfill their reporting obligations.




With one exception, NSCC automated comparison procedures require both the purchasing and selling dealers to submit
information about the trade. Thus, the proposed reporting procedures require transaction information to be submitted
by both parties. For transactions involving the distribution of new issue securities from a syndicate manager to
syndicate members, however, NSCC comparison procedures require only a submission from the syndicate manager. The
proposed procedures allow for the same ``one-sided'' submission of information for public reporting.

The comparison process requires various data elements to be submitted with regard to each transaction. The proposed
transaction reporting program makes an identical requirement for these data items. The following transaction information
will be collected by the Board through NSCC:

Identification of seller
Identification of buyer
Trade date
CUSIP number of security traded
Trade type (

e.g.,

 syndicate takedown, new issue or regular way)
Par value (quantity) traded
Price, in one of the following formats:


Dollar price of security
``Final money'' (total dollar amount of the transaction)
Yield or basis of concession, if any


Settlement date, if not ``regular way''




As noted above, dealers already are required to provide this information to a registered clearing agency as part of
the automated comparison process required under rule G-12(f)(i). Currently, the accrued interest is an optional
data element for the purpose of the automated comparison process, 

ie., 

it can be submitted, but is not required to match or compare a transaction. However, accrued interest will be a mandatory
submission for the purpose of transaction reporting pursuant to the Rule G-14 Transaction Reporting Procedures.
This requirement is necessary for accurate computation of dollar price in certain circumstances (see ``Price Computation,''


infra

).



Timing. 

In the current comparison cycle, dealers submit required information to a registered clearing agency by the evening
of trade date (``T''). NSCC, as the central facilities provider for the comparison system, accepts this submitted
data, compares the submissions of the parties on the night of T and reports the results back to the dealers on T+1. Trades
that are successfully compared on T will be the basis of the daily report produced by the Board's proposed program.
Accordingly, trades that are not successfully compared on the night of the trade will not be subject to reporting on
T+1.
 As an indication of the reliability of the data in the daily report, the percentage of submissions that were successfully
compared (``comparison rate'') will be shown in each day's report.









The Daily Report. 

The daily report will be provided to subscribers for public use by approximately 6:00 a.m. on T+1. This will make the
data available prior to the beginning of trading activity. The daily report will be available both as a computer-readable
file and as a printed report. The computer-readable file will be electronically disseminated by an automated interface
between Board computers and those of subscribers or by magnetic tape delivered by a courier service.



The Daily Report. 

The daily report will include aggregate information for each day of trade, as follows:



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940804-2-00152 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940804-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) Total par value traded;

(ii) Total number of compared transactions; and

(iii) Total number of issues traded (

i.e.,

 the number of different CUSIP numbers that were involved in compared transactions on that day).

In addition to the aggregate data, the daily report will contain price and volume information about certain municipal
securities that were ``frequently traded'' on that day. The Board believes that it would be appropriate to report
issue-specific information only if four or more transactions in the issue are reported as compared on a given day.
Using this threshold and based on recent levels of market activity, the Board anticipates that the daily list of frequently
traded issues normally will range between 80 to 350 issues, with an average of about 180 issues each day. The size and
composition of the list obviously would vary from day to day, depending upon market activity in specific cases.

The information in the daily report about each ``frequently traded'' security will include:

(i) The CUSIP number and security's description;

(ii) The total number of transactions in the security and total volume traded;

(iii) The highest and lowest prices of transactions in the security; and

(iv) ``Average price'' information, 

i.e.

, the number of transactions in the security involving par values between $100,000 and $1,000,000 inclusive, and
the average price of those transactions.

The Board will provide a statement to be included in the report pointing out that (a) the daily report represents only
those inter-dealer transactions that have been submitted for comparison and that actually were compared on the previous
day and (b) reported prices are affected by various factors such as transaction size. This statement is intended to
ensure that readers unfamiliar with the municipal securities market do not misinterpret the daily report.



Price Computation.

 Municipal securities transactions are sometimes executed on a dollar price basis and sometimes executed on a yield
basis. The Board has chosen to use dollar price as the uniform expression of ``price'' in the daily report to simplify
reporting procedures. In cases where dollar price is submitted for comparison, that dollar price, as compared by
the comparison system, will be used in the daily report. In certain cases the security ``price'' for the daily report
will need to be computed from other submitted data. For example, current procedures required for automated comparison
allow the submission of par value and ``final money'' (total dollar amount of the transaction) to achieve comparison.
The proposed Rule G-14 Transaction Reporting Procedures provide that the dealers will submit the amount of
accrued interest in the trade to allow for computation of dollar price in these cases. The following formula will be
used:




Dollar price = (Final money_Accrued interest) / Par value




For ``when, as if issued'' trades submitted for comparison on a yield basis, final money will be computed and a dollar
price similarly derived if a settlement date is known. For yield transactions whose settlement date is not known,
an assumed settlement date will be used. The assumed settlement date will be 20 business days from the first trade date
on which that issue is submitted for comparison. On the daily report, a note will be added to the trade information stating
that an assumed settlement date was used to compute the dollar price in the trade and showing the date used. Once the
actual settlement date is known to NSCC, it will be used and noted as such when the issue is next included on a daily report.



Fees and Costs.

 Subscription fees, estimated production costs for the daily report, and further technical details of the pilot program
will be provided in a subsequent filing prior to beginning operation of the facility.



Surveillance and Enforcement Uses of Pilot Program Information.

 In addition to public reporting, the proposed rule change would make transaction data available to the regulatory
organizations charged with enforcing Board rules. Commenting on the need for better information in this area, the
Commission's staff stated:




In the Staff's view, a central flaw in the present regulatory system is the lack of an integrated audit trail in the municipal
securities market of the type that exists in the stock and options markets. Because of the limited pricing information
available in the secondary market for many thinly traded municipal securities, it is extremely difficult for the
NASD to assess the fairness of the prices being charged retail customers by municipal securities broker-dealers.
The Staff believes that the MSRB, the NASD, and the banking agencies should work to create a cost-effective trade reporting
system that will provide the regulators with an integrated audit trail of municipal securities and result in improved
surveillance for all segments of the market. The development of such an audit trail would increase the NASD's ability
to examine and enforce the existing customer protection rules of the Commission and the NASD.





The transaction reporting pilot program will result in a centralized data base of trade information that is expected
to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of inspection for compliance with and the enforcement of Board rules.
All compared trades will be made available to these regulatory organizations, including those that compare after
trade date and those not frequently traded. Comprehensive information will be made available, including identification
of parties to each trade and the prices of all securities traded.

The information to be made available through the pilot program will enable enforcement agencies to identify transaction
patterns to detect market manipulation and other anomalies. It will also assist regulators in determining the market
value of securities as they assess compliance with the Board's rule G-30 on fair and reasonable prices and commissions.
The Board is working with the NASD and the bank regulatory organizations to ensure that the pilot system's outputs
will meet their requirements for surveillance of the municipal securities market and enforcement of the Board's
rules.

The Board plans to evaluate expansion of the pilot program as experience is gained and comments on program operations
are received from information users and the industry. The Board's first consideration will be how the daily report
and surveillance mechanisms could be improved by including institutional customer transaction data and information
on the time of trade. During this evaluation, the Board's goal will be not only to enhance the information contained
in the daily report, but also to find cost-effective methods for providing even greater levels of transparency to
the market, particularly with respect to customer transactions and the dissemination of transaction price information
on a more contemporaneous basis.



Effect of Proposed Rule Change upon Dealers.

 Dealers should experience minimal operational impact from the proposed rule change, since, as mentioned above,
they are now required, pursuant to the Board's rule G-12(f)(i), to use the facilities of a registered clearing
agency for the automated comparison of transactions. The transaction data submitted by dealers for comparison will
be used by the transaction reporting pilot program. Thus, under the proposed program, dealers would not have to submit
transaction data to a separate reporting system and should not incur additional operational costs.



(b) Statutory Basis



The Board believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which requires, in
pertinent part, that the Board's rules be designed:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940804-2-00153 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940804-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

* * * to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal
securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest * * *.




The transaction reporting pilot program will make it possible to provide pricing reports to all market participants
and to the public. The availability of this information is expected to support market integrity, increase investor
confidence, improve pricing efficiency and increase liquidity in the market.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Board does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purpose of the Act, since it would apply equally to all brokers, dealers and municipal securities
dealers.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



In May 1993 the Board published a notice explaining its plan to collect inter-dealer transaction data by using information
required for automated comparison, clearance and settlement. The notice set forth the proposed method of collection
inter-dealer transaction data and of publishing it. The Board received four comments of which two supported the proposed
pilot program and made suggestions for expansion. The remaining two commenters suggested certain modifications
of the daily report format and the selection criteria for reported issues without expressing general support or opposition.




Sample Format for Daily Report.

 One commenter noted that the reporting of transaction data by the Board should include a statement stating that prices
change with market conditions and that prices for individual transactions may depend upon factors such as size of
transaction, interest rate, maturity date, and call features. Another commenter stated that the daily report should
note that the data represents transactions that have been submitted for comparison. The Board agrees that statements
similar to those requested by the commenters should be included on or with the daily reports to help clarify the meaning
of the data to the general public and has decided to include such statements on the daily report. The Board also plans
to ask recipients of the daily report who intend to publish it for a general audience also to include such statements
in their publications.



Average Price Calculation.

 One commenter suggested widening the band used for average price calculation to include more price information.
In contrast, another commenter suggested narrowing the band to exclude some trades that might be considered ``odd
lots'' (certain zero-coupon bond trades reported by NSCC on the basis of maturity value).

The Board believes that it is appropriate to use the band from $100,000 to $1 million for average price calculations
for initial production of the daily report. Once the program goes into operation and feedback is received from data
users, it will be possible to judge how well the ``average price'' concept actually works in practice. As experience
is gained, the price band concept will be reviewed to determine whether it is serving its intended purpose of indicating
a ``typical'' inter-dealer market price. The pilot program's computer system will be designed to enable the parameters
of the price band to be changed easily and quickly.



Compilations of Data.

 One commenter urged the Board to provide compilations of transaction data (

e.g.

, a month of data on a computer disk) to facilitate study of the data by academics. The Board has decided not to make such
compilations available at the beginning of the pilot program, but may do so in the future.



Information on Daily Reports.

 One commenter suggested that the Board publish individual transaction data (CUSIP number, description, par value,
price) for each transaction, without regard to whether a security is being frequently traded on a specific day. This
commenter believes that, by limiting reporting to individual maturities of an issue that are trading frequently,
the program would withhold information that, in the aggregate, would be useful. For example, the commenter believes
that the general price levels for prerefunded securities could be extracted from aggregate transaction data on prerefunded
securities, even when no one prerefunded security is trading frequently.

The Board believes that reporting an isolated transaction in a security does not necessarily provide a reliable indicator
of ``market price'' and might be misleading to an observer not familiar with the market. Nevertheless, after the pilot
program begins operation and experience is obtained, the Board will review the use of the daily report and consider
expanding the information included to accommodate requests from information users and the industry.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the MSRB consents, the Commission will:

(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested people are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. People making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the Board's principal
offices. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-MSRB-94-9 and should be submitted by August
25, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. Relating to Amendments to the NASD's Proposed N

 

PROVE System for Price Improvement and Execution of Small Orders</DOCTITLE>



July 28, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on July 25, 1994,
 the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.







I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD and The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (``Nasdaq'') propose to amend the proposed rules governing the operation
of The Nasdaq Primary Retail Order View and Execution System (``N

 

PROVE''), a new Nasdaq system for execution and price improvement of small-sized customer orders. Specifically,
the NASD proposes to amend Sections 6.b and 6.c. of the Rules of Operation and Procedures for the N

 

PROVE service to provide that a limit order entered at a price between the best bid or offer displayed on Nasdaq will
be immediately executed against a limit order subsequently entered into N

 

PROVE on the opposite side of the market priced at or superior to the limit price of the first limit order. Following
is the text of the proposed rule change. (Additions are in italics; deletions are bracketed.)



RULES OF OPERATION AND PROCEDURES FOR THE N

 

PROVE SYSTEM 
(6) EXECUTIONS OF N

 

PROVE ORDERS



* * * * *



a. No change.
b. Limit orders may be entered into N

 

PROVE. A limit order priced at the Nasdaq inside market when the order is delivered to an N

 

PROVE market maker will be handled as a market order. Limit orders priced outside the Nasdaq inside market will be stored
in the N

 

PROVE limit order file, and when the inside market equals or betters the limit price, the order will be handled as a market
order. Limit orders priced better than the inside market upon entry will establish the price at which subsequent incoming
market orders on the other side of market may be priced and executed (e.g., a sell order priced between the best bid and
offer would improve the price of an incoming buy order). Market makers will receive notification of the existence
of a limit order priced better than the inside market on their quote retrieval screens; provided however, notification
of the existence of a preferenced limit order will only be delivered to the designated market maker. [A limit order
priced better than the inside market in Nasdaq may also be matched and executed against an incoming market or limit
order, on the other side of the market, without the participation of a market maker.] 

A limit order priced better than the inside market on Nasdaq shall be automatically executed against a subsequent
limit order on the opposite side of the market at a price equal or superior to the limit price of the initial limit order
(a sell (buy) limit order priced at or below (above) a limit order to buy (sell)), up to the size of the initial limit order
or the subsequent limit order, whichever is smaller, and without the participation of a market maker.

c. Market orders may be entered into N

 

PROVE. A market order will be delivered to a market maker for execution at the current inside market (buy orders will
be executed at the best offer and sell orders at the best bid). If a limit order has previously been entered into N

 

PROVE at a price superior to the best bid or offer, the incoming market order will be repriced to match the price of the
limit order and will be displayed for 15 seconds to 

all

 market makers [at] 

whose current quotation equals 

 the 

applicable

 inside quote

, in the case of an unpreferenced order, and to the preferenced market maker in the case of a preferenced order.

 [That order will either be executed by a market maker or will be matched and executed against the limit order.] 

If no market maker accepts the incoming market order within the 15-second period, the market order will be automatically
executed against the limit order.

 All market orders entered into N

 

PROVE will be executed in compliance with market maker obligations as established in subsection (4).



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of this amendment is to amend N

 

PROVE's execution algorithm for limit orders to provide that, upon receipt of limit orders that match between the
inside spread, the system will automatically execute the matching limit orders against each other without any delay
or separate display to market makers. The NASD believes this amendment will further enhance the price improvement
and limit order protection benefits afforded retail investors through N

 

PROVE.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940804-2-00155 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940804-2-00084 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As currently proposed, if a limit order is entered into NPROVE between the inside spread on Nasdaq, a subsequent limit
order on the opposite side of the market priced at the same or a superior price to the limit price of the pending limit
order (

e.g.

, a sell limit order priced at or below a limit order to buy) will be matched against that pending limit order. If the incoming
limit order is unpreferenced, all market makers at the inside quotation will have a 15-second opportunity to execute
the incoming limit order. If the incoming limit order is preferenced, only the preferenced market maker will have
a 15-second opportunity to execute the incoming limit order. If no market maker elects to execute the incoming limit
order, the system would automatically execute the pending limit order against the incoming limit order.






This amendment will change the execution methodology for matched limit orders by eliminating the 15 second window
for the display of the incoming limit order prior to execution and permitting an immediate match of offsetting limit
orders received by NPROVE. By providing retail customers a greater opportunity to receive immediate and automatic
executions of their limit orders priced between the spread, the NASD believes the proposal will enhance NPROVE's
price improvement capabilities and limit order protection features. Moreover, to the extent the NPROVE has received
two priced orders from retail customers that match or cross each other inside the spread, the NASD believes no market
benefit would be served by delaying the execution of this transaction. Indeed, the NASD believes the amendment is
in furtherance of Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(v) of the Act, which provides that investors' orders should be executed without
the intervention of a dealer to the maximum extent possible consistent with the achievement of other critical market
structure objectives, such as the economically efficient execution of securities transactions.

The proposed execution algorithm for matching incoming market orders against limit orders priced better than the
inside market will remain the same. Specifically, as proposed, if a limit order is entered into NPROVE at a price between
the spread, the next incoming market order on the opposite side of the market (e.g., the limit order is to sell stock
and the market order is to buy stock) would automatically ``pass over'' or read the limit order file to see if there are
any orders residing in the limit order file at prices superior to the best bid or offer in the Nasdaq marketplace. If
a limit order resides on the file at a superior price, then the market order will be flashed on the screen at that superior
price for acceptance within a brief 15-second period, instead of at the inside bid or offer, as the case may be. In that
event, all market makers at the inside quotation would have the opportunity for 15 seconds to execute the market order
at the superior limit price. If no market maker elected to execute the order at that improved price, the system would
execute the orders against each other at the limit price.

The NASD notes that both the limit order and the market order are better off with this execution process_customers
placing market orders receive price improvement and customers placing limit orders will be assured that NPROVE executions
will not occur at prices inferior to their limit order prices. Accordingly, the NASD believes this execution process
for a market orders is wholly consistent with the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.

A key consideration for retaining NPROVE's flash display and automated execution feature for market orders is the
need to maintain the liquidity and depth of The Nasdaq Stock Market. One of the cornerstones of the success of Nasdaq's
competing dealer system has been the availability of market maker capital to satisfy investors' liquidity demands.
The extent to which market maker capital is available, in turn, is critically dependent on the ability of market makers
to interact with customer order flow. Without the ability of market makers to trade with their customers' orders,
orders presented to them by other members, or orders entered into Nasdaq execution systems, market-maker profitability
will suffer and, as a result, market liquidity will diminish and investors will receive inferior executions of their
orders. Accordingly, if market makers are denied any opportunity, however brief, to interact with incoming market
orders entered into NPROVE, the NASD believes that liquidity on Nasdaq will inevitably be affected in an adverse manner
to the detriment of investors.

The NASD notes that an objective for a National Market System contained in Section 11A of the Act regarding the execution
of investors' orders without the intervention of a dealer is premised upon, and necessarily incorporates the corresponding
assurance that, such executions will be fully consistent with the economically efficient execution of such securities
transactions. The NASD maintains that affording market makers an extremely narrow 15-second window of exposure
within which they may view, evaluate, and respond to incoming market orders prior to the automated match of two investors'
orders is appropriate in a competing dealer market environment. The ability of market makers to interact with customer
order flow is essential to the long-term well-being of Nasdaq and the efficient execution of customer orders that
results from vigorous competition among viable, aggressive Nasdaq market makers.

In sum, the NASD believes the proposal significantly enhances the price improvement and limit order protection features
of NPROVE and eliminates the possibility that a pending limit order will remain unexecuted while other public customer
orders receive executions at the order's limit price, while preserving the liquidity and orderliness of Nasdaq by
allowing a minimal, yet essential, opportunity for market makers to interact with retail order flow.

The NASD also believes the proposed N

 

PROVE system is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), 15A(b)(11), and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. Section
15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system
and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15A(b)(9) requires that rules of an Association
not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Section
15A(b)(11) requires the NASD to formulate rules governing the quality of fair and informative quotations. Section
11A(a)(1)(C) finds that it is in the public interest to, among other things, assure economically efficient execution
of securities transactions. The fundamental purpose of N

 

PROVE is to assist investors in achieving prompt, efficient executions of their small orders and to provide an opportunity
for price improvement within an automated execution environment. The integrity and efficiency of Nasdaq for public
investors and market-making participants is critical and the NASD believes that N

 

PROVE will provide benefits to both constituencies. The design of N

 

PROVE is not anti-competitive as it affords all market and limit orders an equal opportunity for price improvement
regardless of whether the orders are preferenced or unpreferenced. In addition, to the extent that preferenced orders
may be handled differently than unpreferenced orders, because market makers have entered into preferencing arrangements
with known customers, market maker's effectively will have waived the protections offered them by the system. N

 

PROVE may also enhance the quality of quotations in the Nasdaq marketplace as market makers participating in the service
may be encouraged to narrow the spread and improve the best inter-dealer quotations in Nasdaq in order to be first in
priority and continue to receive unpreferenced order flow through N

 

PROVE.

Lastly, the NASD believes the N

 

PROVE is fully consistent with the significant national market system objectives contained in Section 11A of the
Act. The facilities of N

 

PROVE would advance these objectives by offering efficient execution of investors' small orders, by maintaining
market maker participation through the automated delivery of orders with the ability to reject those orders if trades
have already occurred, and by offering the opportunity for price improvement to N

 

PROVE orders. The system's functionality will more accurately reflect market makers' affirmative obligations
to provide liquidity to the market, without depriving market makers of legitimate exceptions from the firmness requirements
contained in SEC Rule 11Ac1-1.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the NASD consents, the Commission will:

A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or 

B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicant seeks an order that would permit it to rely on rule 3a-5.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant is a recently-formed Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FGIC Holdings, Inc. (``FGIC
Holdings''). FGIC Holdings is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GE Capital Corporation (``GE Capital''), an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of General Electric Company. FGIC Holdings is a holding company engaged primarily in the
insurance business through its subsidiary, Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. GE Capital is a diversified financial
services company. GE Capital's activities consist of several distinct businesses that fall into five industry segments:
specialized financing, mid-market financing, consumer services, equipment management, and specialty insurance.

2. Applicant was formed for the primary purpose of issuing and selling in private placement transactions municipal
reinvestment contracts (``MRCs'') and similar investment agreements primarily to state or local government entities
or agencies. Applicant also sells put options where the holder acquires securities permitted under rule 3a-5(a)(6)
directly for its own account and applicant agrees, at the option of the holder, to purchase such investments at a later
date.
 Within six months of applicant's receipt of the proceeds of the MRC offerings and put fees, applicant lends at least
85% of such proceeds to GE Capital or certain companies controlled by GE Capital (the ``Subsidiaries'') for their
use in financing their respective operations.
 GE Capital fully guarantees applicant's obligations under each MRC it issues.






3. Section 3(a)(1) defines an investment company to include any issuer that is engaged primarily, or that proposes
to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(3) defines
an investment company to include any issuer engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding,
or trading in securities, and that owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40%
of the issuer's total assets, exclusive of Government securities and cash items, on an unconsolidated basis. Because
applicant's loans to GE Capital and the Subsidiaries may be considered investments in the debt securities of GE Capital
and the Subsidiaries, applicant falls within the definition of investment company.

4. To date, applicant has relied on the exception provided under section 3(c)(1) to avoid having to register as an investment
company.
 The number of holders of MRCs is anticipated eventually to exceed 100. At that time, applicant will be unable to continue
to rely on section 3(c)(1). Accordingly, applicant requests an exemption from paragraphs (a)(5), (a)(6), and (b)
of rule 3a-5 so that it can issue debt securities in the manner described above without registering as an investment
company under the Act.






Applicant's Legal Conclusions



1. Rule 3a-5 excepts from the definition of investment company any finance subsidiary of an operating company.
Paragraph (a)(5) of rule 3a-5 requires that a finance subsidiary relying on the rule loan to its parent company
or a company controlled by its parent company at least 85% of amounts raised by the subsidiary. Paragraph (a)(6) limits
the investments of the finance subsidiary to Government securities, securities of its parent company or a company
controlled by its parent company, and certain other debt instruments. Rule 3a-5(b) defines a parent company
and conpanies controlled by the parent company as companies that are not investment companies under section 3(a)
or that are excepted or exempted by order from the definition of investment company by section 3(b) or by the rules and
regulations under section 3(a).

2. Assuming that GE Capital otherwise may be deemed to be an investment company under the Act, the diversity of GE Capital's
financial activities requires it to rely on the exception from the definition of investment company under section
3(c)(6).
 Because GE Capital is excepted from the definition of investment company under section 3(c)(6), rather than under
section 3(b) or the rules and regulations under section 3(a), GE Capital is not an eligible parent within the meaning
of rule 3a-5(b). Consequently, applicant cannot comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6)
that it invest its assets in the securities of an eligible parent company and companies controlled by the parent company.





3. Section 6(c) provides that the Commission may exempt any person or transaction from any provision of the Act or any
rule thereunder to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicant
asserts that none of the investor protection concerns addressed by the Act are raised by its activities since it is
engaged primarily in the business of financing the operations of GE Capital, and GE Capital is not an investment company.
Consequently, applicant believes that the standards for relief under section 6(c) are satisfied.

<DOCTITLE>Latin American Resources, Inc.; Order of Suspension of Trading</DOCTITLE>


August 1, 1994.


It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of adequate and accurate information concerning
the securities of Latin American Resources, Inc. (``LARI''), of Huntington Station, New York, and that questions
have been raised about the accuracy and adequacy of LARI's financial statements and other disclosures. The Commission
is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors require a suspension of trading in the securities
of the above-listed company.
Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that trading in the securities
of the above-listed company, over-the-counter or otherwise, is suspended for the period from 9:15 a.m. (EDT), August
1, 1994 through 11:59 p.m. (EDT), on August 10, 1994.



By the Commission.

ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

MFS Variable Insurance Trust (the ``Trust'') and Massachusetts Financial Services Company (``MFS'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from the provisions of Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a)
and 15(b) of the 1940 Act and Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Trust and shares of any other investment company
that is designed to fund insurance products and for which MFS, or any of its affiliates, may serve as investment advisor,
administrator, manager, principal underwriter or sponsor (collectively, with the Trust, the ``Funds'') to be sold
to and held by: (a) Variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of both affiliated and unaffiliated
life insurance companies (the ``Participating Insurance Companies''); and (b) qualified pension and retirement
plans outside of the separate account context (the ``Plans'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application, the complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference
Branch of the SEC.






 Applicants' Representations



1. The Trust, a Massachusetts business trust, is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, diversified management
investment company of the series type. The Trust commenced operations on or about June 2, 1994.

2. The Trust will offer the following twelve separately managed portfolios: the MFS OTC Series; MFS Growth Series;
MFS Research Series; MFS Growth With Income Series; MFS Total Return Series; MFS Utilities Series; MFS High Income
Series; MFS World Governments Series; MFS Strategic Fixed Income Series; MFS Bond Series; MFS Limited Maturity Series;
and MFS Money Market Series. The application states that, except for the MFS OTC Series, the MFS Utilities Series,
the MFS World Governments Series and the MFS Strategic Fixed Income Series, each of the portfolios of the Trust will
be diversified. Applicants incorporate by reference into the application the registration statement (File No.
33-74668) on Form N-1A of the Trust.
3. MFS serves as the investment advisor to the portfolios of the Trust. MFS is a subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company
of Canada (U.S.), which is a subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada.
4. Applicants state that once the order requested in the application is granted, the Trust intends to offer shares
of each of its existing and future portfolios to separate accounts of insurance companies in addition to the separate
accounts established by Century Life of America (``Century Life'') or its affiliates (the ``Accounts'') to serve
as investment vehicles for variable annuity and/or variable life insurance contracts (the ``Contracts''). The
Trust may also offer shares of its portfolios directly to the Plans outside of the separate account context.
5. The application states that each Participating Insurance Company will have the legal obligation of satisfying
all applicable requirements under both state and federal law. Applicants state that it is anticipated that Participating
Insurance Companies will rely on Rule 6e-2 or Rule 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act, although some may rely on
individual exemptive orders as well, in connection with variable life insurance contracts. Applicants further
state that the role of the Funds, in so far as the federal securities laws are applicable, will be limited to that of offering
shares to the Accounts and meeting any conditions that the Commission may impose upon granting the order requested
in the application.
6. The application states that, due to changes in the tax law, the Funds have the opportunity to increase their asset
base through sale of shares of the Funds to the Plans. The Plans may choose any of the Funds as the sole investment option,
or, as one of several investment options. Shares of any of the Funds sold to a Plan would be held by the trustee of that
Plan as required by Section 403(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''). MFS will not
serve as investment advisor to any of the Plans that purchase shares of the Funds. There will be no pass-through voting
to participants in the Plans.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. In connection with the funding a scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate
account registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust (``UIT''), Rule 6e-2(b)(15) provides partial
exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The relief provided by Rule 6e-2 is available
to a separate account's investment advisor, principal underwriter, and sponsor or depositor. The exemptions granted
by rule 6e-2(b)(15) are available only where the management investment company underlying the UIT offers its
shares ``exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life
insurance company.'' The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both
variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of a single insurance company (or of two or more affiliated
insurance companies) is referred to as ``mixed funding.'' The use of a common management investment company as the
underlying investment medium for variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated
insurance companies is referred to as ``shared funding.'' ``Mixed and shared funding'' denotes the use of a common
management investment company to fund the variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of other
affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies. The relief granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) is not available
with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund
that offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account of the same company or of any other affiliated or unaffiliated
life insurance company. Therefore, Rule 6e-2(b)(15) precludes mixed and shared funding.
2. Applicants state that the relief granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) is not affected by the purchase of shares of the
Funds by the Plans. Applicants note, however, that because the relief under Rule 6e-2(b)(15) is available only
where shares are offered exclusively to separate accounts, additional exemptive relief is necessary if shares of
the Funds also are to be sold to Plans.

3. In connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered
under the 1940 Act as a UIT, Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a),
and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The exemptions granted to a separate account by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) are available
only where all of the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment
companies which offer their shares ``exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life
insurance company, offering either scheduled or flexible contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to
variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company.'' Rule 6e-3(T)
permits mixed funding. Rule 6e-3(T), however, does not permit shared funding.

4. Applicants state that the relief granted by Rule 6e-3(T) is not affected by the purchase of shares of the Funds
by the Plans. Applicants note, however, that because the relief under Rule 6e-3(T) is available only where shares
are offered exclusively to separate accounts, additional exemptive relief is necessary if shares of the Funds are
also to be sold to Plans.

5. As noted, Applicants state that changes in the tax law have created the opportunity for the Funds to increase their
asset base through the sale of Fund shares to the Plans. Applicants state that Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of the
Contracts held in the Funds. The Code provides that such Contracts shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life
insurance contract for any period in which the investments are not, in accordance with regulations prescribed by
the Treasury Department, adequately diversified. On March 2, 1989, the Treasury Department issued regulations
which established diversification requirements for the investment portfolios underlying variable contracts.
Treas. Reg.  1.817-5 (1989). The regulations provide that, to meet the diversification requirements,
all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more
insurance companies. The regulations do, however, contain certain exceptions to this requirement, one of which
allows shares in an investment company to be held by the trustee of a qualified pension or retirement plan without adversely
affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company to also be held by the separate accounts of insurance
companies in connection with their variable contracts. Treas. Reg.  1.817-5(f)(3)(iii).

6. Applicants state that the promulgation of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act preceded the issuance
of these Treasury regulations. Applicants assert that, given the then current tax law, the sale of shares of the same
investment company to both separate accounts and Plans could not have been envisioned at the time of the adoption of
Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15).

7. Applicants therefore request relief from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e-2(b)(15)
and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Funds to be offered and sold in
connection with both mixed and shared funding.





8. Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment advisor or principal
underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a
disqualification enumerated in Sections 9(a) (1) or (2). Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) provide
exemptions from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to limitations on mixed and shared funding. The
relief provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(i) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(i) permits a person disqualified under
Section 9(a) to serve as an officer, director, or employee or the life insurer, or of any of its affiliates, so long as
that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying fund. The relief
provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(ii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(ii) permits the life insurer to serve as the underlying
fund's investment advisor or principal underwriter, provided that none of the insurer's personnel who are ineligible
pursuant to Section 9(a) are participating in the management or administration of the fund.







9. Applicants state that the partial relief from Section 9(a) found in Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15),
in effect, limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with Section 9 to that which is appropriate
in light of the policy and purposes of the Section. Applicant state that those 1940 Act rules recognize that it is not
necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940
Act to apply the provisions of Section 9(a) to the many individuals in a large insurance company complex, most of whom
will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies within that organization. Applicants note
that the Participating Insurance Companies are not expected to play any role in the management or administration
of the Funds. Therefore, Applicants assert, applying the restrictions of Section 9(a) serves no regulatory purpose.
The application states that the relief requested will not be affected by the proposed sale of shares of the Funds to
the Plans. The insulation of the Trust from individuals disqualified under the 1940 Act remains in place. Applicants
assert that, since the Plans are not investment companies and will not be deemed affiliated by virtue of their share
holdings, no additional relief is necessary.

10. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act assume the existence of a pass-through
voting requirement with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account. The application
states that the Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all Contract
owners so long as the Commission interprets the 1940 Act to require such privileges.



11. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from the pass-through
voting requirement with respect to several significant matters, assuming observance of the limitations on mixed
and shared funding imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.





Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A) provide that the insurance company may disregard
voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund, or any contract
between a fund and its investment advisor, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority.






Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(b) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(B) provide that the insurance company may disregard
voting instructions of its contract owners if the contract owners initiate any change in the company's investment
policies, principal underwriter, or any investment advisor, provided that disregarding such voting instructions
is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(15)(ii) and (b)(7)(ii) (B) and (C) of each rule.



12. Applicants represent that the right of the Participating Insurance Companies to disregard voting instructions
of Contract owners provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) does not raise any issues different
from those raised by the authority of state insurance administrators over separate accounts. Under the rules, an
insurer can disregard voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items. Affiliation does not eliminate
the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment
policies, principal underwriter, or investment advisor initiated by contract owners. The potential for disagreement
is limited by the requirements in Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) that the insurance company's disregard of voting
instructions be both reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations.




13. Applicants further represent that the Funds' sale of shares to the Plans does not impact the relief requested in
this regard. As noted previously by Applicants, shares of the Funds sold to Plans would be held by the trustees of such
Plans as required by Section 403(a) of ERISA. Section 403(a) also provides that the trustee(s) must have exclusive
authority and discretion to manage and control the Plan with two exceptions: (a) when the Plan expressly provides
that the trustee(s) is (are) subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee, in which case the trustee(s)
is (are) subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the Plan and not contrary to ERISA; and (b)
when the authority to manage, acquire or dispose of assets of the Plan is delegated to one or more investment mangers
pursuant to Section 402(c)(3) of ERISA. Unless one of the two exceptions stated in Section 403(a) applies, Plan trustees
have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies. Where a named fiduciary appoints an investment
manger, the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares
is reserved to the trustees or to the named fiduciary. In any event, there is no pass-through voting to the participants
in such Plans. According, Applicants note that, unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts, the issue
of the resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with Plans because such
Plans are not entitled to pass-through voting privileges.

14. Applicants state that no increased conflicts of interest would be present by the granting of the requested relief.
Applicants assert that shared funding does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance
company is licensed to do business in several states. Applicants note that where Participating Insurance Companies
are domiciled in different states, it is possible that the state insurance regulatory body in a state in which one Participating
Insurance Company is domiciled could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of insurance regulators
in one or more other states in which other Participating Insurance Companies are domiciled. Applicants state that
the possibility, however, is no different and no greater than exists where, as is currently permitted, a single insurer
and its affiliates offer their insurance products in several states.

15. Applicants argue that affiliation does not reduce the potential, if any exists, for differences in state regulatory
requirements. In any event, the conditions (adapted from the conditions included in Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15))
discussed below are designed to safeguard against any adverse effects that different state insurance regulatory
requirements may produce. If a particular state insurance regulator's decision conflicts with the majority of other
state regulators, the affected insurer may be required to withdraw its separate account's investment in the relevant
Fund.

16. Applicants also argue that affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments
as to when a Participating Insurance Company properly may disregard voting instructions of Contract owners. Potential
disagreement is limited by the requirement that a disregard of voting instructions be both reasonable and based on
specified good faith determinations. However, if a Participating Insurance Company's decision to disregard Contract
owner instructions represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote approving a particular change,
such Participating Insurance Company may be required, at the election of the relevant Fund, to withdraw its investment
in that Fund. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal.

17. Applicants state that there is no reason why the investment policies of a Fund with mixed funding would or should
be materially different from what those policies would or should be if such investment company or series thereof funded
only variable annuity or only variable life insurance contracts. Applicants therefore argue that there is no reason
to believe that conflicts of interest would result from mixed funding. Moreover, Applicants represent that the Funds
will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular insurer or type of Contact.

18. Applicants note that no single investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular insurance
product. Each pool of variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners is composed of individuals of
diverse financial status, age, insurance and investment goals. Those diversities are of greater significance than
any difference in insurance products. An investment company supporting even one type of insurance product must accommodate
those diverse factors.

19. Applicants further note that Section 817(h) of the Code is the only section in the Code where separate accounts
are discussed. Section 817(h) imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable annuity
contracts and variable life contracts held in the portfolios of management investment companies. Treasury Regulation
1.817-5(f)(3)(iii), which established diversification requirements for such portfolios, specifically
permits, among other things, ``qualified pension or retirement plans'' and separate accounts to share the same underlying
management investment company. Therefore, neither the Code, the Treasury regulations nor the revenue rulings thereunder
present any inherent conflicts of interest if Plans, variable annuity separate accounts and variable life insurance
separate accounts all invest in the same management investment company.

20. While there are differences in the manner in which distributions are taxed for variable annuity contracts, variable
life insurance contracts and Plans, Applicants state that the tax consequences do not raise any conflicts of interest.
When distributions are to be made, and the separate account or the Plan is unable to net purchase payments to make the
distributions, that separate account or the Plan will redeem shares of the Trust at net asset value. The plan will then
make distributions in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The life insurance company will surrender values from
the separate account into the general account to make distributions in accordance with the terms of the variable contract.

21. With respect to voting rights, applicants state that it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving such
voting rights to Contract owners and to Plans. Applicants represent that the transfer agent for the Trust will inform
each Participating Insurance Company of each Account's share of ownership in the Trust, as well as inform the trustees
of the Plans of their holdings. Each Participating Insurance Company will then solicit voting instructions in accordance
with Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T).

22. Applicants argue that the ability of Funds to sell their respective shares directly to Plans does not create a ``senior
security'', as such term is defined under Section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, with respect to any Contract owner vis-a-vis
a participant under a Plan. Regardless of the rights and benefits of participants and Contract owners under the respective
Plans and Contracts, the Plans and the Accounts have rights only with respect to their shares of the Trust. Such shares
may be redeemed only at net asset value. No shareholder of any of the Funds has any preference over any other shareholder
with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends.
23. Finally, applicants state that there are no conflicts between Contract owners and participants under the Plans
with respect to the state insurance commissioners' veto powers (direct with respect to variable life insurance and
indirect with respect to variable annuities) over investment objectives. The basic premise of shareholder voting
is that not all shareholders may agree that there are any inherent conflicts of interest between shareholders. The
state insurance commissioners have been given the veto power in recognition of the fact that insurance companies
cannot simply redeem their separate accounts out of one fund and invest those monies in another fund. To accomplish
such redemption and transfers, complex time consuming transactions must be undertaken. Conversely, trustees of
Plans can make the decision quickly and implement redemption of shares from a Fund and reinvest the monies in another
funding vehicle without the same regulatory impediments or, as is the case with most Plans, hold cash pending suitable
investment. Based on the foregoing, Applicants represent that even should there arise issues where the interests
of Contract owners and the interests of Plans conflict, the issues can be almost immediately resolved because trustees
of the Plans can, independently, redeem shares out of the Trust.
24. Applicants state that various factors have kept certain insurance companies from offering variable annuity
and variable life insurance contracts. According to Applicants, these factors include: The cost of organizing and
operating an investment funding medium; the lack of expertise with respect to investment management (particularly
with respect to stock and money market investments); and the lack of public name recognition of certain insurers as
investment professionals. Applicants argue that use of the Funds as common investment media for the Contracts would
ameliorate these concerns. Participating Insurance Companies would benefit from the investment and administrative
expertise of MFS as well as from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a large pool of funds.
Applicants state that making the Funds available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies
to offer variable contracts such as the Contracts which will then increase competition with respect to both the design
and the pricing of variable contracts. This can be expected to result in greater product variation and lower charges.
Thus, Applicants argue that Contract owners would benefit because mixed and shared funding will eliminate a significant
amount of the costs of establishing and administering separate funds. Moreover, Applicants assert that sales of
shares of the Funds to Plans should increase the amount of assets available for investment by the Funds. This should,
in turn, promote economies of scale, permit increased safety of investments through greater diversification, and
make the addition of new portfolios to the Trust more feasible.
25. Applicants believe that there is no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding. Additionally,
Applicants note the previous issuance of an order permitting mixed and shared funding where shares of a trust were
sold directly to qualified plans.

Applicants' Conditions



Applicants have consented to the following conditions if the requested order is granted:

1. A majority of the Board of Trustees or Board of Directors of each Fund (each, a ``Board'') shall consist of persons
who are not ``interested persons'' of the Fund, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder
and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that, if this condition is not met by reason of the
death, disqualification, or bona fide resignation of any trustee or director, then the operation of this condition
shall be suspended: (a) for a period of 45 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period
of 60 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the
Commission may prescribe by order upon application.

2. Each Board will monitor its Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests
of the Contract owners of all of the Accounts investing in the Fund. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for
a variety of reasons, including: (a) an action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable
federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action
or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an
administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of the Fund
are managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by owners of variable annuity contracts and owners of variable
life insurance contracts; or (f) a decision by an insurer to disregard the voting instructions of Contract owners.

3. The Participating Insurance Companies and MFS (or any other investment advisor of a Fund) will report any potential
or existing conflicts to the Board. Participating Insurance Companies and MFS (or any other investment advisor of
a Fund) will be responsible for assisting the appropriate Board in carrying out its responsibilities under these
conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for the Board to consider any issues
raised, including information as to a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard voting instructions
of Contract owners. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the Board will be a contractual
obligation of the Participating Insurance Companies under the agreements governing participation in the Funds
and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of Contract owners.

4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or by a majority of its disinterested trustees or directors, that an
irreconcilable material conflict exists, the relevant Participating Insurance Companies shall, at their expense
and to the extent reasonably practicable, take steps necessary to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material
conflict, including: (a) withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the Accounts from the Fund and reinvesting
such assets in a different investment medium including another portfolio of the Fund or another Fund, or submitting
the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners; and, as
appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (

i.e.

, variable annuity contract owners or variable life insurance contract owners) that votes in favor of such segregation,
or offering to the affected variable contract owners the option of making such a change; and (b) establishing a new
registered management investment company or managed separate account.

The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict
and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies
under the agreements governing their participation in the Funds. The responsibility to take such remedial action
shall be carried out with a view only to the interests of Contract owners. For purposes of this Condition Four, a majority
of the disinterested members of the applicable Board shall determine whether any proposed action adequately remedies
any material irreconcilable conflict, but, in no event will the Fund or MFS be required to establish a new funding medium
for any Contract. Further, no Participating Insurance Company shall be required by this Condition Four to establish
a new funding medium for any Contract if any offer to do so has been declined by a vote of a majority of the affected Contract
owners.

5. The Board's determination of the existence of an irreconcilable material conflict and its implications shall
be made known promptly and in writing to all Participating Insurance Companies.

6. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all Contract owners so long
as the Commission interprets the 1940 Act to require pass-through voting privileges for Contract owners. Accordingly,
the Participating Insurance Companies will vote shares of the Fund held in their Accounts in a manner consistent with
voting instructions timely received from Contract owners. Participating Insurance Companies will be responsible
for assuring that each of their Accounts calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with other Participating
Insurance Companies. The obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Accounts
will be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under the agreements governing their
participation in the Funds. Each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares for which it has not received voting
instructions as well as shares attributable to it in the same proportion as it votes shares for which it has received
instructions.

7. All reports received by the Board of potential or existing conflicts, and all Board action with regard to: (a) determining
the existence of a conflict; (b) notifying Participating Insurance Companies of a conflict; and (c) determining
whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board
or other appropriate records. Such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.

8. Each Fund will notify all Participating Insurance Companies that separate account prospectus disclosure regarding
potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate. Each Fund shall disclose in its prospectus that: (a)
shares of the Fund are offered in connection with mixed and shared funding; (b) material conflicts may arise from mixed
and shared funding arrangements; and (c) the Board will monitor for the existence of any material conflicts and determine
what action, if any, should be taken in response to such conflicts.

9. Each Fund will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders, and, in particular,
each Fund will either provide for annual meetings (except to the extent that the Commission may interpret Section
16 of the 1940 Act not to require such meetings) or comply with Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act, (although the Funds are
not within the trusts described in Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act) as well as with Section 16(a), and, if applicable,
Section 16(b) of the 1940 Act. Further, each Fund will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the
requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of trustees and with whatever rules the Commission
may promulgate with respect thereto.

10. If and to the extent that Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) are amended (or if Rule 6e-3 under the 1940 Act is
adopted) to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the 1940 Act or the rules thereunder with respect to mixed
and shared funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested
by Applicants, then the Funds and the Participating Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as
may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T), as amended, and Rule 6e-3, as adopted, to the
extent applicable.

11. No less than annually, the Participating Insurance Companies and/or MFS (or any other investment advisor of a
Fund) shall submit to the Boards such reports, materials, or data as the Board may reasonably request so that the Boards
may carry out fully the obligations imposed by the conditions contained in the application. Such reports, materials,
and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the Boards. The obligations of the Participating
Insurance Companies to provide these reports, materials, and data to the Boards shall be a contractual obligation
of all Participating Insurance Companies under the agreements governing participation in the Funds.

12. If a Plan should become an owner of 10% or more of the assets of a Fund, such Plan will execute a fund participation
agreement with the applicable Fund. A Plan will execute an application containing an acknowledgment of this condition
upon such Plan's initial purchase of shares of any Fund.



Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, Applicants believe that the requested exemptions, in accordance with the standards
of Section 6(c), are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

<DOCTITLE>Ontario Financing Authority; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



July 28, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANT: 

Ontario Financing Authority (``OFA'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested under section 6(c) from all provisions of the Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

OFA, a public authority established by the Province of Ontario, Canada, seeks an order exempting it from all provisions
of the Act in connection with the offer and sale of its debt securities in the United States.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicant's Representations



1. OFA is a statutory authority of the Province of Ontario (``Ontario'' or the ``Province'') established on November
15, 1993 by the Province under the Capital Investment Plan Act, 1993 (the ``Capital Investment Act''). The Province
established OFA to assist the Province, and municipalities, school boards, post-secondary institutions, hospitals
and other public bodies (the ``Public Sector Clients'') to borrow and invest money, and provide other financial services.
Through OFA, money will be raised to finance capital investment in the areas of, among others, education, health-care,
transportation, and water and sewage infrastructure. OFA is expected to become a major financing vehicle for borrowing
by Public Sector Clients.

<TEXT>
 

2. OFA proposes to issue and sell in the United States debt securities unconditionally guaranteed by the Province
(``Guaranteed Debt Securities''). The proceeds of the Guaranteed Debt Securities will be lent to various Public
Sector Clients. Substantially all of the moneys borrowed by OFA will be re-lent to the Public Sector Clients. Funds
not immediately lent to the Province or Public Sector Clients will be invested by OFA. In order to assure favorable
terms to the Public Sector Clients, and in anticipation of their borrowing needs, OFA may borrow and then invest the
proceeds of such borrowings temporarily in debt instruments, such as banker's acceptances, Treasury bills, and
commercial paper until the Public Sector Clients require such funds.

3. Guaranteed Debt Securities will be direct, unsecured obligations of OFA, with the payment of principal, and any
interest or premium, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by the Province (the ``Provincial Guarantee'')
pursuant to an order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council under the Financial Administration Act (the ``FAA'').
Section 22 of the FAA provides, in part, that the Lieutenant Governor in Council may by order authorize the Minister
of Finance, on behalf of Ontario, ``to agree to guarantee or indemnify the debts, obligations, securities or undertakings
of any person * * * [and] may fix such terms and conditions as are considered advisable * * *.''
Pursuant to this authority, Guaranteed Debt Securities will bear the irrevocable unconditional guarantee of the
Province so that, in the event of a default, holders of Guaranteed Debt Securities may proceed directly against the
Province under such guarantee without first proceeding against OFA, and such amount will then be payable out of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Province.

4. The Capital Investment Act is the primary legislation governing OFA and sets out OFA's constitution, functions,
and powers. The Minister of Finance of the Province is responsible for the administration of the Capital Investment
Act in respect of OFA. Pursuant to the Capital Investment Act, OFA is required to submit an annual report on its affairs,
including audited financial statements, to the Minister of Finance within 90 days of the end of its fiscal year. The
financial statements are audited by the Provincial Auditor.

5. The Lieutenant Governor in Council is empowered to make regulations respecting the management, control, and administration
of the affairs of OFA. OFA's board of directors may pass by-laws regulating OFA's proceedings, specifying the powers
and duties of the officers and employees and generally for the management of OFA. In particular, the power of OFA to
borrow, issue securities, make short-term investments, manage risk associated with financing and investment,
or incur liabilities in order to facilitate financings by others only may be exercised under the authority of a by-law
that has been approved by the Minister of Finance.

6. Substantially all of OFA's assets are expected to include: (i) Obligations of Public Sector Clients to repay loans
made to them by OFA; (ii) the assets, consisting primarily of deposit obligations, of The Province of Ontario Savings
Office; (iii) obligations of certain Public Sector Clients to repay loans made to them by the Province and transferred
to OFA; (iv) investments to facilitate OFA's cash flow management and maximize the return on its surplus funds and
those of Public Sector Clients; and (v) such other assets, which may consist of obligations or investments, as permitted
by the Capital Investment Act.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 3(a)(3) of the Act defines an investment company as an issuer engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting,
owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owning ``investment securities'' having a value exceeding 40% of
the value of such issuer's total assets. Because substantially all of the moneys borrowed by OFA will be lent to Public
Sector Clients, a substantial portion of OFA's assets will consist of obligations of the Public Sector Clients to
repay such loans. In addition, OFA will invest its own surplus funds and those of other Public Sector Clients, as well
as make temporary investments. Such obligations and investments could be deemed to be ``investment securities''
within the meaning of section 3(a)(3). As a result, OFA could be deemed to be an ``investment company'' under the Act.

2. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to grant an exemption from the provisions of the Act if and to the extent that such exemption
is necessary and appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors, and consistent
with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

3. OFA believes that granting the exemption would be appropriate in the public interest. It would benefit United States
investors by making the Guaranteed Debt Securities more readily available to such investors. It also would expand
the United States' market for OFA's Guaranteed Debt Securities and thus encourage the free flow of capital among nations.

4. OFA further believes that granting the exemption requested would be consistent with the protection of investors.
The payment of the principal of, and any premium or interest on, the Guaranteed Debt Securities will be irrevocably
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Province. As a result, the Guaranteed Debt Securities will be backed by the
sovereign credit of the Province and not merely the credit and assets of OFA.

5. Finally, OFA believes an exemption would be consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the Act. OFA is a governmental central financing and investing authority that was organized to obtain and arrange
efficient financing and investments for the requirements of public authorities of the Province. OFA is thus a statutory
body with characteristics different from the types of investment companies at which the Act generally is directed
and for which its substantive provisions are necessary or suitable.

Applicant's Conditions


OFA agrees that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
1. No Guaranteed Debt Securities will be offered or sold within the United States unless: (a) They are registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act''); (b) in the opinion of United States counsel for OFA, an exemption
from registration under the Securities Act is available with respect to such offer and sale; or (c) the staff of the
SEC states in writing that they will not recommend that the SEC take any enforcement action under the Securities Act
if such securities are offered and sold in the United States without registration.
2. All borrowings by OFA, including the issuance by OFA of the Guaranteed Debt Securities, will be effected in accordance
with the provisions of the Capital Investment Act and any applicable regulations and by-laws promulgated thereunder.
All investments of funds of OFA and any Pubic Sector Client will be made by OFA in accordance with the requirements of
the Capital Investment Act and any applicable regulations and by-laws promulgated thereunder. All temporary investments
by OFA will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Investment Act and any applicable regulations
and by-laws promulgated thereunder.
3. The payment of principal of, and any interest or premium on, all Guaranteed Debt Securities issued by OFA will be
irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by the Province pursuant to an order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council
under the FAA.
4. Applicant and the Province will expressly submit to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court in the City or
State of New York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Guaranteed Debt Securities and the Provincial
Guarantee, and Applicant and the Province will agree that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in such New York State court or in any such federal court. Applicant and the Province also will
waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. Applicant and the Province
will appoint an agent for service of process with an office in New York, New York, as agent to receive on behalf of Applicant
and the Province service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process which may be served in any such
action or proceeding. Such consent to jurisdiction and appointment of an agent for service of process will be irrevocable
until all amounts due and payable in respect of any such Guaranteed Debt Securities have been paid. Applicant will
agree to explicitly waive any immunity it may have from jurisdiction and from execution or attachment or any process
in the nature thereof in respect of any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Guaranteed Debt
Securities. The Province will agree to explicitly waive any immunity the Province may have from jurisdiction in respect
of any such action.
5. In respect of any action or proceeding brought with respect to such Guaranteed Debt Securities or Provincial Guarantee
instituted in any state or federal court in the United States (other than any action or proceeding in any New York State
or federal court in New York City referred to in the preceding paragraph), each of OFA and the Province will agree to
accept service of process by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt effected in accordance with Sections 1608(b)(3)(B)
and 1608(a)(3), respectively, of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (28 U.S.C. 1608). In agreeing to accept
such service of process in any such action or proceeding, neither OFA nor the Province will waive any claim of sovereign
immunity it may have with respect to itself or its property in any such action or proceeding, consent to the subject
matter jurisdiction or jurisdiction 

in personam

 of any such court, agree that any such court is a proper forum for any such action or proceeding, or waive any rights it
may have to remove any such action or proceeding from state court to federal court.

RELEVANT ACT SECTION: 

Section 8(f).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicant seeks an order declaring that it has ceased to be an investment company.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant is an open-end diversified management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On March
4, 1988, applicant registered as an investment company under the Act, and filed a registration statement on Form N-1A
under the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement became effective on July 13,
1988, and applicant's initial public offering commenced immediately thereafter.

2. On February 16,1994, applicant's board of directors approved an agreement and plan of reorganization (the ``Plan'')
between applicant and TCW Funds, Inc. (``TCW Funds''), a registered, open-end management company. The Plan provided
for the transfer of all of the assets and liabilities of applicant's sole series, the Money Market Portfolio, in exchange
for shares of TCW Galileo Money Market Fund (``Galileo''), a series of TCW Funds.

3. Definitive proxy materials relating to the Plan were filed with the SEC on March 23, 1994, and proxy materials were
mailed to applicant's on or about March 25, 1994.

4. On April 6, 1994, the SEC issued an order
 permitting applicant to exchange its assets and liabilities for shares of Galileo, provided that applicant's shareholders
approved the exchange. In the application requesting that order, it was stated that the reason for the reorganization
was to help reduce overall operating expenses because of economies of scale achieved by spreading certain management
and administrative expenses over a larger asset base. Applicant's shareholders voted to approve the Plan at a special
meeting of applicant's shareholders on April 20, 1994.





5. As of May 23, 1994, applicant had 87,893,619 shares outstanding, having an aggregate net asset value of $87,893,619,
and a per share net asset value of $1.00. On May 23, 1994, pursuant to the Plan, applicant transferred all of its assets
and liabilities to the TCW Funds, Inc. in exchange for shares of Galileo. The aggregate net asset value of the Galileo
shares received was equal to the net asset value of applicant's shares held. Applicant then distributed the Galileo
shares it received 

pro rata 

to its shareholders, in complete liquidation of applicant.

6. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the reorganization. The expenses applicable to the Plan,
consisting of accounting, printing, administrative, and certain legal expenses, are estimated to be approximately
$10,000. These expenses have been or will be paid by TCW Funds Management, Inc., applicant's investment adviser.

7. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any
business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

8. Applicant intends to file Articles of Dissolution with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation.

<USBUREAU>Federal Railroad Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Petition for Waivers of Compliance </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
has received from the Burlington Northern Railroad a request for waiver of compliance with certain requirements
of the Federal rail safety regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved,
the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. 


Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) 


(FRA Waiver Petition Docket Number SA-94-5) 



The BN seeks a waiver of compliance from certain sections of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR Part 231).
BN states that it will be building one trainset of its ``trough train'' equipment. This train will be composed of 22
13-section cars. The parking brakes on these cars are of conventional design, but their location is not standard.
The unique size and design of one 13-section car does not allow the conventional application of a handbrake. 


BN requests a waiver from 49 CFR 231.1(a)(1), 231.1(a)(3)(i), and 231.1(a)(3)(ii). Section 231.1(a)(1) requires
that there be one efficient handbrake which shall operate in harmony with the power brake installed on the car. 

BN states that the 13-section trough train car has 14 truck assemblies; 2 single axle trucks and 12 two axle trucks.
It is impossible to brake a minimum of half the total axles under the 13-section car from one parking brake location.
A much more positive brake is provided by the proposed system that has each parking brake holding 2 two axle trucks.
No active linkage cross any articulation under this system. The system uses a minimum of 4 parking brakes that brake
16 axles out of the 24 axle total. The 13-section trough train car requires more than one parking brake per car to safely
hold the car when stopped. There are many cars that operate successfully with more than one handbrake, such as heavy
duty flat cars, articulated intermodal cars and stand alone intermodal cars connected into groups with drawbars.


Section 231.1(a)(3)(i) requires that the handbrake be so located that it can be safely operated while the car is in
motion. BN states that the long length of a trough train car 
(278 feet) necessitates multiple parking brakes to hold the car safely on grades and direct simple parking brake connections
to the individual trucks and axles, requires that multiple parking brakes be applied along the length of the car. Four
parking brakes per car is proposed. The location of the parking brakes does not lend itself to making provisions for
the brake to be operated while the car is in motion. The design of the car will not allow the application of a standard
handbrake to safely allow a man to ride the car while setting the brake. These cars are specifically designed for unit
train operation and will be used in services where the train is loaded and unloaded in full trains or large blocks of
cars, while coupled to and under the control of a locomotive. The parking brakes are designed to hold the car once stopped,
on any practical grade for whatever reason. The safety of employees is enhanced by allowing them to apply the brake
from the ground, without the need to climb onto the equipment. 

The BN has had a policy in effect for several years that prohibits anyone from mounting or dismounting any freight car,
caboose, or locomotive while it is moving. The application of parking brakes on this type of car will only be done while
the car is stopped. A waiver is requested that allows the operation of the parking brake only when the car is stopped.


Section 231.1(a)(3)(ii) requires that the brake shaft be located on end of car, to the left of and not less than 17 nor
more than 22 inches from center. 

BN states that due to the design of the car and the need to operate the parking brake from the ground, it is imperative
that the brake wheel and mechanism be mounted in such a way as to make its operation as safe as possible. The brake wheel
and mechanism has been mounted as low as the car design will allow (approximately 3-foot 10 inches from the top of the
rail to the bottom of the wheel rim) and as close to the side of the car as possible (52 inches to the center of the brake
shaft from the center of the car.) This location allows the brake to be easily operated from the ground while the car
is stopped. 

The BN states the trough train provides the latest advancements in slackless technology, car geometry, aerodynamics
and safety. 

Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.

FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number SA-94-5 and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
FRA, Nassif Building, 
400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communications received before September 6, 1994 will be considered
by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far as practicable. All
written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours
(9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W.,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background


Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1505 and Treasury Decision 85-93, published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 29, 1985 (50 FR 21832), the interest rate paid on applicable overpayments or underpayments of Customs duties
shall be in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code rate established under 26 U.S.C. 6621 and 6622. Interest rates
are determined based on the short-term Federal rate. The interest rate that Treasury pays on overpayments will be
the short-term Federal rate plus two percentage points. The interest rate paid to the Treasury for underpayments
will be the short-term Federal rate plus three percentage points. The rates will be rounded to the nearest full percentage.

The interest rates are determined by the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury based
on the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the U.S. with remaining periods to maturity
of 3 years or less, and fluctuate quarterly. The rates effective for a quarter are determined during the first- month
period of the previous quarter. The rates of interest for the period of July 1, 1994-September 30, 1994, are 7
percent for overpayments and 8 percent for underpayments. These rates will remain in effect through September 30,
1994, and are subject to change on October 1, 1994.
