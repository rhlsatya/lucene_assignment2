MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD







Board Organization



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Merit Systems Protection Board.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Board is amending its organization and functional statements by adding a new section to clarify the procedure
to be followed when a majority of the members of the Board cannot agree on the disposition of a case or a matter involved
in a case due to a vacancy, recusal, or other reasons.



None of these matters is currently addressed in the Board's regulations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The procedures established by this regulation are based on established law which the Board applies when one vacancy
exists and the two sitting members are unable to agree on the disposition of a case. Kopp v. Office of Personnel Management,
38 M.S.P.R. 430, 433 (1988); Glass v. Office of Personnel Management, 31 M.S.P.R. 162 (1986); Wade v. Department of
Justice, 31 M.S.P.R. 35 (1986); Ingram v. Department of the Navy, 30 M.S.P.R. 699 (1986) aff'd 818 F.2d 876 (Fed. Cir.
1987) (Table). Consistent with these cases, the regulation rejects suggestions in earlier cases that the Board members
may not under any circumstances delegate final decisional authority. Acting Special Counsel v. Sullivan, 4 M.S.P.R.
485, 490 (1981); Kling v. Department of Justice, 2 M.S.P.R. 464, 468 (1981).



The Board is publishing this rule as a final rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1204(h).

Pine Shoot Beetle 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule and request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the pine shoot beetle regulations by adding Lake and 
McHenry Counties, IL; Blackford, Cass, and Wabash Counties, IN; Huron, Kent, 
Lapeer, Sanilac, and St. Clair Counties, MI; Oswego County, NY; and Allegheny, 
Beaver, Butler, Clarion, Mercer, Venango, and Warren Counties, PA, to the list 
of quarantined areas. This action is necessary on an emergency basis to 
prevent the spread of the pine shoot beetle, a highly destructive pest of pine 
trees, into noninfested areas of the United States. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The pine shoot beetle is a highly destructive pest of pine trees. The 
pine shoot beetle can cause damage in weak and dying trees, where reproduction 
and immature stages of pine shoot beetle occur, and in the new growth of 
healthy trees. The ``maturation feeding'' of young beetles takes the form of 
boring up the center of pine shoots (usually of the current year's growth), 
causing stunted and distorted growth in the host trees. The pine shoot beetle 
is also a vector of several diseases of pine trees. Adults can fly at least 1 
kilometer, and the wood, nursery stock, and Christmas trees they infest are 
often transported long distances. This pest damages urban trees, and can 
cause economic losses to the timber, Christmas tree, and nursery industries. 
The regulations in 7 CFR 301.50 (referred to below as the regulations) 
impose restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from 
quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the pine shoot beetle into 
noninfested areas of the United States. 
Surveys recently conducted by State and Federal inspectors revealed that 
Lake and McHenry Counties, IL; Blackford, Cass, and Wabash Counties, IN; 
Huron, Kent, Lapeer, Sanilac, and St. Clair Counties, MI; Oswego County, NY; 
and Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Clarion, Mercer, Venango, and Warren Counties, 
PA, are infested with the pine shoot beetle. The regulations in  301.50-3 
provide that the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service (APHIS) will list as a quarantined area each State, or each portion of 
a State, in which the pine shoot beetle has been found by an inspector, in 
which the Administrator has reason to believe the pine shoot beetle is 
present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of 
its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in 
which the pine shoot beetle has been found. 
In accordance with these criteria, we are designating Lake and McHenry 
Counties, IL; Blackford, Cass, and Wabash Counties, IN; Huron, Kent, Lapeer, 
Sanilac, and St. Clair Counties, MI; Oswego County, NY; and Allegheny, Beaver, 
Butler, Clarion, Mercer, Venango, and Warren Counties, PA, as quarantined 
areas, and adding them to the list of quarantined areas in  301.50-3(c). 


Emergency Action 


The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has 
determined that an emergency situation exists that warrants publication of 
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate 
action is necessary to prevent the pine shoot beetle from spreading to 
noninfested areas of the United States. 
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this 
action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these 
conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon 
signature. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of 
publication of this rule in the 

Federal Register

. After the comment period 
closes, we will publish another document in the 

Federal Register

. It will 
include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are 
making to the rule as a result of the comments.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its 
review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
About 300 small nurseries and 330 producers of Christmas trees and other 
forest products operate in the 18 newly quarantined counties. All could 
probably be classified as small entities by Small Business Administration 
criteria (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less). While most of the 
small nurseries in these counties specialize in production of deciduous 
landscape products, some also produce rooted pine Christmas trees and pine 
nursery stock. 
This action will affect only the sale of restricted pine products from 
quarantined areas to non-quarantined areas. If inspected and found to be 
infested with the pine shoot beetle, restricted pine products can be either 
diverted for sale within local markets or treated in accordance with 
 301.50-10 prior to shipment to a non-quarantined area. Based on information 
acquired from extension agents and trade association representatives, we 
estimate that in the newly quarantined counties, the sale of restricted pine 
products to buyers in non-quarantined areas will represent less than one 
percent of total sales by small nurseries and less than five percent of total 
sales by Christmas tree and forest product producers. We anticipate, 
therefore, that this action will not have a significant economic impact on 
small nurseries, Christmas tree farmers, or other forest product producers. 
There are a few logging operations in the newly quarantined counties in 
Pennsylvania. However, these operations harvest hardwoods primarily. 
Furthermore, the little pine that is cut is sold locally and thus would not be 
affected by this action. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 
7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice 
Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations 
that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) 
does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in 
court challenging this rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 


et seq.

), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in 
this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and 
there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number is 
0579-0088. 


National Environmental Policy Act 


An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have 
been prepared for this rule. The assessment provides a basis for the 
conclusion that the treatment of restricted pine products, under the 
conditions specified in this rule, will not present a risk of introducing or 
disseminating plant pests and will not have a significant impact on the 
quality of the human environment. Based on the finding of no significant 
impact, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
has determined that an environmental impact statement will not be prepared. 
The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact were 
prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), (2) Regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 
CFR Parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), 
and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 
1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979). 
Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant 
impact are available for public inspection at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 
14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 
4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. In addition, copies may be

Nutrition Labeling of Ground Beef and Hamburger: Extension of Compliance Date 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of extension of compliance date.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing an extension of the date for enforcing compliance with
its nutrition labeling regulations for ground beef and hamburger. The compliance enforcement date for the nutrition
labeling regulations published on January 6, 1993, is August 8, 1994. FSIS is issuing this notice to clarify its policy
on the enforcement of nutrition labeling of ground beef and hamburger pending publication of a final regulation concerning
percentage labeling for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On May 24, 1994, FSIS issued a proposed rule (59 FR 26916) with a shortened 45-day comment period to permit percentage
labeling on lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger. On July 5, 1994, FSIS announced that it was granting a request
filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest to extend the comment period of the proposed rule for an additional
45 days until August 22, 1994 (59 FR 34396). Extending the comment period will allow additional survey data to be collected
and submitted to FSIS concerning consumer perceptions of terms such as ``percent lean,'' ``lean,'' and ``reduced
fat.'' As a result of the extension, the comment period of the proposed rule on labeling of ground beef and hamburger
now extends beyond the nutrition labeling compliance date of August 8, 1994. On June 16, 1994, FSIS announced that
although the effective date of the nutrition labeling regulations was July 6, 1994, the Agency would not take enforcement
action on meat and poultry products until August 8, 1994 (59 FR 30875).




FSIS has received several requests to clarify its enforcement posture for nutrition labeling policies for ground
beef and hamburger pending the completion of the rulemaking process. Many of those requesting clarification contend
that extending the comment period on the proposed rule caused confusion regarding FSIS' enforcement posture for
nutrition labeling of ground beef and hamburger. After carefully considering the issue, FSIS has decided to extend
the effective date for enforcing compliance with the nutrition labeling regulations for ground beef and hamburger
until evaluation of comments received on the May 24 proposed rule is completed, and a final rule is issued. FSIS believes
such action is reasonable and practical because the Agency extended the comment period on the proposed rule (59 FR
34396) in order to collect information about consumer understanding of nutrition labeling terms on these products.
Extending enforcement action on nutrition labeling of ground beef and hamburger should avoid the situation of having
three potentially different labeling schemes for ground beef and hamburger products within several months, and
will prevent a lapse of information that consumers might expect or want on ground beef and hamburger packages. The
extension will also allow manufacturers and retailers to use existing label inventories during this interim period.


FSIS will publish a final rule on ground beef and hamburger labeling in the 

Federal Register

 after it analyzes the public comments and consumer survey results received in response to the proposed rule.

ACTION: 

Final special conditions; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These special conditions are issued to Elliott Aviation, Des Moines, Iowa, for a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC)
on the Beech Models 65, A65, 65-80, 65-A80, 65-B80, 65-90, 65-A90, 70, B90, C90, C90A
and E90 airplanes. These airplanes will have novel and unusual design features when compared to the state of technology
envisaged in the applicable airworthiness standards. These novel and unusual design features include the installation
of electronic displays for which the applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate airworthiness
standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of high intensity radiated fields (HIRF). These special
conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level
of safety equivalent to the airworthiness standards applicable to these airplanes.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Comments Invited




Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety, and, thus,
was not proceeded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on these special conditions.

Interested persons are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the regulatory docket and special conditions number and be submitted in duplicate to the address
specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the
Administrator. These special conditions may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments submitted
will be available in the rules docket for examination by interested parties, both before and after the closing date
for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking
will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments, submitted in response
to this request, must include a self-addressed and stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments
to Docket No. 120CE.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.



Background



On July 10, 1994, Elliott Aviation, 2800 McKinley Avenue, Des Moines, Iowa 50321, made an application to the FAA for
a supplemental type certificate (STC) for the Beech Models 65, A65, 65-80, 65-A80, 65-B80, 65-90,
65-A90, 70, B90, C90, C90A and E90 airplanes. The proposed modification incorporates a novel or unusual design
feature, such as digital avionics consisting of an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), that is vulnerable
to HIRF external to the airplane.

Type Certification Basis



The type certification basis for the Beech Models 65, A65, 65-80, 65-A80, 65-B80, 65-90, 65-A90,
70, B90, C90, C90A and E90 Airplanes is given in Type Certificate Data Sheet No. 3A20.



Discussion



The FAA may issue and amend special conditions, as necessary, as part of the type certification basis if the Administrator
finds that the airworthiness standards, designated according to  21.101(b), do not contain adequate or appropriate
safety standards because of novel or unusual design features of an airplane. Special conditions are normally issued
according to  11.49, after public notice, as required by   11.28 and 11.29(b), effective October
14, 1980, and become a part of the type certification basis.

Elliott Aviation plans to incorporate certain novel and unusual design features into an airplane for which the airworthiness
standards do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for protection from the effects of HIRF. These
features include electronic systems, which are susceptible to the HIRF environment, that were not envisaged by the
existing regulations for this type of airplane.



Protection of Systems From High Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)



Recent advances in technology have given rise to the application in aircraft designs of advanced electrical and electronic
systems that perform functions required for continued safe flight and landing. Due to the use of sensitive solid state
advanced components in analog and digital electronics circuits, these advanced systems are readily responsive
to the transient effects of induced electrical current and voltage caused by the HIRF. The HIRF can degrade electronic
systems performance by damaging components or upsetting system functions.

Furthermore, the HIRF environment has undergone a transformation that was not foreseen when the current requirements
were developed. Higher energy levels are radiated from transmitters that are used for radar, radio, and television.
Also, the number of transmitters has increased significantly. There is also uncertainty concerning the effectiveness
of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window
apertures is undefined.

The combined effect of the technological advances in airplane design and the changing environment has resulted in
an increased level of vulnerability of electrical and electronic systems required for the continued safe flight
and landing of the airplane. Effective measures against the effects of exposure to HIRF must be provided by the design
and installation of these systems. The accepted maximum energy levels in which civilian airplane system installations
must be capable of operating safely are based on surveys and analysis of existing radio frequency emitters. These
special conditions require that the airplane be evaluated under these energy levels for the protection of the electronic
system and its associated wiring harness. These external threat levels, which are lower than previous required values,
are believed to represent the worst case to which an airplane would be exposed in the operating environment.

These special conditions require qualification of systems that perform critical functions, as installed in aircraft,
to the defined HIRF environment in paragraph 1 or, as an option to a fixed value using laboratory tests, in paragraph
2, as follows:

(1) The applicant may demonstrate that the operation and operational capability of the installed electrical and
electronic systems that perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the aircraft is exposed to the
HIRF environment defined below:


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940805-0-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940805-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 





or,



(2) The applicant may demonstrate by a system test and analysis that the electrical and electronic systems that perform
critical functions can withstand a minimum threat of 100 volts per meter, peak electrical field strength, from 10
KHz to 18 GHz. When using this test to show compliance with the HIRF requirements, no credit is given for signal attenuation
due to installation.

A preliminary hazard analysis must be performed by the applicant, for approval by the FAA, to identify electrical
and/or electronic systems that perform critical functions. The term ``critical'' means those functions whose failure
would contribute to, or cause, a failure condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the
airplane. The systems identified by the hazard analysis that perform critical functions are candidates for the application
of HIRF requirements. A system may perform both critical and non-critical functions. Primary electronic flight
display systems, and their associated components, perform critical functions such as attitude, altitude, and airspeed
indication. The HIRF requirements apply only to critical functions.

Compliance with HIRF requirements may be demonstrated by tests, analysis, models, similarity with existing systems,
or any combination of these. Service experience alone is not acceptable since normal flight operations may not include
an exposure to the HIRF environment. Reliance on a system with similar design features for redundancy as a means of
protection against the effects of external HIRF is generally insufficient since all elements of a redundant system
are likely to be exposed to the fields concurrently.



Conclusion



In view of the design features discussed for the Beech Models 65, A65, 65-80, 65-A80, 65-B80, 65-90,
65-A90, 70, B90, C90, C90A and E90 Airplanes, the following special conditions are issued. This action is a rule
of general applicability and affects only those applicants who apply to the FAA for approval of these features on these
airplanes.

The substance of these special conditions has been subject to the notice and public comment procedure in several prior
rulemaking actions. For example, the Dornier 228-200 (53 FR 14782, April 26, 1988), the Cessna Model 525 (56
FR 49396, September 30, 1991), and the Beech Model 200, A200, and B200 airplanes (57 FR 1220, January 13, 1992). It is
unlikely that additional public comment would result in any significant change from those special conditions already
issued and commented on. For these reasons, and because a delay would significantly affect the applicant's installation
of the system and certification of the airplane, which is imminent, the FAA has determined that prior public notice
and comment are unnecessary and impracticable, and good cause exists for adopting these special conditions without
notice. Therefore, these special conditions are being made effective upon publication in the Federal Register.

 However, as previously indicated, interested persons are invited to comment on these special conditions if they
so desire.

Standard Instrument Approach Procedures; Miscellaneous Amendments

action: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and  97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260-3, 8260-4, and 8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.



The Rule



This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and  97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference

The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.



The Rule



This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been canceled.

The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments
in this rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as
an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.



Conclusion



The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies

the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The FAA has determined through testing that current non-localizer type, non-precision instrument approaches developed
using the TERPS criteria can be flown by aircraft equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. In consideration
of the above, the applicable Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) will be altered to include ``or GPS''
in the title without otherwise reviewing or modifying the procedure. Because of the close and immediate relationship
between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs
are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists
for making some SIAPs effective in less than 30 days. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant

Disclosures Regarding Energy Consumption and Water Use of Certain Home Appliances and Other Products Required Under
the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (``Appliance Labeling Rule'')



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission amends its Appliance Labeling Rule by publishing the ranges of comparability to be used
on required labels for central air conditioners and heat pumps and by updating the annual national average cost figure
for electricity to be used in the cost calculation formula required on fact sheets and in directories. These cost figures
are for consumers to use to calculate their own heating and cooling costs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 324 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA)
 requires the Federal Trade Commission to consider labeling rules for the disclosure of estimated annual energy cost
or alternative energy consumption information for at least thirteen categories of appliances. Central air conditioners
(including heat pumps) are included as one of the categories. The statute also requires the Department of Energy (``DOE'')
to develop test procedures that measure how much energy the appliances use. In addition, DOE is required to determine
the representative average cost a consumer pays for the different types of energy available.





On November 19, 1979, the Commission issued a final Rule covering seven of the thirteen appliance categories that
were then covered by DOE test procedures: refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, freezers, dishwashers, water
heaters, clothes washers, room air conditioners and furnaces.
 On December 10, 1987, the Commission amended the Appliance Labeling Rule by extending its coverage to central air
conditioners and heat pumps. For these products, the Commission adopted a disclosure scheme that consists of labels
showing simple energy efficiency and range information, together with a requirement to disclose further efficiency
and cost information by means of either fact sheets or a listing in a general directory containing such information.







Section 305.8(b) of the rule requires manufacturers, after filing an initial report, to report annually by specified
dates for each product type.
 These reports, which are to assist the Commission in preparing the ranges of comparability, contain the estimated
annual cost or energy efficiency rating for the appliances derived from tests performed pursuant to the DOE test procedures.
The reports also contain the model number, the number of tests performed on each model, and the capacity of each. Because
the costs for the various types of energy change yearly, and because manufacturers regularly add new models to their
lines, improve existing models and drop others, the data base from which the ranges of comparability are calculated
is constantly changing. To keep the required information in line with these changes, the Commission is empowered,
under  305.10 of the rule, to publish new ranges (but not more often than annually) if an analysis of the new data
indicates that the upper or lower limits of the ranges have changed by more than 15%. Otherwise, the Commission must
publish a statement that the prior range or ranges remain in effect for the next year.





The annual reports for central air conditioners (including heat pumps) have been received and analyzed by the Commission.
New ranges based upon them are herewith published. These ranges will supersede the current ranges, which were published
on September 25, 1992.






In addition, this Notice provides an updated figure for the annual national average cost of electricity. This figure,
along with national average cost figures for natural gas, propane, heating oil and kerosene, is published annually
by the Department of Energy for the industry's use in calculating the cost figures required by the Commission's Rule.
The cost figure for electricity must be used in the cost calculation formulas that appear in Appendices H and I. These
formulas must be provided on fact sheets and in directories so consumers can calculate their own costs of operation
for the central air conditioners and heat pumps that they are considering purchasing. The updated figure, which DOE
published on December 29, 1993,
 and which the Commission published on February 8, 1994,
 is 8.41 cents per kilowatt-hour. The formulas (and calculations) in both Appendices have been changed to reflect
this.






In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission revises Appendices H(1) and (2) and I(1) and (2) of its Appliance
Labeling Rule by publishing the following ranges of comparability and cost figures for use in the labeling and advertising
of central air conditioners and heat pumps beginning December 28, 1994.

Visas: Documentation of Immigrants Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, As Amended 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Consular Affairs, State.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule amends immigrant visa regulations to make clear that the Department has the authority to determine where
an alien's immigrant visa application shall be processed and to revise the text thereof for clarity and consistency
of usage.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


On April 28, 1994, the Department published a proposed rule (59 FR 21948) to amend 22 CFR 42.61(a) to make explicit that
the Department has the authority to make exceptions, for policy or operational reasons, to the general rules concerning
where an application for an immigrant visa shall be made. The period for comment on the proposal ended on May 31, 1994.

The Department received one comment during the period. The commenter opposed promulgation of the proposed revision
on several bases, one of which appears to derive from a misreading of the legislative history of the 1952 Act. Accordingly,
it appears that a bit of the history of this provision may be appropriate. 
The Immigration Act of 1924 did not contain a specific provision regarding place of application for an immigration
visa. Instead, it simply authorized the Secretary of State to make regulations regarding the ``form'' in which such
applications were to be made. 
For many years the Department's instructions on the subject of place of application were included in Visa Supplement
A, which contained a series of Notes for the guidance of consular officers in processing visa applications. As of November
1, 1940, Note 87 read as follows: 
``Aliens will ordinarily make their applications for immigration visas to the consul in whose district they reside.

``The applications of nonquota immigrants may be accepted outside their home districts provided they present satisfactory
evidence to the consul of their nonquota status under section 4 of the Act and of their admissibility to the United States
under the immigration laws. If such satisfactory evidence is not produced the consul to whom the alien applies may
request the assistance of the consul in the alien's home district in investigating the case or refer the applicant
to that consul. 
``The application of quota immigrants may be accepted outside their home districts provided_
``(1) A quota number is available or can be obtained for the 
 issuance of the visa. 
``(2) The consul is satisfied that in issuing the visa the 
 alien will not be accorded undue priority over other 
 applicants awaiting their turns in the alien's home 
 district. 
``(3) The alien presents satisfactory evidence to the consul 
 of his admissibility into the United States under the 
 immigration laws. If such satisfactory evidence is not 
 produced the consul may request the assistance of the 
 consul in the alien's home district in investigating 
 the case, or refer the applicant to that consul.'' 
In 1946 the Department promulgated formal regulations governing the visa process. After a redesignation of the regulations
in 1948, the regulation concerning place of immigrant visa application read as follows: 
``42.317 

Where immigration visa application may be made.

 (a) An application for an immigration visa may be made at any American consular office, or other office specifically
designated, which has been authorized to issue immigration visas. No consular agency may issue immigration visas.

``(b) An alien ordinarily should make his application for an immigration visa at the American consular office in his
foreign home district. An alien who deliberately leaves his foreign home district for the purpose of making an application
for an immigration visa elsewhere will be referred back to the American consular office in his home district. However,
an alien may apply for an immigration visa at a consular office outside his foreign home district if the consular officer
to whom he applies is satisfied: 
``(1) That the alien has a bona-fide reason for applying outside of his foreign home district; 
``(2) Of the alien's true identity; 
``(3) That the alien has no adverse record in his foreign home district which would preclude the issuance of an immigration
visa to him; and 
``(4) That the alien is in possession of all the `available' documents which can be obtained from his home district.

``(c) In no case of an adult who is not well and favorably known to the principal consular officer should an immigration
visa be issued outside of the alien's home foreign district without notification to, and receipt of clearance from,
the consular officer in the alien's foreign home district, the principal consular office in the foreign country of
the alien's nationality, or the principal consular office in the foreign country of the alien's birth, whichever
is the nearest office most likely to have a previous record regarding the alien. 
``(d) For the purposes of this section an alien's foreign home district shall ordinarily be considered as that district
of a foreign country in which the alien has a domicile, or in which he has lived for the last five years. However, an alien
who has in good faith abandoned his domicile in his former home country without any purpose of circumventing the immigration
laws of the United States may have his visa application accepted at an American consular office in the district in which
he may be temporarily residing or sojourning while awaiting an opportunity to immigrate into the United States. In
such cases, however, the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are applicable. 
``(e) Questionable cases may be reported to the Department for a ruling on the question of jurisdiction.'' 
This regulation remained in effect until promulgation of the revised visa regulations implementing the Immigration
and Nationality Act of 1952. 
The pertinent provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act_section 222(a)_is similar to its predecessor_section
7 of the Immigration Act of 1924_but is also different from it in very significant ways. Unlike its predecessor, which
was silent on the subject of place of application, section 222(a) specifically authorizes the Secretary of State
to provide by regulation for place of application. The legislative process which led to this provision is of interest
because the commenter apparently encountered a portion of it and misunderstood what was occurring. 
As introduced, both H.R. 5678 (Cong. Walter) and S. 2550 (Sen. McCarran) included in the proposed new section INA 222(a)
the following sentence_``Such application shall be filed only with the consular officer in whose district the applicant
shall have established his residence, except that an application for an immigrant visa under the Displaced Persons
Act of 1948, as amended, and under INA 101(a)(27) may be filed with such consular officer as may be designated by regulations.''

During the legislative process in the Senate, this sentence remained unchanged and was, thus, a part of the bill when
it was approved by the Senate. In the House, however, the Judiciary Committee approved a series of amendments to Mr.
Walter's original text, one of which (Amendment 9) deleted the sentence from H.R. 5678. The text of Amendment 9 appears
at page 2 of House Report 1365 of February 14, 1952, which accompanied H.R. 5768, and there is, at page 54 of the Report,
a paragraph which explains the amendment and the thinking of the Committee in making it. The paragraph, in its entirety,
reads as follows: 
``Amendment 9 (to sec. 222) reflects the committee's cognizance of the unprecedented number of persons who have been
uprooted and dislocated during World War II or due to events subsequent thereto. The amendment is designed to alleviate
hardship which might be caused by a rigid requirement that visa applications `shall be filed only with the consular
officer in whose district the applicant shall have established his residence.' It is believed that the Secretary
of State will, by regulations provide for a more flexible requirement regarding the place of filing of visa applications
in both nonimmigrant and immigrant cases. Existing regulations could very well serve as a pattern for the new rules
to be promulgated.'' 
As a result of this particular amendment, H.R. 5678, as approved by the House of Representatives, contained no statutory
provision whatever regarding place of application. Thus, the question of how to deal with place of application for
an immigrant visa had to be disposed of in the conference on the differing House and Senate versions. The Conference
Report on H.R. 5678_House Report 2096 of June 9, 1952_sets forth the text of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as
enacted. The sentence establishing the restrictive rule about place of application was dropped and the phrase ``and
at such place'' was inserted in the first sentence of section 222(a). While the Statement of Managers on the Part of
the House (at pp. 127-29 of House Report 2096) is silent on this subject and there is no statement of the Senate
managers, the Department believes it fair to conclude that the Congress, after due consideration of the issue, consciously
decided to leave the determination of place of immigrant visa application to the Secretary of State and to make that
decision explicit by codifying it.

The commenter contended that the purpose of the Congress was ``to reduce the burden on displaced aliens in the visa
application process'' and quoted from the House Report statement reproduced above in support of this contention.
The commenter omitted the last two sentences of the paragraph and appears to have misunderstood the point being made.

In reality, the Committee was acting to preserve the status quo insofar as the filing of immigrant visa applications
was concerned. As is clear from the discussion above, the ultimate outcome was to preserve the status quo, but to make
explicit the Secretary's authority to determine by regulations the place of immigrant visa application by codifying
it in the first sentence of section 222(a) of the Act. 
Thus, there is clear connection between the regulations implementing the Immigration Act of 1924 and those implementing
the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. Moreover, it is clear that the basis of the regulations simply has
not been that asserted by the commenter. The commenter sees the regulations governing place of application as intended
to benefit alien visa applicants. Quite to the contrary, while the Department has attempted to give aliens broad notice
of the procedures that will generally apply in ``ordinary circumstances,'' it is clear that the regulations have
always been intended for the benefit of the Government, giving it the flexibility to decide where immigrant visa applications
will be processed. This flexibility has traditionally been important for two significant reasons. 
First, there has always been a profound concern that an alien not avoid meaningful examination of his or her admissibility
by having the visa application processed by a consular office in an area remote from his or her country of residence.
Insofar as the constraints in the resources of a particular consular office render knowledgeable assessment of the
application more difficult, the workload management issues discussed below are also relevant here. 
Second, the Department has always had major concerns about the management of the consular function. There has never
been a time when the Department has not had constraints on its resources. Consular staffing has been subject to those
constraints as has every other aspect of the Department's operations. For that reason, it has always been of great
importance to the Department both to have the authority to apportion available resources in a manner responsive to
the level of demand for services and to have a basis for predicting levels of demand. The ability to specify where intending
immigrants will be authorized to apply for an immigrant visa is crucial from both points of view. 
In addition, it is noteworthy that the Department frequently has to adjust its handling of the visa workload because
of world events. The statutory scheme, by leaving the place of application to be determined under Departmental regulations,
allows this flexibility. 
The commenter also expressed concern about the fact that the current regulation allows for the processing of an application
by a consular office in an area where the alien is physically present but has no residence if the alien ``expects'' to
remain in the area throughout the necessary processing time while the proposed regulation would require the alien
to establish his or her ability to remain there for that time. The commenter sees that change as being of major significance.

The Department believes that this concern ignores reality and that the change in wording merely reflects that reality.
A consular officer will not ordinarily accept an alien's assertion that he or she expects to remain in the area for the
requisite period of time without a basis for believing the assertion to be true. Thus, the consular officer will ordinarily
inquire further into the matter if the alien merely makes the bald assertion with no explanation for its basis. Moreover,
it is the Department's position that a consular officer may properly decline to accept the application for processing
if it reasonably appears that the alien's asserted expectation is unrealistic or otherwise ill-founded. 
In light of the foregoing, the Department believes that the proposed change in wording does not have the significance
the commenter apparently has ascribed to it. 
The commenter asserts that incorporation into the proposed regulation of the phrase ``Unless otherwise directed
by the Department'' has the effect of rendering the regulation meaningless. The Department strongly disagrees.

As pointed out in the commentary accompanying the proposed rule, the Department's position is that it has always had
the authority reflected in this phrase and that this proposal does nothing more than make explicit what has always
been implicit. Moreover, this comment presumes that the Department has in the past made, or intends in the future to
make, frivolous use of this authority. The Department can find nothing objectionable in the establishment of a general
rule, which will apply and guide consular officers in all normal circumstances, but which may be modified by the Department
as necessary in those situations in which operational or policy considerations require it. 
Finally, the commenter has asserted that the first and second sentences of the proposed regulation have the effect
of requiring that an alien permitted to apply at the consular office in the area in which he or she is physically present
also apply at the consular office in the area of the alien's residence. The Department wishes to ensure the commenter
that it had no intention of producing such a state of affairs.

A review of prior versions of this regulation indicates that, prior to the 1987 recodification of the visa regulations,
the concepts now set forth in several shorter sentences were included in a single long compound sentence. It is apparently
the division of the regulations into shorter sentences which has created the doubt in the commenter's mind about the
Department's intentions here. Accordingly, the Department has decided that the first two sentences of the proposed
text should be editorially amended to read as follows: 
``Unless otherwise directed by the Department, an alien applying for an immigrant visa shall make application at
the consular office having jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence; except that, unless otherwise directed
by the Department, an alien physically present in an area but having no residence therein may make application at the
consular office having jurisdiction over that area if the alien can establish that he or she will be able to remain in
the area for the period required to process the application.'' 
While there appears to have arisen a general prejudice against the compound sentence in recent years, the Department
trusts that, in this case, it will be seen as clarifying rather than obscuring the issue. 
This rule is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition, this rule would not impose information collection requirements
under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This rule has been reviewed as required under E.O. 12778
and certified to be in compliance therewith. This rule is exempt from review under E.O. 12866, but has been reviewed
internally by the Department to ensure consistency with the objectives thereof.

or shall, at the direction of the Department, accept an immigrant visa application from an alien who is neither a resident
of, nor physically present in, the area designated for that office for such purpose. For the purposes of this section,
an alien physically present in the United States shall be considered to be a resident of the area of his or her last residence
prior to entry into the United States.

Fair Housing Complaint Processing 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, HUD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule amends HUD's Fair Housing Complaint Processing regulations. The regulations govern the authority under
sections 812(g) and (h) of the Fair Housing Act (the Act) to make and issue determinations of reasonable cause to believe
that a discriminatory practice has occurred and issue charges detailing the determination, and the authority pursuant
to section 810(c) of the Act to refer to the Attorney General matters involving breaches of conciliation agreements.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Sections 812(g) and (h) of the Fair Housing Act authorize the Secretary to make determinations of reasonable cause
to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred. Section 810(c) authorizes the Secretary to refer
to the Attorney General matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements by respondents for enforcement.
Regulations found at 24 CFR parts 103 and 104 govern the conduct of investigations under the Act by the Assistant Secretary
and the taking of enforcement action in a number of situations. 


This rule amends portions of 24 CFR part 103 to clarify that the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity
(and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement), rather than the General Counsel, is authorized
to make and issue determinations of reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred
and issue charges based on the determinations, and the authority to refer matters involving possible breaches of
conciliation agreements to the Attorney General. 
This authority was previously delegated to the General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel of the Department by the
Secretary. Through this final rule, the Secretary has now revoked the delegation to the General Counsel and the Deputy
General Counsel of this authority and delegated the authority to the Assistant Secretary. 


Other Matters 


Justification for final rule. In accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking in 24 CFR part 10, the Department
generally publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect. Part 10 provides, however, that notice
and comment rulemaking may be omitted with respect to rules governing the Department's organization or its own internal
practices or procedures. This final rule is one meeting that is standard, and is therefore issued without opportunity
for prior public comment. 
Environmental Impact. In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality
and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to internal
administrative procedures whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition
of project areas or building sites and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National
Environmental Policy Act. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)),
has reviewed this document before publication and by approving it certifies that the rule would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule reflects a delegation of authority by the Secretary
under the Fair Housing Act. 
Executive Order 12606, The Family. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,


The Family,

 has determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, or well-being.
No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies
and programs relate to family concerns. 
Executive Order 12611, Federalism. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive
Order 12611, 

Federalism,

 has determined that this rule does not involve the preemption of State law by Federal statute or regulation and does
not have Federalism implications. Specifically, the rule will not substantially alter the established roles of
HUD and the States and local governments. As a result, the rule is not subject to review. 
Semiannual Regulatory Agenda. This rule was not listed on the Department's semiannual regulatory agenda published
on April 25, 1994 at 59 FR 20424 under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

2. Section 103.335 is amended by removing the words ``General Counsel'' and inserting ``Assistant Secretary'' in
their place. 
3. Section 103.400 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (b), and (c), to read as follows: 


 103.400 

Reasonable cause determination. 


(a) * * * 
(2) If, based on the totality of the factual circumstances known at the time of the decision, the Assistant Secretary
believes that reasonable cause may exist to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about
to occur, the Assistant Secretary shall determine that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory
housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, in all cases not involving the legality of local land use laws or
ordinances (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section). The Assistant Secretary's determination shall
be based solely on the facts concerning the alleged discriminatory housing practices provided by complainants and
respondents and otherwise identified during the investigation in making this determination. In making this determination,
the Assistant Secretary shall consider whether the facts concerning the alleged discriminatory housing practice
are sufficient to warrant the initiation of a civil action in federal court. 
(i) If the Assistant Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists, the Assistant Secretary will immediately
issue a charge under  103.405 on behalf of the aggrieved person, and shall notify the complainant and the respondent
of this determination by certified mail or personal service. 
(ii) If the Assistant Secretary determines that no reasonable cause exists, the Assistant Secretary shall: Issue
a short and plain written statement of the facts upon which the Assistant Secretary has based the no reasonable cause
determination; dismiss the complaint; notify the complainant and the respondent of the dismissal (including the
written statement of facts) by mail; and make public disclosure of the dismissal. The complainant or respondent may
request that no public disclosure be made. Notwithstanding such a request, the fact of dismissal, including the names
of the parties, shall be public information available on request. 
(3) If the Assistant Secretary determines that the matter involves the legality of local zoning or land use laws or
ordinances, the Assistant Secretary, in lieu of making a determination regarding reasonable cause, shall refer
the investigative material to the Attorney General for appropriate action under section 814(b)(1) of the Fair Housing
Act, and shall notify the complainant and the respondent of this action by mail or personal service. 
(b) The Assistant Secretary may not issue a charge under paragraph (a) of this section regarding an alleged discriminatory
housing practice, if an aggrieved person has commenced a civil action under an Act of Congress or a state law seeking
relief with respect to the alleged housing practice and the trial in the action has commenced. If a charge may not be
issued because of the commencement of such a trial, the Assistant Secretary shall so notify the complainant and the
respondent by certified mail or personal service. 
(c)(1) A determination of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause by the Assistant Secretary shall be made within
100 days after filing of the complaint (or where the Assistant Secretary has reactivated a complaint, within 100 days
after service of the notice of reactivation under  103.115), unless it is impracticable to do so. 
(2) If the Assistant Secretary is unable to make the determination within the 100-day period specified in paragraph
(c)(1) of this section, the Assistant Secretary will notify the complainant and the respondent by mail of the reasons
for the delay. 
4. In  103.405, paragraph (a)(1) is amended by removing the words ``General Counsel'' and inserting in their
place the words ``Assistant Secretary''; and paragraph (b) is amended by adding a new sentence at the beginning of
the introductory text, to read as follows: 


 103.405 

Issuance of charge. 


* * * * * 


(b) Within one business day after the issuance of a charge, the Assistant Secretary shall notify the General Counsel
of the issuance of the charge. * * *

ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule terminates the authority of the FHA Commissioner, to insure mortgage loans made for the financing of single
family homes on a coinsurance basis. The purpose of the rule is to terminate a program found by the Department to be one
whose usefulness and utilization by lenders is outweighed by the demands it makes on limited departmental resources.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FHA Coinsurance was first authorized under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1974 which added a new section
244 to the National Housing Act. In February of 1976, the Department implemented a program of coinsurance for the financing
of single family homes_24 CFR part 204. 


The intent of this new coinsurance program was to improve the quality of mortgage originations and servicing, to streamline
HUD insurance processing, and to improve the quality and timeliness of service to the mortgage applicants. This was
to be achieved through the sharing of risk between HUD and the mortgagees and through the delegation of a significant
portion of processing to mortgage originators, including the complete processing of appraisal and mortgage credit
applications, and the disposition of property in the event of default and foreclosure. 
The two main incentives for participation in the program were to be a lender's ability to choose its own appraisers
and to share the premium income with the Department depending on the performance of the lender's book of business for
coinsured loans. 
Despite these incentives, the Department has endorsed very few coinsured single family mortgages. The combined
volume for fiscal years 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 was 6,830 loans nationwide, with the bulk coming from one lender,
Crown Mortgage, doing business in Illinois. The remainder of coinsured loans were originated by four lenders located
in New York or Texas. 
Contributing to this lack of lender interest in the program has been the advent of Direct Endorsement which has blunted
many of the benefits attributable to the coinsurance program, especially the delegation of processing to the lenders.
While the sharing of premium income is a substantial benefit, most lenders, due to their financial situation, are
in no position to share even a 10 percent risk exposure. (A lender is not permitted to obtain reinsurance of its potential
or actual loss.) Also, few, if any lenders, wish to be burdened with the task of disposing of foreclosed property. 
A Secretarial task force on financial management has recommended that this coinsurance program be terminated giving
the following reasons: 
1. The demands the program makes on the Department's resources outweigh its usefulness and utilization by lenders.
From a programmatic standpoint, it does not make sense to devote scarce staff resources to a program as rarely used
as coinsurance. Mortgage Insurance and Accounting (MIAS) Staff spend about one half a staff year running this program.
Coinsurance requires MIAS to maintain a separate computer system to track coinsurance reserves and administer claim
payments. Reserve payouts must be calculated and processed each year as well. Furthermore, the Chicago Office, which
handles most of the coinsurance program's volume, estimates that in FY 1991, one-half a staff year was used to run the
program. At least this much staff time was consumed by the program for the remainder of the country. 
2. One of the incentives for program participation, the lender's ability to choose its own appraisers, will be nullified
when this feature is applied in the future to the Direct Endorsement program, through the Department's implementation
of section 202(e)(3) of the National Housing Act. 
3. Participating lenders tend to ``cherry pick'' loans for coinsurance processing, with the riskier loans assigned
to the Direct Endorsement program. All participating coinsurance lenders are also participating in the Direct Endorsement
program. 
4. Elimination of this program will not result in a reduction of avenues of mortgage credit for first time and low-and
-moderate income homebuyers. 


Issuance of a Proposed Rule and Public Comment 


On March 30, 1994, the Department published a proposed rule which would terminate FHA's single family coinsurance
program (59 FR 14809). One written comment has been received by the public concerning this proposal. The Savings and
Community Bankers of America, representing more than 1800 savings and community financial institutions, fully
supported termination of the program citing essentially the same reasons as are set forth above under the heading
Supplemental Information. 


Other Matters 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Undersigned certifies that this rule does
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Experience under the coinsurance
programs affected by this rule has not demonstrated any substantial impact on small entities.

Semiannual Agenda 


This rule was listed under the Office of Housing (Sequence No. 1568) in the Department's Semiannual Regulatory Agenda
published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20443) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 


Environment 


Under HUD regulations (24 CFR 50.20(k)), this rule is exempt from the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act as set forth in 24 CFR Part 50. The rule relates to internal administrative procedures, the content of which
does not involve development decisions, and does not affect the physical condition of project areas or building sites
but only relates to the amount and manner of payment of FHA insurance claims and distributive shares. 


Executive Order 12612, Federalism 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, 

Federalism,

 has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review
under the Order. The rule will not affect the basic availability of FHA insured single family mortgage financing assistance_merely
the methods under which such financing can be secured. No programmatic or policy changes would result from this rule's
promulgation which affect existing relationships between the federal government and state and local governments.



Executive Order 12606, the Family 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family,

 has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and
general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. The rule is limited to terminating a specific
means for delivery of FHA insurance which has proved to be unworkable and a drain on the FHA staff resources. Other single
family programs of HUD, specifically the direct endorsement program, will be improved upon and reemphasized in conjunction
with this rule. 
(The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.117.) 


List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 204 


Mortgage insurance. 



Accordingly, 24 CFR part 204 is revised, in its entirety, to read as follows: 


PART 204_COINSURANCE 




Authority:

 12 U.S.C. 1715z-9, 1715(b); 42 U.S.C. 3535(d).

Termination of program. 


Effective December 29, 1994, of final rule the authority to coinsure mortgages under this part is terminated, except
that the Department will honor legally binding and validly issued borrower approvals issued by lenders before the
termination date. This part 204, as it existed immediately before the termination date, will continue to govern the
rights and obligations of coinsured lenders, mortgagors, and the Department of Housing and Urban 



Development with respect to loans coinsured under this part.

 Final and temporary regulations.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final and temporary regulations 
under section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 relating 
to accounting for costs incurred in producing property and 
acquiring property for resale. Section 263A was enacted as part 
of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Changes to the applicable law 
were made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, the 
Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, and the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. These final regulations 
primarily affect taxpayers subject to section 263A that acquire 
property for resale.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background 


On March 30, 1987, and August 7, 1987, temporary regulations 
under section 263A were published in the 

Federal Register

 (TD 
8131, 52 FR 10052 and TD 8148, 52 FR 29375). A public hearing 
was held on December 7, 1987. On August 9, 1993, final 
regulations under section 263A were published in the 

Federal 
Register (TD 8482, 58 FR 42198). In addition, a notice of 
proposed rulemaking was published on August 9, 1993, (58 FR 
42263) regarding certain provisions that were reserved in the 
final regulations. A public hearing was held on November 30, 
1993, on these provisions. After consideration of the public 
comments regarding the proposed regulations, the regulations are 
adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. 



Explanation of Statutory Provisions 


Section 263A (the uniform capitalization rules) was enacted 
as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-514, 100 Stat. 
2085, 1986-3 C.B. (Vol. 1) (the 1986 Act). The statute was 
amended as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, 
Pub. L. 100-203, 101 Stat. 1330, 1987-3 C.B. 1 (the 1987 Act), 
the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-647, 102 Stat. 3342, 1988-3 C.B. 1 (the
1988 Act), and the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101-239, 103 
Stat. 2106 (the 1989 Act), 1990-1 C.B. 210. 

Section 263A provides a uniform set of rules that govern the 
capitalization of direct and indirect costs associated with 
property produced and property acquired for resale. 
Specifically, section 263A requires taxpayers to capitalize the 
direct and indirect costs properly allocable to real property and 
tangible personal property that they produce. Section 263A also 
requires taxpayers to capitalize the direct and indirect costs 
(including purchasing, handling, and storage costs) properly 
allocable to real property and personal property acquired for 
resale. 

The final regulations under section 263A that were published 
on August 9, 1993, generally require handling costs to be 
capitalized. Handling costs include costs attributable to 
processing, assembling, repackaging, transporting, and other 
similar activities, provided these activities do not come within 
the meaning of the term ``produce'' as defined in  1.263A-2(a)(1). 
However, the final regulations under section 263A also provide 
that certain handling costs are not required to be capitalized. 
For instance, handling costs incurred at a retail sales facility 
with respect to property sold to retail customers at the facility 
are not required to be capitalized. In addition, handling costs 
incurred at a dual-function storage facility with respect to 
property sold to customers from the facility are not required to 
be capitalized to the extent that the costs are incurred with 
respect to property sold in on-site sales. 

The final regulations under section 263A that were published 
on August 9, 1993, reserve several provisions previously 
contained in the temporary regulations relating to certain other 
costs that were not considered handling costs. In particular, 
the regulations reserve provisions relating to distribution 
costs, custom-order delivery costs, and repackaging costs. After publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and
considering public comments, these final regulations provide rules concerning such costs. In addition, these final

regulations provide rules that permit the District Director to 
require appropriate adjustments to the valuation of inventories 
and other property subject to section 263A if a transfer of 
property is made to another person for a principal purpose of 
avoiding the application of section 263A. 



Public Comments 


The Scope of Distribution Costs 


The proposed regulations provide that distribution costs are 
not required to be capitalized. The proposed regulations define 
distribution costs as any transportation costs incurred outside a 
storage facility in delivering goods to an unrelated customer. 
For this purpose, the proposed regulations state that any costs 
incurred on a loading dock are treated as incurred outside a 
storage facility.

Several commentators argued that, in addition to 
transportation costs incurred outside a storage facility, 
distribution costs should also include all costs (i.e., labor, 
equipment, and occupancy costs) incurred after a sales order has 
been received, regardless of whether these costs are incurred 
inside or outside a storage facility. They stated that the costs 
of retrieving the goods and readying them for shipment are more 
in the nature of deductible selling and distribution costs and do 
not relate to the production, acquisition, or holding of 
property. 

The preamble to the proposed regulations cites the Blue Book 
to the 1986 Act which states that deductible ``distribution 
expenses are intended to include only external distribution 
costs, that is, those costs incurred in transporting goods from 
the taxpayer's warehouse or retail outlet to the customer, or to 
the customer's agent, a common carrier, or some other 
intermediary. Distribution expenses do not include costs of 
moving inventory from a taxpayer's warehouse to its retail store 
or other internal transportation costs.'' Joint Committee on 
Taxation Staff, General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of 
1986, 99th Cong., JCS-10-87, 510 n.61. Commentators contended 
that this reference was taken out of context and suggested that 
it should be used to define the nature of an activity (e.g., 
shipment to a customer vs. internal transfers) rather than the 
location of an activity (e.g., inside an off-site storage 
facility vs. the loading dock). 

These final regulations retain the definition of 
distribution costs contained in the proposed regulations. The 
Service and Treasury continue to believe that this definition of 
distribution costs provides for a better matching of income and 
related expenses because gross income is not typically recognized 
from the sale of an item when an order is placed, but rather when 
the item is shipped, delivered, or accepted, or when title to the 
item passes to the purchaser. Since costs incurred inside a 
storage facility are typically incurred prior to an item being 
shipped, delivered, or accepted, or when title passes, these costs 
should be capitalized until income is recognized. 


Furthermore, the Conference Report to the 1986 Act 
specifically states that ``processing, assembly, repackaging, and 
similar costs, including labor costs attributable to unloading 
goods (but not including labor costs attributable to loading of 
goods for final shipment to customers, or labor at a retail 
facility)'' should be capitalized. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 841, 99th 
Cong., 2d Sess. II-306 (1986), 1986-3 (Vol. 4) C.B. 306. Thus, 
because Congress intended that costs incurred prior to loading 
goods for shipment be capitalized, distribution activities should 
not be construed to begin any earlier than at the loading dock. 


Pick and Pack Costs and Repackaging Costs 


Several commentators have expressed concern that the 
definition of distribution costs contained in the proposed 
regulations may result in some taxpayers abandoning the use of 
the simplified resale method. In response, these final 
regulations except ``pick and pack'' costs from the scope of 
capitalizable handling costs incurred inside a storage facility. 
These final regulations define pick and pack costs as those costs 
incurred inside a storage facility in preparing specific goods 
for imminent shipment to a particular customer after the customer 
has ordered those goods. Examples of pick and pack costs include 
costs incurred to move specific goods from a storage location in 
preparation for shipment to the customer, pack or repack those 
goods for shipment to the customer, and stage those goods for 
shipment to the customer. 

Pick and pack costs, however, do not include occupancy 
costs, such as rent, depreciation, insurance, taxes, utilities, 
and maintenance. The Service and Treasury believe that the 
exclusion of these costs from the scope of pick and pack costs is 
consistent with Congressional intent that all off-site storage 
and warehousing costs be capitalized. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 
841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. II-306 (1986), 1986-3 (Vol. 4) C.B. 
306. Furthermore, this position is supported by the Conference 
Report to the 1986 Act. In a footnote to the Conference Report 
the conferees state that ``[o]ffsite storage and warehousing costs 
generally include the cost of a facility whose primary function 
is the storage or warehousing of goods.'' H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 
841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. II-306 (1986), 1986-3 (Vol. 4) C.B. 
306. Thus, because the primary function of an off-site storage 
facility is the storage or warehousing of goods, all occupancy 
costs incurred at an off-site storage facility must be 
capitalized. 
Because the above rule for pick and pack costs essentially 
replaces the exception for repackaging costs contained in the 
proposed regulations, the separate exception for repackaging 
costs is unnecessary and has been eliminated.

Costs of Delivering Custom-Ordered Items 



The proposed regulations provide that, notwithstanding the 
general requirement that costs incurred in transporting goods 
from a taxpayer's storage facility to its retail sales facility 
are required to be capitalized, costs incurred outside a storage 
facility in delivering custom-ordered items to a retail sales 
facility are not required to be capitalized. For this purpose, 
the proposed regulations provide that any costs incurred on a 
loading dock are treated as incurred outside a storage facility. 
The preamble to the proposed regulations also states that the 
Service is considering eliminating this exception altogether. 

Commentators contended that the custom-order exception 
should not be eliminated because these delivery costs are more 
appropriately characterized as costs incurred to ship goods 
directly to a customer rather than as costs incurred to 
internally move inventory. In addition, commentators asserted 
that the custom-order exception should not be limited to costs 
incurred outside a storage facility in delivering custom-ordered 
items to a retail sales facility. These commentators believe 
that all costs incurred in delivering custom-ordered items to a 
retail sales facility should be deductible, regardless of whether 
they are incurred inside or outside a storage facility. 

These final regulations retain the custom-order exception. 
The Service and Treasury believe that limiting this exception to 
costs incurred outside a storage facility in delivering custom-ordered items to a retail sales facility provides
for a better 
matching of income and related expenses. 



Costs of Transporting Goods to a Related Person 



The proposed regulations provide that distribution costs do 
not include costs incurred by a taxpayer in delivering goods to a 
related person. The proposed regulations further provide that 
when a taxpayer sells goods to a related person, the costs of 
transporting the goods are included in determining the basis of 
the goods that are sold, and hence in determining the resulting 
gain or loss from such sale, for all purposes of the Internal 
Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of 
this provision, the proposed regulation states that persons are 
related if they are described in section 267(b) or section 
707(b). 

One commentator argued that the requirement to capitalize 
costs incurred by a taxpayer in delivering goods to a related 
person is contrary to the purported purpose of section 263A and 
can result in the permanent disallowance of the capitalized 
costs. The commentator noted that if the capitalization of costs 
incurred in transporting property between related parties 
produces or increases a loss, the loss disallowance rules in 
sections 267(a)(1) and 707(b)(1) may in some instances 
permanently disallow the loss. Thus, the commentator argued that 
the requirement to capitalize costs incurred by a taxpayer in 
delivering goods to a related person is unfair because it results in harsher treatment than the treatment of internal

transportation costs carried on within a single entity. 

These final regulations retain the rule contained in the 
proposed regulations. The Service and Treasury continue to 
believe that the cost of transporting goods between related 
parties is properly treated as a capitalizable handling cost for 
all purposes (i.e., not just for timing purposes, but also for 
character purposes). In addition, the very limited potential for 
loss disallowance under sections 267(a)(1) and 707(b)(1) could 
result from any one of a number of properly capitalizable costs 
(e.g., storage costs, production costs, etc.) other than handling 
costs associated with transporting goods to a related party. 
Moreover, the fact that sections 267(a)(1) and 707(b)(1) will 
result in loss disallowance only in unusual circumstances does 
not justify the additional complexity that would result to all 
taxpayers from the series of rules that would be necessary to 
accommodate the treatment requested by the commentator. 



Transfers for Tax Avoidance Purposes 



The proposed regulations provide that the District Director 
may require appropriate adjustments to valuations of inventory 
and other property subject to section 263A if the transfer of 
property is made to another person for a principal purpose of tax 
avoidance. The example provided in the proposed regulations 
states that the District Director may require a taxpayer using 
the simplified production method (as described in  1.263A-2(b)) 
to apply that method to transferred inventories immediately prior 
to a transfer under section 351 if a principal purpose of the 
transfer is tax avoidance. The Service and Treasury continue to 
believe that the Secretary has the authority to prescribe 
regulations to prevent taxpayers from using related parties, 
pass-thru entities, or intermediaries to avoid the application of 
section 263A. Therefore, the final regulations retain the anti-abuse rule contained in the proposed regulations
with one 
clarifying modification that substitutes ``a principal purpose to 
avoid the application of section 263A'' for ``a principal purpose 
of tax avoidance.'' 



Effective Dates 



These final regulations are applicable to costs incurred in 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993. In the case of 
property that is inventory in the hands of the taxpayer, however, 
these regulations are effective for taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1993. 



Accounting Method Changes 



If a taxpayer must change its method of accounting as a 
result of these regulations, the taxpayer generally must file a 
Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, with the 
Commissioner in accordance with the requirements of  1.446-1(e)(3)(i) and Rev. Proc. 92-20, 1992-1
C.B. 685. If, however, 
as a result of these regulations a taxpayer changes its method of 
accounting in its first taxable year beginning on or after 
January 1, 1994, then the change must be made pursuant to 
Rev. Proc. 94-49, 1994-30 I.R.B., dated July 25, 1994.

Special Analysis 



It has been determined that these regulations are not a 
significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, 
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been 
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations. 
Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. 
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, a copy 
of the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations 
was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small 
Business Administration for comment on its impact on small 
business. 



Drafting Information 



The principal authors of these regulations are Rosemary 
DeLeone and Harry-Todd Astrov of the Office of Assistant Chief 
Counsel, Income Tax and Accounting, IRS. However, other 
personnel from the IRS and the Treasury Department assisted in 
developing these regulations on matters of both substance and 
style.

6. The text of paragraph (j)(4) is added. 

7. The added text reads as follows: 



 1.263A-1

 Uniform capitalization of costs. 



* * * * * 



(b) * * *

(10) * * *

(i) For purposes of this section, substantial 
construction is deemed to have occurred if the lesser of_

(A) 10 percent of the total estimated costs of 
construction; or 

(B) The greater of $10 million or 2 percent of the total 
estimated costs of construction, was incurred before March 1, 
1986.

(ii) For purposes of the provision in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section, the total estimated costs 
of construction shall be determined by reference to a reasonable 
estimate, on or before March 1, 1986, of such amount. Assume, 
for example, that on March 1, 1986, the estimated costs of 
constructing a facility were $150 million. Assume that before 
March 1, 1986, $12 million of construction costs had been 
incurred. Based on the above facts, substantial construction 
would be deemed to have occurred before March 1, 1986, because 
$12 million (the costs of construction incurred before such date) 
is greater than $10 million (the lesser of $15 million; or the 
greater of $10 million or $3 million). For purposes of this 
provision, construction costs are defined as those costs incurred 
after construction has commenced at the site of the property 
being constructed (unless the property will not be located on 
land and, therefore, the initial construction of the property 
must begin at a location other than the intended site). For 
example, in the case of a building, construction commences when 
work begins on the building, such as the excavation of the site, 
the pouring of pads for the building, or the driving of 
foundation pilings into the ground. Preliminary activities such 
as project engineering and architectural design do not constitute 
the commencement of construction, nor are such costs considered 
construction costs, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(10).

(j) * * *

(4) * * * The District Director may require appropriate 
adjustments to valuations of inventory and other property subject 
to section 263A if a transfer of property is made to another 
person for a principal purpose of avoiding the application of 
section 263A. Thus, for example, the District Director may 
require a taxpayer using the simplified production method of 
 1.263A-2(b) to apply that method to transferred inventories 
immediately prior to a transfer under section 351 if a principal 
purpose of the transfer is to avoid the application of section 
263A. 

Par. 9. Section 1.263A-3(c)(4)(vi) is amended as follows: 

1. The heading is revised. 

2. The text of paragraphs (A) and (B) is added. 

3. The heading for paragraph (C) is revised and the text is 
added. 

4. The revised and added provisions read as follows: 



 1.263A-3

 Rules relating to property acquired for resale.

(vi) 

Costs not required to be capitalized as handling 
costs

_(A) 

Distribution costs

_(

1

) 

In general

. Distribution 
costs are not required to be capitalized. Distribution costs are 
any transportation costs incurred outside a storage facility in 
delivering goods to a customer. For this purpose, any costs 
incurred on a loading dock are treated as incurred outside a 
storage facility. 

(

2

) 

Costs incurred in transporting goods to a related 
person.

 Distribution costs do not include costs incurred by a 
taxpayer in delivering goods to a related person. Thus, for 
example, when a taxpayer sells goods to a related person, the 
costs of transporting the goods are included in determining the 
basis of the goods that are sold, and hence in determining the 
resulting gain or loss from the sale, for all purposes of the 
Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. See, e.g., 
sections 267, 707, and 1502. For purposes of this provision, 
persons are related if they are described in section 267(b) or 
section 707(b).

(B) 

Delivery of custom-ordered items.

 Generally, costs 
incurred in transporting goods from a taxpayer's storage facility 
to its retail sales facility must be capitalized. However, costs 
incurred outside a storage facility in delivering custom-ordered 
items to a retail sales facility are not required to be 
capitalized. For this purpose, any costs incurred on a loading 
dock are treated as incurred outside a storage facility. 
Delivery of custom-ordered items occurs when a taxpayer can 
demonstrate that a delivery to the taxpayer's retail sales 
facility is made to fill an identifiable order of a particular 
customer (placed by the customer before the delivery of the goods 
occurs) for the particular goods in question. Factors that may 
demonstrate the existence of a specific, identifiable delivery 
include the following_

(

1

) The customer has paid for the item in advance of the 
delivery; 

(

2

) The customer has submitted a written order for the item; 

(

3

) The item is not normally available at the retail sales 
facility for on-site customer purchases; and 

(

4

) The item will be returned to the storage facility (and 
not held for sale at the retail sales facility) if the customer 
cancels an order. 

(C) 

Pick and pack costs

_(

1

) 

In general.

 Generally, 
handling costs incurred inside a storage or warehousing facility 
must be capitalized. However, costs attributable to pick and 
pack activities inside a storage or warehousing facility are not 
required to be capitalized. Pick and pack activities are 
activities undertaken in preparation for imminent shipment to a 
particular customer after the customer has ordered the specific 
goods in question. Examples of pick and pack activities include: 

(

i

) Moving specific goods from a storage location in 
preparation for shipment to the customer; 

(

ii

) Packing or repacking those goods for shipment to the 
customer; and 

(

iii

) Staging those goods for shipment to the customer. 

(

2

) 

Activities that are not pick and pack activities.

 Pick 
and pack activities do not include: 

(

i

) Unloading goods that are received for storage; 

(

ii

) Checking the quantity and quality of goods received; 

(

iii

) Comparing the quantity of goods received to the 
amounts ordered and preparing the receiving documents; 

(

iv

) Moving the goods to their storage location, e.g., bins, 
racks, containers, etc.; and 

(

v

) Storing the goods. 

(

3

) 

Costs not attributable to pick and pack activities.

 
Occupancy costs, such as rent, depreciation, insurance, security, 
taxes, utilities, and maintenance costs properly allocable to the 
storage or warehousing facility, are not costs attributable to 
pick and pack activities.

Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Regulations: Inland Waterways Navigation Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is amending the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Regulations to correct an inconsistency
between the statutory and regulatory language; and amending the Inland Waterways Navigation Regulations to remove
regulatory language that contradicts the Inland Navigation Rules.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Drafting Information




The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Jonathan Epstein, Project Manager, Office of Navigation
Safety and Waterway Services, and LT Ralph L. Hetzel, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.



Regulatory History



On April 8, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone
Regulations: Inland Waterways Navigation Regulations'' in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16780). The Coast Guard received one letter commenting on the proposal. No public hearing was requested, and
none was held.



Background and Purpose



This rule corrects two conflicts between statutory law and existing navigation safety regulations.



1. Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Regulations



This rule makes Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Regulations, specifically 33 CFR 26.05, consistent with
the corresponding statutory authority, the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act, 1972, (33 U.S.C. 1204).
The particular statutory language is important because it determines who may maintain the watch on the designated
bridge-to-bridge calling channel (VHF-FM Channel 13 in U.S. territorial waters, except in the approaches
to the lower Mississippi River where VHF-FM Channel 67 is the designated channel).



2. Inland Waterways Navigation Regulations



This rulemaking removes 33 CFR 162.65(b)(3)(iv) because it contradicts statutory provisions in the Inland Navigation
Rules Act. Specifically it provided that a vessel being overtaken by another shall slacken speed sufficiently to
permit the passage to be effected with safety to both vessels. This directly conflicted with Inland Navigation Rule
13 which places the responsibility for keeping clear on the overtaking vessel and Inland Rule 17 which requires the
overtaken vessel to maintain course and speed.



Discussion of Comments and Changes



The Coast Guard received only one comment in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. This comment strongly
endorsed the correction to the bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone regulations, noting that one of the key elements
of Bridge Resource Management is clear delegation of duties; and that only the master or conning officer should have
authority to communicate intended ship movements to other vessels.

Because the only comment was positive no changes from the proposed language have been made.



Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).

The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a Full Regulatory Assessment is unnecessary.
Since this rulemaking basically corrects inconsistencies and places no new requirements on the maritime community
further Regulatory Evaluation was deemed unnecessary.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard considered whether this rulemaking would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).

Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. Under Federal law, authority to issue regulations to amend the Inland Waterways Navigation Regulations
and the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Regulations is vested in the Secretary of Transportation and delegated
to the Coast Guard. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt State action addressing this subject matter.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rulemaking is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as
this administrative action clearly has no environmental effect. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available
in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ``

Classifying and Handling Class 1 (Explosive) Materials



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is amending its regulations concerning the carriage and handling of explosives. These amendments
are necessary because the United States has adopted a new system for classifying and labeling explosives. These amendments
will align terminology in existing Coast Guard regulations with that used in the new system and update references
to address the new system.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LCDR Mark O'Malley, Project Manager, Port Safety and
Security Division, and Mr. Stephen H. Barber, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.




Regulatory History



On April 8, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Classifying and Handling Class
1 (Explosive) Materials in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16783). The Coast Guard received no letters commenting on the proposal. No public hearing was requested, and
none was held.



Background and Purpose



On December 21, 1990, the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) published a final rule revising the
Hazardous Material Regulations contained in 49 CFR parts 171 through 180 (December 21, 1990; 55 FR 55402). This final
rule also revised the requirements previously found in 46 CFR part 146 concerning the transportation of military
explosives by vessel and relocated them in 49 CFR part 176. Under this final rule, there is only one regulatory system
common to all explosives. Therefore, the shipment of military explosives by vessel now must comply with the requirements
of 49 CFR part 176. Furthermore, the old classification system for explosives was replaced by the United Nations system.


These comprehensive rules for commercial and other explosives treat military explosives as belonging to Division
1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 of Class 1 (explosive) materials, as defined in 49 CFR 173.50. Under the old system, military
explosives were categorized as Class A, B, or C. [For a comparison of old versus new classification schemes, see 49
CFR 173.53.]

Sections 78.80-10 and 97.70-10 of 46 CFR are being revised to align with the more recently revised 49 CFR
176.78. Section 176.78 of 49 CFR was revised to provide for the use of a power operated truck designated EE or EX to handle
Class 1 (explosive) materials or other cargo in an area near Class 1 (explosive) materials on board a vessel. Additionally,
paragraph (d) of 46 CFR 176.78 states that a power operated truck designated LPS, GS, D, or DS may be used under conditions
acceptable to the Captain of the Port (COTP) rather than requiring Commandant approval. These sections are being
revised to consolidate current regulations for the use of power operated vehicles on board vessels transporting
hazardous materials.

Furthermore, on January 29, 1991, after consultation with the Coast Guard, RSPA published a final rulemaking revoking
46 CFR part 146 (January 29, 1991; 56 FR 3334).

The purpose of this rulemaking is to update terminology and cross-references throughout Coast Guard regulations
to reflect this new classification system.

There were no comments received by this NPRM; therefore, no changes were made.


Regulatory Evaluation


This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule
to be so minimal that a full evaluation is unnecessary. This rule conforms terminology and cross references throughout
Coast Guard regulations with a new, already established classification system. It will have no economic impact.


Small Entities


This regulation is administrative in nature and conforms existing regulations to a new system for classifying and
labeling explosives. It will have no economic impact on entities large or small. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies
under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Collection of Information


This rule contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.

).


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule
involves administrative changes in terminology and clearly does not have any environmental impact. A Categorical
Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ``

Oregon; Final Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program Revisions 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Oregon has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Oregon's application and has made
a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Oregon's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of
the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Oregon's hazardous
waste program revisions. Oregon's application for program revision is available for public review and comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


States with final authorization under Section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or ``the
Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'')
allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements
promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the
HSWA requirements under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the
HSWA requirements. 
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260-266, 268, 124 and 270. 


B. Oregon 


Oregon initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program on January 30, 1986. Oregon received authorization
for revisions to its program on May 29, 1990. On July 1, 1994, Oregon submitted a program revision application for additional
program approvals. Today, Oregon is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(4).

EPA has reviewed Oregon's application, and has made an immediate final decision that Oregon's hazardous waste program
revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends
to grant Oregon final authorization for the additional program modifications. The public may submit written comments
on EPA's immediate final decision up until September 14, 1994. Copies of Oregon's application for program revision
are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ``

Addresses

'' section of this notice. 

Approval of Oregon's program revision shall become effective in sixty (60) days unless adverse comments pertaining
to the State's program revisions are received during the public comment period. If an adverse comment is received,
EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to comments
which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. 

Oregon's revision application includes the majority of HSWA and non-HSWA federal provisions promulgated before
July 1, 1993. The more substantive changes included in this revision application are: the Mining Waste Rules, the
Land Disposal Restriction Rules, the Used Oil Rule, and the Permit Modification Rule. Oregon is applying for authorization
for the following Federal hazardous waste regulations:

<DOCNO> FR940805-0-00049 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940805-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Some portions of Oregon's revised program are broader in scope than the federal program, and thus are not federally
enforceable. The broader in scope rules are OAR Chapter 340: 100-011, 101-033, 102-044, 102-070,
104-075, 105-013, 105-014, 105-040, 105-041, 105-051, 111-020, 111-030,
and 111-037. Broader information requirements characterize 100-011, 102-070, 105-013,
and 105-014 (in some cases the last two rules may be more stringent depending on the type of information required).
State-only siting standards make 105-040, 105-041, and 120-001 broader. Permit conditions are
modified under 105-051. State-only hazardous wastes are added by 101-033. Small quantity generators
must comply with large quantity generator requirements under 102-044. Non-RCRA permitted recycling facilities
are required to comply to provide biennial report information by 104-075 (in some cases this rule may be more
stringent depending on the information required). Oregon's used oil rule adds regulated and prohibited activities
to the Federal rule in 111-020 and 111-030. Used oil generators are allowed to transport oil in leased vehicles
under 111-037. 
EPA will administer the enforcement, modification, revocation, reissuance, and termination of portions of joint
State/EPA permits for which the State is not yet authorized until such time that the State is granted authorization.
Oregon is not seeking authorization to operate on Indian lands. 


C. Decision 


I conclude that Oregon's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Oregon is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised. 
Oregon now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations
of HSWA. Oregon also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections
under Section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under Sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 


Compliance with Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Certification under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Oregon's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Wisconsin: Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Wisconsin has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (hereinafter RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed
Wisconsin's application and has reached a decision, subject to public review and comment, that these hazardous waste
program revisions satisfy all the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends
to grant final authorization to Wisconsin to operate its expanded program, subject to authority retained by EPA under
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter HSWA).

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
A. Background 


States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 
6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with,
and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. 
In accordance with 40 CFR 271.21, revisions to State hazardous waste 
programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other
changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR
Parts 124, 260-266, 268, and 270. 


B. Wisconsin 


Wisconsin initially received final authorization for its program effective January 31, 1986 (51 

FR

 3783). Subsequently, Wisconsin received authorization for revisions to its program, which became effective on
June 6, 1989 (54 

FR

 22278), January 22, 1990 (54 

FR

 48243), April 24, 1992 (57 

FR 

15029), and August 2, 1993 (58 

FR

 31344). On March 16, 1994, Wisconsin submitted a program revision application for additional program approvals.
Today, Wisconsin is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
EPA reviewed Wisconsin's application, and has made an immediate final 
decision that Wisconsin's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify
for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications
to Wisconsin. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until September 6, 1994.
Copies of Wisconsin's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations
indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. 
Approval of Wisconsin's program revision shall become effective in 60 
days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of
the comment period. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final
decision or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision
takes effect or reverses the decision. 
On October 4, 1994, (unless EPA publishes a prior FR action withdrawing this immediate final rule), Wisconsin will
be authorized to carry out, in lieu of the Federal program, those provisions of the State's program which are analogous
to the following provisions of the Federal program:

EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of 
permits, that contain conditions based upon the federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization,
and which were issued by EPA prior to the effective date of this authorization. EPA has previously suspended issuance
of permits for the other provisions on January 31, 1986, June 6, 1989, January 22, 1990, April 24, 1992, and August 2,
1993, the effective dates of Wisconsin's final authorization for the RCRA base program, and for subsequent program
revisions. 

Wisconsin is not authorized to operate the Federal program on Indian 
lands. This authority remains with EPA unless provided otherwise in a future statute or regulation. 



C. Decision 



I conclude that Wisconsin's program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established
by RCRA described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the HSWA. Accordingly, EPA grants
Wisconsin final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. Wisconsin currently has responsibility
for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of
the RCRA program and its amendments. Wisconsin also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains
the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008,
3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 



D. Codification in Part 272 



EPA incorporates by reference authorized State programs in Part 272 of 40 CFR to provide notice to the public of the
scope of the authorized program in each State. Incorporation by reference of the Wisconsin program will be completed
at a later date. 



Compliance with Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866.

of certain Federal regulations in favor of Wisconsin's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., Federal agencies must consider the paperwork burden imposed
by any information request contained in a proposed rule or a final rule. This rule will not impose any information requirements
upon the regulated community.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY</USDEPT>








Changes in Flood Elevation Determinations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule lists communities where modification of the base (100-year) flood elevations is appropriate because
of new scientific or technical data. New flood insurance premium rates will be calculated from the modified base (100-year)
flood elevations for new buildings and their contents. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this interim rule. However, the
address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base (100-year) flood elevation determinations
are available for inspection is provided. 






Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical
data. 






The modifications are made pursuant to Section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR Part 65. 






For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.







The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 






These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities. 






The changes in base flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4. 






National Environmental Policy Act






This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 






Regulatory Flexibility Act






The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base (100-year) flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared. 






Regulatory Classification






This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. 






Executive Order 12612, Federalism






This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, dated
October 26, 1987. 






Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform 






This rule meets the applicable standards of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

State Vocational Rehabilitation Unit In-Service Training; Final Rule

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION </USDEPT>


<USDEPT>34 CFR Part 388 </USDEPT>






State Vocational Rehabilitation Unit In-Service Training 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the State Vocational Rehabilitation Unit In-Service Training program.
The regulations are needed to implement changes made by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992. These final regulations
incorporate new statutory requirements, reference changes in Education Department General Administrative Regulations,
incorporate new phraseology from the Act, limit eligibility to designated State agencies, and provide funding allocation
information.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 These regulations implement changes to the State Vocational Rehabilitation Unit In-Service Training program made
to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act) by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (the Amendments), Pub. L.
102-569, enacted October 29, 1992. 



This program supports the National Education Goal that, by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and
will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities
of citizenship. The Department supports a variety of training activities for vocational rehabilitation personnel
so that they may assist individuals with disabilities in gaining the knowledge and skills to obtain employment and
compete in a global economy. 

On May 9, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the State Vocational Rehabilitation
Unit In-Service Training program in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 24000). The major issues related to this program are discussed in the preamble to the NPRM. Significant changes
resulting from public comment since publication of the NPRM include_ 
(1) eliminating the separate minimum share for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau; (2) removing the requirement for an annual comprehensive needs
assessment; 
(3) deleting the requirement that distance learning be in connection with a training course; and (4) deleting the
requirement that distance education for rehabilitation workers occur at individual job sites. 



Analysis of Comments and Changes 



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 16 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. 

Major issues are grouped according to subject, with appropriate sections of the regulations referenced in parentheses.
Other substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and
other minor changes are not addressed.

Minimum Share and Matching Considerations (  388.21(a) and 388.30) 





Comments: 

Five commenters suggested deleting  388.21(a)(4), which provides a minimum share of not less than one-eighth
of one percent of the amounts made available for in-service training to Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands,
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau. The commenters believe agencies in the
territories, some of which have as many employees as small designated State agencies, should receive the same minimum
share of not less than one-third of one percent of the amounts made available for the fiscal year as provided in  388.21(a)(3)
to small agencies. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that the same minimum share provided to small designated State agencies is appropriate for the
specified territories. The Secretary also notes that the territories are eligible to compete for the remaining funds
to be allocated based on the quality of the application as determined by competitive reviews conducted by the Department
using the selection criteria in  388.20 and the priorities in  388.22. 



Changes: 

A revision has been made to  388.21(a) by deleting paragraph (4) so that all grant recipients receive the same
minimum share of the sums made available for in-service training for the fiscal year. A revision of  388.30,
deleting paragraph (c), which provides special matching considerations for the territories, also has been made
in the final regulations. 



Program Purpose ( 388.1) 





Comments: 

Two commenters requested definitions for the terms ``succession planning'' and ``capacity building'' used in  388.1.




Discussion: 

The Secretary notes that these terms are found in the statute, but are optional for State agencies to address in their
in-service training. There are alternative ways to address these concepts, and the Secretary prefers not to define
them, thus leaving the widest possible discretion to State agencies. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comment: 

A commenter observed that  388.1 should be revised, and the regulations changed throughout, to emphasize human
resource development in place of training. Peer reviewers should be oriented to human resource development prior
to their service as reviewers. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that the term human resource development is descriptive of many appropriate activities under
this program. However, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, uses the term ``in-service training,'' so that
term is used in the regulations. 


Changes: 

None. 



Annual Needs Assessment ( 388.20(a)(2)(iii)) 





Comments: 

Three commenters addressed the requirement in  388.20(a)(2)(iii) for an annual needs assessment of in-service
training needs. The commenters believe an annual assessment is not necessary and recommend a comprehensive needs
assessment every three years and a less comprehensive review annually. 



Discussion: 

Although an assessment must be conducted during the course of the project period, the Secretary agrees that a comprehensive
assessment is not needed annually. 



Changes: 

A revision, deleting the word ``annual,'' has been made to  388.20(a)(2)(iii) in the final regulations. 



Project Length 





Comments: 

Three commenters noted that the regulations do not specify the length of projects. Recommendations of project periods
of 36 and 60 months were made. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary notes that regulations usually do not specify project duration and instead leave flexibility for the
Secretary to determine an appropriate project period each time a competition is announced. 



Changes: 

None. 



Allowable Costs ( 388.31(d)) 





Comment: 

A commenter asked that the phrase ``in connection with a distance learning training course'' be dropped from the description
of allowable telecommunications and technology fees in  388.31(d). 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that distance learning may include valuable in-service training activities, such as a lecture
or technology demonstration, that are not part of a training course. 



Changes: 

Section 388.31(d) has been revised by deleting the words ``in connection with a distance learning training course.''




Distance Education Priority ( 388.22(b)(2)) 





Comment: 

A commenter noted that it was an unnecessary limitation to require that distance education for rehabilitation workers
be at their job sites as stated in  388.22(b)(2). The commenter noted that it may be necessary or efficient for
an agency to gather a group of employees at a central location removed from individual offices for distance education.




Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that there is no compelling reason to require in this priority that training occur at an individual
job site. 




Changes: 

Section 388.22(b)(2) has been revised by deleting the words ``at their job sites.''

<PARENT> FR940805-0-00021 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Comment: 

A commenter recommended dropping the priority in  388.22(b)(2) for distance education on the grounds that
there is no evidence that distance education produces better results at less cost. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that distance education is needed in some States and wants to ensure that a mechanism exists
to demonstrate innovative approaches to learning. 


Changes: 

None. 


Enhanced Employment Outcomes for Specific Populations Priority ( 388.22(b)(3)) 




Comment: 

A commenter requested clarification of the heading for  388.22(b)(3), which refers to ``specific populations''
although the text that follows refers to ``all individuals or specified groups.'' 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that it is up to the State agency to determine whether in-service training to improve employment
outcomes will be targeted narrowly or broadly. Activities directed to improving employment outcomes for all population
groups or for a specific target group are permitted under this priority. 


Changes: 

None. 


General 




Comment: 

A commenter observed that the NPRM retains most of the language in the current regulations and does not accurately
reflect the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (the 1992 Amendments), particularly provisions related to State
and strategic plans. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that extensive changes have been proposed in the current regulations and is confident that
all requirements in the 1992 Amendments have been implemented. 


Changes: 

None. 


Priorities ( 388.22) 




Comments: 

Two commenters supported reserving a portion of funds for priorities, but believe this reserve should be divided
between priorities based on need and priorities based on responsiveness or quality of the application and innovative
approaches. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the three priorities listed in the proposed regulations address significant needs of
State agencies and that no further division of the priorities into categories is needed. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comment: 

Regarding  388.22, which sets the Secretary's priorities, a commenter asked if an application that addresses
issues or activities other than the three priorities listed can be eligible for quality funds. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary responds that only applications that respond to the priorities already identified by the Secretary
in the regulations for this program or priorities established through future rulemaking will be considered when
allocating the quality funds. 


Changes: 

None. 


Basic State Agency Award Formula ( 388.21) 




Comments: 

Four commenters objected to the proposed formula in  388.21 whereby 80 percent of the funds available would
be distributed based on the number of staff and 20 percent of the funds available would be distributed based on quality.
They believe that the split penalizes States with small populations with limited capacity to write grants. In the
commenters' view, the distribution does not take into account extra travel costs in a State with a large geographic
area, and a commenter suggested increasing the small State agency minimum share. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the proposed formula maximizes the amount of funds available for basic awards while ensuring
that a reasonable amount is available for small agencies and for the Secretary's priorities. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comment: 

A commenter noted that  388.21 does not state what the minimum score is that an applicant must receive in order
for its application to be approved by the Secretary or how it is to be computed. 


Discussion: 

In order to make funding decisions, the Secretary sets a minimum score for each competition after all applications
have been reviewed. The minimum score will be computed through an analysis of all reviewed applications to determine
those that are in the fundable range. 


Changes: 

None.

<TEXT>
 

Selection Criteria ( 388.20) 




Comments: 

Two commenters recommended deleting  388.20(f)(1)(ii) of the evaluation selection criteria that would judge
in-service training outcomes by the extent to which training results in improved individual competency through
licensure, certification, or award of academic degrees or certificates. The commenters believe in-service training
to be short-term and job-based; therefore, reference to improved individual competency through degree-based programs
should be dropped. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that, in response to the need to increase the number of qualified rehabilitation personnel,
academic outcomes must be included among the measures of in-service training programs. 


Changes: 

None. 


Reviewers' Qualifications 




Comments: 

Three commenters observed that reviewers for in-service proposals should be well qualified, represent diverse
populations, and be identified by name and program affiliation after the review is completed. They commented that
all applicants should receive reviewer comments. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that reviewers must be qualified and representative of the diverse populations and agencies
assisted through in-service training. The Secretary does make summary information available on characteristics
of reviewers but believes the specific reviewers of proposals should remain anonymous. All applicants are provided
with the reviewer comments on their applications when the review is completed. 


Changes: 

None. 


Intergovernmental Review 


This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective
of the Executive Order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and strengthened federalism by relying on processes
developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.

In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for this program.

Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard establishes regulations that require the owners or operators of existing tank vessels of 5,000 gross
tons (GT) or more that do not have double hulls to carry certain emergency lightering equipment on board and foreign
flag vessel owners or operators to provide the vessels' International Maritime Organization (IMO) international
numbers in the advance notice of arrival report. The purpose of the regulations is to reduce damage to the environment
by facilitating response and salvage efforts for a vessel in the case of a collision or grounding. The regulations
represent the Coast Guard's first step in designating structural and operational measures for existing tank vessels
without double hulls as required by the Oil Pollution 
Act of 1990 (OPA 90).

Drafting Information 


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Randall N. Crenwelge, Project Manager, Oil Pollution
Act Staff, and Jacqueline L. Sullivan, Project Counsel, OPA 90 Staff. 



Regulatory History 


On November 1, 1991, the Coast Guard published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (56 FR 56284) which
discussed structural and operational measures which are intended to meet the requirements of section 4115(b) of
OPA 90. The ANPRM included a request for date on the technical and economic feasibility of those measures for use on
vessels covered by section 4115(b). A total of 88 comment letters were received by the close of the extended comment
period, which ended on January 30, 1992 (57 FR 1243).

After reviewing the comments, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled, ``Structural
and Operational Measures to Reduce Oil Spills from Existing Tank Vessels Without Double Hulls'' (Existing Vessels)
on October 22, 1993 (58 FR 54870). The Coast Guard issued two subsequent correction notices on November 19, 1993 (58
FR 61143), and December 14, 1993 (58 FR 65298), which made technical corrections to the NPRM. In response to several
comments received on the NPRM, the Coast Guard published, on December 16, 1993, a notice of public meeting and extension
of comment period (58 FR 65863).

The Coast Guard held a public meeting on January 20, 1994, to obtain information from the public on the proposed regulations.
Topics addressed by speakers included applicability, differences between tank barges and tankships, exemptions,
and economic and technical feasibility of the proposed regulations. Some of the basic assumptions of the proposed
regulations were also discussed, particularly their reliance on Regulation 13G of Annex I of the International Convention
for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (MARPOL 73/78). Information
on the public meeting is available for public review at the address under ``ADDRESSES

.''

In light of the comments received at the public meeting and in response to the written comments received concerning
the NPRM, the Coast Guard is reviewing the proposed regulations. The Coast Guard, however, is committed to implementing
all the provisions of section 4115(b) in a timely manner. To expedite the implementation of section 4115(b) of OPA
90, the Coast Guard has developed a three-pronged approach which encompasses three separate rulemaking projects.
The Coast Guard intends to: (1) Issue this final rule implementing the requirements to carry emergency lightering
equipment and to include the International Maritime Organization (IMO) international number in the advance notice
of arrival report; (2) in the near future, issue a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) regarding additional
operational measures for tankships and tank barges; and (3) review comments on the NPRM for major measures and revise
the Regulatory Assessment (RA) before issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) regarding structural
measures for tankships and tank barges.



Background and Purpose



Section 4115 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101-380) mandates regulations to provide improved
protection from oil spills in waters subject to jurisdiction of the United States due to collisions and groundings
of tank vessels that are constructed or adapted to carry, or that carry oil in bulk as cargo or cargo residue. Section
4115(b) (which appears as a statutory note following 46 U.S.C. 3703a) directs the Coast Guard to develop structural
or operational requirements for tank vessels of 5,000 gross tons (GT) or more to serve as regulations until 2015, when
all tank vessels operating in U.S. waters are required to have double hulls under section 4115(a) of OPA 90 (46 U.S.C.
3703a). Regulations issued under the authority of section 4115(b) must provide as substantial protection to the
environment as is economically and technologically feasible.



Discussion of Comments and Changes



Background information on structural and operational measures for existing vessels without double hulls is provided
in the preambles to the ANPRM and the NPRM.

The Coast Guard received a total of 132 comments concerning the NPRM; however, only 8 comments addressed the provisions
on emergency lightering equipment, and there were no comments on the advance notice of arrival requirements for foreign
vessels. The Coast Guard also received two comments on the applicability of the regulations.



Emergency Lightering Equipment



The NPRM proposed requirements for vessels covered by the regulations to be equipped with lightering equipment,
including certain size reducers, bolts, washers, nuts, gaskets, and appropriate quantities of spares. The onboard
emergency lightering equipment is intended to facilitate rapid transfer of oil from a vessel in the case of a collision
or grounding. Although, normally, lightering operations should not commence until salvage experts and the vessel's
master have assessed the condition of the vessel, under some circumstances immediate action may be required. If oil
cargo is improperly lightered from a vessel or if oil cargo is lightered from the wrong tanks, additional damage to
the vessel could occur, crew safety could be jeopardized, and additional oil cargo could be discharged into the marine
environment. Even if lightering is not initiated until after a full assessment of its suitability, having the required
equipment on board ensures that lightering will not be delayed.

Eight comments on the NPRM expressed general support for the Coast Guard's requirement for emergency lightering
equipment. In addition, four of these comments proposed modifications.

Three comments agreed with the requirement to store emergency lightering equipment near the cargo manifold as long
as the equipment is stored in such a manner that it is protected from the weather. The Coast Guard agrees and is requiring
all emergency lightering equipment to be stored in one separate and marked location, in a space such as the cargo control
room, pump room, or forecastle locker, and as convenient to the cargo manifold, as practicable.

One comment disagreed with the specific pieces of equipment required by the NPRM and suggested that any requirement
for emergency lightering equipment be considered as a total package along with other lightering and salvage equipment.
The equipment required by this rule is in addition to the requirements for lightering equipment found in the Vessel
Response Plans (VRP) IFR (58 FR 43434). This equipment is independent of all other lightering equipment; it is not
to be viewed as part of a larger package of lightering equipment found in the VRP IFR. Additionally, it must be stored
separately from all other lightering equipment for the purposes of easy identification and quick access.

The Coast Guard has determined that the emergency lightering equipment required by this regulation is necessary
to ensure that the vessel owner or operator has lightering equipment available immediately to use the vessel's cargo
pumps to discharge through its manifold to another vessel alongside. This requirement will increase rather than
decrease compatibility with other parts of an overall lightering or salvage system.

Another comment suggested that the Coast Guard require two extra sets of bolts, washers, nuts and gaskets per reducer
set instead of just one extra set. Although carriage of additional spares is encouraged, the Coast Guard has opted
to establish a minimum requirement.

One comment stated that foreign flag vessels should be exempt from the requirement to have equipment that meets the
material standards referenced in the proposed regulations (46 CFR 56.25). The comment claimed that some of the material
standards referenced would not be appropriate for foreign flag vessels because their standards are established
by other classification societies or by other foreign standards. The comment did state, however, that foreign flag
vessels should be held to the dimensional requirements in the proposed  157.420 of the NPRM.

The Coast Guard finds that no change in response to this comment is appropriate. Foreign flag vessels operating in
U.S. waters must be prepared to conduct emergency lightering operations in coordination with vessels operating
under Coast Guard standards. The Coast Guard will accept equipment that complies with other standards that it determines
to be equivalent, or it may accept specific pieces of equipment as being equivalent. All lightering equipment, regardless
of which standards are used, must facilitate safe lightering operations.

One comment indicated that the Coast Guard should consider requiring onboard emergency rapid transfer systems (ERTS)
in conjunction with the requirement for emergency lightering equipment. Without full-scale development and testing
of the ERTS, the Coast Guard does not wish to mandate the use of this system because its effectiveness is unproven; however,
the Coast Guard may consider the use of such a system in the future if it determines that such an arrangement provides
as substantial protection to the environment as is economically and technologically feasible and meets the general
safety considerations.

Adapters have been added to the equipment required by  157.410 to ensure equipment size compatibility. Adapters
are required to adapt components with dimensions in English units to metric units. The vessel owner or operator must
provide any other adapters that are necessary to ensure connection to the specified hose sizes for lightering purposes.

Initially, the NPRM for this rulemaking proposed a 3-year phase-in period for structural and operational measures.
This period would give the vessel owner or operator sufficient time to conveniently drydock a tank vessel. The lightering
equipment required by this final rule does not require drydocking for installation and is most likely available from
manufacturers' stock inventory. Therefore, a phase-in period of 1 year is granted to allow for convenient installation
aboard a tank vessel.



Advance Notice of Arrival



The NPRM proposed to require the owners or operators of certain foreign flag tank vessels to provide the vessels' IMO
international numbers to the Captains of the Port before arriving at a port or place in the United States. There were
no comments on the advance notice of arrival requirements in the NPRM, and the requirements remain unchanged in the
final rule. However, the effective date has been changed from 3 years to 90 days after publication of this final rule.
Because no structural or operational changes are required to implement this provision, the change in the effective
date should not adversely affect the owners or operators of foreign flag tank vessels operating in U.S. waters.

<PARENT> FR940805-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the NPRM, the regulations for emergency lightering equipment were located in a proposed new subpart G at 33 CFR 157.420.
Because the requirements for structural measures, which were located in proposed   157.410 and 157.415
in the NPRM, are not being issued at this time, the requirements for emergency lightering operations will be located
at  157.410 in the final rule. Section 157.400 entitled ``Purpose and scope'' is being issued at this time except
that proposed paragraph (c), which established the effective date for the entire subpart, has been deleted.









Regulatory Evaluation






The NPRM of October 22, 1993, was classified as ``major'' under Executive Order 12291, which was in effect, because
the cost of the proposed requirements would be over $100 million annually. As previously discussed, the final rule
implements only a minor portion of that proposal. This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive
Order 12866, and has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant
under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).




A draft Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT has been prepared
and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ``

ADDRESSES

.'' The Evaluation is summarized as follows.








Summary of Benefits







This rulemaking requires all applicable vessels to carry emergency lightering equipment including reducers, adapters,
bolts, washers, nuts, and gaskets. The principal benefit will be to facilitate rapid oil transfer from a stricken
tank vessel to another tank vessel in those instances where the stricken vessel's cargo pumps are operable. The resultant
ability to rapidly transfer oil will minimize the risk of further spillage. A review of a sample of marine pollution
cases did not reveal a sufficient number of incidents from which the benefits of this measure could be directly quantified.
However, the measures will be useful in cases where a vessel's cargo transfer system remains operational although
portions of the ship are damaged and substantial quantities of oil remain aboard. This lightering equipment can be
used to reduce the risk of further spillage.





This final rule also requires a foreign flag vessel to report its IMO international number to the Coast Guard Captain
of the Port when reporting its advance notice of arrival. This international number will provide the Coast Guard with
a means of accessing Marine Safety Information System (MSIS) data on the vessel, from which the Coast Guard may determine
whether any special attention would be necessary if the vessel were involved in a collision or grounding. A quick response
that takes into account the special circumstances of a vessel will significantly reduce the amount of oil spilled
as a result of a collision or grounding. Although the benefits from this requirement could be significant, the Coast
Guard is unable to quantify them from available data.





Summary of Costs






The present value of the cost to the tank vessel industry of providing a storage area and acquiring emergency lightering
equipment is expected to total $6 million. U.S. tank vessels will incur $1 million of the total cost and foreign tank
vessels trading with the United States will incur the remaining $5 million. The undiscounted cost per vessel will
range from $4,000 to $9,500 for foreign tank vessels, and $5,000 to $12,500 for U.S. tank vessels covered by this final
rule, depending on the configuration of the vessel and extent of modifications required to provide appropriate storage.
The undiscounted cost for U.S. tank barges is estimated at about $5,000 per barge. Additionally, the cost to U.S. tank
vessels may be more expensive because U.S. materials and labor rates are generally higher.



The requirement for a foreign vessel to provide its international number in its advance notice of arrival report will
create no additional cost to the tank barge and tankship industries. Tank vessels are now required to report advance
notice of arrival to the Captain of the Port of each U.S. port visited, and the international number is readily available
to the master, owner, or agent.




The present value of the total cost of this final rule to the tankship and tank barge industries is $6 million. 





Small Entities





Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities for this rule.




The present value of the cost of this rule totals $6 million. The undiscounted cost per vessel will range from as low
as $4,000-$5,000 per vessel for the smallest tankship and tank barge included in this rulemaking to only $12,500
per vessel for the largest U.S. flag tank vessel affected. These sums include both the hardware and shipyard costs
for stowage arrangements and are extremely small when compared with the capital invested in the affected vessels.
No early vessel retirements are anticipated as a result of this final rule. In accordance with OPA 90, the Coast Guard
excludes from this final rule the tank barge and tankship fleet under 5,000 GT.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940805-0-00068 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940805-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Because of the exemption of tank vessels of less than 5,000 GT from this final rule and the low cost per vessel, the Coast
Guard certifies that this rulemaking will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.


Collection of Information


This rule contains collection-of-information requirements. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

), and OMB has approved them. The section number is 160.207 and the corresponding OMB approval number is OMB Control
Number 2115-0557.


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that preparation of an Environmental
Impact Statement is not necessary. An Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Finding of No Significant Impact are available
in the docket for copying or inspection where indicated under ``

ADDRESSES

.'' The environmental impacts of the requirements of this rule are sufficiently severable from the operational and
structural measures proposed in the NPRM to allow independent evaluation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Statement


Section 2 of DIDRA, 12 U.S.C. 3352, authorizes the agencies to make exceptions to statutory and regulatory appraisal
requirements for transactions with respect to real property located in areas that the President has determined,
pursuant to section 5170 of Title 42, that a major disaster exists, provided that the exception would facilitate recovery
from the major disaster and is consistent with safety and soundness.
 Such exceptions expire not later than three years after the date of the President's determination that a major disaster
exists in the area.

Since July 7, 1994, and continuing, the President has declared several areas as Major Disaster Areas in certain Alabama,
Florida, and Georgia counties because of the extensive flooding that occurred and is continuing. The agencies believe
that granting relief from the appraisal requirements for certain real estate transactions in all such areas affected
by this flooding is consistent with the provisions of the DIDRA.
The agencies have determined that the disruption of real estate markets in all such affected areas interferes with
the ability of depository institutions to obtain appraisals that comply with statutory and regulatory requirements
and, therefore, may impede institutions in making loans and engaging in other transactions that would aid in the reconstruction
and rehabilitation of the affected area. Accordingly, the agencies have determined that recovery from this major
disaster would be facilitated by excepting transactions involving real estate located in the area directly affected
by the flooding from the real estate appraisal requirements of Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,
and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) as amended, 12 U.S.C. 3331 

et seq.,

 and regulations promulgated thereto. This has the effect of excepting certain transactions from the definition
of ``federally related transactions.''
The agencies have also determined that safety and soundness would not be adversely affected by such exceptions so
long as the depository institution's records relating to any such excepted transaction clearly indicate either
that the property involved was directly affected by the major disaster or that the transaction would facilitate recovery
from the disaster and there is a binding commitment to fund the transaction within three years after the date the major
disaster was declared. In addition, the transaction must continue to be subject to review by management and by the
agencies in the course of examination of the institution under normal supervisory standards relating to safety and
soundness, though the transactions need not comply with the specific requirements of Title XI of FIRREA and the agencies'
appraisal regulations.


Expiration Dates


Any exceptions provided under the order shall expire not later than three years after the date on which the President
determines, pursuant to section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C.
5170, that a major disaster exists in the area. Accordingly, exceptions for the major disasters declared due to the
flooding expire on: July 8, 1997 for Alabama counties; July 10, 1997 for Florida counties; and July 7, 1997 for Georgia
counties. Exceptions for any other counties in this area that have been declared major disasters by the President
as a result of the flooding that began on or about July 7, 1994 expire 3 years after the date of such declaration.


Order


In accordance with section 2 of DIDRA, relief is hereby granted from the provisions of Title XI of FIRREA and the agencies
appraisal regulations for any real estate-related financial transaction that requires the services of an appraiser
under those provisions, provided that:
(1) The transaction involves real estate located in an area that the President has determined, pursuant to section
401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5170, is a major disaster area
as a result of the July 1994 flooding in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, and has been designated eligible for Federal
assistance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA);





(2)(a) The real property involved was directly affected by the major disaster, or
(b) The real property involved was not directly affected by the major disaster but the institution's records explain
how the transaction would facilitate recovery from the disaster;
(3) There is a binding commitment to fund a transaction that is made within three years after the date the major disaster
was declared by the President; and
(4) The institution retains in its files, for examiner review, appropriate documentation supporting the property's
valuation.
