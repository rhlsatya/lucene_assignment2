Determination Not To Revoke Antidumping Duty Orders, Findings, and Suspension Agreement



<AGENCY>

International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of determination not to revoke antidumping duty orders, findings, and a suspension agreement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the antidumping duty orders,
findings, and the suspension agreement listed below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background




The Department of Commerce (the Department) may revoke an antidumping duty order or finding, or terminate a suspended
investigation, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii), if no interested party has requested an administrative review
for four consecutive annual anniversary months and no domestic interested party objects to the revocation or requests
an administrative review.

We had not received a request to conduct administrative reviews of the following antidumping duty orders, findings,
or suspension agreement for the last four consecutive annual anniversary months. Therefore, pursuant to  353.25(d)(4)(i)
of the Department's regulations, on September 9, 1993, November 2, 1993, December 27, 1993, December 30, 1993, January
3, 1994, January 27, 1994, February 4, 1994, and March 29, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 notices of intent to revoke these antidumping duty orders and findings or terminate the suspended investigation
and served written notice of the intent to each interested party on the Department's service list in each case. Within
the specified time frame, we received objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke these antidumping
duty orders and findings or terminate these suspended investigations. Therefore, because domestic interested
parties objected to the revocations and terminations, we no longer intend to revoke these antidumping duty orders
and findings or terminate the suspended investigation.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List a service to be 
furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or 
have other severe disabilities. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On November 11, 1993, the Committee for Purchase From People Who 
Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (58 FR 62647) 
of proposed addition to the Procurement List. 
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the service, 
fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or 
most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the 
service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal 
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 



I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the service 
to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the service. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the service to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the service proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 
Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the 
Procurement List: 
Painting Service, 
Family Quarters, 
Fort Sam Houston, Texas. 
This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.

<DOCTITLE>Procurement List; Addition </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or 
Severely Disabled.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Addition to the Procurement List.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List a commodity to 
be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind 
or have other severe disabilities. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On February 25, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who 
Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 9189) 
of proposed addition to the Procurement List. 
Comments were received from the current contractor for the grommet 
in response to a request for sales data. In providing the data, 
the contractor indicated that loss of the contract would increase 
its prices for other items made of the same material, and reduce 
the company's competitiveness, because it would have to pay higher 
prices for the smaller volume of the material it would order if the 
grommet is added to the Procurement List. The contractor also 
indicated that it had spent a great amount of money to develop 
molds for the grommet, as a new producer would have to do. Because it has several molds, the contractor believes that
it can produce 
the grommet for many years without subsequent investment, and that 
its experience with the molds permits it to keep the molds in 
running order easily. 


The contractor did not provide data to indicate the extent of the 
impact which paying higher prices for material would have on the 
company. Consequently, the Committee cannot assess how much it 
would add to the impact of losing Government sales of the grommet. 
The sales loss alone represents such a small percentage of the 
contractor's total sales that the Committee does not consider it to 
constitute severe adverse impact. 
The contractor's point about a new producer having to create new 
molds at substantial cost would appear to be a way of claiming that 
this cost would be reflected in the price the Government will pay 
for molds produced under the Committee's program. However, the 
Committee is required to set a fair market price for items the 
Government buys under its program. Consequently, the nonprofit 
agency which will produce the grommet under the Committee's program 
will not be able to charge an unfairly high price for the grommets 
in order to recoup its costs for the new molds. 
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
commodity, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the 
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
that the commodity listed below are suitable for procurement by 
the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodity 
to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the commodity. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the commodity to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the commodity proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 
Accordingly, the following commodity is hereby added to the 
Procurement List: 



Grommet 


8140-01-051-9951 




This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.

ACTION:

 Notice of availability of the amendments to the 1993-94 National Direct Student Loan and Federal Perkins Loan
Programs Directory of Designated Low-Income Schools. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Institutions and borrowers participating in the Federal Perkins Loan and National Direct Student Loan Programs
and other interested persons are advised that they may obtain information regarding the amendments to the National
Direct Student Loan and Federal Perkins Loan Programs Directory of Designated Low-Income Schools for Teacher Cancellation
Benefits for the 1993-94 School Year (Directory). The amendments identify changes in the list of schools that

<DOCTITLE>Intent to Prepare A Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement for the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site
Golden, CO </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Department of Energy (DOE). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent (NOI). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 DOE announces its intent to prepare a Site-wide Environmental Impact Statement (SWEIS) for the Rocky Flats Environmental
Technology Site (formerly known as the Rocky Flats Plant) located near Golden in Jefferson County, CO. The SWEIS is
being prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as amended (42 USC 4321 

et seq.

), and in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions
of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) and the DOE NEPA Implementing Procedures (10 CFR Part 1021). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Rocky Flats, a Federal Government-owned, contractor-operated facility near Golden, Colorado, began operations
in 1952. The site's primary mission was the production of component parts for nuclear weapons. Key production activities
involved the fabrication of parts from plutonium, uranium, and nonradioactive metals, such as beryllium, stainless
steel, and aluminum. Components made at Rocky Flats were shipped elsewhere for assembly. Components from obsolete
nuclear weapons were disassembled and processed to recover plutonium and americium (a by-product of plutonium radioactive
decay). Enriched uranium components were separated and shipped elsewhere for recycling. In support of weapon component
fabrication, Rocky Flats operated facilities for the storage, treatment, and transport of waste; chemical laboratories;
research and development facilities; and special support operations for other DOE facilities. 



In the process of fulfilling its national security mission, Rocky Flats generated waste materials that have contaminated
soils, groundwater, and surface water with chemical and radioactive substances. In 1989, Rocky Flats was placed
on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. Cleanup, decontamination, and restoration of Rocky
Flats is part of DOE's overall commitment to properly and safely manage sites under DOE's stewardship and to reduce
or eliminate risks to the environment and public health and safety. These activities are being conducted at Rocky
Flats under an Interagency Agreement regarding the remedial cleanup of Rocky Flats between DOE, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, and the Colorado Department of Health. This agreement is currently under renegotiation as the
Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement. 

Rocky Flats will have completed a transition from a weapons complex site to one that has predominantly an environmental
restoration and waste management mission by the end of fiscal year 1994 (September 30, 1994). The only weapons complex
function still performed by the facility is the manufacture of a number of nonnuclear parts for nuclear weapons. As
a result of the recent decision to consolidate the weapons complex nonnuclear manufacturing activities, the remaining
weapons complex activities at the site will be terminated at the end of fiscal year 1994, and will be moved to the Department's
Kansas City Plant. Thus, the new mission of the site will be to clean up and convert Rocky Flats to beneficial uses in
a manner that is safe, environmentally and socially responsible, physically secure and cost-effective. In light
of these changes, the name of the facility has recently been changed from the Rocky Flats Plant to the Rocky Flats Environmental
Technology Site. 

As defined in the DOE NEPA Implementing Procedures, a SWEIS is a broad-scope, programmatic NEPA document that identifies
and assesses the individual and cumulative environmental effects of ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future
actions at a DOE site. A SWEIS may be used to assess potential effects related to changes in overall operational mode
or mission. Subsequent, project-specific NEPA documents may be tiered from a SWEIS, and general information included
in the SWEIS can be incorporated by reference into project-specific NEPA documents. 

The Rocky Flats SWEIS is being prepared to update and replace the April 1980, Final Environmental Impact Statement
for the Rocky Flats Plant Site 
(DOE/EIS-0064), and to provide a basis for selection of a site-wide strategic approach to implementing Rocky
Flats' change in mission from production of nuclear weapons components to nuclear materials storage, waste management,
cleanup, and economic conversion. The SWEIS will also support project level decisions within the next 5-10
years regarding land use, management of nuclear materials, deactivation of Rocky Flats facilities, decontamination
and decommissioning of existing facilities for conversion to beneficial uses, need for additional waste storage
facilities, and possible onsite and offsite transportation of radioactive, hazardous and mixed wastes. This NOI
provides a proposed action and two alternatives for public review and comment.

22, 1990. As a result of the cancellation of nuclear weapons production at Rocky Flats, both the 1991 SWEIS NOI and the
Plutonium Recovery Modification Project NOI no longer reflect Rocky Flats' current mission. Accordingly, both
the 1991 SWEIS NOI and the Plutonium Recovery Modification Project NOI are withdrawn. 

Public Scoping Process: To ensure the SWEIS addresses the full range of issues and alternatives related to this proposal,
DOE invites all interested parties, including the general public, to submit oral or written comments on the issues
to be addressed and the alternatives to be analyzed in the SWEIS. Interested parties may submit written comments to
Beth Brainard-Jordan at the address listed above, at facsimile number 1-303-966-6633, or at the
public scoping meeting. 

DOE also invites all interested parties to present oral and/or written comments at the public scoping meeting scheduled
for August 23, 1994. In addition, parties are invited to offer comments or suggestions concerning the SWEIS by calling
the Rocky Flats SWEIS telephone hotline at 1-800-801-2026. All written and oral comments will be
recorded and given equal weight in preparation of the Draft SWEIS. 

The scoping process includes informal scoping workshops, which have begun and will continue until the close of the
comment period. These workshops are designed to provide interested parties with an effective, informal mechanism
for two-way communication with DOE. Dates, times, and locations of the workshops will be advertised locally in the
Golden, CO, area. 

A public scoping meeting is being held to assist in defining the appropriate scope of the SWEIS and the significant
environmental issues to be addressed. This meeting is scheduled for August 23, 1994, from 2:00 to 4:30 P.M. and from
6:00 to 8:00 P.M., at the Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities, 6901 Wadsworth Boulevard, Arvada, CO. This public
scoping meeting will be conducted by a facilitator, and will not be a formal evidentiary hearing. The facilitator,
DOE representatives, and members of the public present may ask for clarification of comments and statements. Requests
to speak at the meeting and requests for additional information may be made by calling the toll-free telephone number
1-800-801-2026 or by facsimile at 1-303-832-9095. People may also register at
the meeting to speak. 

To ensure that all interested parties have an opportunity to speak, five minutes will be allotted for each speaker.
Depending on the number of persons requesting to speak, the facilitator may allow people to speak more than once or
allot additional time for elected officials, organizations, or speakers representing multiple parties. Persons
speaking on behalf of organizations should identify the name of the organization in their request to speak. Persons
who have not submitted a request to speak in advance of the public scoping meeting, but who have registered at the meeting,
will be called upon to speak in turn after the pre-registered speakers. Written comments will also be accepted at the
meeting, and speakers are encouraged to provide written versions of their oral comments for the record. 

DOE is committed to providing opportunities for the involvement of interested individuals and groups in this and
other DOE planning activities. DOE will publish additional information on the date and location of the public scoping
meeting in local newspapers well in advance of the scheduled meeting date. If it becomes necessary to change the date,
time or location of the public scoping meeting, the changes will be announced in appropriate media. 

DOE will record and prepare transcripts of the public scoping meeting comments. Interested parties will be able to
review the transcripts, written comments, reference material, related NEPA documents, and background information
on Rocky Flats during normal business hours at the following reading rooms:

DOE will prepare a SWEIS Implementation Plan after completion of the public scoping process. The SWEIS Implementation
Plan will be placed in the public reading rooms for review, and copies will be made available to the public upon request.
The Implementation Plan will be a brief document that will provide guidance for the preparation of the SWEIS in accordance
with 10 CFR 1021.312 and will include a discussion of the intended scope and content of the SWEIS; a summary of the comments
received and their disposition; and target dates for completion of the Draft SWEIS, Final SWEIS, and issuance of a
Record of Decision. 
Preliminary Alternatives: This section describes three preliminary alternatives that represent the spectrum
of options available for future actions at Rocky Flats. Each alternative represents a broad direction regarding
materials management, waste management, and site cleanup that DOE could take during the ten-year period after the
issuance of a Record of Decision. 
DOE recognizes that there may be a need to redefine these alternatives and welcomes comments on the best way to accomplish
this. The actions DOE chooses to implement, through the Record of Decision, may be composites of actions analyzed
in the SWEIS alternatives. Proposed future actions that are not well enough defined to be analyzed in the SWEIS will
be subject to separate NEPA review tiered from the SWEIS. 
Alternative 1_No Action: Analysis of the no action alternative provides a reference point for comparison with the
environmental effects of the other alternatives analyzed. The No Action alternative would include ongoing activities
and planned activities for which decisions have already been made to proceed. DOE will continue to conduct these activities
as the SWEIS is being prepared. 
The ongoing activities included in the no action alternative are site cleanup and minor facility upgrades. Examples
include: 
 Transfer of non-nuclear weapons manufacturing to Kansas City
 Continuation of remediation under the Interagency Agreement
 Treatment and storage of onsite wastes up to currently approved limits
 Shipping wastes offsite to permitted disposal facilities that have agreed to accept the waste 
 Maintenance activities
 Activities needed to support ongoing site programs and to safeguard nuclear material
DOE is also considering certain proposed actions for which NEPA review may be completed during the preparation of
the SWEIS. DOE may decide to proceed with actions for which NEPA review has been completed and which are allowable as
interim actions during the preparation of the SWEIS (see limitations stated in 40 CFR 1506.1, for example). These
actions would then become a part of the No Action alternative. Such planned activities may include: 
 Consolidation of fissile materials storage locations 
 Rehabilitation of site drainage ditches 
 Actinide solution processing 
 Construction of a storage facility for investigation-derived material 
The no action alternative would not include cleanup activities and waste management activities that require new
permits or facility upgrades that involve major expansions or modifications to existing buildings. Transfer of
buildings or property to private ownership (economic conversion) would not be included in the no action alternative.
Excluding these actions from this alternative provides the reference point that shows the effects of site operations
with no major improvements or modifications. 
Analysis of the no action alternative is required by Council on Environmental Quality and DOE regulations.

Alternative 2_Proposed Action: This alternative encompasses the activities addressed in Alternative 1 plus other
actions necessary to meet environmental, regulatory, and security requirements and other mission objectives that
would be taken within the ten years following the Record of Decision. The proposed action includes activities described
in the Transition Plan Report to Congress, the Rocky Flats Strategic Plan, actions under discussion in connection
with the Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement that is currently being negotiated, and anticipated activities under the
Federal Facility Compliance Act. Examples include, but are not limited to: 
 Materials management_consolidate all non-waste materials
 Waste Management_store onsite and dispose of offsite; pretreat, if necessary 
 Upgrade buildings to meet the new mission and current regulatory requirements 
 Economic conversion to transfer buildings or property to private use or ownership 
 Deactivation of onsite facilities 
Alternative 3: This alternative assumes that offsite disposal facilities may not be available as envisioned in current
plans, and involves programs that would create suitable facilities for prolonged storage of waste and other materials.
The onsite activities included in Alternative 2, with the exception of economic conversion, would be encompassed
by this alternative plus the construction of onsite facilities suitable for storing nuclear materials and transuranic
waste until offsite disposition is available. Low-level waste and mixed wastes would be disposed of onsite. 
This alternative is consistent with the current mission statement, but involves design and construction of additional
prolonged onsite storage and disposal capacity. 
Preliminary Issues To Be Addressed: The SWEIS will address the impacts of the alternatives to the extent necessary
to make a reasoned choice among the alternatives, using available data where possible and by obtaining new data where
necessary. In accordance with Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1500.4 and 1502.21), other documents,
as appropriate, may be incorporated into the impact analyses by reference, in whole or in part. The following preliminary
issues are presented to facilitate public comment on the SWEIS. This presentation is not intended to be all-inclusive
nor to be a predetermination of impacts to be considered. 
1. Land Use. The SWEIS will consider land use planning issues in consultation with the Citizen's Advisory Board, including
economic conversion and potential land use restrictions based on residual contamination levels. 
2. Economic Conversion. The impacts of converting buildings onsite and portions of the buffer zone to private sector
usage, including the impacts of decontaminating land and buildings for economic conversion.
3. Environmental Restoration. The impacts of environmental restoration activities to remediate past releases
to ground water, surface water, sediment, and soils. 
4. Waste Management. The impacts of management (treatment, storage, and disposal) of solid and liquid waste, including
residues, non-hazardous, hazardous, and mixed transuranic and low-level wastes. 
5. Pollution Prevention. The SWEIS will consider appropriate and innovative pollution prevention, waste minimization,
and energy and water use reduction technologies, including eliminating or significantly reducing (a) acquisition
of unnecessary hazardous substances; and (b) energy, water, and related environmental impacts by promoting use
of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. 
6. Nuclear Materials. The impacts of storage and management of nuclear materials until their disposition can be determined.

7. Soil, Water, and Air. Potential impacts to soil, water, and air. 
8. Sensitive Environmental Resources. Potential impacts to plants, animals, and habitat, including impacts to
floodplains, wetlands, and threatened and endangered species and their habitat. 
9. Cultural Resources. Potential impacts to cultural resources, such as historic, archaeological, scientific,
or other culturally important sites. 
10. Socioeconomic. Potential impacts to local and regional socioeconomic conditions and factors, including urban
encroachment, employment, housing, tax base, and community infrastructure and services. 
11. Environmental Justice. Potential disproportionate impacts of DOE activities on minority or low-income populations.

12. Transportation. Potential impacts on the environment and public health from the on- and off-site transportation
of radioactive and/or hazardous materials, equipment, products, and wastes. 
13. Public and Occupational Safety and Health. The radiological and non-radiological impacts on workers and the
public from routine site operations and potential accidents. 
14. Regulatory Compliance. The impacts of the alternatives on compliance of Rocky Flats with applicable Federal
and State requirements.

1. Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Environmental Restoration and Waste Management (EM-PEIS).
The EM-PEIS will analyze complex-wide environmental restoration and waste management issues and alternatives.
DOE published the NOI to prepare the EM-PEIS on October 22, 1990 (55 FR 42633) and issued an Implementation Plan
on December 23, 1993. The Rocky Flats SWEIS will discuss its relationship to the EM-PEIS and how issues addressed
in the EM-PEIS could affect the alternatives analyzed in the SWEIS.
2. Proposed Interim Storage of Enriched Uranium Above the Maximum Historic Storage Levels at the Y-12 Plant
(Enriched Uranium Environmental Assessment). The Enriched Uranium Environmental Assessment will analyze the
treatment and storage of enriched uranium, including highly enriched uranyl nitrates now stored at Rocky Flats and
at DOE's Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge, TN. DOE will incorporate into the Rocky Flats SWEIS, as appropriate, any decisions
made about interim storage and treatment of highly enriched uranium as a result of the Enriched Uranium Environmental
Assessment.
3. Resumption of Thermal Stabilization of Plutonium in Building 707, Rocky Flats Plant: Environmental Assessment
(DOE/EA-0887). This environmental assessment analyzed the impacts of heating small quantities of plutonium
powder in gloveboxes, under controlled conditions, in Building 707. DOE issued a Finding of No Significant Impact
on February 10, 1994. The Rocky Flats SWEIS will incorporate the decisions made about thermal stabilization of plutonium
into the Rocky Flats SWEIS and discuss how issues addressed in the Building 707 Environmental Assessment could affect
the alternatives analyzed in the Rocky Flats SWEIS.
4. Nonnuclear Consolidation Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA-0792). The Nonnuclear Consolidation Environmental
Assessment analyzed the DOE's proposal to withdraw defense activities from the Mound, Pinellas, and Rocky Flats
Plants, and consolidate most of the nonnuclear activities at the Kansas City Plant. Consolidation was evaluated
in terms of operating costs, protection of the environment and public and worker health and safety, and preservation
of technical competency to maintain the nuclear deterrent. DOE issued a Finding of No Significant Impact on July 8,
1993. The Rocky Flats SWEIS will discuss how issues addressed in the Nonnuclear Consolidation Environmental Assessment
could affect the alternatives analyzed in the Rocky Flats SWEIS.
5. Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for the Storage and Disposition of Fissile Nuclear Materials. This
Environmental Impact Statement will assess alternatives and assist in establishing a national policy for the long
term storage and disposition of fissile nuclear materials. Any decisions resulting from the Rocky Flats SWEIS regarding
the storage and disposition of fissile nuclear materials will be interim decisions that will not affect the long-term,
DOE-wide decisions to be made following completion of the Nuclear Materials Programmatic Environmental Impact
Statement.
6. Site-wide Environmental Impact Statement (SWEIS) for the Nevada Test Site and Other Off-site Test Locations within
the State of Nevada. This SWEIS would evaluate alternative management strategies for the Nevada Test Site, which
would support current and future defense related missions, research and development, waste management, environmental
restoration, infrastructure maintenance, and facility upgrades and alternative uses over the next 5-10 years.
This SWEIS would also address environmental restoration and other related activities at other offsite test locations
within the State of Nevada, which include the Project Shoal Area, Central Nevada Test Area, Tonopah Test Range, and
portions of the Nellis Air Force Range. In the Nevada SWEIS, DOE would consider the transportation, management and
disposal at the Nevada Test Site of wastes from other locations, including the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology
Site.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Kansas City Support Office announces that, pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance
Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), DOE intends to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award to Kansas State University,
Engineering Extension Service (KSU/EES), for technical assistance in the DOE/HUD Base System Analysis Maintenance
Program.




PROJECT PERIOD: 

The project period for the grant award is extended 12 months to September 30, 1995. Total funding for the FY94 portion
of the project is expected to be approximately $15,000.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

KSU/EES provided technical, computer, and software support for the DOE/HUD Initiative in FY91, FY92 and FY93. That
effort will be continued and evolve in the FY94 project effort. KSU/EES will: (1) secure needed modifications to the
utility record system software (ENACT-2) developed by the Washington State Energy Office; (2) assist in institutionalizing
the revised software into the HUD/PHA management process; (3) develop a summary report on the efficacy of the ENACT-2
program for HUD and PHAs energy management, and make recommendations on additional software enhancements, how to
facilitate its national replication in the HUD/PHA management system/interface. Due to their prior involvement,
and associated experience, their staff is uniquely qualified to continue the efforts associated with their assigned
tasks. KSU/EES has expended much time and effort in helping analyze the extensive engineering and facility management
relationships and complexities that are associated with the program. It would not be cost effective to sever that
base of knowledge in either time or funds because competition for support would have a significant adverse effect
on continuity and completion of the project in the time frame approved by DOE Washington.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)
criteria (A), (B), and (D) it intends to make a Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award (Cooperative Agreement)
to the State of Illinois for the ``Support of High Sulfur Coal Research.''




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The objective of the program is to continue broad-based research on high sulfur coal and thereby expand the technology
base that will allow for the increased use of high sulfur coals in an economically and environmentally acceptable
manner. The following are areas in which research will be conducted: Coal preparation (Cleaning, Characterization,
and Reconstruction); Gas cleanup (Combustion and Gasification Gas Cleanup); Coal-Related waste management (Combustor,
Gasifier, Preparation Plant, and FGD Waste); Coal conversion (Gasification, Liquefaction, Mild Gasification
and Processing); Develop advanced combustion technologies and perform combustion testing; and other activities
which include technology transfer activities, operation of the coal sample bank, market surveys/analyses and addressing
global climate issues.




In accordance with criteria under 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) criteria (A), (B), and (D), the State of Illinois has been
selected as the cooperative agreement recipient. Criterion (A) is satisfied since the research effort to be supported
is a continuation of work presently being jointly funded by DOE and State of Illinois. Criterion (B) is satisfied since
similar research projects would be conducted by the State using their own resources; however, additional DOE support
will enhance the public benefit by permitting a larger number of more complex projects to be supported. Presently,
neither the State nor DOE know of another entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct a similar high-sulfur
coal research activity. Criterion (D) is also satisfied. The State has the unique domestic capability necessary
to perform the planned research activities in view of the extensive program it has already conducted. The State also
maintains a large database along with expertise gained through its Department of Energy & Natural Resources,
Illinois Coal Development Board, Illinois Clean Coal Institute, Coal Industry Committee, and other dedicated State
agencies.

The project period for the cooperative agreement is for three years with an initial funding period of twelve months.
The estimated value for the initial funding period is $2,000,000.00. The State of Illinois is required to provide
at least fifty percent cost sharing from non-federal sources.

<DOCTITLE>Certain Chemicals; Approval of a Test Marketing Exemption</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces EPA's approval of an application for test marketing exemption (TME) under section 5(h)(1)
of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and 40 CFR 720.38. EPA has designated this application as TME-94-15.
The test marketing conditions are described below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 5(h)(1) of TSCA authorizes EPA to exempt persons from premanufacture notification (PMN) requirements and
permit them to manufacture or import new chemical substances for test marketing purposes if the Agency finds that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use and disposal of the substances for test marketing purposes
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. EPA may impose restrictions on test marketing
activities and may modify or revoke a test marketing exemption upon receipt of new information which casts significant
doubt on its finding that the test marketing activity will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.

Inadvertently, notice of receipt of the application was not published. Therefore, an opportunity to submit comments
is being offered at this time. The complete nonconfidential document is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information
Center (NCIC), Rm. NE-B607 at the above address between 12 noon and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding
legal holidays. EPA may modify or revoke the test marketing exemption if comments are received which cast significant
doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury. EPA hereby
approves TME-94-15. EPA had determined that test marketing of the new chemical substance described below,
under the conditions set out in the TME application, and for the time period and restrictions specified below, will
not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Production volume, use, and the number of
customers must not exceed that specified in the application. All other conditions and restrictions described in
the application and in this notice must be met.
The following additional restriction applies to TME-94-15: 
The Company is prohibited from any predictable or purposeful release of the PMN substance, or any waste stream from
manufacture, processing, or use containing the PMN substance, to the waters of the United States.




T-94-15






Date of Receipt:

 June 10, 1994. The extended comment period will close (insert date 15 days after date of publication in the 

Federal Register

).


Applicant:

 A and R materials, Inc.


Chemical:

 Isotopically altered zinc oxide (IAZO).


Use:

 Chemical additive to nuclear power plant coolant.


Production Volume:

 1,000 Kilograms. 


Number of Customers:

 One.


Test Marketing Period:

 Twelve months, commencing on the first day of manufacture under this exemption. 


Risk Assessment:

 EPA identified no significant health concerns for the test market substance. Therefore, the test market activities
will not present any unreasonable risk of injury to human health. EPA has concluded, if the TME substance were to be
released to surface water, the TME substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to the environment. Therefore,
the company is prohibited from any predictable or purposeful release of the TME substance, or any waste stream from
manufacture, processing, or use containing the TME substance, to the waters of the United States. 
The Agency reserves the right to rescind approval or modify the conditions and restrictions of an exemption should
any new information come to its attention which casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collections Approved by Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>



The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has received Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for the
following public information collections pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511.
For further information contact Shoko B. Hair, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 418-1379.



OMB Control No.: 3060-0168



Title: Reports of Proposed Changes in Depreciation Rates_Section 43.43

Expiration Date: 10/31/96

Estimated Annual Burden: 120,000 total hours; 10,000 hours per response.

Description: Section 220(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Section 220(b), requires the
Commission to prescribe depreciation charges for the subject carriers. Section 219 of the Act requires annual and
other reports from the carriers. Section 43.43 of the Commission's Rules establishes the reporting requirements
for depreciation prescription purposes. Communication common carriers with annual operating revenues of $100
million or more that the Commission has found to be dominant must file information specified in Section 43.43 before
making my change in the depreciation rates applicable to their operating plant. The Commission uses the information
to establish proper depreciation rates to be charged by the carriers, pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Act. The information
serves as the basis for depreciation analyses made by the Description Rates Branch in establishing the aforementioned
rates. Without this information, the validity of the carriers' depreciation policies could not be ascertained.
In the 

Report and Order 

in CC Docket No. 92-296 (released 10/20/93) (Depreciation Simplification Order), the Commission streamlined
its depreciation prescription process for local exchange carriers (LECs) regulated under its price cap regulatory
scheme by adopting a modified basic factor range approach. In the 

Second Report and Order 

issued in CC Docket No. 92-296, the Commission adopted the initial set of accounts and ranges for the price cap
LECs and terminated phase one of the implementation process. Ranges will be set for the remaining accounts later this
year.



OMB Control No.: 3060-0463



Title: Telecommunications Services for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Disabilities, and the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990, CC Docket No. 90-571.

Expiration Date: 06/30/97

Estimated Annual Burden: 8,110 total hours; 112.64 hours per response

Description: Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Public law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327,
366-69, added Section 225 of the Communications Act of 1934, amended Section 711 and made confronting amendments
to Sections 2(b) and 221(b). 47 C.F.R. Part 64, Subpart F implements certain provisions of the ADA. It contains the
operational, technical and functional standards required of all telecommunications relay services (TRS) providers
and also the procedures for state certification and for filing complaints involving TRS. Information submitted
in response to the state certification program will be used to determine whether the program is certifiable under
federal requirements. Information submitted by complainants will be used to determine the merits of the complaints,
and to attempt resolution.

ACTION: 

Proposed Consent Agreement.

firms to divest Aldus Corporation's FreeHand professional-illustration software and name to Altsys Corporation
within six months after the merger takes place. In addition, for ten years, it would require the respondents to obtain
Commission approval before acquiring any stock or other interest in any firm engaged in the development or sale of
professional-illustration software for the Macintosh or Power Macintosh.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to Section 6(f) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 721, 15 U.S.C. 46 and  2.34 of the Commission's

order to divest, having been filed with and accepted, subject to final approval, by the Commission, has been placed
on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days. Public comment is invited. Such comments or views will be considered
by the Commission and will be available for inspection and copying at its principal office in accordance with  4.9(b)(6)(ii)
of the Commission's Rules of Practice (16 CFR 4.9(b)(6)(ii)).

representation, or interpretation not contained in the Order or the Agreement may be used to vary or contradict the
terms of the Order.

8. Proposed respondents have read the proposed Complaint and Order contemplated hereby. They understand that once
the Order has been issued, they will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing they have fully complied
with the Order. Proposed respondents further understand that they may be liable for civil penalties in the amount
provided by law for each violation of the Order after it becomes final.

II




It is further ordered, 

that, pending divestiture of FreeHand, Respondents shall take such action as is necessary to maintain the viability
and marketability of FreeHand and shall not cause or permit the destruction, removal from the market, wasting, deterioration
or impairment of FreeHand. Pending divestiture of FreeHand, employees of Respondents involved in the development,
marketing, or sale of Illustrator or FreeHand shall not be involved in the development, marketing or sale of the other
product; and employees of Respondents involved in the development, marketing or sale of Illustrator or FreeHand
shall not receive or have access to or the use of any ``material confidential information'' not in the public domain,

It is further ordered,

have fully complied with the provisions of Paragraphs II and III of this Order, Respondents shall submit to the Commission
a verified written report setting forth in detail the manner and form in which they intend to comply, are complying,

in the development or sale of Professional Illustration Software, provided, however, that an acquisition of such
stock, share capital, equity or other interest will be exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if it is solely
for the purpose of investment and Respondents will hold no more than one percent of the shares of any class of security
traded on a national securities exchange or authorized to be quoted in an interdealer quotation system of a national
securities association registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission; or


B. Acquire any Professional Illustration Software or acquire or enter into any exclusive license to Professional
Illustration Software; Provided, however, that such an acquisition will be exempt from the requirements of this
paragraph if the purchase price is less than $2,000,000 (two million dollars).



VI






It is further ordered, 

that, for a period of ten (10) years from the date this order becomes final, unless Respondents are required to seek
prior approval from the Commission pursuant to Paragraph V, Respondents shall not, without providing advance written
notification to the Commission, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries, partnerships, or otherwise, acquire
any Professional Illustration Software or any exclusive license to Professional Illustration Software;


Said notification shall be given on the Notification and Report Form set forth in the Appendix to Part 803 of Title 16
of the Code of Federal Regulations as amended (hereinafter referred to as ``the Notification''). Respondents shall
provide to the Commission at least ten days prior to acquiring any such interest (hereinafter referred to as the ``first
waiting period''), both the Notification and supplemental information either in Respondents' possession or reasonably
available to Respondents. Such supplemental information shall include a copy of the proposed acquisition agreement;
the names of the principal representatives of each Respondent and of the firm Respondents desire to acquire who negotiated

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment


The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted, subject to final approval, an Agreement Containing
Consent Order from Adobe Systems, Inc., (``Adobe'') and Aldus Corporation (``Aldus'') (collectively, the ``Respondents'')
in resolution of antitrust concerns arising from Adobe's proposed acquisition of Aldus (the ``Acquisition'').
The proposed Consent Order (Order) has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments
by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)
days, the Commission will again review the Agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw
from the Agreement or make final the Agreement's proposed Order.
Respondents Adobe and Aldus, which market, respectively, Adobe Illustrator and Aldus FreeHand, are direct and substantial
competitors with respect to professional illustration software.
The Commission has reason to believe that Adobe's acquisition of Aldus would substantially lessen competition in
violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  18 and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15
U.S.C.  45. The proposed Order if issued by the Commission, would settle the allegations of the Complaint.
The proposed complaint in this matter alleges that Adobe Illustrator and Aldus FreeHand are the only illustration
software programs which offer features and performance characteristics enabling graphics professionals efficiently
and reliably to create and print high-quality illustrations. It alleges that the proposed acquisition would result
in a monopoly in the market for professional illustration software for use on Apple Macintosh and Power Macintosh
computers. It further alleges that even if the relevant market is broadened to include the development and sale of
all illustration software for use on Apple Macintosh and Power Macintosh computers, or is broadened even further
to include the development and sale of illustration software for use on IBM-compatible computers with the Windows
operating environment, the relevant market is highly concentrated and Adobe and Aldus have a combined share of more
than 35% of sales. The products in the broader markets are differentiated and a significant share of sales in the broader
markets is accounted for by customers who regard Illustrator and FreeHand as their first and second choices.
The complaint further alleges that entry into the market for professional illustration software would not be timely,
likely, or sufficient in its magnitude, character, and scope to deter or counteract anticompetitive effects of the
Acquisition because developing a professional illustration program is difficult and time consuming, and marketing
a technically comparable or even an improved illustration program would be difficult and time consuming because
of network externalities associated with Illustrator's and FreeHand's extensive installed user bases. Repositioning
of other programs to compete with Illustrator and FreeHand would also be difficult, time consuming and unlikely.

<DOCNO> FR940805-2-00041 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The complaint alleges that the Acquisition, by combining Illustrator and FreeHand, may substantially lessen competition
or tend to create a monopoly in the development and sale of professional illustration software.

Under the terms of the proposed Order, the Respondents must divest FreeHand to Altsys Corporation, along with Aldus
source code incorporated in FreeHand; the name ``FreeHand;'' the FreeHand customer names and addresses together
with FreeHand specific information in the Aldus database; and marketing, advertising, training and technical support
information and materials for FreeHand.
The Order requires the Respondents to effect the divestiture of FreeHand within six (6) months after the Acquisition
is consummated. The Order requires that prior to divesting FreeHand the Respondents shall take all necessary actions
to maintain the viability and marketability of FreeHand.

The proposed Order would also prohibit the Respondents, for a period of ten (10) years from the date the proposed Order
becomes final, from acquiring, without the prior approval of the Commission, any stock, share capital, equity or
other interest in any concern engaged in the development or sale of professional illustration software native to
the Macintosh or Power Macintosh; or any such professional illustration software or any exclusive license to such
professional illustration software, the purchase price of which is $2 million or more.

It is anticipated that the proposed Order would resolve the competitive problems alleged in the Complaint. The purpose
of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official
interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment 



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from American Institute of Smoking
Cessation, Inc. (hereinafter ``AISC''), its President, Kenneth C. Grossman, and its Vice-President, Jane A. Grossman,
marketers of The Grossman Method seminar, a single, three-hour, group hypnosis session program for smoking cessation
and weight loss. The Grossman Method seminar is offered to the public nationwide by Kenneth C. Grossman at hotel locales.


The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for the reception of comments by
interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)
days, the Commission will again review the agreement and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order. 

The Commission's complaint charges that the proposed respondents deceptively advertised: (1) The likelihood of
seminar participants' success in achieving abstinence from smoking cigarettes and weight loss; and (2) the effectiveness
of proposed respondents' smoking cessation methods in leading consumers to achieve smoking abstinence compared
to other stop-smoking methods. 



Success 



The complaint against AISC, Kenneth C. Grossman and Jane A. Grossman alleges that the proposed respondents failed
to possess a reasonable basis for claims they made regarding the success of their seminar participants in quitting
smoking and quickly achieving weight loss, and made a false claim about smoking abstinence success. Through advertisements
placed in various media in advance of their seminars, proposed respondents represented that surveys prove that 97
to 100 percent of their seminar participants permanently abstain from smoking after attending those seminars. The
complaint alleges that this claim is false. 

Proposed respondents further represented through their advertisements, including the use of consumer endorsements,
that seminar participants: (1) Typically are cured of smoking addiction and permanently abstain from smoking cigarettes;
(2) are cured of smoking addiction without experiencing irritability, anxiety or weight gain; and (3) typically
achieve weight loss quickly. Finally, proposed respondents represented that over 300,000 seminar participants
have permanently quit smoking as a result of attending the Grossman Method seminar over the last fifteen years, and
that up to or over 98% of consumers attending The Grossman Method seminar have quit smoking. 

The Commission believes that these success claims for seminar attendees' smoking cessation and weight loss are deceptive
because proposed respondents did not posses adequate substantiation for those claims at the time they made the claims.


The proposed consent order seeks to address the alleged success misrepresentations cited in the accompanying complaint
in five ways. First, the order (Part I.B.) requires proposed respondents to possess a reasonable basis consisting
of competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any claim about the performance or efficacy of any
smoking cessation or weight loss program. 

Second, the proposed order (Part I.A.) prohibits proposed respondents from representing that seminar participants
are cured of smoking addiction without experiencing side effects, such as irritability, anxiety or weight gain,
unless the claim is substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. 

Third, the proposed order (Part I.C.) prohibits proposed respondents from representing through any endorsements
that seminar participants have achieved success in smoking abstinence or weight loss unless the claimed success
is representative of the typical or ordinary experience of all such participants, and competent and reliable scientific
evidence substantiates that claim, or respondents clearly and prominently disclose either: (1) What the generally
expected results would be for program participants, or (2) the limited applicability of the endorser's experience
to what consumers may generally expect to achieve, that is, that consumers should not expect to achieve similar results.


Fourth, the proposed order (Part I.D.) generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting the existence,
contents, validity, results, conclusions, or interpretations of any test, study, survey or report.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940805-2-00046 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940805-2-00031 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Finally, the proposed order (Part I.E.) generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting the performance
or efficacy of any smoking cessation or weight loss program.



Efficacy



The Commission's complaint further alleges that proposed respondents failed to possess a reasonable basis for a
claim they made regarding the relative ability of their hypnosis program to lead consumers to quit smoking. AISC,
Kenneth C. Grossman and Jane A. Grossman represented through their advertising that their single-session, group
hypnosis seminar is more efficacious for smoking cessation than other stop-smoking methods. The Commission believes
that this comparative efficacy claim for proposed respondents' hypnosis program is deceptive because proposed
respondents at the time they made the claim did not possess adequate substantiation for the claim.

To address this efficacy misrepresentation, the proposed order (Part I.B.) requires proposed respondents to possess
and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any representation about the relative
(or absolute) performance or efficacy of any smoking cessation (or weight loss) program, before they make such a claim.
The proposed order (Part I.E.) further generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting the performance
or efficacy of any smoking cessation program (or weight loss program).

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order, or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis to Aid Public Comment on the Provisionally Accepted Consent Order


The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted for public comment, from Boulder Ridge Cable TV (``Boulder
Ridge''), Dean Hazen, Weststar Communications, Inc., and Rodney A. Hansen (collectively ``the parties''), an agreement
containing consent order. This agreement has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of
comments from interested persons.
Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received, and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's order.
The Commission's investigation of this matter concerns a non-competition and non-disclosure agreement signed
by the parties in connection with the acquisition of Three Palms, Ltd. (``Three Palms''), by Boulder Ridge. Boulder
Ridge and Three Palms operated competing cable companies in Ridgecrest, California. The parties own and operate
multiple cable systems in California and Hawaii.
The agreement containing consent order, if finally issued by the Commission, would settle charges that the mutual
agreement not to compete between Boulder Ridge and Three Palms appears to restrain competition unreasonably and
bears no reasonable relation to the Ridgecrest market interests of the buying firm. The Commission has reason to believe
that the agreement would affect competition for cable television services adversely and would violate Section 5
of the Federal Trade Commission Act, unless an effective remedy eliminates such anticompetitive effects.
The order accepted for public comment would require the parties to cease and desist from enforcing any rights they
may have under Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the agreement not to compete. The order also would ban the parties from entering
into similar agreements in the future by prohibiting them from agreeing not to compete in any geographic area unrelated
to the cable system or systems being sold. This would bar any unreasonable broad covenant not to compete but would provide
an exception for an agreement made in connection with the sale of a cable television system or cable television service
in which the parties agree not to compete with one another in a geographic area that is reasonably related to the cable
television system or cable television service that is being acquired or sold.
The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the consent order. This analysis is not intended
to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and order or to modify their terms in any way.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of period for public comment on petition to modify or vacate consent order.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (``C&H''), a respondent in Docket No. C-2858, is subject to an order
prohibiting it from representing that its granulated sugar is different or superior unless: (a) Such difference
or superiority relates to a consumer use of such sugar which is specified in the advertisement; (b) such difference
or superiority is substantiated; and (c) such substantiation includes competent and reliable evidence that the
difference or superiority is discernible to or of benefit to the class of consumers to whom the representation is directed.
C&H filed a petition on July 20, 1994, requesting that the Commission reopen and modify the order to allow C&H
to advertise any truthful, nondeceptive difference between its sugar and competing sugar (other than a difference
relating to health, safety, nutritional quality, or purity) without relating it to a specific consumer use and proving
its discernibility or benefit. In the alternative, C&H requests that the Commission either modify the order
to allow C&H to advertise any truthful, nondeceptive difference between its sugar and competing sugar that is
substantiated by competent and reliable evidence or that it vacate the order. This document announces the public
comment period on this petition.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The order in Docket No. C-2858 was published at 42 FR 6800 on February 4, 1977, reported at 89 F.T.C. 15. C&H
argues that significant changes in constitutional law and Commission policy since 1976 justify reopening the docket
and modifying the order. C&H maintains that the U.S. Supreme Court has extended First Amendment protection to
purely commercial speech and views as particularly suspect prohibitions on expression such as those in the order.
C&H also contends that the burden of proof in restricting commercial speech lies with the party seeking to restrict
it and that the Commission has provided no evidence that the order directly advances its interests in a reasonable
manner. In addition, C&H argues that since 1976 the Commission altered its position concerning truthful comparative
advertising and now actively encourages such advertising. C&H notes that since 1976 the Commission has adopted
a ``reasonable consumer'' standard. C&H also contends that the public interest justifies reopening and setting
aside the order because consumers have a constitutional right to receive uncensored distribution of truthful information.
Furthermore, C&H maintains that market efficiency requires that consumers be given access to truthful information
and that the order improperly discriminates among competitors. The petition was placed on the public record on July
27, 1994.

Analyis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment 



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Gorayeb Seminars, Inc. (hereinafter
``GSI''), Gorayeb Learning Systems, Inc. (hereinafter ``GLS'') and their President, Ronald B. Gorayeb, marketers
of The Gorayeb Method seminar, a single, two-hour, group hypnosis session program for smoking cessation and weight
loss. The Gorayeb Method seminar is offered to the public nationwide by Ronald B. Gorayeb at hotel locales. 

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for the reception of comments by
interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)
days, the Commission will again review the agreement and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order. 

The Commission's complaint charges that the proposed respondents deceptively advertised: (1) The likelihood of
seminar participants' success in achieving and maintaining abstinence from smoking cigarettes and weight loss;
and (2) the effectiveness of proposed respondents' weight-loss programs in leading consumers to achieve and maintain
weight loss compared to other weight-loss methods. 



Success 



The complaint against GSI, GLS and Ronald B. Gorayeb alleges that the proposed respondents failed to possess a reasonable
basis for claims they made regarding the success of their seminar participants in quitting smoking and achieving
and maintaining weight loss. Through advertisements placed in various media in advance of their seminars, proposed
respondents represented that seminar participants: (1) Are cured of smoking addiction and permanently abstain
from smoking cigarettes; (2) are cured of smoking addiction without experiencing withdrawal, anxiety or weight
gain; and (3) achieve and maintain weight loss. Proposed respondents further represented that thousands of consumers
have permanently quit smoking and thousands have achieved and maintained weight loss as a result of attending The
Gorayeb Method seminars. 

The Commission believes that these success claims for seminar attendees' smoking cessation, weight loss and maintenance
of achieved weight loss are deceptive because proposed respondents did not possess adequate substantiation for
those claims at the time they made the claims. 

The proposed consent order seeks to address the alleged success misrepresentations cited in the accompanying complaint
in three ways. First, the order (Part I.B.) requires proposed respondents to possess a reasonable basis consisting
of competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any claim about the performance or efficacy of any
smoking cessation or weight loss program. 

Second, the proposed order (Part I.A.) prohibits proposed respondents from representing that seminar participants
are cured of smoking addiction without experiencing side effects, such as withdrawal, anxiety or weight gain, unless
the claim is substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. 

Finally, the proposed order (Part I.C.) generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting the performance
or efficacy of any smoking cessation or weight loss program. 



Efficacy 



The Commission's complaint further alleges that proposed respondents failed to possess a reasonable basis for a
claim they made regarding the relative ability of their hypnosis program to lead consumers to achieve and maintain
weight loss. GSI, GLS and Ronald B. Gorayeb represented through their advertising that their single-session, group
hypnosis seminar is more efficacious for weight loss and weight-loss maintenance than other weight-loss methods.
The Commission believes that this comparative efficacy claim for proposed respondents' hypnosis program is deceptive
because proposed respondents at the time they made the claim did not possess adequate substantiation for the claim.


To address this efficacy misrepresentation, the proposed order (Part I.B.) requires proposed respondents to possess
and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any representation about the relative
(or absolute) performance or efficacy of any weight loss program (or smoking cessation program), before they make
such a claim. The proposed order (Part I.C.) further generally prohibits proposed respondents from misrepresenting
the performance or efficacy of any weight loss program (or smoking cessation program). 

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order, or to modify in any way their terms.

SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Stepan Co. has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0409) proposing
that a medium chain triglyceride containing caprylic and capric acids be affirmed as generally recognized as safe
(GRAS) for use in food as a direct human food ingredient. The petitioner proposes that captrin be the common or usual
name for this triglyceride.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201(s) and 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 321(s) and 348(b)(5)) and the
regulations for affirmation of GRAS status in  170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Stepan Co., 100 West
Hunter Ave., Maywood, NJ 07607, has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0409) proposing that a medium chain triglyceride containing
caprylic and capric acids be affirmed as GRAS for use in food as a direct human food ingredient. The petitioner proposes
that captrin be the common or usual name for this triglyceride. 


The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in   170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and 170.35 is filed by the
agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition
for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation.
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact
statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding
of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
Interested persons may, on or before October 4, 1994, review the petition and file comments with the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments should be filed and should be identified with the docket number

helpful in determining whether captrin is, or is not, GRAS for the proposed use. In addition, consistent with the regulations
promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency encourages public participation
by review of and comment on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice.
A copy of the petition (including the environmental assessment) and received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management

organization (FQHMO), our regulations set forth at 42 CFR 417.144(e), promulgated under title XIII of the Public
Health Service Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 300e), require publication in the 

Federal Register

 of the names, addresses, and descriptions of the service areas of new FQHMOs. We interpret this requirement as applying
to revisions of service areas of currently approved FQHMOs, as well. Our last notice containing this information
was published on April 20, 1994 (59 FR 1021). 
There are three categories of FQHMOs: operational qualified, transitional qualified, and preoperational qualified.
These terms are defined in 42 CFR 417.141. 
HCFA has determined that the following entity is an operational FQHMO under section 1310(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 300e-9(d))
and has expanded its previously qualified service area: 


Expansion and Addition of Service Area Regional Components by Existing FQHMOs 
Intergroup Prepaid Health Services (Intergroup) 



(Individual Practice Association Model; Requirements are set forth at sections 1302(5) and 1310(b)(2)(a) of the
Act), 1010 N. Finance Center Drive, Suite 200, Tucson, Arizona 85710. Intergroup's approved Federally qualified
expansion includes the remainder of Pinal County and the entire Counties of Santa Cruz, Cochise, Gila, Graham, and
Greenlee. Date of qualification for service area expansion: 
March 3, 1994. 


B. Compliance Actions 


HCFA gives notice of compliance actions affecting FQHMOs. No compliance actions occurred during 
January 1, 1994 through March 31, 1994. 


C. Availability of Additional Information 


A cumulative list of FQHMOs and additional information 
may be obtained by writing to the following address: 
Health Care Financing Administration, 
Office of Managed Care, Room 4406 Cohen Building, 
330 Independence Avenue, SW., 
Washington, DC 20201. 
The list also may be obtained by visiting that office between the hours of 8:30 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. Monday through Friday,
except for Federal holidays. Interested persons should contact Margie Sharif for an appointment by telephoning

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice lists HCFA manual instructions, substantive and interpretive regulations and other 

Federal Register

 notices, and statements of policy that were published during January, February, and March of 1994 that relate to the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Section 1871(c) of the Social Security Act requires that we publish a list of Medicare
issuances in the 

Federal Register

 at least every 3 months. Although we are not mandated to do so by statute, for the sake of completeness of the listing,
we are including all Medicaid issuances and Medicare and Medicaid substantive and interpretive regulations (proposed
and final) published during this timeframe. 


We are also providing the content of revisions to the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual published between January 1,
and March 31, 1994. On August 21, 1989 (54 FR 34555), we published the content of the Manual and indicated that we will
publish quarterly any updates. Adding to this listing the complete text of the changes to the Medicare Coverage Issues
Manual allows us to fulfill this requirement in a manner that facilitates identification of coverage and other changes
in our manuals.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Program Issuances 


The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is responsible for administering the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
which pay for health care and related services for 36 million Medicare beneficiaries and 33 million Medicaid recipients.
Administration of these programs involves (1) Providing information to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients,
health care providers, and the public; and (2) effective communications with regional offices, State governments,
State Medicaid Agencies, State Survey Agencies, various providers of health care, fiscal intermediaries and carriers
who process claims and pay bills, and others. To implement the various statutes on which the programs are based, we
issue regulations under authority granted the Secretary under sections 1102, 1871, and 1902 and related provisions
of the Social Security Act (the Act) and also issue various manuals, memoranda, and statements necessary to administer
the programs efficiently. 
Section 1871(c)(1) of the Act requires that we publish in the 

Federal Register

 at least every 3 months a list of all Medicare manual instructions, interpretive rules, statements of policy, and
guidelines of general applicability not issued as regulations. We published our first notice June 9, 1988 (53 FR 21730).
Although we are not mandated to do so by statute, for the sake of completeness of the listing of operational and policy
statements, we are continuing our practice of including Medicare substantive and interpretive regulations (proposed
and final) published during the 3-month timeframe. Since the publication of our quarterly listing on June 12, 1992
(57 FR 24797), we decided to add Medicaid issuances to our quarterly listings. Accordingly, we are listing in this
notice Medicaid issuances and Medicaid substantive and interpretive regulations published from January 1 through
March 31, 1994. 


II. Medicare Coverage Issues 


We receive numerous inquiries from the general public about whether specific items or services are covered under
Medicare. Providers, carriers, and intermediaries have copies of the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual, which identifies
those medical items, services, technologies, or treatment procedures that can be paid for under Medicare. On August
21, 1989, we published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 34555) that contained all the Medicare coverage decisions issued in that manual. 
In that notice, we indicated that revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual will be published at least quarterly in the


Federal Register

. We also sometimes issue proposed or final national coverage decision changes in separate 

Federal Register

 notices. Readers should find this an easy way to identify both issuance changes to all our manuals and the text of changes
to the Coverage Issues Manual. 
Revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual are not published on a regular basis but on an as-needed basis. We publish revisions
as a result of technological changes, medical practice changes, responses to inquiries we receive seeking clarifications,
or the resolution of coverage issues under Medicare. If no Coverage Issues Manual revisions were published during
a particular quarter, our listing will reflect that fact. 
Not all revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual contain major changes. As with any instruction, sometimes minor clarifications
or revisions are made within the text. We have reprinted manual revisions as transmitted to manual holders. The new
text is shown in italics. We will not reprint the table of contents, since the table of contents serves primarily as
a finding aid for the user of the manual and does not identify items as covered or not. 


III. How to Use the Addenda 


This notice is organized so that a reader may review the subjects of all manual issuances, memoranda, substantive
and interpretive regulations, or coverage decisions published during the timeframe to determine whether any are
of particular interest. We expect it to be used in concert with previously published notices. Most notably, those
unfamiliar with a description of our Medicare manuals may wish to review Table I of our first three notices (53 FR 21730,
53 FR 36891, and 53 FR 50577) and the notice published March 31, 1993 (58 FR 16837), and those desiring information on
the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual may wish to review the August 21, 1989, publication (54 FR 34555).

To aid the reader, we have organized and divided this current listing into five addenda. Addendum I identifies updates
that changed the Coverage Issues Manual. We published notices in the 

Federal Register

 that included the text of changes to the Coverage Issues Manual. These updates, when added to material from the manual
published on August 21, 1989, constitute a complete manual as of March 17, 1994. Parties interested in obtaining a
copy of the manual and revisions should follow the instructions in section IV of this notice.

Addendum II identifies previous 

Federal Register

 documents that contain a description of all previously published HCFA Medicare and Medicaid manuals and memoranda.

Addendum III of this notice lists, for each of our manuals or Program Memoranda, a HCFA transmittal number unique to
that instruction and its subject matter. A transmittal may consist of a single instruction or many. Often it is necessary
to use information in a transmittal in conjunction with information currently in the manuals.

Addendum IV lists all substantive and interpretive Medicare and Medicaid regulations and general notices published
in the 

Federal Register

 during the quarter covered by this notice. For each item, we list the date published, the 

Federal Register

 citation, the title of the regulation, the Parts of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) which have changed (if applicable),
the agency file code number, the ending date of the comment period (if applicable), and the effective date (if applicable).

Addendum V sets forth the revisions to the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual that were published during the quarter
covered by this notice. For the revisions, we give a brief synopsis of the revisions as they appear on the transmittal
sheet, the manual section number, and the title of the section. We present a complete copy of the revised material,
no matter how minor the revision, and identify the revisions by printing in italics the text that was changed. If the
transmittal includes material unrelated to the revised section, for example, when the addition of revised material
causes other sections to be repaginated, we do not reprint the unrelated material.



IV. How To Obtain Listed Material

<TEXT>
 

HCFA's laws, regulations, and manuals are now available on CD-ROM, which may be purchased from GPO or NTIS on
a subscription or single copy basis. The Superintendent of Documents list ID is HCLRM, and the stock number is 717-139-00000-3.
The following material is contained on the CD-ROM disk:

 Titles XI, XVIII, and XIX of the Act.

 HCFA-related regulations.

 HCFA manuals and monthly revisions.

 HCFA program memoranda.

The titles of the Compilation of the Social Security Laws are current as of the September 1, 1992. The remaining portions
of CD-ROM are updated on a monthly basis.

The CD-ROM disk does not contain Appendices M (Interpretative Guidelines for Hospices) and R (Resident Assessment
for Long Term Care Facilities) of the State Operations Manual. Copies of these appendices may be reviewed at a Federal
Depository Library (FDL).

Any cost report forms incorporated in the manuals are included on the CD-ROM disk as LOTUS files. LOTUS software
is needed to view the reports once the files have been copied to a personal computer disk.



V. How To Review Listed Material



Transmittals or Program Memoranda can be reviewed at a local FDL. Under the FDL program, government publications
are sent to approximately 1400 designated libraries throughout the United States. Interested parties may examine
the documents at any one of the FDLs. Some may have arrangements to transfer material to a local library not designated
as an FDL. To locate the nearest FDL, individuals should contact any library.

In addition, individuals may contact regional depository libraries, which receive and retain at least one copy of
most Federal government publications, either in printed or microfilm form, for use by the general public. These libraries
provide reference services and interlibrary loans; however, they are not sales outlets. Individuals may obtain
information about the location of the nearest regional depository library from any library.

Superintendent of Documents numbers for each HCFA publication are shown in Addendum III, along with the HCFA publication
and transmittal numbers. To help FDLs locate the instruction, use the Superintendent of Documents number, plus the
HCFA transmittal number. For example, to find the Carriers Manual, Part 3_Claims Process (HCFA-Pub. 14-3)
transmittal entitled ``Claims Involving Patients Who Have Elected Hospice Care,'' use the Superintendent of Documents
No. HE 22.8/7, and the HCFA transmittal number 1475.



VI. General Information



It is possible that an interested party may have a specific information need and not be able to determine from the listed
information whether the issuance or regulation would fulfill that need. Consequently, we are providing information
contact persons to answer general questions concerning these items. Copies are not available through the contact
persons. Copies can be purchased or reviewed as noted above.

Addendum V_Medicare Coverage Issues Manual  


(For the reader's convenience, new material and changes to previously published material are in italics. If any part
of a sentence in the manual instruction has changed, the entire line is shown in italics. The transmittal includes
material unrelated to revised sections. We are not reprinting the unrelated material.)

 

Transmittal No. 67; section 50-5, Thermography. CHANGED Procedures_Effective Date: Services Furnished
on or  
After 12/21/92.  
Section 50-5, Thermography._This section excludes from coverage the use of thermography for all indications.
Do not open previously processed claims. However, if individual claims are brought to your attention, reopen and
process them retroactively to December 21, 1992.  
50-5 Thermography (Effective for services performed on and after December 21, 1992.  
Thermography is the measurement of self-emanating infrared radiation that reveals temperature variations at the
surface of the body. The thermographic device senses body temperature and demonstrates areas of differing heat emission
by producing brightly colored patterns. Each color represents a specific temperature level. Interpretation of
these color patterns according to designated anatomic distribution is thought to aid in diagnosing a vast array of
diseases.  
Thermography for any indication (including breast lesions which were excluded from Medicare coverage on July 20,
1984) is excluded from Medicare coverage because the available evidence does not support this test as a useful aid
in the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury. Therefore, it is not considered effective. This exclusion was
published as a HCFA Final Notice in the Federal Register on November 20, 1992.  
Transmittal No. 67; Section, 60-14, Infusion Pumps. CHANGED Implementing Instruction_Effective Date: For
services performed on or after 03/04/94.  
Section 60-14, Infusion Pumps, has been revised to provide for coverage of implantable infusion pumps for use
in the treatment of spasticity and chronic intractable pain of malignant or nonmalignant origin, if specified patient
selection criteria are met.  
This section has also been revised to permit coverage of other uses of an implantable infusion pump if the pump is being
used to administer a drug that is included as an indicated use on the pump's approved labelling and the contractor's
medical staff determines that such is reasonable and necessary for an individual patient.  


60-14 Infusion Pumps  


The Following Indications For Treatment Using Infusion Pumps Are Covered Under Medicare:  
A. External Infusion Pumps._ 
1. Iron Poisoning (Effective for Services Performed On or After 9/26/84)._When used in the administration of deferoxamine
for the treatment of acute iron poisoning and iron overload, only external infusion pumps are covered.  
2. Thromboembolic Disease (Effective for Services Performed On or After 9/26/84)._When used in the administration
of heparin for the treatment of thromboembolic disease and/or pulmonary embolism, only external infusion pumps
used in an institutional setting are covered.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940805-2-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940805-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. Chemotherapy for Liver Cancer (Effective for Services Performed On or After 1/29/85)._The external chemotherapy
infusion pump is covered when used in the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma or colorectal cancer where
this disease is unresectable or where the patient refuses surgical excision of the tumor.  
 
4. Morphine for Intractable Cancer Pain (Effective for Services Performed On or After 4/22/85)._Morphine infusion
via an external infusion pump is covered when used in the treatment of intractable pain caused by cancer (in either
an inpatient or outpatient setting, including a hospice).  
 
Other uses of external infusion pumps are covered if the contractor's medical staff verifies the appropriateness
of the therapy and of the prescribed pump for the individual patient.

 
 



Note: 

Payment may also be made for drugs necessary for the effective use of an external infusion pump as long as the drug being
used with the pump is itself reasonable and necessary for the patient's treatment.

 
 

B. Implantable Infusion Pumps._ 
 
1. Chemotherapy for Liver Cancer (Effective for Services Performed On or After 9/26/84)._The implantable infusion
pump is covered for intra-arterial infusion of 5-FUdR for the treatment of liver cancer for patients with primary
hepatocellular carcinoma or Duke's Class D colorectal cancer, in whom the metastases are limited to the liver, and
where (1) the disease is unresectable or (2) where the patient refuses surgical excision of the tumor.  
 


2. Anti-Spasmodic Drugs for Severe Spasticity._An implantable infusion pump is covered when used to administer
anti-spasmodic drugs intrathecally (e.g., baclofen) to treat chronic intractable spasticity in patients who have
proven unresponsive to less invasive medical therapy as determined by the following criteria:  
 
 As indicated by at least a 6-week trial, the patient cannot be maintained on noninvasive methods of spasm control,
such as oral anti-spasmodic drugs, either because these methods fail to control adequately the spasticity or produce
intolerable side effects, and  
 
 Prior to pump implantation, the patient must have responded favorably to a trial intrathecal dose of the anti-spasmodic
drug.

<PARENT> FR940805-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. Opioid Drugs for Treatment of Chronic Intractable Pain._An implantable infusion pump is covered when used to administer
opioid drugs (e.g., morphine) intrathecally or epidurally for treatment of severe chronic intractable pain of malignant
or nonmalignant origin in patients who have a life expectancy of at least 3 months and who have proven unresponsive
to less invasive medical therapy as determined by the following criteria:  
 
 The patient's history must indicate that he/she would not respond adequately to non-invasive methods of pain
control, such as systemic opioids (including attempts to eliminate physical and behavioral abnormalities which
may cause an exaggerated reaction to pain); and  
 
 A preliminary trial of intraspinal opioid drug administration must be undertaken with a temporary intrathecal/epidural
catheter to substantiate adequately acceptable pain relief and degree of side effects (including effects on the
activities of daily living) and patient acceptance.  
 
4. Coverage of Other Uses of Implanted Infusion Pumps._Determinations may be made on coverage of other uses of implanted
infusion pumps if the contractor's medical staff verifies that:  
 
 The drug is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the individual patient;  
 
 It is medically necessary that the drug be administered by an implanted infusion pump; and  
 
 The FDA approved labelling for the pump must specify that the drug being administered and the purpose for which
it is administered is an indicated use for the pump.  
 
5. Implantation of Infusion Pump Is Contraindicated._The implantation of an infusion pump is contraindicated in
the following patients:  
 
 Patients with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to the drug being used (e.g., oral baclofen, morphine, etc.);
 
 Patients who have an infection;  
 
 Patients whose body size is insufficient to support the weight and bulk of the device; and  
 
 Patients with other implanted programmable devices since crosstalk between devices may inadvertently change
the prescription. 

 
 



Note:

 Payment may also be made for drugs necessary for the effective use of an implantable infusion pump as long as the drug
being used with the pump is itself reasonable and necessary for the patient's treatment.

 
 

The following indications for treatment using infusion pumps are not covered under medicare:  
 
A. External Infusion Pumps._ 
 
1. Diabetes (Effective for Services Performed On or After 1/29/85)._The use of an external infusion pump for the subcutaneous
infusion of insulin in the treatment of diabetes is not covered.  
 
B. Implantable Infusion Pump._  
 
1. Thromboembolic Disease (Effective for Services Performed On or After 9/26/84)._According to the Public Health
Service, there is insufficient published clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the heparin implantable
pump. Therefore, the use of an implantable infusion pump for infusion of heparin in the treatment of recurrent thromboembolic
disease is not covered.  
 
Transmittal No. 68. Section 50-32. CHANGED IMPLEMENTATION Instructions_Effective Date: For Services Performed
on or After 03/17/94.  
 
Section 50-32, Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA), is revised to provide for additional coverage
of this procedure. PTA coverage is expanded to include treatment of atherosclerotic obstructions of vessels in the
upper extremities. The upper extremities do not include head or neck vessels. Clarification is made that PTA is covered
in the treatment of obstructive lesions of the arteriovenous dialysis fistulas through either an arterial or a venos
approach.  
 


50-32 Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA)  
 




This procedure involves inserting a balloon catheter into a narrow or occluded blood vessel to recanalize and dilate
the vessel by inflating the balloon. PTA is covered to treat the following indications:  
 
 Atherosclerotic obstructive lesions:

^ In the lower extremities, i.e., the iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries, or in the upper extremities, i.e., the
innominate, subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries. The upper extremities do not include head or neck vessels.
 
^ Of a single coronary artery for patients for whom the likely alternative treatment is coronary bypass surgery and
who exhibit the following characteristics:  


#

 Angina refractory to optimal medical management;  




#

 Objective evidence of myocardial ischemia; and  




#

 Lesions amenable to angioplasty;  


^ Of the renal arteries for patients in whom there is an inadequate response to a thorough medical management of symptoms
and for whom surgery is the likely alternative. PTA for this group of patients is an alternative to surgery, not simply
an addition to medical management.  
 Obstructive lesions of arteriovenous dialysis fistulas and grafts when performed through either a venous
or arterial approach.  
PTA is not covered to treat obstructive lesions of the carotid, vertebral and cerebral arteries. 

The safety and efficacy of these procedures have not been established.  
 
Transmittal No. 69. Section 50-13. Changed Implementing Instructions_Effective Date: Services performed
on or after 03/22/94.  
 
Section 50-13, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, provides for coverage of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose
disc disease without regard to whether radiologic imaging has been tried first to diagnose the problem.  


50-13 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Effective for services performed on or after 11-22-85.)
 


Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), formerly called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), is covered under Medicare
when furnished as described below for the types of covered conditions described in this instruction.  
A. General  
1. Method of Operation._Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive method of graphically representing the distribution
of water and other hydrogen-rich molecules in the human body. In contrast to conventional radiographs or CT scans,
in which the image is produced by X-ray beam attenuation by an object, MRI is capable of producing images by several
techniques. In fact, various combinations of MR image production methods may be employed to emphasize particular
characteristics of the tissue or body part being examined. The basic elements by which MRI produces an image are the
density of hydrogen nuclei in the object examined, their motion, and the relaxation times, the period of time required
for the nuclei to return to their original states in the main, static magnetic field after being subjected to a brief
additional magnetic field. These relaxation times reflect the physical-chemical properties of tissue and the molecular
environment of its hydrogen nuclei. Only hydrogren atoms are present in human tissues in sufficient concentration
for current use in clinical MRI.  
2. General Clinical Utility._Overall, MRI is a useful diagnostic imaging modality that is capable of demonstrating
a wide variety of soft-tissue lesions with contrast resolution equal or superior to CT scanning in various parts of
the body.  
Among the advantages of MRI are the absence of ionizing radiation and the ability to achieve high levels of tissue contrast
resolution without injected iodinated radiological contrast agents. Recent advances in technology have resulted
in development and FDA approval of new paramagnetic contrast agents for MRI which allow even better visualization
in some instances. Multislice imaging and the ability to image in multiple planes, especially sagittal and coronal,
have provided a flexibility not easily available with other modalities. Because cortical (outer layer) bone and
metallic prostheses do not cause distortion of MR images, it has been possible to visualize certain lesions and body
regions with greater certainty than has been possible with CT. The use of MRI on certain soft tissue structures for
the purpose of detecting disruptive, neoplastic, degenerative, or inflammatory lesions has now become established
in medical practice.  
B. Covered Clinical Applications._Although several uses of MRI are still considered investigational and some uses
are clearly contraindicated (see subsection D), MRI is considered medically efficacious for a number of uses. Use
the following descriptions as general guidelines or examples of what may be considered covered rather than as a restrictive
list of specific coverages. Coverage is limited to MRI units which have received FDA premarket approval, and such
units must be operated within the parameters specified by the approval. As with all items and services, the services
must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the specific patient involved.  
MRI is useful in examining the head, central nervous system, and spine. Multiple sclerosis can be diagnosed with MRI
and the contents of the posterior fossa are visible. The inherent tissue contrast resolution of MRI makes it an appropriate
standard diagnostic modality for general neuroradiology.

MRI can assist in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal and retroperitoneal masses, including abnormalities
of the large vessels such as aneurysms and dissection. When a clinical need exists to visualize the parenchyma of solid
organs to detect anatomic disruption or neoplasia, this can be accomplished in the liver, urogenital system, adrenals,
and pelvic organs without the use of radiological contrast materials. When MRI is considered reasonable and necessary,
the use of paramagnetic contrast materials may be covered as part of the study. MRI may also be used to detect and stage
pelvic and retroperitoneal neoplasms and to evaluate disorders of cancellous bone and soft tissues. It may also be
used in the detection of pericardial thickening.  
 
Primary and secondary bone neoplasm and aseptic necrosis can be detected at an early stage and monitored with MRI.
Patients with metallic prostheses, especially of the hip, can be imaged in order to detect the early stages of infection
of the bone to which the prothesis is attached.  
 


Effective for services provided on or after 03/22/94 MRI may also be covered to diagnose disc disease without regard
to whether radiological imaging has been tried first to diagnose the problem.  
 
C. Gating Devices and Surface Coils (Effective for Services On or After 

3/04/91)._Gating devices which eliminate distorted images caused by cardiac and respiratory movement cycles are
now considered state of the art techniques and may be covered. Surface and other specialty coils may also be covered,
as they are used routinely for high resolution imaging where small limited regions of the body are studied. They produce
high signal-to-noise ratios resulting in images of enhanced anatomic detail.  
 


D. Contraindications and Non-Covered Uses._ 
 
1. Contraindications._MRI is not covered when the following patient-specific contraindications are present.
It is not covered for patients with cardiac pacemakers or with metallic clips on vascular aneurysms. MRI during a viable
pregnancy is also contraindicated at this time. The danger inherent in bringing ferromagnetic materials within
range of MRI units generally constrains the use of MRI on acutely ill patients requiring life support systems and monitoring
devices which employ ferromagnetic materials. In addition, the long imaging time and the enclosed position of the
patient may result in claustrophobia, making patients who have a history of claustrophobia unsuitable candidates
for MRI procedures.  
 
2. Non-Covered Uses._Several uses of MRI have been identified as investigational and are not covered. These include
measurement of blood flow and spectroscopy. In addition, MRI is not suitable for the imaging of cortical bone and calcifications
and for procedures involving spatial resolution of bone or calcifications.

<DOCTITLE>Interagency Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Animal Damage Control and National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) Compliance </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management; Interior. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice and request for comment. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS), are planning to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that recognizes APHIS
as the lead Federal agency for the conduct of animal damage management on lands administered by the BLM. Specifically,
the MOU assigns responsibility for carrying out animal damage management (ADM) primarily for protection of livestock,
including compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the issuance of records of decision to
APHIS. Under the current MOU, BLM and APHIS divide ADM responsibilities, with BLM preparing site-specific environmental
analyses. The proposed MOU recognizes the State's responsibilities for management of resident wildlife populations
and the need for communication among the parties, the States, and other affected agencies such as the Forest Service.





Implementation of this MOU will place responsibilities where they logically belong and streamline the conduct of
ADM. It will allow BLM to focus money and time on its own responsibilities and initiatives and allow APHIS to better
carry out its responsibilities under the Animal Damage Control Act in compliance with NEPA. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 7, 1993, Vice President Gore issued the National Performance Review report which detailed the re-invention
of government with a focus on streamlining and an overall reduction in management. This MOU pursues both those goals
by consolidating responsibilities for ADM in APHIS, thereby avoiding redundancy and expense. 




Background 




The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), 43 U.S.C. section 1701 

et seq.

, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to manage the public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained
yield. The Secretary, in managing the public lands, is subject to other applicable law, such as the Animal Damage Control
Act. The FLPMA also allows the Secretary to permit other Federal agencies to use public lands through cooperative
agreements. 43 U.S.C. 1732. The FLPMA does not enlarge or diminish the responsibility and authority of the States
for management of fish and resident wildlife. 43 U.S.C. 1737. However, the Secretary may designate areas of the public
lands where hunting and fishing are not allowed for reasons of ``public safety, administration or compliance with
provisions of applicable law.'' 43 U.S.C. 1732(b) 


The Animal Damage Control Act, 7 U.S.C. section 426, 426(b), gives the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to conduct
campaigns for the destruction or control of predatory animals on public and private lands. 7 U.S.C. 426, 426(b). It
also provides that the Secretary may cooperate with public agencies, States and others. Id. 


The purpose of this MOU is to consolidate program responsibility for ADM for protection of livestock with APHIS. Currently,
APHIS creates an ADM plan and submits it to BLM. The BLM is then responsible for preparing environmental analyses (EA's)
and records of decision authorizing APHIS's action on BLM lands. This dual-agency process is cumbersome for both
agencies, unnecessary, and expensive. It places BLM in the position of analyzing the environmental consequences
of another agency's action on public lands and issuing a record of decision to allow APHIS's action to occur. 


Beginning in 1991 and extending through 1993, many administrative appeals were filed with the Interior Board of Land
Appeals challenging the legal sufficiency of BLM's NEPA documentation on the APHIS's activities. In response, BLM
issued an Instruction Memorandum in 1993 (IM No. 93-199), ordering all field offices to allow full, programmatic
animal damage control only where NEPA documentation was complete and up to date. (The directive did not affect case-by-case
emergency control, based on proof of kill.) The BLM continues to work on updating every District's EA and to deal with
administrative appeals and Federal Court litigation on both sides of the issue for a program it does not administer.
This process is an inefficient way of carrying out APHIS's mandate under the Animal Damage Control Act. By transferring
NEPA compliance and decisionmaking authority to the action agency, administrative efficiency will be enhanced,
and costs reduced. 


The following is the draft MOU on which the public may comment:

MASTER MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING between the ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT
OF AGRICULTURE and the BUREAU of LAND MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR 



This MASTER MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) is made and entered into by and between the UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT
OF THE INTERIOR, BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT, hereinafter referred to as the BLM, and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,
ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE, hereinafter referred to as APHIS-ADC. 



I. Purpose 



The purpose of this MOU is to: (1) identify responsibilities in compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) of the respective agencies and foster a partnership in discharging the Federal obligation under the Animal
Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931 (46 Stat. 1468, 7 U.S.C. 426-426b), as amended, for the management of wild
vertebrates causing damage on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act (FLPMA) 43 U.S.C. Section 1201 et seq.; (2) establish general guidelines to assist field personnel
in carrying out their animal damage management (ADM) responsibilities consistent with the policies of BLM and APHIS-ADC;
(3) strengthen the cooperative approach to ADM on BLM lands through exchange of information and mutual program support;
and (4) reaffirm working relationships with State governments. 




II. Statement of Mutual Interest and Responsibilities 



The parties recognize the importance of effective ADM on lands under the administrative jurisdiction of the BLM,
including control of predation by individual animals or local populations to achieve land and resource management
objectives. Further, it is mutually recognized that the tools and procedures available for managing populations
must be used in a professional manner according to a plan developed in compliance with NEPA, the Endangered Species
Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and the Animal Damage Control Act. 

Both agencies have an interest in limiting damage caused by and to wildlife, so as to protect other multiple-use values.
They also agree that in evaluating the need for, and in conducting ADM programs, multiple-use values must be considered.


The parties also recognize that: 

A. The BLM administers public lands located primarily in the Western States and Alaska amounting to about 270 million
acres. These lands and resources are managed under multiple-use principles providing for a variety of uses, including
timber harvesting, recreation, livestock grazing, mining and mineral development and fish and wildlife habitat
management under the laws of Congress and regulations of the Department of the Interior. 

B. The States are responsible for managing the resident wildlife within their respective borders on land owned by
the United States, including lands within the jurisdiction of the BLM. For purposes of this agreement, the term ``wildlife''
shall not include wild horses or burros, as defined in Public Law 92-195 dated December 15, 1971. The State responsibilities
include regulation of wildlife populations so the habitat on public lands will ensure productivity for future wildlife
populations. 

C. The APHIS-ADC is the agency with the authority and expertise under the Animal Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931,
as amended, and the Rural Development, Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1988 for providing
ADM services. This includes maintaining technical expertise in the science of ADC, control tools and techniques;
conducting ADM research and management programs, and ensuring NEPA compliance on activities related to predator
control primarily for livestock protection on public lands. 

TO IMPLEMENT THE FOREGOING, the parties agree as follows where BLM lands are involved: 


III. The BLM Shall 



A. Cooperate with APHIS-ADC in the development and annual review of ADM plans affecting BLM lands and resources on
those lands and ensure that they are consistent with FLPMA. 
B. Provide information to APHIS-ADC as to where control actions should be prohibited or restricted for public safety
reasons relating to resource management plans conformance. 
C. When requested, provide information and assistance to APHIS-ADC during the NEPA process. 
D. Complete NEPA compliance for nonpredator ADM activities initiated by BLM to protect natural resources and facilities.



IV. The APHIS-ADC Shall 


A. Evaluate ADM needs in cooperation with State agencies and permittees.

B. Develop and update ADM annual plans in cooperation with the appropriate State and Federal agencies, permittees,
and others. Cooperate with the BLM to identify human safety zones and other areas where mitigation or restriction
may be needed to comply with BLM's Resource Management Plans. 

C. Complete necessary NEPA documents and decision records on the ADM plans. 

D. Conduct ADM on BLM lands in accordance with APHIS-ADC policies, consistent with BLM resource management
plans. 

E. Provide the BLM with technical information on recommended ADM tools and techniques, when requested. 



V. It is Mutually Agreed By the Parties That 




A. The parties will participate, as needed, in State ADM agreements with the appropriate State and Federal agencies.


B. The parties will ensure interagency coordination and review of the effects of predator control activities on BLM
lands and resources before APHIS-ADC makes decisions on predator control plans. 

C. The parties will meet on a State or regional basis, as needed, to coordinate ADM operations. Representation shall
be by the BLM State Director and the APHIS-ADC Regional Director, State Director of State Wildlife Agencies,
State Department of Agriculture, and Regional Forester of the Forest Service or their designated representatives.


D. The parties will elevate any problems regarding implementation of this agreement that cannot be resolved to the
next higher level for resolution. 

E. Nothing in this MOU is intended to modify in any manner the present cooperative programs of either Agency with States,
other public agencies, or educational institutions. 

F. This MOU shall supersede the existing MOU between APHIS-ADC and BLM and supplements and amendments thereto
relating to the conduct of ADM programs by the parties. 

G. This MOU is neither a fiscal nor a funds obligation document. Any endeavor involving reimbursement or contribution
of funds between the parties to this MOU will be handled in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and procedures
including those for Government procurement and printing. Such endeavors will be outlined in separate agreements
that shall be made in writing by representatives of the parties and shall be independently authorized by appropriate
statutory authority. This MOU does not provide such authority. 

H. Nothing in this memorandum shall obligate either the BLM or APHIS-ADC to expend appropriations or to enter
in any contract or other obligations. 

I. All ADM programs on BLM lands will be coordinated with appropriate State and Federal agencies. 

This MOU may be modified or amended upon written consent of both parties or may be terminated with 30-day written notice
of either party.

Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Patoka River National Wetlands Project.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has prepared a Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS), which is available for public review. The FEIS evaluates a proposal to establish the Patoka
River National Wetlands Project in Pike and Gibson Counties in southwest Indiana.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FEIS evaluates a proposal to establish the Patoka River National Wetlands Project in Pike and Gibson Counties
in southwest Indiana. Four alternatives, including a No Action alternative are being considered. The three action
alternatives are aimed at protecting and enhancing the valuable resources of the Patoka River valley. The Project
encompasses one of the last remaining stretches of bottomland forest in Indiana and the Midwest. It provides some
of the best wood duck production habitat in the State and is used by threatened and endangered species including bald
eagles and Indiana bats. Alternative 4 is the Service's preferred alternative. It proposes to acquire 22,083 acres
of land from willing sellers. Full acquisition may take 20 years or more. 6,800 acres would be purchased as the Patoka
River National Wildlife Refuge and Wildlife Management Areas would be purchased from within an adjacent 15,283-acre
selection area. Project lands would be managed to protect and enhance bottomland hardwood forests, other wetland
habitats, and complementary uplands. The goal would be to provide essential food, cover and resting areas for migratory
birds, threatened and endangered species, and resident fish and wildlife; and to improve outdoor recreation and
education opportunities for the American people. Copies of the FEIS have been sent to all landowners within the proposed
Project boundaries; to federal, state and local government officials; interested parties; and to all individuals,
agencies, and organizations who requested copies.

Burlington Northern Inc. and Burlington Northern Railroad Company_Control and Merger_Santa Fe Pacific Corporation
and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company 


<AGENCY>

 Interstate Commerce Commission.


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of prefiling notification and request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to 49 CFR 1180.4(b), applicants have notified the Commission of their intent to file an application seeking
authority for Burlington Northern Inc.'s acquisition of control of and merger with Santa Fe Pacific Corporation,
the result in a common control of Burlington Northern Railroad Company and The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway
Company by the merged company, and the merger of the two railroad entities. The Commission finds this to be a major transaction
as defined in 49 CFR Part 1180. Applicants have proposed an accelerated procedural schedule, on which the Commission
invites comments by interested persons.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 8, 1994, Burlington Northern Inc. (BNI), Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN), Santa Fe Pacific Corporation
(SFP), and The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe) (collectively, applicants) filed a notice
of intent indicating that they will file an application seeking Commission approval and authorization under 49 U.S.C.
11343-47 for: (1) BNI's acquisition of control of and merger with SFP; (2) the resulting common control of BN
and Santa Fe by the merged company; and (3) the merger of the two railroad entities. 



Under an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 29, 1994, BNI and SFP have agreed that SFP will merge with and into BNI
in accordance with Delaware law. The merger is subject to certain conditions, including Commission approval. During
the pendency of the Commission's review of the application, BNI and SFP, including their carrier subsidiaries, will
continue to operate as independent companies, each headquartered in its current city and operating under the direction
of its current board and management. Upon Commission approval, SFP will be merged with and into BNI, which will be the
surviving company and will change its name to Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. Each share of SFP common stock
will be exchanged for 0.27 of a share of newly issued BNI common stock. 

Following the merger of BNI and SFP, the merged company will directly control both BN and Santa Fe, and the operations
of the two railroads will be fully integrated pursuant to that common control. Applicants also are seeking authority
to merge the two railroad legal entities. 

Applicants will use the year 1993 for purposes of their impact analyses to be filed in the application. Applicants
anticipate filing their application approximately 3 to 4 months after the July 8, 1994 filing of this Notice. 

The Commission finds that this is a major transaction, as defined at 49 CFR 1180.2(a), as it is a control and merger transaction
involving two or more class I railroads. The application must conform to the regulations set forth at 49 CFR Part 1180
and must contain all information required therein for major transactions, except as modified by any advance waiver.
The carriers are also required to submit maps with overlays that show the existing routes of both carriers and their
competitors. 

By petition also filed July 8, 1994, applicants sought a protective order to protect confidential, highly confidential,
and proprietary information, including contract terms, shipper-specific traffic data, and other traffic data
to be submitted in connection with the control application. A protective order was entered in a decision served July
15, 1994. 

Also on July 8, 1994, applicants filed a petition to establish a proposed procedural schedule.

 The Commission seeks comments now on applicants' proposed procedural schedule. Applicants' proposed procedural
schedule is as follows:

Under the proposal, immediately upon each evidentiary filing, the filing party will place all documents relevant
to the filing (other than documents that are privileged or otherwise protected from discovery) in a depository open
to all parties, and will make its witnesses available for discovery depositions. Access to documents subject to protective
order will be appropriately restricted. Parties seeking discovery depositions may proceed by agreement. Relevant
excerpts of transcripts will be received in lieu of cross-examination at the hearing, unless cross-examination
is needed to resolve material issues of disputed fact. Discovery on responsive applications will begin immediately
upon their filing. The Chief Administrative Law Judge will have the authority: (1) to revise the schedule as may appear
necessary; and (2) initially to resolve any discovery disputes. The dates for filing post-hearing briefs and for
oral argument before the Commission will be set upon completion of oral hearing before the Chief Administrative Law
Judge. 

The proposed schedule contains substantially shorter time periods than those provided for in our rules at 49 CFR 1180.4(a)-(e).
For example, 1180.4(e) which tracks the statute at 49 U.S.C. 11345(b)(3), requires that the evidentiary proceedings
for a major transaction be completed in 24 months after acceptance of the primary application, with a final decision
to be issued within 180 days thereafter. 

We invite interested persons to submit written comments on the proposed procedural schedule. Comments must be filed
by August 22, 1994. Applicants may reply by September 1, 1994.


 

Decided: July 29, 1994.

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.



Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.



Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

Environmental Assessment Finding of No Significant Impact Related to Amendment of Materials License No. SUB-1357,
Chemetron Corporation, Inc., Cuyahoga Heights, OH




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering issuing an amendment of Materials License No. SUB-1357,
held by Chemetron Corporation, Inc., to authorize the remediation of the McGean-Rohco Complex buildings and equipment
located at 2910 Harvard Avenue in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio. 



Environmental Assessment 


Background 



By the letter of March 24, 1994, Chemetron Corporation, Inc. (Chemetron) requested that NRC amend their license to
authorize them to perform the remediation of the Harvard Avenue and Bert Avenue sites in accordance with their remediation
plan entitled, ``Site Remediation Plan Chemetron Remediation Project Harvard and Bert Avenue Sites Chemetron Corporation,
Inc. Newburgh Heights, Ohio,'' dated October 1, 1993, November 1, 1993, and November 11, 1993. By letter of April 4,
1994, Chemetron requested that the NRC separately review the sections of the remediation plan pertaining to the McGean-Rohco
buildings, located at 2910 Harvard Avenue, in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio. Chemetron indicated that they wished to initiate
the remediation of these buildings as quickly as possible. 



Proposed Action 


The proposed action is the issuance of a license amendment authorizing Chemetron to perform remediation of the McGean-Rohco
Complex buildings located at 2910 Harvard Avenue in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio. 



Need for Proposed Action 


The purpose of the proposed action is to decommission the McGean-Rohco Complex buildings, by removing depleted uranium
contamination on building surfaces and in equipment, so that the buildings and equipment can be released for unrestricted
use. These buildings are currently in use by McGean-Rohco, Inc. personnel. Remediating the buildings will allow
McGean-Rohco to utilize the buildings and equipment without the radiological controls and training requirements
that are currently required. 



Environmental Assessment 


The NRC staff reviewed the levels of contamination, the proposed remediation methods, and radiological and environmental
controls that will be used during the remediation. These controls include worker dosimetry, the As Low As Reasonably
Achievable (ALARA) program, area air monitoring, routine surveys, a bioassay program for workers, and routine monitoring
of both airborne and liquid effluent releases to meet 10 CFR Part 20 requirements. Worker and public doses will be limited
so that exposures will not exceed 10 CFR Part 20 requirements. Chemetron proposed to remediate building surfaces
and equipment to the levels in ``Guidelines for Decontamination of Facilities and Equipment Prior to Release for
Unrestricted Use of Termination of Licenses for Byproduct, Source, or Special Nuclear Material,'' dated August
1987.

In Chemetron's remediation plan, Chemetron proposed to dispose of protective clothing, equipment, and roofing
wastes, generated in the McGean-Rohco remediation, by disposing them either at a licensed low-level radioactive
waste disposal site. Contaminated building materials, such as bricks, blocks, and concrete, would be disposed of
in the disposal cell being proposed for the Harvard Avenue site. By letter of July 8, 1994, Chemetron proposed to store
wastes, generated in the McGean-Rohco Complex remediation, in Building 16. On July 29, 1994, Chemetron proposed
to also use Building 14 for waste storage. While wastes are in storage, Buildings 14 and 16 will be secured and monitored.


Expected release to airborne and liquid pathways, as well as other environmental impacts will be small and acceptable.


The NRC requested a review by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office (OHPO) of the McGean-Rohco Complex. In the OHPO
letter of June 14, 1994, they concluded that the project, if completed as proposed, would have no effect on properties
listed on or eligible for the National Register of Historical Places. 



Conclusions 



The proposed remediation of the McGean-Rohco Complex buildings will enable Chemetron to release buildings and equipment,
currently being used by McGean-Rohco, Inc., for unrestricted use, and enable McGean-Rohco, Inc. personnel access
to these areas without having radiological controls or training requirements. On the basis of the NRC staff's evaluation
of Chemetron's proposed remediation approach for the McGean-Rohco Complex, and analysis of the environmental impacts
of the proposed action, the staff concludes that the proposed remediation activities will not result in any significant
environmental or radiologic impact. 




Alternatives to the Proposed Action 



Leaving the depleted uranium contamination in place is the only alternative to the proposed action. This alternative
would result in the necessity of keeping radiological controls and training requirements. Without remediation
of the contamination, industrial incidents, such as the chemical explosion that occurred in December 1993, could
cause releases of radioactive material and increased costs to remediate the contaminated areas. 



Alternative use of Resources 



The activities leading to the proposed action would result in the irreversible use of energy resources in the conduct
of the proposed McGean-Rohco Complex remediation. A small amount of land at the waste disposal sites would be irreversibly
committed for waste disposal. There are no reasonable alternatives to these resource uses, and the proposed activities
do not involve any unresolved conflicts concerning uses of available resources. 



Agencies and Persons Consulted, and Sources Used



The EA was prepared by NRC staff. The Cuyahoga County Board of Health, and the Ohio Department of Health reviewed the
proposed remediation plan. Neither of these agencies had comments applicable to the McGean-Rohco Complex decommissioning
activities. The OHPO reviewed applicable documents and photographs to assess eligibility for the National Register
of Historical Places, and concluded that the proposed action would have no effect on properties listed on or eligible
for the National Register of Historical Places.




Finding of No Significant Impact 


The NRC staff prepared this EA evaluating the environmental impacts related to the license amendment requested from
Chemetron Corporation, Inc., to authorize the remediation of the McGean-Rohco Complex buildings and equipment.
This EA examines the radiological impacts associated with these proposed activities. As indicated above the EA did
not identify any significant environmental impact associated with these proposed license amendment actions, the
staff concluded that a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is justified and appropriate. 



Opportunity for a Hearing 


On April 11, 1994, the NRC published in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of Consideration of Amendment to Chemetron Corporation License and Opportunity for Hearing. In response
to this notice, the Earth Day Coalition submitted a petition for hearing. The proceeding is currently before the Presiding
Officer.

<DOCTITLE>Draft Policy Statement on Agreement State Program </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Draft policy statement on Agreement State Program. 





The Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff is releasing the proposed policy statement on the Agreement State Program
for public comment. The draft policy statement establishes Agreement State program principles, and describes the
respective roles and responsibilities of the NRC and the States in the administration of this program, which is authorized
by Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Agreement States are States which have assumed regulatory
authority from NRC over the possession and use of certain radioactive materials. 

On August 25, 1993, the Commission requested the NRC staff to recommend improvements to the NRC's Agreement States
Program to assure adequate protection of the public health and safety. This draft policy statement responds to the
first area the Commission requested be considered, ``improvements in guidance and principles of operations for
the Agreement State Program.'' This draft document is an ``umbrella'' policy statement which will serve as broad
guidance in delineating the NRC's and the State's respective responsibilities and expectations. In this regard,
the NRC especially requests comments on the following: 




The Commission has proposed that the categories of findings made about adequacy of an Agreement State's program be
Adequate, Marginally Adequate and Inadequate. For the Marginally Adequate finding, the NRC action could be either
(a) followup reviews, or (b) probation with followup reviews, depending on whether or not NRC were confident that
the State would address the program deficiencies in an expeditious and effective manner. Comment is requested as
to whether these three categories are appropriately and sufficiently descriptive of the performance, or whether
the ``Marginally Adequate'' category needs to be subdivided such that States placed on probation are not identified
in the same category as those which are not placed on probation. 




In addition to the draft proposed ``Statement of Principles and Policy For the Agreement State Program,'' a document
provided to the Commission entitled ``Specific Review Area Recommendations,'' and draft internal procedures on
the NRC process to be applied when a State agreement is suspended or terminated, also are being made available for public
comment. We also request specific comments on the use of 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart L ``Informal Hearing Procedures for
Adjudications in Materials and Operator Licensing Proceedings'' for suspension and termination decisions, in
lieu of the hearing procedures detailed in the internal procedures published with this Notice for suspension and
termination of an agreement, sections V and VI, respectively. 

The staff is soliciting comments from the Agreement States and the public at this informal stage by publishing the
documents and also placing them in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Public Document Room located at 2120 L Street,
NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Comment period expires October 4, 1994. Comments received after this date will
be considered if it if practical to do so, but the Commission is able to assure consideration only for comments received
on or before this date. Mail written comments to: Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C.
20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch. Deliver comments to: 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland,
between 7:45 am and 4:15 pm on Federal workdays. For further information contact Ms. Maria Lopez-Otin, Federal Liaison,
Office of State Programs, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 504-2598.
Once the comments are received, the staff will develop a final draft of the policy statement for Commission review.
After obtaining Commission approval, the proposed policy statement will once again be issued for a final round of
public comment. 

Two other policy statements continue to be applicable, in large part, but future revisions to these existing policy
statements will be necessary to reflect the new ``umbrella'' policy statement. The two existing policy statements
are: ``Criteria for Guidance of States and NRC in Discontinuance of NRC Regulatory Authority and Assumption Thereof
by States Through Agreement'' (46 FR 7540; January 23, 1981 as amended by policy statements published at 46 FR 36969;
July 16, 1981 and 48 FR 33376, July 21, 1983) and ``NRC Review of Agreement State Radiation Control Programs, Final
General Statement of Policy'' (57 FR 22495; May 28, 1992). 

This draft statement of policy does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (434 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

I. Purpose 



The purpose of this Statement of Principles and Policy is to clearly describe the respective roles and responsibilities
of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and States in the administration of programs carried out under Section
274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Section 274 provides broad authority for the NRC to establish Federal
and State cooperation in the administration of regulatory programs for the protection of public health and safety
in the industrial, medical, and research uses of nuclear materials. 

This policy statement addresses the Federal-State interaction under the Atomic Energy Act to: (1) establish and
maintain agreements with States under section 274(b) to provide for discontinuance by the NRC, and the assumption
by the State, of responsibility for administration of a regulatory program for the use of byproduct, source, and small
quantities of special nuclear material; and (2) guide post-agreement interactions to ensure that NRC and Agreement
State radiation control programs are coordinated and compatible and that Agreement State programs continue to ensure
adequate protection of the public health and safety. 

This policy statement establishes principles, objectives, and goals that should be reflected in the implementing
guidance and programs of the NRC and Agreement States to meet their respective program responsibilities and which
should be achieved in the administration of these programs. 



II. Statement of Legislative Intent 



The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 did not specify a role for the States in regulating the use of nuclear materials. Many States
were concerned as to what their responsibilities in this area might be and expressed interest in seeing that the boundaries
of Federal and State authority were clearly defined. This need for clarification was particularly important in view
of the fact that although the Federal government retained sole responsibility for protecting the public health and
safety from the radiation hazards of byproduct, source, and special nuclear material, the responsibility for protecting
the public from the radiation hazards of other sources such as x-ray machines and radium had for many years been borne
by the States. 

Consequently, in 1959 Congress enacted Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act to establish a statutory framework under
which States could assume certain regulatory jurisdiction over byproduct, source, and special nuclear material
in quantities less than a critical mass. The primary purpose of the legislation was to authorize the Commission to
relinquish to the States its regulatory authority over the use of these materials. The Commission retained regulatory
authority over the licensing of certain facilities and activities such as nuclear reactors, larger quantities of
special nuclear material, and the export and import of nuclear materials. 

In considering the legislation, Congress recognized that the Federal government would need to assist the States
to ensure that they developed the capability to exercise their regulatory authority in a competent and effective
manner. Accordingly, the legislation authorized the Commission to provide training and other services to State
officials and employees. However, in rendering this assistance, the Congress did not intend that the Commission
would provide any grants to a State for the administration of a State regulatory program. This was fully consistent
with the objectives of Section 274 to qualify States to assume independent regulatory authority over certain defined
areas of regulatory jurisdiction and to permit the Commission to discontinue its regulatory responsibilities in
those areas. 

In order to relinquish its authority to a particular State, the Commission must find that the program is compatible
with the Commission's program for the regulation of radioactive materials and that the State program is adequate
to protect the public health and safety. In addition, the Commission has an obligation to review existing Agreement
State programs to ensure continued adequacy and compatibility. Section 274(j) of the Act provides that the NRC may
terminate or suspend all or part of its agreement with a State if the Commission finds that such termination is necessary
to protect the public health and safety or the State has not complied with the provisions of Section 274(j). In these
cases, the Commission must offer the State reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing. In addition, the Commission
may temporarily suspend all or part of an agreement in the case of an emergency situation.

III. Principles of Program Implementation 



III.1. Regulatory Program Excellence 



The principles of excellence contained in this section provide a common philosophical basis on which Agreement States
and NRC regulatory programs should be formulated and implemented. NRC and the Agreement States should strive for
excellence in the administration of their programs and in their collective efforts to establish a credible, coherent,
consistent program for the regulation of Atomic Energy Act materials throughout the United States. Both the NRC and
the Agreement States should continually improve their regulatory program effectiveness and efficiency based on
their respective and collective experience. Excellence in radiation safety regulation should include striving
to improve assurance of the adequacy of public health and safety. In order to achieve excellence, the highest standards
of public accountability, ethical conduct, and professionalism should be applied to individual and organizational
performance. 

Regulatory decisions and actions should be developed and implemented in an open and publicly credible manner and
should be able to withstand scrutiny. Such scrutiny should be welcomed by the regulator. The regulator should be,
and appear to be, independent and impartial in its actions and free from pressure and inappropriate influences from
the regulated community. Regulations and regulatory decisions should be based on assessments of the best available
information from affected and interested individuals and organizations, as well as on the best available knowledge
from research and operational experience. Significant decisions should be documented with the rationale for such
decisions explained. The public should have an opportunity for early involvement in significant regulatory program
decisions. Where several effective alternatives are available, the alternative that best assures safety while
considering differing views should be adopted, considering the resources needed to implement that alternative.
Regulations should be necessary, or appropriate, to assure safety, and should be clear, coherent, logical, and practical.
Regulatory actions should be fully consistent with regulations and good public policy and should lead to stability
and predictability in the planning and implementation of radiation control programs. 

Failure to adhere to these principles of excellence in the conduct of operations should be a sufficient reason for
a regulatory program to self-initiate program changes that will result in needed improvements. There is an obligation
by all involved to identify and express concerns relating to a program that appears to be operating contrary to these
principles of excellence. 

It is not intended that these principles of excellence be established as formal criteria against which NRC and Agreement
State programs would be assessed. Rather, the expectation is that these principles will be incorporated into the
day-to-day operational fabric of NRC and Agreement State materials programs. These principles should be used in
the formulation of policies and programs, implementation of those policies and programs, and assessments of program
effectiveness. Application of these principles will ensure that complacency will be minimized, that adequate levels
of protection of public health and safety are being provided, and that government employees tasked with the responsibility
for these Federal and State regulatory programs serve the public in an effective, efficient, and responsive manner.
These principles are primarily for the use of materials program managers and staff in the self assessment of their
programs and to use in the establishment of goals and objectives for the continual improvement of their respective
programs. However, in the normal conduct of NRC Region and Agreement State formal program performance reviews, any
deficiencies that indicate the program is not adhering to these principles of excellence should be noted. 



III.2. Coherent National Program 



NRC acknowledges its responsibility to ensure that there is a coherent national radiation control program and NRC
through this program establishes national radiation protection standards. The basic elements of such a program
include ability to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety, compatibility in areas of national
interest, sufficient flexibility to accommodate local needs and conditions, ability to assess program performance
on a consistent and systematic basis, and excellence in program administration. 

Each of these elements is reflected and addressed in specific sections of this policy statement.

III.3. Adequate to Protect the Public Health and Safety 


NRC and Agreement State radiation control programs share a responsibility to ensure adequate protection of the public
health and safety in the administration of their respective regulatory programs controlling the uses of nuclear
materials and facilities. Accordingly, NRC and Agreement State programs shall possess the requisite supporting
legislative authority, implementing organization structure and procedures, and financial and human resources
to effectively administer a radiation control program that ensures adequate protection of the public health and
safety. 


III.4. Compatible in Areas of National Interest 


NRC and Agreement State radiation control programs share a responsibility to ensure that a consistent and compatible
radiation control program is administered. Such a radiation protection program should be based on a common regulatory
philosophy including use of common definitions and standards. It should not only be effective, and cooperatively
implemented by NRC and the Agreement States, but also should provide uniformity and consistency in program areas
having national significance. 
Such areas include those affecting interstate commerce, movement of goods and provision of services. Also necessary
is the ability to communicate using a nationally accepted set of terms with common understanding, the ability to ensure
an adequate level of protection of public health and safety that is consistent and stable across the nation, and the
ability of NRC and each Agreement State to evaluate the effectiveness of the national radiation control program.
States will not have the flexibility to deviate from the program elements that the Commission requires for compatibility.



III.5. Flexibility 


With the exception of national radiation protection standards, to the extent possible, Agreement State radiation
control programs should be provided with flexibility in program implementation to accommodate individual State
preferences, State legislative direction, and local needs and conditions. However, the exercise of such flexibility
should not bar or preclude, or effectively preclude, a practice authorized by the Atomic Energy Act, and in the national
interest. That is, a State would have the flexibility to design its own program, including incorporating more stringent
requirements provided that the requirements for adequacy are still met, and the more stringent requirements do not
preclude or effectively preclude a practice within the national interest without an adequate public health and safety
or environmental basis. 


IV. New Agreements 
IV.1. Overall Process of Becoming an Agreement State 


Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act requires that once a decision to seek Agreement State status is made by the State,
the Governor of that State must certify to the NRC that the State desires to assume regulatory responsibility and has
a program for the control of radiation hazards adequate to protect the public health and safety with respect to the
materials within the State covered by the proposed agreement and compatible with the Commission's program. This
certification will be provided in a letter to the NRC which includes a number of documents in support of the certification.
These documents include the State's enabling legislation, the radiation control regulations, a narrative description
of the State program's policies, practices and procedures, and a proposed agreement. 
The NRC has published criteria describing the necessary content these documents are required to cover. The NRC reviews
the request and publishes notice of the proposed agreement in the 

Federal Register

 to provide an opportunity for public comment. After consideration of public comments, if the Commission determines
that the State program is adequate and compatible, and approves the agreement, a formal agreement document is signed
by the Governor and the Chairman of the NRC. 


IV.2. Phased Implementation 


The NRC believes that a formal phased implementation process, during which a State initially assumes authority over
smaller, less complex licenses, would be advantageous to both NRC and the Agreement State. It would provide the NRC
an opportunity to obtain important information on the State's program and validation of the State's capabilities
before turning over a major portion of the program. At the end of the initial phase, the NRC would have greater confidence
in the State's ability to protect the public health and safety and to administratively manage the program. From the
State perspective, it should provide new States an opportunity to work out start up problems with their program prior
to having responsibility for more complex licenses. 
Therefore, upon the effective date of a full agreement, a mandatory phased implementation process will be used. In
the initial phase, the State will assume full regulatory authority over categories of licensees programs of lesser
complexity. During this phase, the State will perform all regulatory functions for the transferred licenses. At
the end of this phase, the NRC will evaluate the State program to determine that the State program continues to be adequate
to protect public health and safety and compatible with the Commission's program. If, at the end of the initial implementation
phase, the Agreement State program is adequate and compatible, and the State has demonstrated an ability to assume
authority for more complex licensed activities, the remaining categories of licensees will be transferred to the
State.

V. Mutual Program Assistance 


NRC will provide training and other assistance to States, such as assistance in developing regulations and program
descriptions to help individual States prepare for entrance into Agreements and to help them during transition periods
of assumption of regulatory authority. Following assumption of regulatory authority, NRC will continue to provide
training and other assistance such as review of proposed regulatory changes to help States administer their regulatory
responsibilities. NRC would also use its best efforts to provide specialized technical assistance to Agreement
States to address unique or complex licensing, inspection, and enforcement issues. Similarly, Agreement States
will assist the NRC and other Agreement States in addressing areas where Agreement States have particular expertise
or are in the best position to provide immediate assistance. In addition, NRC and Agreement States shall use their
best efforts to keep each other informed about relevant aspects of their programs. NRC will provide an opportunity
for Agreement States to have early and substantive involvement in rulemaking, policy, and guidance development
activities. Agreement States will provide a similar opportunity to the NRC to make it aware of, and to provide the opportunity
to review and comment on, proposed changes in Agreement State programs, regulations, policies, and regulatory guidance.

Following assumption of regulatory authority by an Agreement State, if it experiences difficulty in program administration,
NRC would use its best efforts to assist the State in maintaining the effectiveness of its radiation control program.
Such assistance could address an immediate difficulty or a chronic difficulty affecting the State's ability to discharge
its responsibility to continue to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety. 


VI. Performance Evaluation 


Under Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, NRC retains authority for ensuring that Agreement State
programs continue to provide adequate protection of the public health and safety. In fulfilling this statutory responsibility,
NRC will provide oversight of Agreement State radiation control programs to ensure that they are adequate and compatible
prior to entrance into a Section 274(b) agreement and that they continue to be adequate and compatible after an Agreement
is effective. NRC, in cooperation with the Agreement States, will establish and implement a performance evaluation
program to provide NRC and Agreement State management with systematic, integrated, and reliable evaluations of
the strengths and weaknesses of their respective radiation safety control programs and identification of areas
needing improvement. 
As a part of this performance evaluation process, NRC will take any necessary actions to ensure that Agreement State
radiation control programs remain adequate and compatible. These actions include: (1) biennial assessments of
Agreement State radiation control programs against established review criteria; (2) provision of assistance to
help address weaknesses or areas within an Agreement State radiation control program requiring improvement; (3)
placing a State on a probationary status for serious program deficiencies that require heightened oversight; (4)
temporary suspension of an agreement and reassertion of regulatory authority in an emergency if an Agreement State
program experiences any immediate program difficulties preventing the State from continuing to ensure adequate
protection of the public health and safety; and (5) suspension or termination of an agreement and reassertion of NRC
regulatory authority if the Agreement State program experiences difficulties which jeopardize the State's ability
to continue to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety. The basis for NRC's actions will be based
on a well defined and predictable process and a performance evaluation program which will be consistently and fairly
applied. 


VII. Levels of Agreement State Program Review Findings 


The following discussion outlines the nature of NRC findings regarding the NRC's Agreement State review process.



Finding 1_Adequate to Protect Public Health and Safety and Compatible 


If the NRC finds that a State program has met all of the Agreement State program review criteria or that only minor deficiencies
exist, the Commission would find that the State's program is adequate to protect the public health and safety. If the
NRC determines that a State program contains all required NRC program elements for compatibility, or only minor discrepancies
exist, the program would be found compatible. 


Finding 2_Marginally Adequate

1




If the NRC finds that a State program protects public health and safety, but is deficient in meeting some of the review
criteria, the NRC may find that the State's program is marginally adequate. The NRC would consider in its determination
plans that the State has to address any of the deficiencies noted during the review. In cases where less significant
Agreement State deficiencies previously identified have been uncorrected for a significant period of time, NRC
may also find that the program is marginally adequate. 




Finding 3_Inadequate to Protect Public Health and Safety and/or not Compatible 


If the NRC finds that a State program is significantly deficient in some or all of the review criteria, the NRC would
find that the State's program is not adequate to protect the public health and safety. If the NRC determines that a State,
after a substantial period of time, has either failed to adopt a significant item(s) of compatibility or has failed
to adopt several of the required compatibility items, or has refused to revise state regulations which are inconsistent
with the required NRC compatibility elements, the program would be found not compatible. 


VIII. NRC Actions as a Result of These Findings 


The following discussion outlines the options available to the NRC as a result of making any of the above findings.
None of these actions are automatic. The appropriate action will be determined on a case-by-case basis by NRC management.

<PARENT> FR940805-2-00056 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Letters 


In all cases, subsequent to an Agreement State program review, the findings would be recounted in a letter to senior
level State management. In the event that the NRC finds that a State program is adequate and compatible, no further
action would be required. In the case where minor deficiencies are noted, the State would be requested to describe
their proposed corrective action. If the corrective action appears appropriate, no further NRC review is required.
If additional clarification of the corrective actions is needed, additional correspondence may be necessary. 


Follow-up Reviews 


In the event that deficiencies are noted during the program review, NRC may increase the frequency of contacts with
the State to keep abreast of developments and conduct onsite follow-up reviews to assure that progress is being made
on correcting program deficiencies. If, during follow-up reviews, it is shown that the State has taken corrective
actions, a letter finding the State adequate and compatible would be provided. 


Probationary Status 


There are three circumstances which can lead to a marginally adequate or incompatible State program being placed
in a probationary status: (1) There are cases in which program deficiencies may be serious enough to require immediate
heightened oversight; (2) In other cases, Agreement State program deficiencies previously identified may have
been uncorrected for a significant period of time; and (3) If the NRC determines that a State program has been late in
adopting either a significant item(s) of compatibility or has not adopted several of the required compatibility
elements. If the NRC was not confident that the State would address the program deficiencies in an expeditious and
effective manner, the Commission would place the State program on probation. 
As a result of placing a State program on probation, the NRC would communicate its findings to a higher level of State
management. Notice of such probationary status would normally be addressed to the Governor of the State. Notice would
also be published in the 

Federal Register

. A copy of the letter to the Governor would be placed in the Public Document Room and a press release would be issued.

Once a State program is placed on probation, the NRC would heighten its oversight of the program. This would include
obtaining commitments from the State in the form of a management plan to describe actions to be taken by the State to
address the program deficiencies, including specific goals and milestones. The NRC would increase observation
of State program activities under the Agreement to assure adequate protection of the public health and safety. In
some cases, the NRC would consider providing technical support for the maintenance of the regulatory program. The
probationary period would last for a specified period of time. This period would not normally be more than one year,
but could be extended based on extenuating circumstances. At the end of that time, if the State has not addressed the
deficiencies, the NRC would institute suspension or termination proceedings. 


Suspension 


Section 274j of the Atomic Energy Act gives the Commission authority to suspend all or part of its agreement with a State
if the suspension is required to protect the public health and safety, or if the State has not complied with one or more
of the requirements of the Act. In cases where the Commission finds that program deficiencies related to either adequacy
or compatibility are such that the Commission must take action due to a lack of confidence in the State's ability to
protect the public health and safety, the Commission would suspend all or part of its agreement with the State. If the
situation is not resolved, termination will be considered. 
Before reaching a final decision on suspension, the Commission will notify the State and provide the State an opportunity
for a hearing on the proposed suspension. Notice of the proposed suspension will also be published in the 

Federal Register

. Suspension, rather than termination, would be the preferred option in those cases where the State provides evidence
that the program deficiencies are temporary and that the State is committed to correcting the deficiencies that led
to the suspension. 
In addition to the normal suspension authority, Section 274j.(2) of the Act also addresses emergency situations
and gives the Commission authority to temporarily suspend all or part of its agreement with a State without notice
or hearing if, an emergency situation exists requiring immediate action to protect public health and safety, and
the State has failed to take necessary action within a reasonable time. 


Termination 


Section 274j of the Atomic Energy Act gives the Commission authority to terminate its agreement with a State if such
termination is required to protect the public health and safety, or if the State program has not complied with one or
more of the requirements of the Act (e.g., is found to be not compatible with the Commission's program). When the Commission
finds such significant program deficiencies, the Commission would institute proceedings to terminate its agreement
with the State. 
In cases where a State has failed to respond in an acceptable manner during the probationary period and there is no prospect
for improvement, termination will be considered. Before reaching a final decision on termination, the Commission
will notify the State and provide the State an opportunity for a hearing on the proposed termination. Also, notice
of the proposed termination will be published in the 

Federal Register

. There may be cases where termination will be considered even though the State program has not been placed on probation.

IX. Program Funding 



NRC will continue to provide training and other assistance to Agreement States to the extent permitted by statute
and budgetary resources. Currently, Section 274 does not allow federal funding for the administration of Agreement
State radiation control programs. Section 274 does authorize the NRC to offer training and other assistance to a State
in anticipation of entering into an Agreement with NRC, however, it is NRC practice not to fund the establishment of
new Agreement State programs. 

Given the importance in terms of protection of the public health and safety to have a uniform national program of well
trained radiation control program personnel, the NRC intends to continue funding training and travel for Agreement
State staff. NRC staff would also provide technical assistance to Agreement States to address complex licensing
and compliance issues and other specialized technical assistance. 



X. Regulatory Development 



NRC and Agreement States will cooperate in the development of new regulations and policy. Agreement States will have
early and substantive involvement in the development of new regulations affecting protection of the public health
and safety and of new policy affecting administration of the Agreement State program. Likewise, the NRC expects to
have the States provide it with early and substantive involvement in the development of new Suggested State Regulations.
NRC and Agreement States will keep each other informed about their individual regulatory requirements (i.e., regulations
or license conditions) and the effectiveness of those regulatory requirements so that each has the opportunity to
make use of proven regulatory approaches to further the effective and efficient use of resources. 



XI. Program Evolution 



The NRC-Agreement State program is dynamic and the NRC and Agreement States will continue to jointly assess the overall
national program to identify specific changes which should be considered based on experience or to further improve
overall performance and effectiveness of the national program. The changes considered should include possible
legislative changes. The program should also include the formal sharing of information and views such as briefings
of the Commission by the Agreement States.

Specific Review Area Recommendations 




 Whether two separate policies, one for entering into an agreement and one for evaluation of existing state
programs, are needed. 

The PAG has considered this issue and recommends that a single ``umbrella'' policy covering the NRC and Agreement
State Program be issued. The existing policy statements that address entering into an Agreement and the evaluation
of State programs will be modified or converted to procedures. 

 Evaluation of whether a formal transition period should be established during which new Agreement State programs
could be phased gradually. 

The PAG recommendation, which includes a formal transition period for new Agreement State programs, has been incorporated
as section IV of the draft Policy Statement. 

 Reevaluation of the criteria and elements used for adequacy and compatibility reviews so that the less significant
items are eliminated and the focus is on those things which must be complied with to provide reasonable assurance of
adequate protection of the public health and safety. 

The new compatibility policy and criteria are being developed. The pilot program under the Integrated Materials
Performance Evaluation Program (IMPEP) will consist of gathering information on the common performance indicators
in addition to the normal program reviews. Criteria for adequacy are contained in the IMPEP procedures. The PAG will
maintain cognizance of these initiatives and serve as an integrative mechanism. 

 Identification of the information which NRC needs from the Agreement States and establishment of a requirement
for the reporting of such information. In addition, why this information is needed and how it benefits health and safety.


The PAG review of existing Agreements between the NRC and Agreement States found that the Agreements contain a commitment
for the Agreement State and the NRC to use their best efforts to keep each other informed on regulatory changes to assure
that the State and Commission programs are coordinated and compatible. Currently, representatives of the Agreement
States and NRC staff in AEOD, OSP, and NMSS are evaluating options for the development of a database on events involving
Atomic Energy Act-regulated materials. The database is intended to provide Agreement State and NRC staffs with information
to assist in the evaluation of regulatory effectiveness, and aid in the prediction of safety trends. 

The PAG will consider the current initiatives to obtain information on events in conjunction with its examination
of the merits of codifying State agreement practices in a new part of the NRC rules and regulations, including the need
to codify a requirement for reporting of event data by Agreement States. The PAG will factor in the information derived
from these initiatives when it examines the codification issue. 

 Identification of the minimum administrative-type provisions the NRC will consider necessary in assessing
the adequacy and compatibility of Agreement State programs. This covers such things as: hearing opportunities,
rulemaking procedures, environmental assessments, the separation of regulatory and promotional responsibilities,
investigative capabilities, enforcement policies, criminal sanctions, and other similar provisions. 

In establishing compatibility criteria, the staff will address these issues. IMPEP is also considering a number
of these areas. The PAG will maintain cognizance of these initiatives and serve as an integrative mechanism. 

 Evaluation of the present practice of placing Agreement State approved devices on the NRC registration list
so that they can be used nationwide. 


OSP, NMSS, and OGC are evaluating the current practice and will provide recommendations to the Commission describing
approaches which will result in improved effectiveness and efficiency in sealed source and device reviews.

 Review and make appropriate recommendations on the adequacy of the documentation and control procedures
currently being used by the NRC for the Agreement State program. 
Although Commission regulations do not specifically impose data reporting requirements on Agreement States, the
NRC criteria for the approval of new programs and the periodic review of existing State programs, necessitate that
a State provide sufficient documentation to the NRC for the evaluation of the program. In addition to the documentation
needed for the NRC to evaluate a State program against the NRC approval or review criteria, existing State programs
routinely submit a wide variety of information and documentation, including copies of licenses and orders issued
by the State, statistical data on licensing and inspection activities, draft and proposed regulations, copies of
sealed source and device registrations, licensing guides, and similar documents. 
The PAG explored the handling of documents generated and received by NRC in relation to Agreement State and State Liaison
program business, e.g., program reviews, followup letters, and other incoming documents and correspondence, as
well as the management of information contained in these documents. OSP has informed the PAG that initiatives have
begun that will improve the document control procedures used by the Office of State Programs. OSP has also initiated
efforts to integrate its document tracking, control, and filing systems with those used throughout NRC. OSP will
establish procedures to assure that appropriate documents are placed in the Public Document Room, use NRC Central
Files as the official agency file for OSP correspondence, and use NUDOCS and RIDS for document distribution and retrieval.
Other program improvements, such as procedures to implement the Integrated Materials Performance Evaluation Program,
will result in satisfactory documentation of the important elements of OSP programs. 
Additionally, OSP, with support from IRM, will establish an INTERNET-based E-mail and file transfer system for use
by NRC and the Agreement States. This system should permit electronic communication between NRC and the Agreement
States. The system will also permit the electronic transfer of large documents between regulators. This system began
operation in May 1994. As a longer term project, OSP and IRM will establish an Agreement State program electronic information
base that will permit faster retrieval and analysis of programmatic information in the future. 
OSP indicates that these documentation and document control improvements should result in assurance that appropriate
OSP documents are available to the public through use of the PDR; provide an administrative resource savings to OSP
by using Central Files, RIDS and NUDOCS; and provide a resource savings to OSP and the Agreement States generally through
(1) greater use of electronic communication, (2) more easily retrievable correspondence through the use of Central
Files and NUDOCS, and (3) electronic retrieval and analysis of electronic data base information. 
 Until performance indicators are in place and provide beneficial regulatory insight, staff should (keeping
in mind the importance of a short turnaround time) provide the Commission with the results of each Agreement State
program evaluation for which a finding is withheld concerning adequacy or compatibility prior to issuing a letter
to the state. 
It is now staff practice to provide the Commission with the results of each Agreement State program evaluation for
which a finding of either adequacy or compatibility is withheld. 
 Propose a method to accelerate the process of issuing letters to States which notify State management of the
status of the State program following NRC's formal review. 
The proposed IMPEP review process is designed to achieve and institutionalize an accelerated procedure for issuing
review letters. The goal is to have letters, which contain factual program review findings, issued in one month. The
PAG agrees with this approach. 
 Determine criteria for placing (or removing) a State program in a status category which would serve to put State
officials and the public on notice that their program is failing to fully meet an acceptable norm for public health
and safety protection or compatibility. 
The PAG's recommendations in this area have been incorporated into the draft Policy Statement, and can be found at
section VIII. 
 Evaluate and propose internal procedures/guidance on the NRC process to take over when a state agreement is
suspended or terminated, in whole or in part, or is temporarily suspended. 
You will find the PAG's proposed internal procedures in the following pages. Note that the concept of a Management
Review Board (MRB) as described in these procedures, is a pilot initiative to evaluate the effectiveness of indicator
information in adequacy and compatibility determinations.

Post Agreement Activities 


Guidelines for Suspension of a Section 274b Agreement 


I. Introduction 


A. This procedure provides the guidelines that will be followed by NRC staff when considering whether or not to exercise
the authority contained in Section 274j(2) of the Atomic Energy Act to suspend an Agreement for a State. 
B. This procedure will not address the emergency situation where there is a danger to the public health and safety.
Guidelines for emergency suspension are found in Procedure 

XXX

.


II. Suspension 


A. Section 274j. of the Atomic Energy Act gives the Commission authority to suspend all or part of its agreement with
a State if the suspension is required to protect the public health and safety, or if the State has not complied with one
or more of the requirements of the Act. In cases where the Commission finds that program deficiencies related to either
adequacy or compatibility are such that the Commission must take action, the Commission will suspend all or part of
its agreement with the State. 
B. Before reaching a final decision on suspension, the Commission will notify the State and provide the State an opportunity
for a hearing on the proposed suspension as discussed in Part VI. Notice of the proposed suspension will also be published
in the 

Federal Register

. Suspension, rather than termination, will be the preferred option in those cases where the State provides evidence
that the program deficiencies are temporary and that the State is committed to implementing program improvements.



III. Management Review Board Role 


A. The Management Review Board (MRB) is responsible for making the adequacy assessment of each Agreement State's
program based on the reviews of the program, using both common performance indicators and non-common performance
indicators and the compatibility determination. The management review board consists of senior NRC managers, or
their designees, to include: 



Executive Director for Operations 
Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards 
Director, Office of State Programs 
Director, Office of Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data 
General Counsel 



B. The MRB will consider the results of the Agreement State review and any other appropriate information in making
a determination of adequacy and compatibility with respect to an Agreement State. MRB meetings to discuss specific
program review findings normally will be open and Agreement States representatives will be invited to attend. MRB
internal deliberations regarding the overall Agreement State program rating may be closed, given the predecisional
nature of those discussions. 
C. If it is the recommendation of the MRB that NRC initiate the proceedings to suspend an Agreement, the Office of State
Programs will be assigned the lead for preparation of the Commission paper. The Commission paper will contain the
information supporting the suspension as described in Part IV, and will assess potential resource implications
of NRC reasserting authority. The Commission paper will be coordinated with OGC, NMSS and the region. 


IV. Staff Work 


A. Before the opportunity for hearing and issuance of the 

Federal Register

 notice, OSP will draft a Commission paper for the signature of EDO on the suspension of regulatory authority in the
State based on the initial recommendations of the MRB. In preparation of the Commission paper, the assigned Project
manager should coordinate with OGC as to the form or type of Commission paper. The draft Commission paper (Appendix
A) should contain the following information:

1. Background information (Appendix B) 
2. MRB recommendations (Appendix C) 
3. Proposed Commission Order Reasserting Authority (Appendix D) 
4. Proposed 

Federal Register

 Notice regarding the Suspension and Reassertion of NRC authority (Appendix E) 
5. Letter to the Governor regarding the Commission decision (Appendix F) 
6. A public announcement to be issued by Public Affairs (Appendix G) 
7. Proposed letters to the appropriate Congressional Committees on the Commission Decision (Appendix H)



V. Hearings 


Before the Commission can suspend a State's program, it must provide reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing
to the State as required by Section 274j(1). Section 274j(1) does not require such a hearing if suspension is requested
by the Governor. 
Before the opportunity for a hearing can arise, the Office of State Programs must submit to the Commission a paper containing
a recommendation to suspend the State program in question. This Commission paper will include the recommendations
of the MRB and any other material pertinent to the staff's recommendation to suspend the Agreement. Before a decision
is made on the OSP recommendation, the Commission must provide the State with notice and an opportunity to request
a hearing on the issue. If the State does not request a hearing, the Commission will make a final decision on the issue.
If the State does request a hearing, the Commission will initiate the hearing process described below. 
The hearing for the suspension of an Agreement State program will be an informal hearing conducted either by the Commission
itself, or at the Commission's discretion, by a Special Agreement State Board appointed by the Commission. In cases
where the Commission determines that a Special Board will be used, the Board will consist of three members: (1) the
chair of the Organization of Agreement States (OAS) (unless the chair is from the State in question, in which case the
Agreement State representative will be the past chair of the OAS); (2) an official from the Office of General Counsel,
and (3) the Deputy Director of an NRC regional office (outside of the region in which the State is located). 
The Commission, or the Special Board, as appropriate, will conduct an informal hearing to address the issues in question.
At the hearing, the NRC staff, representatives of the Agreement State, and interested third parties will have an opportunity
to testify, answer questions from the Special Board, and submit written materials. Third parties may submit written
material to the Special Board and may testify for a limited period of time. After consideration of the issues, the Commission
or the Special Board will issue a decision on suspension. A majority of the Commission or the Special Board will be required
to support a decision. In cases where a Special Board is used, the Commission will have discretion to review the decision
of the Special Board, and either uphold or overturn the Board's decision. 


VI. Additional Coordination During the Suspension 


A. NRC will conduct a meeting with the licensees in the State to explain the reassertion of NRC authority and the present
fee structure. Lead for the meeting should be the Region in consultation with NMSS, OGC and OC. 
B. After the suspension of the Agreement, OSP will prepare a letter to the Department of Labor advising the Department
of the effective date of the termination of the Agreement (Appendix J). 
C. The Regional State Agreements Officer (RSAO) should obtain from the State a computer printout of all specific and
general licenses affected by the suspension of the State's agreement. Mailing labels should be obtained if possible
from the State. A letter should be prepared notifying each licensee of the suspension and reassertion by NRC and appropriate
information (Appendix K). 
D. OSP will prepare a letter to all Agreement and Non-Agreement States notifying them of the effective date of the suspension
and if appropriate, enclosing a copy of the order or 

Federal Register

 notice (Appendix L). 
E. The RSAO will coordinate with the State so that all necessary action is taken to have license files transferred or
made available to the NRC. 


VII. Withdrawal of Suspension/Recommendation for Termination 


A. When the situation requiring the suspension has been corrected or eliminated, the Management Review Board will
consider all factors and recommend to the Commission whether to lift the suspension. 
B. If the situation is not resolved, termination will be considered and the Procedure 

XXX

 for termination should be followed.

Post Agreement Activities 


Guidelines for Emergency Suspension of a Section 274b Agreement 


I. Introduction 


This procedure provides the guidelines that will be followed by NRC staff when considering whether or not to exercise
the authority contained in Section 274j(2) of the Atomic Energy Act. 


II. General 


Section 274j(2) of the Act addresses emergency situations and gives the Commission authority to temporarily suspend
all or part of its agreement with a State without notice or hearing if an emergency situation exists requiring immediate
action to protect public health and safety and the State failed to take steps within a reasonable time. The NRC will
invoke this authority to temporarily suspend all or part of its agreement with an Agreement State only as a last resort,
where an emergency creates a danger to the public health or safety, and the Agreement State has failed to take, or is
prevented from taking, the necessary steps to protect the public health and safety. The Commission will exercise
this authority whenever necessary to contain or eliminate the danger, and only during the period of the emergency.
Prior to any emergency suspension of all or part of the NRC's agreement with a State, the NRC will notify the governor
of the State. The NRC will consider invoking this authority with respect to a single facility or location if the emergency
situation and the criteria of Part V or the guidelines so warrant after considering the factors stated in Part VI. 


III. Emergency 


The NRC recognizes that a severe threat to public health and safety would have to exist before a emergency suspension
of all or part of its agreement with an Agreement State would be invoked. Under existing practices, an Agreement State
could, if necessary, request technical assistance from NRC for a specific emergency situation. NRC continues to
encourage State requests for technical assistance. The exercising of NRC authority to temporarily suspend an agreement
would occur for those highly unusual events which would require prompt remedial action to protect the public health
and safety. 


IV. Initiation of Emergency Suspension Action 


1. Under section 274j(2), if a State requests that the NRC temporarily suspend part of its agreement, the State shall
make the request by telephone call to the Executive Director for Operations (telephone number), in coordination
with the Director of Office of State Program or in off hours, to the NRC Emergency Operation Center, telephone ( ).
Such a request should be made by the Governor, or the Governor's designee, and include the specific nature of the emergency
and its possible impacts as related to the criteria and factors in Parts V and VI below. This request may be made only
by the Agreement State that has regulatory authority under which the licensee is operating when the emergency occurs.

2. When the NRC determines an event warrants emergency suspension of an agreement it will follow the guidelines and
criteria stated in Parts V below. 
3. The Governor and the radiation control program director of the affected State will be consulted and kept fully informed
of the actions taken by the NRC. For events which may warrant consideration of emergency suspension but for which there
is a reasonable basis for presumption that a State can satisfactorily resolve the emergency situation, the NRC will
inform the State of necessary actions that the State should take to avert further consideration of emergency suspension
under section 274j(2) and will provide appropriate technical assistance within the limits of its resources. 
4. The Executive Director for Operations, in consultation with OSP, NMSS, the involved Regional Office and OGC will
issue an order regarding the emergency suspension (Appendix A). The Commission will be kept informed as to the nature
of the emergency situation and the actions taken to contain or eliminate the danger (Appendix B).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940805-2-00107 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940805-2-00056 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

5. A press release regarding the emergency suspension will be prepared and issued by the Office of Public Affairs (Appendix
C).

6. State Programs will coordinate with the Office of Congressional Affairs in order to notify the appropriate State
representatives and congressional committees (Appendix D).

7. Notification to the affected licensee or groups of licensees in the State will be made by the Regions after obtaining
information regarding the affected licensee or groups of licensees from the Agreement State Radiation Control Program
(Appendix E).



V. Minimum Criteria



1. The NRC will consider suspension of an agreement pursuant to Section 274j(2) in the case of an emergency involving
byproduct, source or special nuclear material when the situation presents an immediate, significant, or unacceptable
threat to the public health and safety and immediate action by the Commission is needed because the Agreement State
program is not able to effectively carry out mitigative actions to ensure continued protection of the public health
and safety.

2. In evaluating such emergency situations, the NRC staff will consider whether the Agreement State has failed to
take, or is prevented from taking, necessary steps to protect the public health and safety. Factors the staff would
consider include:

A. The timeliness and adequacy of actions being taken by the State in response to the emergency;

B. Whether the State can satisfactorily resolve the emergency situation; and

C. Whether the State is implementing or is committed to implement program improvements to address systemic deficiencies.

3. The following type of conditions, if not appropriately addressed by the State to prevent the threat or prevent the
threat from recurring, are example candidates that could result in a consideration of emergency suspension:

A. Conditions that caused or threaten to cause individuals to receive a dose exceeding those basic dose limits set
forth in Subpart C of 10 CFR Part 20,

B. Conditions that caused or threaten to cause individual members of the public to receive a dose exceeding those basic
dose limits set forth in Subpart D of 10 CFR Part 20, or

C. Conditions that caused or threaten to cause individuals to receive a dose exceeding those dose limits applicable
to a certain class of licenses set forth in other parts of 10 CFR, such as Part 35 limits for patient release.

D. Conditions specified by the Commission where an emergency has been or appears to need immediate action by the Commission
to protect public health and safety.



VI. Withdrawal of Emergency Suspension



When the emergency situation is contained or eliminated, the EDO will consider all factors and recommend to the Commission
whether to lift the suspension.

The Executive Director for Operations will notify the Governor of the State the emergency suspension is no longer
in effect (Appendix F). Such a decision will be made only after NRC has determined that the conditions which initiated
the emergency suspension no longer exist and are unlikely to be repeated. The NRC will inform the State of continuing
actions which the State must carry out in order to prevent another emergency.



VII. Impact of the Emergency Suspension



The State's inability to address the emergency situation will be considered by the Management Review Board in the
evaluation of the Agreement State's continued ability to protect public health and safety. Depending on the nature
of the emergency, it may be necessary to place the State on probation, with NRC heightening its oversight of the program.

Post Agreement Activities 



Guidelines for Termination of a Section 274b Agreement 



I. Introduction 



This procedure provides the guidelines that will be followed by NRC when considering whether or not to terminate an
agreement pursuant to the authority contained in Section 274j(1) of the Atomic Energy Act. 

This procedure will describe the method for processing the termination whether initiated at the request of the State
or at the initiative of the NRC. 



II. Objectives 



The objectives of these procedures are to: 

A. Provide guidelines for timely action on termination of an agreement at the State's request or at the initiation
by the NRC staff and 

B. Provide an orderly transition in the discontinuance of certain regulatory authority by the State and assumption
thereof by the NRC. 



III. Background 



Section 274j of the Atomic Energy Act gives the Commission authority to terminate its agreement with a State if such
termination is required to protect the public health and safety, or if the State has not complied with one or more of
the requirements of the Act (e.g. is found to be not compatible with the Commission's program). Section 274j(1) also
provides that an agreement may be terminated at the request of the Governor of a State. When the Commission finds that
program deficiencies are such that the State can no longer protect the public health and safety, the Commission will
institute proceedings to terminate the agreement with the State. Procedures to address emergency situations to
temporarily suspend all or part of an agreement with a State can be found in Procedure 

XXX

.

In cases where a State has failed to respond in an acceptable manner during the probationary or suspension period,
and there is no prospect for improvement, the Commission may also institute formal proceedings to terminate the agreement.
Before reaching a final decision on termination, the Commission will notify the State and provide the State the opportunity
for a hearing on the proposed termination as discussed in Part VI. Notice of the proposed termination will also be published
in the 

Federal Register

. 



IV. Minimum Criteria for Termination 



A. At the request of the Governor, NRC may terminate all or part of its agreement with a State and reassert its authority.
The letter should be addressed to the Chairman, NRC, from the Governor (Appendix A). 

B. The Commission, on its own initiative, will institute formal procedures to terminate an agreement under the following
circumstances: 

1. The State radiation control program is found to be inadequate to protect public health and safety, and no compensating
program has been implemented, 

2. The State has been on probation for a period of time during which it failed to respond to NRC concerns regarding the
States ability to carry out a program to protect public health and safety, and 

3. The State radiation control program is not compatible with the NRC program and the State has refused or is unable
to address those areas previously identified as compatibility concerns and the non-compatibility is disruptive
to the national program for the regulation of Atomic Energy Act material.

<PARENT> FR940805-2-00056 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

C. The following are examples of situations where NRC would consider initiating formal procedures to terminate an
agreement. This list is not inclusive and other situations may require consideration by the Commission at the recommendation
of the Management Review Board.

1. Significant loss of staff which includes number of staff or those with critical skills, coupled with a State's inability
to hire appropriate replacements

2. Continual management problems which manifest in the State's inability to perform adequate inspections or issue
appropriate licenses

3. State's inability to adopt compatible program elements over significant period of time

4. Continued probationary or suspension status for a State program.



V. Management Review Board Role 



A. The Management Review Board (MRB) is responsible for making the adequacy assessment of each Agreement State's
program based on the reviews of the program, using both common performance indicators and non-common performance
indicators, and the compatibility determination. The management review board consists of senior NRC managers,
or their designees, to include: 




Executive Director for Operations 
Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards 
Director, Office of State Programs 
Director, Office of Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data 
General Counsel 




B. The MRB will consider the results of the Agreement State review and any other appropriate information in making
a determination of adequacy and compatibility with respect to an Agreement State. MRB meetings to discuss specific
program review findings normally will be open and Agreement State representatives will be invited to attend. MRB
internal deliberation regarding the overall Agreement State program rating may be closed, given the predecisional
nature of those discussions. 

C. If it is the recommendation of the MRB that NRC initiate the proceedings to terminate an Agreement, the Office of
State Programs will be assigned the lead for preparation of the Commission paper. The Commission paper will contain
the information supporting the termination. The Commission paper will be coordinated with OGC, NMSS and the region.

VI. Staff Work 



A. Before the opportunity for hearing and issuance of the 

Federal Register

 notice, OSP will draft a Commission paper for the signature of EDO on the termination of regulatory authority in the
State based on the initial recommendations of the MRB. In preparation of the Commission paper, the assigned Project
manager should coordinate with OGC as to the form or type of Commission paper. The draft Commission paper (Appendix
B) should contain the following information: 




1. Background information (Appendix C) 
2. MRB recommendations (Appendix D) 
3. Letter from Governor requesting termination_if appropriate (Appendix A) 
4. Proposed Commission Order Reasserting Authority (Appendix E) 
5. Proposed 

Federal Register

 Notice regarding the Termination and Reassertion of NRC authority (Appendix F) 
6. Letter to the Governor regarding the Commission decision (Appendix G) 
7. A public announcement to be issued by Public Affairs (Appendix H) 
8. Proposed letters to the appropriate Congressional Committees on the Commission Decision (Appendix I) 



VII. Hearings 



Before the Commission can terminate a State's program, it must provide reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing
to the State as required by Section 274j(1). Section 274j(1) does not require such a hearing if termination is requested
by the Governor. 

Before the opportunity for a hearing can arise, the Office of State Programs must submit to the Commission a paper containing
a recommendation to terminate the State program in question. This Commission paper will include the recommendations
of the MRB and any other material pertinent to the staff's recommendation to terminate the Agreement. Before a decision
is made on the OSP recommendation, the Commission must provide the State with notice and an opportunity to request
a hearing on the issue. If the State does not request a hearing, the Commission will make a final decision on the issue.
If the State does request a hearing, the Commission will initiate the hearing process described below. 

The hearing for the termination [including the termination of a program that had been previously suspended] of an
Agreement State program will be an informal hearing conducted either by the Commission itself, or at the Commission's
discretion, by a Special Agreement State Board appointed by the Commission. In cases where the Commission determines
that a Special Board will be used, the Board will consists of three members: (1) the chair of the Organization of Agreement
States (OAS) (unless the chair is from the State in question, in which case the Agreement State representative will
be the past chair of the OAS); (2) an official from the Office of General Counsel, and (3) the Deputy Director of an NRC
regional office (outside of the region in which the State is located). 

The Commission, or the Special Board, as appropriate, will conduct an informal hearing to address the issues in question.
At the hearing, the NRC staff, representatives of the Agreement State, and interested third parties will have an opportunity
to testify, answer questions from the Special Board, and submit written materials. Third parties may submit written
material to the Special Board and may testify for a limited period of time. After consideration of the issues, the Commission
or the Special Board will issue a decision on termination. A majority of the Commission or the Special Board will be
required to support a decision. In cases where a Special Board is used, the Commission will have discretion to review
the decision of the Special Board, and either uphold or overturn the Board's decision. 



VIII. Agreement State and NRC Activities During Termination Proceedings 



During the period of time NRC is pursuing termination of an Agreement with a State, State and NRC activities should
be coordinated so that there is continued protection of the public health and safety. The State should be urged to request
technical assistance in any area where there is a concern regarding the State's ability to carry out its responsibilities
under the Agreement. OSP will coordinate with the State, region and NMSS as to the necessary technical assistance
to continue the protection of public health and safety. 



IX. Additional Coordination After Terminations 



A. NRC will conduct a meeting with the licensees in the State to explain the reassertion of NRC authority and the present
fee structure. Lead for the meeting should be the Region in consultation with NMSS, OGC and OC. 

B. After the termination of the Agreement, OSP will prepare a letter to the Department of Labor advising the Department
of the effective date of the termination of the Agreement (Appendix K). 

C. The Regional State Agreements Officer (RSAO) should obtain from the State a computer printout of all specific and
general licenses under the State's agreement. Mailing labels should be obtained if possible from the State. A letter
should be prepared notifying each licensee of the termination, reassertion by NRC and appropriate information (Appendix
L). 

D. OSP will prepare a letter to all Agreement and Non-Agreement States notifying them of the effective date of the termination
and, if appropriate, enclosing a copy of the order or 

Federal Register

 notice (Appendix M). 

E. The RSAO will coordinate with the State so that all necessary action is taken to have the files for the licenses transferred
to the NRC. 



X. Renewed Interest in 274b 



After a State has terminated an agreement, it may at a later date express interest in obtaining a new agreement. The
State should be treated as other non-agreement States interested in agreements and Procedure C.1 for processing
new agreements should be followed for these negotiations.

<DOCTITLE>Renewal of Facility License No. R-73; University of Washington</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 16 to Facility License No. R-73,
issued to the University of Washington (the licensee), which converts the operating license to a possession only
license and renews the license for the facility located on the University campus in Seattle, Washington. The renewed
license will expire on February 14, 1999.

The amended license complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the
Commission's regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I. Those findings are set forth in the license amendment. Notice of Consideration
and opportunity for hearing was afforded in the notice of the proposed issuance of this renewal in the 

Federal Register

 on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12629). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following notice
of the proposed action.

The Commission has prepared a related Safety Evaluation of the renewal of Facility License No. R-73 and has,
based on that evaluation, concluded that the facility can continue to be maintained by the licensee without endangering
the health and safety of the public.

The Commission also has prepared an Environmental Assessment which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38213), for the renewal of Facility License No. R-73 and has concluded that this action
will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further details with respect to this action, see: (1) Application for amendment dated August 10 and 31, 1989, as
modified on February 14 and May 2, 1994; (2) Amendment No. 16 to Facility License No. R-73; (3) the related Safety
Evaluation; and (4) the Environmental Assessment. These items are available for public inspection at the Commission's
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Proposed Rule Change by American
Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Amendments To Exchange Rule 103



August 1, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 15, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On July 11, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the
Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify which Exchange members would be affected
by the proposal.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange is proposing to amend Amex Rule 103 to permit a member, while on the trading floor, to initiate a proprietary
stock transaction while he has a position in a listed option overlying the stock. The text of the proposed rule change
is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



Amex Rule 103 prohibits a member, while on the trading floor, from initiating a proprietary stock transaction while
he has a position in an option overlying the stock, or while he has knowledge that any account in which his member organization
or any other member, allied member or approved person in such organization is directly or indirectly interested has
such an option position.

Rule 103 was adopted in 1935 in response to a Commission request to each national securities exchange, and was intended
to control various abuses in the use of options connected to the operations of manipulative ``pools'' during the late
1920s and early 1930s.

In 1977, shortly after the start of trading in listed options, the Commission reviewed the issue of whether the restriction
should be eased with respect to listed options, and agreed to lift the restriction for regional exchange members,
citing the small percentage of total orders in the underlying equity flowing to any one regional exchange.
 Indicating a desire to progress very cautiously in this area, however, the Commission declined to permit a change
in the rule at the primary markets, the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and the Amex. The Commission did indicate
a willingness to study whether specialists should be allowed to hedge in options on their specialty stocks, and a rule
to that effect with specific hedging guidelines was ultimately adopted.
 Such hedging by specialists is specifically permitted by Rule 103.






Accordingly, the impact of Rule 103(a) is now limited to the Registered Equity Traders
 and Registered Equity Market Makers (``REMMs''),
 who are the remaining classes of members who initiate proprietary transactions on the floor in equities while restricted
by Rule 103(a) from doing so if they hold a position in the overlying options. The Amex is proposing to lift the Rule 103
restriction with respect to listed options. The NYSE recently received Commission approval for similar amendments
to its comparable rule.








As the Commission noted in its order approving the NYSE rule change, this proposal may reduce the current disincentive
for options market participants to act as stock traders, thereby increasing the capital committed to such market
making activities and improving the depth and liquidity of such markets, particularly in times of market stress.

Further, the Exchange believes that, similar to the NYSE, the Amex's surveillance and compliance programs would
enable the Exchange to identify and investigate stock and/or options transactions which raise manipulative concerns,
and to detect and deter intermarket manipulation and other fraudulent or abusive practices.

Finally, the Amex also proposes to correct a cross reference in Rule 103(b) to Rule 175, which was not done when Rule
175 was last amended.

<PARENT> FR940805-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to facilitate securities transactions and perfect the mechanism of a
free and open market.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspections and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-22
and should be submitted by August 26, 1994.



IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 




In light of the changes in market structure that have taken place since Rule 103 was adopted, the Commission believes
that the benefits of the Amex proposal outweigh an burdens it may impose. Specifically, the Commission has concluded
that the proposed rule change should enhance the quality of the Amex market. The Amex established the membership categories
of Registered Equity Trader and REMM to provide a means by which Amex members could, under certain conditions, add
depth and liquidity to the market by initiating proprietary transactions on the floor of the Exchange.
 The Commission, however, notes that Rule 103 may frustrate that purpose,
 to the extent it may be unnecessarily restrictive given the risks posed by Registered Equity Traders' and REMMs' dealings
in stocks in which they (or their member organization) have an option position.








After careful review, the Commission believes that the Amex proposal may reduce the current disincentive for members,
especially options market participants and their associated persons, to act as a Registered Equity Trader or REMM
given Rule 103's restrictions.
 For instance, Amex members currently serving as Registered Equity Traders and REMMs could initiate proprietary
floor trades in situations where they presently cannot do so; moreover, other members might be encouraged to service
in that capacity. In the Commission's view, an increase in the capital committed to such supplemental market making
activities could improve the depth and liquidity of the Amex market, particularly in times of market stress.

<TEXT>
 

Furthermore, the Commission is satisfied that the Amex proposal contains adequate safeguards to protect investors
in the securities markets. In this respect, the Commission notes that a comprehensive regulatory framework has been
developed for the trading of listed securities, including listed options.
 For example, in 1983, an Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') was formed to coordinate more effectively surveillance
and information sharing arrangements between the stock and options markets.
 Using procedures developed in that forum, among other things, the national securities exchanges identify and investigate
stock and/or options transactions that, based on certain parameters, raise manipulative concerns. The Commission
believes that this regulatory scheme, including Amex monitoring and surveillance of amended Rule 103, should be
sufficient to detect and deter intermarket manipulation and other fraudulent or abusive practices.






Specifically, the Amex has informed the Commission that the Exchange will increase the frequency and scope of its
examination of the trading activity of 

Registered Equity Traders and REMMs. The Commission expects that Amex staff will utilize such information as part
of its on-going efforts to ensure compliance with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and Exchange rules.
In this respect, the Exchange has assured the Commission that, if a transaction raises concerns about intermarket
manipulation, Amex staff, with the cooperation of the options exchanges where appropriate, will conduct a thorough
examination of all the relevant facts. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the Amex's monitoring and surveillance
of Rule 103, as amended, will aid the Exchange in detecting any trading abuses.


More generally, the Commission believes that, independent of Rule 103, other Amex rules, which the Amex will continue
to monitor for compliance, should help to keep floor professionals from being in a position where they can engage in
trading abuses. These include, among other things, the yielding requirement imposed on certain on-floor orders
for a member's account,
 and the conditions placed on when a Registered Equity Trader or REMM can initiate a proprietary floor trade.
 Further, Registered Equity Traders and REMM, like other Amex members, are subject to the prohibition on frontrunning
of block transactions.








Finally, the Commission notes that, Registered Equity Traders and REMMs currently are not prohibited from trading
in stocks in which they have an existing option position. Such transactions, however, must be initiated off-floor.
To the extent that the amended rule will permit such transactions to be initiated on-floor, Amex surveillance should
detect and deter any trading abuses derived from informational advantages. In sum, the Commission believes that
the proposed rule change should not materially affect the Amex's ability to address the regulatory concerns raised
by floor professionals' intermarket trading activity.



The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof. This will permit the benefits of the proposed rule change to be realized as
soon as possible. In addition, the Exchange's proposal is identical to an NYSE proposal that was published in the 

Federal Register

 for the full comment period and was approved by the Commission.







It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-94-22), including Amendment No. 1, is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.
Relating to the Stopping of Option Orders by Market-Makers and Designated Primary Market-Makers </DOCTITLE>



July 29, 1994.



I. Introduction 



On June 24, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposal that establishes procedures for permitting market makers and designated primary market makers to grant
stops to option orders.
 








Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33013 (Oct. 4,
1993), 58 FR 53005. No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the CBOE proposal.



II. Description of the Proposal 




The Exchange states that the purpose of the Rule is to implement a comprehensive method for executing ``stopped''
options transactions on the Exchange, comparable to stopping rules that are in operation at other exchanges. The
proposed rule change provides that an Exchange market-maker (``market-maker'') or designated primary market-maker
(``DPM'') is authorized, though not required, to grant a stop on an option transaction and that a floor broker is authorized,
but not required, to accept a stop. In addition, the proposed rule change sets forth the conditions which attach to
a market-maker's or DPM's granting of a stop. 

A ``stop'' is defined as a guarantee that an option order will be executed at the stop price or better. The Exchange believes
that the practice of stopping an option order provides many benefits for marketplace participants, market-makers
or DPMs, floor brokers, and customers alike. The Exchange also believes a stop benefits the customer by providing
an opportunity for the floor broker to try to obtain a better price for that customer without risk. According to the
Exchange, a stop provides one means whereby a floor broker may satisfy the ``due diligence'' standard which he or she
is required to meet under Exchange rules and enables the floor broker to lock in a desirable price while attempting
to better that price. Additionally, the Exchange believes that a stop also provides the market-maker or DPM with an
opportunity to compete for order flow by better meeting the needs of floor brokers, and it provides additional price
discovery for the trading crowd. 


The conditions under which an Exchange market-maker or DPM may grant, and a floor broker may accept, a stop are set forth
in paragraph (b) of the proposed rule. First, a market-maker or DPM granting a stop on a straight order or on only the
option portion of a buy-write transaction must make the trading crowd and the Order Book Official aware of the terms,
price, and size of the stop. Second, all stopped orders must be time-stamped by the floor broker at the time the stop
is granted. Third, a market-maker or DPM must be prepared to execute, if requested, one or more additional orders up
to, but not to exceed in aggregate, the total quantity of contracts executed in the original stopped transaction at
the same stop price or better. Fourth, floor brokers are required to either execute the stopped order at the stop price
and size at the time a transaction occurs in the crowd at the stop price, or to release the market-maker or DPM from his
or her guarantee. Finally, proposed Exchange Rule 8.17(b)(5) describes how a floor broker must bid or offer to improve
on the stop price guarantee: ``In improving on the stop price once a floor broker has accepted a stop, a floor broker
must bid no more than one fractional trading increment less than the stop and must offer no more than one fractional
trading increment greater than the stop. A fractional trading increment is the minimum fractional change allowed
for bids and offers consistent with [Exchange] Rule 6.42.'' When attempting to better the stop price, any bid or offer
that improves the established market for a particular option series would be reflected on the screen.






Paragraph (c) of the Rule establishes priority for ``stopped'' orders over new crowd orders, excluding the public
limit order book, when the stop order is properly granted, accepted, and time-stamped by the floor broker at the time
the stop is granted and accepted. Paragraph (d) of the Rule requires notice be given to a customer by the floor broker
or member organization within a reasonably practicable time after that customer's order has been stopped. Paragraph
(e) of the Rule details the reporting requirements applicable to the execution of stopped orders on the tape and on
cards used for reporting Exchange transactions. 

Paragraph (f) of the Rule addresses the effect of a trading halt on the priority and pricing of a stopped order. This
aspect of the Rule, which the Exchange asserts is substantially the same as an American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'')
provision covering the same subject, establishes procedures for the benefit of customers by requiring the floor
broker to use due diligence to obtain any better price at which an option might re-open after a halt, while maintaining
priority at the stop price if the reopening is at that price or an inferior price. Finally, paragraph (g) of the Rule
explicitly states that the market-maker granting the stop is held to that guarantee by placing the liability for correcting
an erroneous or inaccurate price on the market-maker or DPM that granted the stop.



III. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5) in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect
investors and the public interest.
 In addition, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirement under Section 11(b) of the
Act and the rules thereunder that require specialist transactions to be consistent with the maintenance of fair and
orderly markets.









Historically, the Commission has been concerned about the practice of granting stopped orders. In the 1963 Report
of the Special Study of Securities Markets,
 the Commission commented that in many instances ``[t]he practice of stopping stock against orders on the specialist's
book * * * involves too great a compromise of the specialist's fiduciary obligation for personal profit
without any offsetting gain to his market making function.''
 The Special Study's concern with stopping stock was that unexecuted customer limit orders on the specialist's book
would be bypassed by the stopped order. The Commission, nevertheless, has allowed the practice of stopping stock
in markets where the spread is twice the minimum variation because the possible harm to orders in the book would be offset
by the possibility of price improvement when the spread between the bid and offer is reduced.










The Commission believes that the same concerns attendant to the practice of stopping stock are equally applicable
to the stopping of options orders. However, the Commission believes the CBOE proposal addresses adequately these
concerns by adopting sufficently stringent safeguards. For example, the proposal requires a market-maker or DPM
to alert the trading crowd and Order Book Official of the terms, price and size of the stop on a straight order or on the
option portion of a buy-write. Second, the proposal also requires a market-maker or DPM to be ready to execute additional
orders equal to the total quantity of contracts executed in the original stopped transaction at the stopped price.
The Commission believes these conditions will serve to enhance market depth and liquidity by increasing the trading
opportunities available to the crowd by apprising them of the order and allowing them to better the current market,
and by giving other orders the opportunity to receive the stopped price.

The proposal establishes guidelines on how a floor broker must improve on the stop price. Once accepting a stop, a floor
broker may only bid one fractional trading increment less than the stop and may only offer one fractional trading increment
greater than the stop.
 As a result of this requirement, the practice of granting stops will be limited to markets where the spread is twice
the minimum variation allowable (under CBOE Rule 6.42). Accordingly, under the CBOE's proposal, the floor broker's
requirement to gain price improvement for the stopped order will result in narrowing the spread between the bid and
offer. This narrower spread in the quotes will be available on the quotation screen to all market participants, and
should provide benefits to the market that offset any potential harm to the customer limit order book.





The proposal also requires a floor broker to either immediately execute the stopped order at the stop price and size
when a transaction at the same price occurs in the crowd, or to release the market-maker from the guarantee. The Commission
believes that this requirement will ensure that a floor broker exercises due diligence in filling an order at the stop
price while at the same time serving to ensure, once a transaction at the stop price occurs, that the market maker or
DPM is not under a limitless obligation to guarantee the order.

The Commission also believes that the CBOE proposal sufficiently limits the practice of stopping orders to situations
where the market-maker or DPM granting the stop would not unduly impinge upon the fiduciary obligations to orders
on the public customer limit order book. The proposal grants priority to stopped orders over new crowd orders only,
and not the public customer limit order book. Additionally, when a floor broker attempts to improve upon a stop price
guarantee and the subsequent bid/offer matches the best bid/offer in the customer limit order book, in accordance
with CBOE Rule 6.45, the customer limit order will have priority at that price, should an execution occur. The Commission
believes these are critical aspects of the CBOE proposal, in that they are designed to enable market-makers to grant
stops while ensuring that customer's orders on the limit order book will not be disadvantaged. The time stamping of
all stop orders when granted will establish an audit trail and provide a reliable method for establishing priority.
Moreover, the Commission believes that the CBOE has adequately addressed customer notification concerns, the effect
of a trading halt on the priority and pricing of a stopped order, and reporting requirements applicable to the execution
of stopped orders on the tape. Finally, the Exchange has agreed to issue an Information Circular to its members which
will specify the circumstances under which a stop may be granted.

The Commission also believes that the proposal is consistent with the prohibition in Section 11(b) against providing
discretion to a specialist (or market maker) in the handling of an order.
 Section 11(b) was designed, in part, to address potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the specialist's
dual role as agent and principal in executing stock or option transactions. In particular, Congress intended to prevent
specialists from unduly influencing market trends through their knowledge of market interest from the specialist's
book and their handling of discretionary agency orders. The Commission has stated that, pursuant to Section 11(b),
all orders other than market or limit orders are discretionary and therefore cannot be accepted by specialists.





After careful review, the Commission concludes that it is appropriate to treat stopped orders as equivalent to limit
orders. A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stated amount of option contracts at a specified price, or at a better
price if obtainable.
 In this instance, the Commission believes that stopped orders are equivalent to limit orders because once the stop
has been granted, the market maker or DPM is obligated to execute the order at the best bid or offer, or better if obtainable.
As with limit orders, the market maker or DPM exercises no control or discretion over whether the order is subsequently
executed. Therefore, the Commission believes the CBOE proposal establishes sufficiently stringent guidelines
to ensure that a market maker or DPM complies with his market duties and Section 11(b).





It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-93-30) is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 to Proposed Rule Change by Chicago Stock Exchange,
Inc. Relating to the Creation of the Chicago Match System</DOCTITLE>


August 1, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 4, 1994, May 4, 1994, June 7, 1994 and July 12, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 to a proposed rule change
 as described in Items I, II and III below, which items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 to the proposed rule change
from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act, the Chicago Stock Exchange is amending the rules for its institutional matching
system, the Chicago Match (formerly known as the Match Market Exchange Facility).


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization
has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The CHX submitted to the Commission Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 to request that the Commission amend its proposed rules
relating to the proposed Chicago Match System (``Chicago Match'').
The purpose of Amendment No. 4 is to further amend the proposed rules relating to the Chicago Match by (i) changing the
cross price of the match to the mid-point between the consolidated best bid and offer regardless of the size of the spread;
(ii) reporting to the consolidated tape or NASDAQ the cross price plus or minus the average liquidity fee for each stock
stated in 256ths; (iii) limiting the maximum liquidity fee or liquidity credit (received or paid) to 1/2 of the spread
of the consolidated best bid and offer at cross time (regardless of the size of the spread); and (iv) not permitting
orders to sell short to be entered with a liquidity fee.
As stated above, this amendment changes the proposed cross price for the Chicago Match. As initially proposed, all
matched orders will be executed at a random time within a pre-determined ten minute window period at the market price
at such time. The market price will still be calculated based upon the spread of a particular issue. However, rather
than changing the price depending on whether there is a 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, etc. spread and determining whether there is
an order imbalance, Amendment No. 4 proposes to have the Chicago Match calculate the market price as the mid-point
between the consolidated best bid and offer regardless of the size of the spread. For example, if the consolidated
best bid and best offer for stock X was 20-20 1/8, the cross price would be 201/16.
As a result of the above change, Amendment No. 4 also changes the way trades in the Chicago Match are reported to the Consolidated
Tape or NASDAQ. As proposed, the Exchange will report one trade for each stock executed in the Chicago Match. That trade
report will include the total number of shares executed in that stock and a price equal to the cross price plus (or minus)
the volume weighted average of liquidity fees paid (or liquidity credits received) for that stock.
Also as a result of the above change to the cross price, limited price orders, orders with a liquidity fee or credit entered
in cents, and orders that are entered with a liquidity fee or credit relative to the consolidated best bid or offer or
as a computed quantity (in addition to liquidity fees or credits entered in cents) will be eligible to be displayed
orders. The Exchange will assign numeric values to these orders based on the then current consolidated best bid and
offer. It is anticipated that initially the Exchange will update this information at least every 15 minutes or such
less time that is possible.

<TEXT>
 

In addition to the above changes, Amendment No. 4 changes how orders in a specialist's book interact with the Chicago
Match and limits the maximum size of liquidity fees and credits. As before, the CHX's CQS quotation will automatically
be fed into the Chicago Match facility on a real-time basis. These bids and/or offers will be entered as an order in Chicago
Match. Rather than limiting interaction with the book to 1/8 spread issues however, the revised rules would enter
the CHX CQS quotation into the match in all issues. If entered, these orders will have the highest priority of execution
at that liquidity credit level. 

As stated above, the Chicago Match will limit the maximum size of liquidity fees and liquidity credits. With respect
to the limitation of the size of 

liquidity fees,

 if a liquidity fee is greater than 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer at cross time it will be reduced
to 1/2 of the spread at cross time. For example, if 1/2 of the spread is 61/4 cents, and an order with a liquidity fee of
10 cents entered, the maximum liquidity fee that order can pay is 61/4 cents. Liquidity credits, on the other hand,
will be treated differently than liquidity fees. For 

liquidity credits, 

the Chicago Match will not permit liquidity credits to be received in an amount greater than 1/2 of the spread of the
Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. For example, if the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer at cross time was
1/2, the maximum liquidity credit allowed would be 25 cents.
 If an order was entered with a liquidity credit greater than 25 cents, the user would have an option of either having
the liquidity credit reduced to the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer or having the order be excluded from the match.






The final change proposed by this amendment concerns short sales. In order to ensure that any order to sell short can
have no market impact and not contribute to a volume weighted average liquidity fee that is less than the middle of the
spread, no order to sell short will be permitted to be executed if it includes a liquidity fee. Liquidity credits, however,
will be allowed. 

In addition to the amendments submitted in Amendment No. 4, the Exchange also made changes to the Chicago Match Rules
in Amendment Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Amendment No. 1 changed the name of this proposed system from ``Match Market Exchange''
(``MMX'') to ``Chicago Match''. Amendment No. 1 changed the definition of size conditions (in Rule 2(ab)) to be considered
for a near match to be a specific number entered by the User instead of the former procedure of designating the size conditions
as ``small,'' ``medium,'' and ``large.'' Amendment No. 1 required that liquidity fees and credits be entered in cents
and entered relative to the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer at cross time or entered as a computed quantity (in Rule
6(e)(9)). Amendment No. 1 also made technical changes and corrections that do not affect the substance of the proposal
and made other substantive changes that subsequently were amended. 




Amendment No. 2 changed the definition of ``Near Match'' (in Rule 2(w)) to clarify that it means two orders for a particular
security in which (i) the number of shares of each order equals or exceeds the minimum size specified by the other order;
and (ii) the Liquidity Credit required by one side is greater than the Liquidity Fee offered by the other side. Amendment
No. 2 clarified the meaning and intent of proposed Rule 6(e)(8) which permits a user to enter another user's name in
order to prevent any matches between those two users, thereby excluding certain users when necessary to comply with
ERISA. Amendment No. 2 also clarified the meaning and intent of proposed Rule 6(e)(7) which permits a user to exclude
an entire category of contra parties. Amendment No. 2 further clarified that Conditional Orders may not be Displayed
Orders and that all confirmations will comply with the requirements of Rule 10b-10 under the Act; and it noted
that non-member users will be required to have $10 million for investment purposes. 

Amendment No. 3 amended Rule 3 to delete references to the Exchange permitting orders for securities that are not listed
or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on the Exchange to be entered into the Chicago Match System. Amendment
No. 3 also made substantive changes to proposed Rule 9(b) (which attempted to eliminate any argument that trades executed
in the Chicago Match could trade through other market's published quotations) which were subsequently amended in
Amendment No. 4. 



2. Basis 



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in that it is designed
to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest. 



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition. 



The Exchange believes that no burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change. 



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 



No comments were solicited or received. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
fifth Street, NW., Washington DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying at the principal
office of the above-referenced self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CHX-93-19
and should be submitted by August 22, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Computer Data Systems, Inc., Common
Stock, $0.01 Par Value) File No. 1-6002 </DOCTITLE>


August 1, 1994. 



Computer Data Systems, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act``) and Rule 12d2-2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Boston Stock
Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''). 

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:


According to the Company, its Common Stock is listed on the BSE. According to the Company, nearly all of the trading
volume of the Company's Common Stock is now transacted through NASDAQ/NMS and the Company does not believe that the
limited benefit it would obtain through continuation of its listing on the BSE would justify the cost and expense involved.


Any interested person may, on or before August 22, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

 


For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Maxxim Medical, Inc., Common Stock,
$.001 Par Value; 63/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2003) File No. 1-10600</DOCTITLE>



August 1, 1994.



Maxxim Medical, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock and convertible subordinated debentures
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock and 63/4% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on December 22, 1993 and concurrently therewith
such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its Common Stock and 63/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures from listing on
the Amex, the Company considered the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing
of its Common Stock and 63/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures on the NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not
see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its Common Stock and 63/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures
and believes that dual listing would fragment the market for the Common Stock and 63/4% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures.

Any interested person may, on or before August 22, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

Georgia Power Company (70-8443)



Georgia Power Company (``Georgia Power''), 333 Piedmont Avenue, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30308, a wholly-owned electric
public-utility subsidiary company of The Southern Company, a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration
under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(d) of the Act and Rules 44 and 54 thereunder.

Georgia Power proposes to enter into a loan agreement or installment sales agreement (``Agreement'') on or before
December 31, 1997 in connection with the issuance and sale by the Development Authority of Burke County, Georgia (``Authority'')
of $60 million aggregate principal amount of its Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Vogtle
Project), Sixth Series 1994 (``Revenue Bonds ''). The Revenue Bonds will be issued to refinance the costs of certain
pollution control and/or sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at Georgia Power's facilities located in Burke
County.

The Revenue Bonds will bear an interest rate equal to 6.375% per annum, which may be convertible to a rate that fluctuates
in accordance with a specified prime or base rate or rates or may be determined pursuant to certain remarketing or auction
procedures. The Authority has entered into underwriting arrangements pursuant to which the underwriters will purchase
the Revenue Bonds from the Authority at a purchase price of 100% of the principal amount thereof. Georgia Power will
pay the underwriting fee, which is equal to 1.498% of the aggregate principal amount of the Revenue Bonds. Such arrangements
will result in a true interest cost to Georgia Power of 6.489% per annum.

The Revenue Bonds will mature on August 1, 2024 and may, if it is deemed advisable for purposes of marketability, be
entitled to the benefit of a mandatory redemption sinking fund calculated to retire a portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the Revenue Bonds prior to maturity.

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Authority will lend to Georgia Power the proceeds of the sale of the Revenue Bonds. Under
the Agreement, Georgia Power will pay the Authority amounts at times and in amounts which shall correspond to the payments
with respect to the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the related Revenue Bonds whenever and in whatever
manner the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, upon redemption or declaration or otherwise.

Proceeds from the sale of the Revenue Bonds will be deposited with a trustee (``Trustee'') under an indenture to be
entered into between the Authority and the Trustee, pursuant to which such Revenue Bonds are to be issued and secured.
Also, the Agreement will provide for the assignment to the Trustee of the Authority's interest in, and of the monies
receivable by the Authority under, the Agreement.

Georgia Power may be required to purchase any of the Revenue Bonds, or any of the Revenue Bonds may be subject to mandatory
redemption, at any time if the interest thereon is determined to be subject to federal income tax. Also in the event
of taxability, interest on those Revenue Bonds may be effectively converted to a higher rate, and Georgia Power also
may be required to indemnify the bondholders against any other additions to interest, penalties and additions to
tax.

Georgia Power currently has outstanding certain first mortgage bonds issued under an indenture dated as of March
1, 1941 between Georgia Power and Chemical Bank, as trustee, as supplemented and amended (``Mortgage''). In order
to obtain the benefit of ratings for the Revenue Bonds equivalent to the rating of these mortgage bonds, Georgia Power
will deliver to the Trustee a series of first mortgage bonds, to be issued under the Mortgage, as collateral for its
obligations to the Authority related to the Revenue Bonds (``Collateral Bonds''). The aggregate principal amount
of such Collateral Bonds would be equal to either: (1) the principal amount of the related Revenue Bonds, if the Collateral
Bonds are interest-bearing; or (2) the sum of such principal amount of those Revenue Bonds plus interest payments
thereon for a specified period, if the Collateral Bonds are not interest-bearing. The Collateral Bonds will mature
on the maturity date of the Revenue Bonds.

The proceeds from the sale of the Revenue Bonds will be applied by Georgia Power to the redemption of $126.725 million
principal amount of Development Authority of Burke County (Georgia), 12% Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia
Power Company Plant Vogtle Project), Third Series 1984.

July 29, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act'').





APPLICANT: 

Valmora Partners, L.P.



Relevant Act Section: 

Sections 206A and 205(a)(1).



Summary of Application: 

Applicant is a limited partnership that a family formed to facilitate investments of family trusts and custodianships,
and it requests an order to permit registered investment advisers to charge it performance-based advisory fees.



Filing Date: 

The application was filed on April 29, 1994 and amended on July 29, 1994.



Hearing or Notification of Hearing: 

An order granting the applicant will be issued unless the SEC orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing

in the form of an affidavit or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Hearing requests should state the nature of the
writer's interest, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons may request notification of a hearing
by writing to the SEC's Secretary.


</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicant's Representations


1. Applicant is a Texas limited partnership that a particular family formed to facilitate and simplify investments
of multiple family trusts and custodianships. Applicant is excepted from registration under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, under section 3(c)(1). Applicant requests an order under section 206A of the Advisers Act that would grant
an exemption from section 205(a)(1) of that Act to permit registered investment advisers to charge it performance-based
advisory fees.
2. Applicant's general partners, Tom F. Marsh, is responsible for making investment decisions for applicant. Mr.
Marsh is the chief executive officer and the sole owner of March Operating Company (``MOC''), an oil and gas exploration
and production company. Mr. Marsh's wife, his mother, one of his brothers, MOC, two long-term family employees, fifteen
trusts established under Texas law, and four custodianships established under the Texas Uniform Gifts to Minor's
Act (the ``UGMA'') are the limited partners of applicant. Thus, each of the limited partners is either: (a) A Marsh
family member;
 (b) an entity wholly-owned by Mr. Marsh; (c) a long-term family employee;
 or (d) a trust or custodianship having Marsh family members as beneficiaries and a Marsh family member or a long-term
family employee as trustee or custodian. The trustee or custodian makes the decision for each of the relevant entities
to invest in applicant.





3. Applicant is essentially a family investment vehicle, and no management, performance, or other fee is charged
to the limited partners. Mr. Marsh acts as applicant's general partner without any compensation. Applicant reimburses
MOC for direct costs it incurs in providing certain administrative and support services to applicant, such as preparing
applicant's financial statement and making and keeping its books and records.
4. Virtually all of applicant's assets consist of limited partnership interests of privately placed investment
limited partnerships. These limited partnerships are not registered as investment companies in reliance on section
3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act, and they are charged performance-based advisory fees by investment advisers.
Neither applicant, nor any Marsh family member or long-term family employee who acts as trustee or custodian of any
of the trusts or custodianships that are limited partners of applicant is an affiliated person of any adviser.


Legal Analysis


1. Section 205(a)(1) of the Advisers Act generally prohibits a registered investment adviser from receiving compensation
on the basis of a share of capital gains in or capital appreciation of a client's account. Section 206A of the Advisers
Act provides that the SEC may exempt any person or transaction from any provision of the Advisers Act ``if and to the
extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of [the Advisers Act].''
2. Rule 205-3 provides an exemption from the prohibition against performance-based compensation in section
205(a)(1) provided that the conditions of the rule are satisfied. Paragraph (b)(1) of the rule requires each client
entering into an investment advisory contract that provides for such compensation to be: (a) a natural person or a
company who immediately after entering into the contract has at least $500,000 under management of the investment
adviser; or (b) a person who the registered investment adviser reasonably believes prior to entering into the contract,
is a natural person or a company whose net worth at the time the contract is entered into exceeds $1,000,000. Paragraph
(b)(2) of the rule provides that the term ``company'' does not include a private investment company such as applicant
unless each of its equity owners is a natural person or a company as defined therein that meets the eligibility requirements
of paragraph (b)(1) of the rule. A trust is expressly included within the definition of ``company.'' Applicant believes
that a custodianship should be viewed as a type of trust for this purpose because, under UGMA, a custodian is a fiduciary
whose duties and powers are similar to those of a trustee.
3. Mr. Marsh, his wife, his mother, his brother, MOC, the long-term family employees, and five of the fifteen trusts
qualify under the client eligibility requirements of rule 205-3(b). The remaining ten trusts and the four custodianships
(the ``non-qualifying trusts'') do not individually satisfy the requirements of the rule. Thus, applicant requests
an exemption under section 206A from section 205(a)(1) to let it invest in privately placed limited partnerships
that are managed by registered investment advisers that charge performance fees. Applicant requests that the relief
also cover applicant in the event that trusts and custodianships formed in the future having family members or long-term
family employees as trustee or custodian may become limited partners of applicant. Such future trusts and custodianships
will comply with the representations set forth in the application.

4. The client eligibility requirements of rule 205-3 reflect the SEC's recognition that certain high net worth
clients have the capacity to bear the perceived additional risks of performance fees, as well as the ability to protect
themselves adequately against the potential abuses of performance fees. Applicant is unable to rely on the rule because
the non-qualifying trusts do not meet the $500,000 under management or $1,000,000 net worth requirement. However,
applicant believes that exemptive relief from section 205(a)(i) is appropriate because: (a) the individuals charged
with making the investment decisions for applicant and the non-qualifying trusts satisfy the net worth requirements,
are financially sophisticated, and are fully able to assess the potential risks of performance fees; (b) the trustees
and custodians of the non-qualifying trusts are either close family members or long-term family employees, have
substantial assets invested in applicant and are therefore subject to the same risks as the beneficiaries; and (c)
the net worth of each beneficiary of the non-qualifying trust exceeds $1,000,000. Applicant believes the beneficiaries
of the non-qualifying trusts are wealthy investors who, together with the trustees and custodians, can understand
the effect on their investment of performance-based compensation and bear the potential risks of such fees.

5. Because those exercising investment authority for the non-qualifying trusts have such intimate and strong familial
relationships to the beneficiaries, applicant believes it is not unreasonable to presume that the commonality of
such interest will result in the decision-maker behaving in the best interests of the beneficiaries. Except for the
requested exemption for the non-qualifying trusts and custodianships, the requirements of rule 205-3(b)
are satisfied in all other respects. Thus, applicant believes that granting the requested exemption is appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Advisers Act.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.

Application by Chemical Waste Transportation Institute for a Preemption Determination as to New York Department
of Environmental Conservation Requirements on the Transfer and Storage of Hazardous Wastes Incidental to Transportation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Public Notice Reopening Comment Period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 RSPA is reopening the comment period on the application by the Chemical Waste Transportation Institute for a determination
that the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act preempts certain New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
requirements on the transfer and storage of hazardous wastes incidental to transportation. RSPA will afford interested
parties the opportunity to submit additional comments and to respond to additional comments submitted during the
reopened initial comment period.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


In September 1993, Chemical Waste Transportation Institute (CWTI) applied for a determination that the Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) preempts certain requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (NYDEC). These requirements, in Title 6 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR), apply
to the transfer and storage of hazardous wastes incidental to transportation (hereinafter ``transfer and storage
requirements''). The text of CWTI's application was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 15, 1993, and interested parties were invited to submit comments. 58 FR 53614. 
RSPA has previously extended the period for public comments in this matter. One extension was in response to the requests
of four States for additional time to submit comments, including the statement by NYDEC that it was preparing revisions
to its regulations that would eliminate many of the specific requirements challenged by CWTI. 58 FR 65226 (Dec. 13,
1993). A second extension allowed additional time for NYDEC to publish proposed revisions to its transfer and storage
requirements (which NYDEC then provided to all parties that had previously submitted comments on CWTI's application),
for NYDEC to submit further comments that considered these proposed revisions, and for other parties to address these
proposed revisions and NYDEC's further comments. 59 FR 4312 (Jan. 31, 1994). The rebuttal comment period, as extended,
closed April 14, 1994. 
RSPA's Acting Administrator recently received a written request from the Association of State and Territorial Solid
Waste Management Officials (ASTSWMO) for a meeting to discuss the effect of RSPA's preemption ``activities upon
States' ability to appropriately regulate transporters of hazardous waste under [the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act] RCRA.'' ASTSWMO indicated that it would like to discuss, among other issues, the ``commingling and
mixing of hazardous waste by transporters while in transit,'' and the ``off loading and storage of hazardous waste
at non-RCRA regulated sites.'' These issues are involved in the NYDEC transfer and storage requirements challenged
in CWTI's application. RSPA views this request broadly as a desire by ASTSWMO to make additional comments beyond its
January 13, 1994 letter already submitted on CWTI's application. 
ASTSWMO's letter and RSPA's response, denying ASTSWMO's request for a meeting, have been placed in the public docket.
In view of the concerns expressed in ASTSWMO's letter and possible developments in connection with NYDEC's proposed
revisions to its transfer and storage requirements, RSPA considers it appropriate to reopen the comment period on
CWTI's application to allow:

<DOCNO> FR940805-2-00133 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

(1) ASTSWMO and others to comment on ``the effect of RSPA [preemption] activities upon States' ability to appropriately
regulate transporters of hazardous waste under RCRA''; 
(2) NYDEC to advise RSPA of the current status of the proposed revisions to the NYDEC transfer and storage requirements,
including the proposed repeal of many of the requirements challenged by CWTI; 
(3) All interested parties to provide further information on whether requirements proposed to be repealed by NYDEC
have been or are being applied and enforced at this time; and 
(4) NYDEC and other parties to comment further on the meaning of the phrases ``store incidental to transport'' and
``transfer incidental to transport'' contained in 6 NYCRR 372.3(a)(6) and (7), respectively, and whether the definitions
set forth in 6 NYCRR 364.1(c)(12) and (14) apply to these phrases. 
On July 5, 1994, President Clinton signed Public Law 103-272 which extensively revised, codified and enacted
without substantive change numerous laws related to transportation. The former Hazardous Materials Transportation
Act, 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 

et seq., 

has been repealed and replaced by 49 U.S.C. Chapter 51, ``Transportation of Hazardous Material,'' except as to ``proceedings
that were begun before'' July 5, 1994. Accordingly, the preemption provisions in former 49 App. U.S.C. 1804 and 1811
remain applicable to CWTI's application. At the same time, since Congress made no substantive change in passing 49
U.S.C. Chapter 51, RSPA's determination in this matter will cite to the preemption criteria as set forth in 49 U.S.C.
5125. 


II. Reopening of Comment Period 


For the reasons set forth above, the period for public comments on CWTI's application is being reopened. Comments
may be submitted through August 31, 1994, and may discuss all issues relating to CWTI's application including those
contained in comments previously submitted. Rebuttal comments may be submitted through September 23, 1994, and
may discuss only those issues raised in comments submitted during the reopened comment period; rebuttal comments
may not raise new issues. 
As previously stated in the October 15, 1993, December 13, 1993, and January 31, 1994 notices, all comments should
be limited to the issue of whether the NYDEC transfer and storage requirements are preempted by the HMTA, and all comments
should: specifically address (a) the preemption criteria (``substantively the same,'' ``dual compliance,'' and
``obstacle'') described in Part I of the October 15, 1993 Public Notice, and (b) whether the NYDEC transfer and storage
requirements are ``otherwise authorized by Federal law.'' Persons intending to comment should review the standards
and procedures governing RSPA's consideration of applications for preemption determinations, set forth at 49 CFR
107.201-107.211.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Actions Under the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice sets forth three actions to be taken by the Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH), under the NIH
Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (

Federal Register

, July 5, 1994, Part IV).

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Today three actions are being promulgated under the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules.
These three proposed actions were published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 of May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24618), and reviewed and recommended for approval by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee
(RAC) at its meeting on June 9-10, 1994. 


I. Background Information and Decisions on Actions Under the 

NIH Guidelines 


A. Amendment to Appendix M-I-D of the 

NIH Guidelines Regarding Informed 
Consent for Human Gene Transfer Protocols 


During the December 2-3, 1993, Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee 
meeting, Dr. Gary Ellis, Director of the Office for Protection from Research 
Risks (OPRR), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, responded to the written comments 
submitted by Dr. Zallen, Chair of the Working Group on Informed Consent 
Issues. Dr. Ellis noted the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee's concern 
regarding specific issues that should be addressed in human gene transfer 
protocol Informed Consent documents, i.e., request for autopsy, 
recommendations for male/female contraception, separate Informed Consent 
documents when the gene therapy aspects of the protocols are independent of an 
ongoing clinical protocol, commitment to long-term patient follow-up, and 
financial responsibility of the institution for all research-related costs. During his 
presentation, Dr. Ellis provided the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee 
with background information regarding the roles of both OPRR and local 
Institutional Review Boards (IRB) in the review of research proposals involving 
human subjects. Dr. Ellis recommended that the Recombinant DNA Advisory 
Committee draft a letter outlining its specific recommendations to OPRR for 
distribution and consideration by the local IRBs. 
In a memorandum dated December 23, 1993, Dr. Ellis further clarified the 
avenues that should be pursued by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee 
with regard to translating its concern about the ``quality and content of informed 
consent documents into constructive changes in the informed consent process,'' 
specifically in relation to human gene transfer. Dr. Ellis recommended that the 
NIH Guidelines should be amended to introduce consistency in Informed 
Consent document language.

During the March 3-4, 1994, Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee meeting, 
Dr. Doris Zallen, Chair of the Working Group on Informed Consent, provided a 
summary of the proposed amendments to Appendix M-I-D, Informed Consent. 
Two versions of revised Appendix M-I-D were presented: (1) the version 
drafted by the working group, and (2) a modified version incorporating the 
modifications suggested by Mr. Alex Capron. The Recombinant DNA Advisory 
Committee recommended that the working group should develop a consolidated 
version of Appendix M-I-D which includes language from both proposed 
documents. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee suggested that 
questions should be prefaced with an explanation as to the necessity for the 
requested information. 
On April 27, 1994, Dr. Zallen submitted revised amendments to Appendix M-I- 
D, Informed Consent, in response to the specific comments posed by the 
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee at its March 3-4, 1994, meeting. The 
proposed amendments were reviewed by the Recombinant DNA Advisory 
Committee during the June 9-10, 1994, meeting. The Recombinant DNA 
Advisory Committee approved a motion to accept the proposed amendments 
with minor editorial changes to Appendix M-I-D, Informed Consent, by a vote of 
13 in favor, 0 opposed, and no abstentions. 
The amended version of Appendix M-I-D, Informed Consent, reads: 


Appendix M-I-D. Informed Consent 


In accordance with the requirements of DHHS regulations for the Protection of 
Human Subjects (45 CFR Part 46), investigators should indicate how subjects 
will be informed about the proposed study and the manner in which their 
consent will be solicited. They should also indicate how the Informed Consent 
document makes clear the special requirements of gene transfer research. 


Appendix M-I-D-1. Communication About the Study to Potential Participants 


Appendix M-I-D-1-a.
Which members of the research group and/or institution 
will be responsible for contacting potential participants and for describing the 
study to them? What procedures will be used to avoid possible conflicts of 
interest if the investigator is also providing medical care to potential subjects? 


Appendix M-I-D-1-b.


How will the major points covered in Appendices M-I-A 
through M-I-C be disclosed to potential participants and/or their parents or 
guardians in language that is understandable to them? 


Appendix M-I-D-1-c.


What is the length of time that potential participants will 
have to make a decision about their participation in the study? 


Appendix M-I-D-1-d.


If the study involves pediatric or mentally handicapped 
subjects, how will the assent of each person be obtained? 


Appendix M-I-D-2. Informed Consent Document

``Investigators submitting human gene transfer proposals for Recombinant DNA 
Advisory Committee review must include the Informed Consent document as 
approved by the local Institutional Review Boards. A separate Informed 
Consent document should be used for the gene transfer portion of a research 
project when gene transfer is used as an adjunct in the study of another 
technique, e.g., when a gene is used as a 'marker' or to enhance the power of 
immunotherapy for cancer. 
``Because of the relative novelty of the procedures that are used, the potentially 
irreversible consequences of the procedures performed, and the fact that many 
of the potential risks remain undefined, the Informed Consent process should 
include the following specific information in addition to any requirements of the 
DHHS regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR 46). Indicate 
if each of the specified items appears in the Informed Consent document or, if 
not included in the Informed Consent document, how those items will be 
presented to potential subjects. Include an explanation if any of the following 
items are omitted from the consent process or the Informed Consent document. 


Appendix M-I-D-2-a. General Requirements of Human Subjects Research 


Appendix M-I-D-2-a-(1). Description/purpose of the study. 


``The subjects should be provided with a detailed explanation in non-technical 
language of the purpose of the study and the procedures associated with the 
conduct of the proposed study, including a description of the gene transfer 
component. 


Appendix M-I-D-2-a-(2). Alternatives. 

``The Informed Consent document should indicate the availability of therapies 
and the possibility of other investigational interventions and approaches. 


Appendix M-I-D-2-a-(3). Voluntary participation. 

``The subjects should be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and 
that failure to participate in the study or withdrawal of consent will not result in 
any penalty or loss of benefits to which the subjects are otherwise entitled. 


Appendix M-I-D-2-a-(4). Benefits. 


``The subjects should be provided with an accurate description of the possible 
benefits, if any, of participating in the proposed study. For studies that are not 
reasonably expected to provide a therapeutic benefit to subjects, the Informed 
Consent document should clearly state that no direct clinical benefit to subjects 
is expected to occur as a result of participation in the study, although knowledge 
may be gained that may benefit others. 


Appendix M-I-D-2-a-(5). Possible risks, discomforts, and side effects. 


``There should be clear itemization in the Informed Consent document of types 
of adverse experiences, their relative severity, and their expected frequencies. 
For consistency, the following definitions are suggested: side effects that are 
listed as mild should be ones which do not require a therapeutic intervention; 
moderate side effects require an intervention; and severe side effects are 
potentially fatal or life-threatening, disabling, or require prolonged 
hospitalization. 
``If verbal descriptors (e.g., `rare,' `uncommon,' or `frequent') are used to express 
quantitative information regarding risk, these terms should be explained. 
``The Informed Consent document should provide information regarding the 
approximate number of people who have previously received the genetic 
material under study. It is necessary to warn potential subjects that, for genetic 
materials previously used in relatively few or no humans, unforeseen risks are 
possible, including ones that could be severe.

``The Informed Consent document should indicate any possible adverse medical 
consequences that may occur if the subjects withdraw from the study once the 
study has started. 


Appendix M-I-D-2-a-(6). Costs. 

``The subjects should be provided with specific information about any financial 
costs associated with their participation in the protocol and in the long-term 
follow-up to the protocol that are not covered by the investigators or the 
institution involved. 
``Subjects should be provided an explanation about the extent to which they will 
be responsible for any costs for medical treatment required as a result of 
research-related injury. 


Appendix M-I-D-2-b. Specific Requirements of Gene Transfer Research 




Appendix M-I-D-2-b-(1). Reproductive considerations. 


``To avoid the possibility that any of the reagents employed in the gene transfer 
research could cause harm to a fetus/child, subjects should be given information 
concerning possible risks and the need for contraception by males and females 
during the active phase of the study. The period of time for the use of 
contraception should be specified. 
``The inclusion of pregnant or lactating women should be addressed. 


Appendix M-I-D-2-b-(2). Long-term follow-up. 


``To permit evaluation of long-term safety and efficacy of gene transfer, the 
prospective subjects should be informed that they are expected to cooperate in 
long-term follow-up that extends beyond the active phase of the study. The 
Informed Consent document should include a list of persons who can be 
contacted in the event that questions arise during the follow-up period. The 
principal investigator should request that subjects continue to provide a current 
address and telephone number. 
``The subjects should be informed that any significant findings resulting from the 
study will be made known in a timely manner to them and/or their parent or 
guardian including new information about the experimental procedure, the 
harms and benefits experienced by other individuals involved in the study, and 
any long-term effects that have been observed.
 


Appendix M-I-D-2-b-(3). Request for autopsy.

 ``To obtain vital information about the safety and efficacy of gene transfer, 
autopsies are to be performed, if feasible. Subjects should be informed that at 
the time of death, no matter what the cause, permission for any autopsy will be 
requested of their families. Subjects should be asked to advise their families of 
the request and of its scientific and medical importance. 


Appendix M-I-D-2-b-(4). Interest of the 
media and others in the research. 


``To alert subjects that others may have an interest in the innovative character of 
the protocol and in the status of the treated subjects, the subjects should be 
informed of the following: (i) that the institution and investigators will make 
efforts to provide protection from the media in an effort to protect the 
participants' privacy, and (ii) that representatives of applicable Federal agencies 
(e.g., the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration), 
representatives of collaborating institutions, vector suppliers, etc., will have 
access to the subjects' medical records.'' 
I accept this recommendation, and Appendix M-I-D, Informed Consent, of the 
NIH Guidelines will be added accordingly. 


B. Amendment to Appendix M-VI of the NIH Guidelines Regarding Procedures 
to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human Gene Transfer Experiments

<TEXT>
 

On April 29, 1994, Dr. Nelson Wivel of the Office of Recombinant DNA 
Activities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, requested that 
Appendix M-VI, Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human Gene Transfer Experiments,
be amended to clarify submission 
requirements. 

The Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human 
Gene Transfer Experiments currently reads: 

``Appendix M-VI-D. Regardless of the method of review, the Points to Consider is the standard of review
for all gene transfer protocols.'' 

The proposed amendment reads: 

``Appendix M-VI-D. Regardless of the method of review, the Points to Consider is the standard of review
for all gene transfer protocols; therefore, submission of the response to the Points to Consider is required.'' 

The proposed amendment was reviewed by the Recombinant DNA Advisory 
Committee during the June 9-10, 1994, meeting. The Recombinant DNA 
Advisory Committee approved a motion to accept the proposed amendment to 
Appendix M-VI, Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient Human Gene Transfer Experiments,
by a vote of 13 in favor, 0 opposed, and no abstentions. 

I accept this recommendation, and Appendix M-VI, Procedures to be Followed for Expedited Review of Single Patient
Human Gene Transfer Experiments, of the NIH Guidelines will be amended accordingly. 



C. Deletion of Appendix L of the NIH Guidelines Regarding Release into the 
Environment 



On April 29, 1994, Dr. Nelson Wivel of the Office of Recombinant DNA 
Activities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, requested that 
Appendix L, Release into the Environment of Certain Plants, be deleted from the NIH Guidelines based on the following:
(1) Section I of the NIH Guidelines 
allows experiments to proceed that are reviewed and approved by another 
Federal agency that has jurisdiction for review and approval without the 
necessity for NIH review or approval (52 FR 31849); (2) the Recombinant DNA 
Advisory Committee has not reviewed any deliberate release experiment 
involving recombinant DNA since 1984; (3) at its May 30-31, 1991, meeting, the 
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee recommended that Section III-A-2 be 
deleted from the NIH Guidelines; and (4) experiments involving deliberate 
release into the environment are currently reviewed within the framework of 
existing Federal regulations, as administered by the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 

Section I of the NIH Guidelines was amended on August 24, 1987, such that any recombinant DNA experiment (other than
human gene transfer) may proceed 
without Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee and NIH approval if it has 
been reviewed and approved by another Federal agency that has jurisdiction 
over such a proposal. The amended version (52 FR 31849) of Section I reads as 
follows: 



Section I-A. Purpose 



``* * *Any recombinant DNA experiment, which according to the NIH Guidelines requires approval by
the NIH, must be submitted to the NIH or to another Federal agency that has jurisdiction for review and approval. Once
approval, or other applicable clearances, have been obtained from a Federal agency other than the NIH (whether the
experiment is referred to that agency by the NIH or sent directly there by the submitter), the experiment may proceed
without the necessity for NIH review or approval* * *.'' 

On December 6, 1990, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee Planning 
Subcommittee recommended that the requirement for Recombinant DNA 
Advisory Committee review of experiments involving deliberate environmental 
release of organisms containing recombinant DNA be eliminated from the NIH 
Guidelines. This recommendation reflected the fact that the Federal regulatory 
agencies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection 
Agency, are responsible for the review and approval of environmental release 
experiments. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee reviewed the request 
and recommended that the following sections be deleted from the NIH 
Guidelines (Actions Under the Guidelines, 

Federal Register

, July 5, Part III): 



Section III-A-2. 



Deliberate release into the environment of any organism 
containing recombinant DNA except those listed below. The term ``deliberate 
release'' is defined as a planned introduction of recombinant DNA-containing 
microorganisms, plants, or animals into the environment. 



Section III-A-2-a.

 Introductions conducted under conditions considered to be accepted scientific practices in which there is adequate
evidence of biological and/or physical control of the recombinant DNA-containing organisms. The nature of such
evidence is described in Appendix L. 



Section III-A-2-b.

 Deletion derivatives and single base changes not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines.

Rearrangements involving the introduction of DNA from different strains of the 
same species
