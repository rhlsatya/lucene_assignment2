DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 



Office of the Secretary













Disclosure of Code-Sharing Arrangements and Long-Term Wet Leases
 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Transportation; Office of the Secretary. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM); Denial of petition for 
rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department proposes to strengthen its current rules 
requiring airlines to notify consumers of the existence of a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease whereby
the operator of a flight differs from the airline in whose name the transportation was sold. This action is being taken
to ensure that consumers have pertinent information about airline code-sharing arrangements and long-term wet
leases on domestic and international flights. The Department is proposing: (1) to require ticket agents (including
travel agents) doing business in the United States and foreign air carriers, as well as U.S. air carriers, to give consumers
reasonable and timely notice that the travel they are considering purchasing will be provided by an airline different
from the airline holding out the transportation, and to disclose the identity of the airline that will actually operate
the aircraft; and (2) for tickets issued in the United States, to require U.S. and foreign air carriers and ticket agents
(including travel agents) to provide written notice of the transporting carrier's identity at the time of sale of
transportation involving a code-sharing or long-term wet-lease arrangement. The Department also wants to consider
seriously a 
requirement to print the transporting carrier's identity on the flight coupon for services involving a code-sharing
or long-term wet-lease arrangement. The Department is making this proposal on its own initiative. In addition, the
Department is denying a petition filed in Docket 48710 by Donald Pevsner that requested a complete ban on code-sharing
arrangements. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Several sources of information on airline services widely used in the 
United States_most notably the Official Airline Guide and computer 
reservations systems `` use a two-character airline designator code to 
identify the carrier operating a flight. Code-sharing is the term given 
to a common airline industry marketing practice where, by mutual agreement between cooperating carriers, at least
one of the airline designator codes used on a flight is different from that of the airline operating the aircraft. In
one version, two or more airlines each use their own designator codes on the same aircraft operation. Although only
one airline operates the flight, each airline in a code-sharing arrangement may hold out, market and sell the flight
as its own in published schedules. 

The term ``code-sharing'' also refers to other arrangements where the code on a passenger's ticket is not that of the
operator of the flight, but where the operator does not also hold out the service in its own name. Such code-sharing
arrangements are common between commuter air carriers and their larger 
affiliates. Arrangements falling into this category are similar to leases of aircraft and crew (wet leases). 

The Department regulates all international code-sharing arrangements 
as wet leases under 14 CFR Parts 207, 208, 212 and 218. 

Although code-sharing and wet-lease arrangements can offer significant consumer benefits, they can also be misleading
unless consumers know that the transportation they are buying will not be provided by the airline whose designator
code is shown on the ticket and unless they know the identity of the airline on which they will be flying. The recent growth
in use of code-sharing, wet-leasing and similar marketing tools, particularly in international air transportation,
has given the Department concern about whether the current disclosure rules (described below) protect the public
interest adequately. This notice proposes to strengthen the rules and requests public comment. 



Benefits of Code-Sharing Services 



In its examination of domestic 
airline interline practices, the Department noted that only 10% of passengers on certificated air carriers used
interline services, indicating the strong preference of passengers on connecting flights for on-line service.
Interline Practices in the Airline Industry at 24 (January 1986). There may be even fewer today. Data for the quarter
ended September 30, 1993, show that interline passengers account for approximately 2.3% of total passengers based
on the Department's Passenger Origin and Destination Survey. Code-sharing arrangements, which enable airlines
to hold out multi-carrier connections as on-line service, are, in part, a market response to this demand for on-line

service. Often, code-sharing partners offer services similar to those available for on-line connections with the
goal of offering ``seamless'' 
service (i.e., service where the transfers from flight to flight or airline to airline are facilitated). They may,
for example, locate gates near each other to make connections more convenient, or coordinate baggage handling to
give greater assurance that baggage will be properly handled.

In addition, airlines claim that code-sharing can help them operate more 
efficiently, because they can spread costs by providing a joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate
services with two aircraft. Particularly in thin markets, this efficiency can increase consumers' price and service
options or enable the use of equipment sized appropriately for the market. Thus, overall, the Department believes
that code-sharing can offer significant economic benefits. 

Code-sharing services have expanded significantly since USAir (then 
Allegheny Airlines) set up the first code-sharing arrangements in the 1960s. A 1986 DOT study of the regional airline
industry found that code-sharing agreements were a prominent feature of the nationwide air service network. A Study
of the Regional Airline Industry at 80 (May 1986). The study also found that 16 of the 20 largest regional airlines operating
in the continental U.S. participated in a code-sharing agreement with a major airline. Id. at 27. The Regional Airline
Association's 1993 Annual Report reported that by 1992, the largest 29 regional carriers were code-sharing, 36 of
the largest 50 regional airlines had code-sharing agreements, and 96% of regional airline passengers flew on code-sharing
carriers. 

Similarly, international code-shares, which have existed at least since the early 1980s, have expanded recently.
Early international code-shares 
tended to involve individual routes; the more recent trend has been towards 
code-sharing agreements that involve total route systems, such as the one 
between Northwest and KLM. Today, most major U.S. airlines have code-sharing agreements with foreign airlines.




Benefits of Wet Leases 



Some airlines perform some or all of their scheduled passenger air transportation services by contracting for the
equipment and crew of another carrier (wet lease). Operating by wet lease can permit such carriers to offer services
that might otherwise be unavailable. The flexibility to contract with other airlines for equipment and crew to fill
operational needs benefits the public by avoiding disruptions and creating service alternatives that could not
otherwise be provided. 



DOT Regulatory Policy and Statutory Bases



Section 41712 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code (formerly  411 of the Federal Aviation Act) authorizes the Department
to decide if a U.S. or foreign air carrier or ticket agent (including travel agents) has engaged in unfair or deceptive
practices and to ban such practices. Under that section, the Department has adopted various regulations and policies
to prevent unfair or deceptive practices, such as the rules governing computer reservations systems (14 CFR Part
255) and the policy on fare advertising (14 CFR  399.84). 

Although code-sharing and wet-leasing can afford public benefits, they 
can also confuse and mislead the public unless prospective travelers are aware of the arrangements before they select
a flight. Current DOT policy has dealt only with code-sharing, and has been to consider the practice to be unfair and
deceptive and in violation of 49 U.S.C.  41712 unless consumers are given reasonable and timely notice of the
existence of the code-sharing arrangement. 14 C.F.R. 399.88 (Docket No. 42199, 50 FR 38508, September 23, 1985).
The policy statement expressly applies only to U.S. air carriers, however. It states that the obligation to give ``reasonable
notice'' requires air carriers, at a minimum to: 




(1) Identify, with an asterisk or other means, each flight in which 
the airline code is different from the code of the airline actually providing the service, in written or electronic
schedule information; 

(2) Provide information in any direct oral communication with a consumer concerning a code-sharing flight sufficient
to alert the consumer that the flight will occur on an airline different from the airline whose code is shown on the ticket
and identify the airline(s) actually providing the service; and 

(3) provide frequent, periodic notice in advertising media of the existence of a code-sharing relationship and the
identities of the airline(s) actually providing the service. 




Thus, the current policy recognizes that, to be timely, notice must be given during all discussions about a code-shared
flight. Consumers must be given clear notice before they make reservations or buy transportation both that the service
they are considering is on a code-shared flight and of the actual operator's identity, so that they can consider these
facts in making travel purchase decisions. 

When adopted, the policy statement on code-sharing disclosure was not 
applied directly to ticket agents, since it was believed that ticket agents 
would communicate important information to travelers to retain them as clients. 49 FR 43709; October 31, 1984. Furthermore,
section 41712 of title 
49 of the U.S. Code prohibits unfair and deceptive practices by ticket 
agents, and Department rules also prohibit ticket agents from 
misrepresenting the kind or quality of service being sold. 14 CFR 399.80(c). In practice, the Department has not expressly
required ticket agents to disclose code-sharing arrangements, although it would consider enforcement action against
ticket agents who misrepresent code-sharing services as single-carrier services in response to specific inquiries.


Moreover, since there were few code-sharing arrangements between U.S. and 
foreign air carriers at the time of its adoption, the policy did not 
explicitly cover foreign air carriers. 14 CFR 399.88. To some extent, the Department has since moved to address this
matter. Specifically, when the Department approves a code-sharing arrangement involving a foreign air carrier,
it now explicitly requires the foreign air carrier to adhere to the requirements of 14 CFR 399.88 as a condition of its
approval. See, 

e.g.,

 Order 94-5-35 (May 24, 1994).

<TEXT>
 

Finally, although the earlier notification rule did not cover wet leases 
other than code-sharing arrangements as then defined, other wet leases appear to present similar opportunities
to mislead consumers into thinking that they are buying transportation from one carrier, when in fact the transporting
carrier will be different. 

The Department continues to believe that the public interest is best 
served by permitting carriers to engage in code-sharing and wet-lease 
arrangements, so long as the public is given reasonable notice.
 These 
arrangements can expand the price and service options available to consumers. Moreover, several of our international
agreements specifically authorize code-sharing arrangements. We have determined, therefore, to limit this rulemaking
to whether more notice is necessary to assure adequate public disclosure. We will not expand it to entertain comments
on other issues, such as whether code-sharing should be banned. 





Inadequacy of the Current Rule 



Experience with the increasing number of code-sharing arrangements in recent years, combined with consumers' receiving
only haphazard disclosure, has tentatively persuaded us to modify our rules. A recent DOT enforcement investigation
found that airlines and travel agents failed to disclose code-sharing arrangements 30% of the time. In the case of
two particular airlines, failure to disclose was the norm. The Department has taken enforcement action against those
companies, including the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the assessment of civil penalties and the issuance
of warning letters. However, enforcement action alone will not solve the overall problem. 

Failure to disclose the relationship and the identity of the actual flight 
operator is deceptive and can result in confusion, hardship and inconvenience to consumers. It can also increase
the costs of travel unexpectedly. For example, the Department receives complaints from consumers who mistakenly
assumed that their carrier would use jet aircraft, rather than propeller-driven aircraft. Consumers enrolled in
the frequent-flyer program of the airline whose code was on the ticket have found that they got no or fewer miles when
they flew on the code-sharing partner's flights or that miles could be earned but not used on such flights or vice versa.
Consumers have reported not knowing where to check in, a problem that can result in missed connections. Elderly or
physically challenged passengers needing particular equipment have complained that the failure to disclose the
code-sharing arrangement and the actual operator's identity has inconvenienced them. Travelers have only discovered
at the airport that their flight was being operated by an airline they preferred not to use, a situation that can occur
whenever a wet-lease arrangement is involved. Finally, consumers have complained that a service held out as on-line
was in fact interline and there was no integration between the two airlines. These problems can also occur with certain
wet leases. The Department believes that consumers can make travel decisions to avoid such problems if carriers and
ticket agents notify them adequately. 



Proposed Changes 



First, the Department has tentatively concluded that no basis exists for differentiating among U.S. air carriers,
ticket agents doing business in the United States, and foreign air carriers in the requirement to give full disclosure.
Thus, we propose to expand the rule to cover the latter two classes explicitly. Ticket agents (including travel agents)
sell about 80% of all airline tickets issued in the United States. Secretary's Task Force on Competition in the U.S.
Domestic Airline Industry, Airline Marketing Practices: Travel Agencies, Frequent Flyer Programs, and Computer
Reservations Systems at 7 (1990). A requirement that applies to only 20% of ticket sales affords the public too little
protection. We therefore propose to require ticket agents doing business in the United States and foreign air carriers,

when giving information about air transportation involving code-sharing arrangements, to disclose these arrangements
and the identity of the 
transporting carrier, just as U.S. airlines are currently required to do. 
This should not be a burden to ticket agents since, to avoid misrepresentations, they are already required to tell
consumers when asked that the carrier holding out the service is not the same as the one operating the flight. Ticket
agents should also be able to identify code-shared flights easily, since computer reservations systems already
identify them and airlines can update those systems to reflect changes very quickly. As noted above, extending the
notice requirement to foreign air carriers merely conforms our rules to agency practice when we approve code-share
applications. In this way, we hope to assure that all U.S. consumers have a complete understanding of the 
transportation they are buying at the time when they make a travel purchase decision. 

Some domestic code-sharing arrangements consist of several commuter carriers that operate under a ``network''
name, e.g., Northwest Airlink, Delta Connection. In disclosing the transporting carrier for purposes of this rule,
it is permissible to use such a network name if that is the name in which the service is generally held out to the public.
Since the purpose of this rule is to prevent confusion, we do not wish to require disclosure of a corporate name that
is not the name used by the carrier to identify itself in airports or in advertisements and will thus mean nothing to
consumers. However, we remind airlines and ticket agents that the proposed rule requires disclosure not only of the
name of the transporting carrier or network, but also of the fact that this entity is not the one shown on the ticket.
Since many network names may connote a special type of service rather than a different carrier, the transporting airline
should be identified with a statement such as ``our affiliate, Northwest Airlink'' or ``our partner in travel, Delta
Connection.''

Second, we also propose to require U.S. and foreign air carriers and ticket agents (including travel agents) to provide
written notice of the transporting carrier's identity in conjunction with the sale of any air 
transportation sold in the United States that involves a code-sharing 
arrangement or long-term wet lease. The proposed rule would therefore 
require that, if a separate itinerary is issued with the ticket, the itinerary contain a legend that states ``Operated
by'' followed by the name of the transporting carrier in conjunction with the listing of any flight segment on which
the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier. In the case of single-flight number service where a segment
will be operated by a carrier other than the carrier in whose name the transportation was sold, the rule would require
the carrier identity for that segment to be disclosed, e.g., ``Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated
by Jane Doe Airlines.'' 

If no itinerary is issued, the proposal would require the selling carrier 
or ticket agent to provide a separate written notice that clearly 
identifies the transporting carrier for any flight segment on which the 
designator code is not that of the transporting carrier. The following 
notice would satisfy this requirement:




``IMPORTANT NOTICE: Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines.'' 




Many ticket agents and airlines already provide written information that 
specifies the carrier that will operate the service on behalf of the 
airline shown on the ticket. Thus, addition of this notice should not be 
unduly burdensome. 

The Department intends that this written notice be given to any consumer buying, in the United States, air transportation
involving any arrangement whereby one carrier uses the code of another except for short-term wet leases, as discussed
below. The separate written notice requirement would apply whether or not the consumer is given an actual ticket to
evidence the transportation, and it must be given or sent when he or she buys the transportation. Further, the Department
tentatively concludes that it would not be acceptable to make this written notice a standard part of tickets given
to every consumer, because consumers would not be able to tell from a universal notice whether their particular flight
was a code-shared operation. 

However, the Department remains concerned that the appearance of one carrier's designator code on the face of the
ticket, or flight coupon, when the service is in fact being provided by a different carrier may mislead some passengers.
In particular, we are concerned that some passengers may rely on their flight coupons for information, notwithstanding
the presence of an itinerary. We are seriously considering a requirement that, where the designator code on the ticket
is not that of the transporting carrier on any flight segment, there must be printed on the flight coupon covering that
segment (1) the asterisk that already identifies flights listed in the CRS under an airline code different from that
of the transporting carrier; and (2) a legend elsewhere on the coupon that states the transporting carrier's identity
preceded by the words ``operated by.'' This information is already 
available in the CRSs, and the Department invites specific technical 
comments on the feasibility and costs of implementation or on alternative ways of providing the information on the
ticket. Comments should be supported by concrete data and economic analysis and should contain sufficient detail
to allow the Department to evaluate the position advocated. If the Department were to adopt such a requirement, it
would be in addition to the separate written notice requirement. 

The above oral and written notification requirements would apply to most 
situations in which the operating airline is different from the one in whose name the service is being held out, including
code-sharing arrangements and long-term wet leases. The Department believes that, as a general rule, consumers
are entitled to know both the identity of the company that will be transporting them and the one holding out the transportation.


However, the Department recognizes that periodically situations arisewhere full disclosure is impractical or
would be extremely disruptive. For example, advance notification is impossible where an aircraft is rendered unusable
and temporary substitute transportation is arranged at the last minute. For this reason, the Department proposes
to apply the rule only to long-term wet leases. The proposed rule would use the same definition of long-term wet lease
that appears in other parts of the Department's regulations, i.e., a lease of aircraft and crew that either lasts more
than 60 days or is part of a series of such leases that amounts to a continuing arrangement lasting more than 60 days.
The Department would nonetheless expect that, in the interest of 
maintaining good customer relations, an airline or ticket agent would make every effort to notify consumers of changes
in the operator of a flight that take place after they have purchased their transportation. 

Finally, the Department proposes to clarify the current obligation of code-sharing partners to include clear notice
about the code-sharing arrangement in public advertisements. As written, the current policy 
statement merely directs the partners to advertise the fact of the 
arrangement and the identity of the actual operator periodically. To comply, carriers have routinely included general
and often uninformative language in advertisements, whether or not they are advertising code-shared services.
We tentatively conclude that this does not suffice. We consider that it would be more useful to the public if the partners
were required to include both the nature of the operational arrangement and the identity of the transporting carrier
only when they are advertising services in a city-pair market where the service is provided under a code-sharing arrangement
or by long-term 
wet lease.

<PARENT> FR940810-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Because the Department believes that the rule conforms in many ways to 
prevailing practice, it believes that airlines and ticket agents can 
implement the proposed changes at little, if any, cost. We invite 
specific cost data to help us evaluate the cost to the industry of 
complying with the proposed requirements if any commenter believes the 
cost to be burdensome. In particular, the Department is interested in 
comments regarding its proposal to cover all types of long-term wet 
leases. Opponents of this aspect of the proposal should support their 
comments with economic or other data that would assist the Department 
in distinguishing among types of wet lease for the purpose of protecting 
consumers from unfair and deceptive practices. 

As discussed above, the Department also requests that commenters 
address its concern that, despite the separate written notice that is 
being proposed, the current approach to printing flight coupons may 
mislead the consumer. 

The Department recognizes that the airlines and ticket agents will 
require time to implement the proposed separate written notice 
requirement. The Department is proposing that the final rule be 
effective 60 days after publication, but it requests comments on other 
possible effective dates. In addition, we invite information about the 
time necessary to implement inclusion of the transporting carrier's 
identity on flight coupons if we should adopt a rule requiring this. 

The Department also proposes to remove 14 CFR 399.88 of the 
Policy Statements, since the proposed rule would replace it. 



Regulatory Analyses and Notices 



The Department has determined that this action is not a significant 
regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures. The
Department has placed a regulatory evaluation that examines the estimated costs and impacts of the proposal in the
docket. 

The Department certifies that this rule, if adopted, would not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
Although many ticket agents and some air carriers are small entities, 
the Department believes that the costs of notification will be minimal. 
The Department seeks comment on whether there are small entity impacts 
that should be considered. If comments provide information that there 
are significant small entity impacts, the Department will prepare a 
regulatory flexibility analysis at the final rule stage. 

The Department does not believe that there would be sufficient 
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism 
assessment. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The proposed rule does not contain information collection requirements 
that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 2507 et seq.).

 257.4 

Unfair and deceptive practice. 



The holding out and sale of scheduled passenger air transportation 
involving a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease is 
prohibited as unfair and deceptive in violation of 49 U.S.C.  41712 
unless, in conjunction with such holding out or sale, carriers and 
ticket agents follow the requirements of this part. 



 257.5 

Notice requirement. 



(a) 

Notice in schedules. 

In written or electronic schedule information 
provided by carriers to the public, the Official Airline Guide and 
comparable publications, and, where applicable, computer reservations 
systems, carriers involved in code-sharing arrangements or long-term 
wet leases shall ensure that an asterisk or other easily recognizable 
mark identifies each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation 
on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier. 

(b) 

Oral notice to prospective consumers. 

In any direct oral 
communication with a prospective consumer concerning a flight that is 
part of a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease, a ticket 
agent doing business in the United States or a carrier 
shall tell the consumer, before booking transportation, that the 
transporting carrier is not the carrier whose designator code will 
appear on the ticket and shall identify the transporting carrier. 

(c) 

Written notice. 

At the time of sale, each selling carrier or ticket 
agent shall provide each consumer of scheduled passenger air 
transportation sold in the United States that involves a code-sharing 
arrangement or long-term wet lease with the following notice: 
(1) If an itinerary is issued, there shall appear in conjunction 
with the listing of any flight segment on which the designator code 
is not that of the transporting carrier a legend that states 
``Operated by'' followed by the name of the transporting carrier. In 
the case of single-flight number service involving a segment or 
segments on which the designator code is not that of the 
transporting carrier, the notice shall clearly identify the 
segment or segments and the transporting carrier. The following 
form of statement will satisfy the requirement of the preceding 
sentence:






IMPORTANT NOTICE: 

Service between XYZ City and ABC 
City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines; or




(2) If no itinerary is issued, the selling carrier or ticket agent shall 
provide a separate written notice that identifies clearly the 
transporting carrier for any flight segment on which the designator 
code is not that of the transporting carrier. The following form of 
notice will satisfy the requirement of this subparagraph:




IMPORTANT NOTICE: Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines.




(d) 

Advertising.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Environmental Protection Agency proposes to grant an exemption from the oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) requirements to the State of Michigan. These requirements include adopting and implementing regulations addressing
general conformity, transportation conformity, inspection and maintenance, reasonably available control technology,
and new source review. In the Final Rules Section of this 

Federal Register

, EPA is granting the State's exemption request, as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If EPA receives adverse comments,
the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule
based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested
in commenting on this notice should do so at this time.

Proposed Flood Elevation Determinations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Technical information or comments are requested on the proposed base (100-year) flood elevations and proposed base
flood elevation modifications for the communities listed below. The base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis
for the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being
already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP).

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA or Agency) proposes to make determinations of base (100-year) flood
elevations and modified base flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with section 110 of
the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 



These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings. 



National Environmental Policy Act. 

This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration.
No environmental impact assessment has been prepared. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act. 

The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared. 



Regulatory Classification. 

This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism.

 This proposed rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,
dated October 26, 1987. 



Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. 

This proposed rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

Standards for Damage Stability of New Domestic Passenger Vessels



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking with request for comments; notice of public hearing.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to amend the rules, on standards for damage stability, that it adopted on December 10, 1992.
Amended rules are necessary to relieve certain vessels of an unforeseen regulatory burden. The amended rules proposed
here would relieve those vessels of that burden and yet minimize the potential for capsizing and other casualties
caused by inadequate damage stability.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request For Data, Views, and Arguments




This notice encourages the submission of comments on the proposed changes to 46 CFR 171.080(e). It is the Coast Guard's
goal to implement regulations that will best address both the safety, and the operational needs, of all vessels. All
new domestic passenger vessels, as defined in 46 CFR 171.045, must now meet the standards for damage stability in 46
CFR 171.080(e). These standards were based on one developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for
any passenger vessel allowed to carry 12 or more passengers on an international voyage (under a ``SOLAS Passenger
Ship Certificate''). The Coast Guard again seeks advice from owners and operators of vessels, naval architects,
shipyards, its own inspectors, classification societies' inspectors, consumers, crews of vessels, and others
involved in affected vessels' compliance with  171.080(e), either as it stands or as this proposed rule would
amend it. Interested persons are invited and encouraged to participate by submitting written data, views, and arguments.

Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice [CGD 94-010],
identify the specific paragraph of the section to which each comment applies, and include supporting documents or
sufficient detail to indicate the reason for each comment. The Coast Guard will acknowledge receipt of comments if
a stamped, self-addressed post card or envelope is enclosed with the comments.


Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in the drafting of this final rule are Patricia L. Carrigan, Project Manager, Office
of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection and Patrick J. Murray, Project Counsel, Office of Chief
Counsel.

Background and Purpose



Regulatory History



On February 13, 1990, the Coast Guard published [55 FR 5120] a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Stability
Design and Operational Regulations. During the 60-day comment period, the Coast Guard received 28 letters. Only
2 of the 28 included comments on the standards for damage stability of new domestic passenger vessels in the proposed
rule.

On September 11, 1992, the Coast Guard published [57 FR 41812] a final rule, also entitled Stability Design and Operational
Regulations. This adopted standards from the proposed rule.

On December 10, 1992, the final rule went into effect. Soon afterward, the Coast Guard received inquiries on the appropriateness
of the standards, now in 46 CFR 171.808(e), for certain new domestic passenger vessels.

On July 7, 1993, the Coast Guard published [58 FR 36374] a notice to announce a public meeting on August 5, 1993. This
meeting was to discuss what problems were being encountered in complying with the standards and what measures might
be appropriate.

On August 5, 1993, at the public meeting, discussions occurred on the application of the standards to certain new domestic
passenger vessels, especially those operating in protected and partially-protected waters. Comments indicated
that some designers were encountering unexpected difficulties.

The Coast Guard believes that compliance with the current standards is feasible, and achievable with minimal changes
in design. But it also believes that it can relax those standards on certain waters without unreasonably degrading
safety.

On August 27, 1993, therefore, in response to requests that it reconsider the standards to apply on certain waters,
the Coast Guard published [58 FR 45264] a notice temporarily suspending  171.080(e), for all vessels without
SOLAS Passenger Ship Certificates, and reopening the comment period for 90 days. The delay would also allow further
research by the Coast Guard into the application of the standard to new domestic passenger vessels.

On February 25, 1994, in response to the comments received, the Coast Guard both published a notice of intent to issue
this NPRM and indefinitely extended the temporary suspension of  171.080(e), for all vessels without SOLAS
Passenger Ship Certificates [59 FR 9099].



Reasons for Reconsidering Standards for Damage Stability



Even as recently as February 13, 1990, the sudden growth in the number of excursion vessels and gambling vessels on
protected and partially-protected waters, especially western rivers, was unforeseen. By December 10, 1992, therefore,
when the current standards came into effect, further research and investigation of the impact of the standards on
these vessels had become necessary.

The Coast Guard extended its work with the Volpe Transportation Systems Center of the Department of Transportation
to examine at least six more vessels as we had examined a number earlier in the regulatory process. The six vessels so
far submitted for examination ply mainly protected and partially-protected waters; they include gambling vessels,
a type not examined closely in the earlier study. A detailed analysis of the failures, design changes and economic
impact will be available in the regulatory docket when the study concludes.



Comments on Final Rule of December 10, 1992



Comments on Final Rule in General



Nine comments conceded that some degree of after-damage stability is needed. Three comments maintained that the
current regulations aim at ensuring ``total survivability'' rather than a reasonable degree of safety. Three comments
urged that the regulations should not be relaxed without more evidence that relaxing them is necessary, and even then
not without following the correct legal procedure. Two comments stated that suspending a regulation already in effect
6 months was unlawful; they stated further that no balance was achieved in this suspension, that the suspension favored
purely shipyards, owners and operators, and naval architects, and that no response had arrived from passengers,
crews, or insurance underwriters. One comment, further, stated that 3 years had been necessary to accomplish the
regulation, 11/2 months to emasculate it.

One comment stated that, far from needing a relaxed standard, vessels on inland rivers might need a standard more stringent
than that of SOLAS. Inland rivers face many dangers not considered in the development of international standards,
including treacherous currents and heavy traffic. New standards for vessels on these rivers should actually increase
residual buoyancy and reduce heel and trim to facilitate evacuation.

Two comments questioned the use of the standard from SOLAS for coastwise domestic routes as well as inland routes.
Two more questioned its use for any domestic route, even for exposed waters.



Response to Comments on Final Rule in General



The Coast Guard agrees that passenger safety is its primary concern and that the old standards for damage stability
were grossly inadequate. The Coast Guard disagrees that the current standards aim at, let alone ensure, ``total survivability.''
However, the Coast Guard is bound to consider seriously the input received from the industry, and to determine whether
these standards are having a greater impact than intended. The Coast Guard has invited and will continue to invite
comment on these standards from all interested parties, observing that it cannot force those sectors of the industry
not heard from to develop a position on these standards. However, in everyone's interest, the Coast Guard makes safety
its primary concern in all standards for vessel design. The Coast Guard followed proper legal procedures in the suspension
of these standards.

The Coast Guard agrees that smaller vessels, with fewer passengers, should receive less burdensome treatment. However,
where these vessels venture into exposed waters, the hazard to them is much greater than to large ones.

Responding to reasoned comments, the Coast Guard considers the best approach one that applies standards in tiers:
full rigor for craft most vulnerable (for whatever reason, including exposure of waters), less rigor for those less
vulnerable. This approach has determined the shape of this proposed rule.

Comments on Final Rule Citing Particular Provisions


1. Current   171.080(e)(1) and (e)(2)


Seven comments stated that the standard of a 15 degree range of stability in paragraph (e)(1) is unreasonable for wide-beam
vessels and should be deleted if the area standard is met. One comment suggested that the range be limited to the angle
developed from application of wind heel in  170.070.
Seven comments found paragraph (e)(2) completely unreasonable in its treatment of watertight closures. Four comments
stated that weathertight closures should not be considered points of flooding in damage stability.


2. Current  171.080(e)(3)


Four comments found paragraph (e)(3) to be reasonable. 


3. Current  171.080(e)(4)(i)


One comment stated that there should be no standard for passenger heeling moment, because its author's vessels operate
close to shore and have crews trained in passenger control to avoid extreme heeling moments. Four comments stated
that the standard of a 0.10 meter righting arm for passenger heeling moment seemed reasonable. Five comments stated
that the standard for passenger heeling moment should be limited to that for intact stability in  171.050. One
comment stated that standards for passenger heeling moments are necessary even for inland waters. One comment stated
that the standard for residual passenger heeling moment exceeds those for intact wind heeling moment and intact passenger
heeling moment. One comment cited a 150-passenger aluminum ``T-boat'' (small passenger vessel) built in 1988 as
a sample of a typical vessel that cannot comply with the standard for passenger heeling moment. One comment stated
that, of the vessels examined that met the old damage stability standard easily, four had flooded decks trying to meet
the current one for passenger heeling moment.


4. Current  171.080(e)(4)(iii)


One comment suggested that we delete the standard for lifeboat heeling moment since no ``T-boat'' has davit-launched
lifeboats.


Response to Comments on Final Rule Citing Particular Provisions


It is unacceptable for standards (whether governing design or operation) to assume that all vessels will stay close
to shore or that the crew will, in all situations, be able to control passengers so as to avoid extreme heeling moments.
However, a tiered approach, based on route, will give these factors some weight. Again, equivalency between standards
for intact stability and those for damage stability is not the goal. Those for intact stability must ensure sufficient
stability in all intact conditions of operation, while those for damage stability must ensure sufficient stability
to keep the vessel afloat and allow time for safe evacuation of the passengers in all required cases of damage or inadvertent
flooding. The putative 1988-built vessel was not available to examine for compliance with the standards as, contrary
to the comment, it was never built; the only class of vessels it typifies is a class of vessels never built. Regardless,
the fact that existing vessels cannot meet a new design standard does not in any way justify continuing to build new
vessels to an old design standard that is grossly inadequate when a new standard can be easily incorporated into the
design of new vessels. Most ``T-boats'' do not have lifeboats; but one existing domestic passenger vessel does have
davit-launched lifeboats, and these regulations must consider all possible eventualities.


Discussion of Major Changes Proposed Here


The changes would incorporate a tiered approach to standards for damage stability, an approach based on a vessel's
route. They would establish three categories: exposed waters, partially-protected, and protected. Definitions
for these terms appear in  170.050. On exposed waters, where a vessel could encounter the greatest force from
wind and waves, the most severe standard would apply. On partially-protected and protected waters, less rigorous
standards would apply.
This tiered approach would be manifest in two specific parts of the standard: in the range of positive stability beyond
the damaged equilibrium angle that a vessel must attain and in the righting arm value that the vessel must attain.
A vessel on exposed waters would have to attain a range of positive stability beyond the damaged equilibrium angle
of 15 degrees; on partially-protected waters, of 10 degrees; and, on protected waters, of 5 degrees. A vessel on partially-protected
waters would have to attain a righting arm value of two-thirds of that for a vessel on exposed waters; and a vessel on
protected waters, one of one-third of that for a vessel on exposed waters. The proposed rule would clarify what constitutes
a new vessel. It would delete part of current  171.080(e)(2). The opening paragraph of new  171.080(f)
now addresses downflooding and defines the use of weathertight and watertight openings. Paragraphs (4)(i) and (ii)
of new  171.080(f) now clarify placement of passengers for calculating heeling moments involving passengers.

Regulatory Evaluation



This proposed rule would not be a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 on Federal Regulation
and would not be significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation [DOT
Order 2100.5 (May 22, 1980)]. It has not been reviewed under E.O. 12866. Nonetheless, a Regulatory Evaluation is available
in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES

.

The marine industry would incur an estimated annual benefit of $250,000 as a result of this proposed rule. There is
no cost associated with this rule, which would reduce the number of vessels affected by current standards.



Small Entities



The Coast Guard has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under  605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposed rule would not increase the paperwork burden on the public. The only paperwork involves ship design
calculations used in the development of stability information, but this information is already subject to review
by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR 170.110. The Coast Guard previously submitted the requirements regarding its collection
of this information, developed from these and other calculations, to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for
review under the Paperwork Reduction Act [44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.], and the OMB approved them. The applicable control
numbers from OMB are 2115-0095, 2115-0114, 2115-0130, and 2115-0131.

For further information, write or call the Information Requirements Division, M-34, Officer of the Secretary
of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20593, (202) 366-4735.



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposed rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612, and has determined that the rule would not have sufficient implications for federalism to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

This proposed rule would establish standards for damage stability of new domestic passenger vessels. The authority
to establish these standards in all navigable waters of the United States is committed to the Coast Guard by Federal
statutes. Furthermore, since passenger vessels tend to move from port to port in the national and international marketplace,
standards for them should be of at least national scope to avoid unreasonably burdensome variances. Therefore, the
Coast Guard intends this rule to preempt State action addressing these standards.



Environment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposed rule and concluded that, under paragraph
2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
This rule would require a minimal standard for damage stability of new domestic passenger vessels. It would not govern
how potential pollutants or hazardous materials are carried on board these vessels, though stabler vessels should
reduce the number of uncontrolled releases of pollutants or hazardous materials into the environment. It does not
result in any_




1. Significant cumulative impacts on the human environment;

2. Substantial controversy or substantial change to existing environmental conditions;

3. Impacts more than minimal on properties protected under sub- 4(f) of the DOT Act as superseded by Public Law 97-449,
or under  106 of the National Historic Preservation Act; or

4. Inconsistencies with any Federal, State, or local laws or administrative determinations relating to the environment.




A Determination of Categorical Exclusion is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under

(ii) The heeling moment due to asymmetric escape routes for passengers, if the vessel has asymmetric escape routes
for passengers, is calculated assuming_
(A) Each passenger weighs 75 kilograms;
(B) Each passenger occupies 0.25 square meter of deck area; and
(C) All passengers are distributed, on available deck areas unoccupied by permanently affixed objects, toward one
side of the vessel on the decks where passengers would move to enter lifesaving equipment or leave the vessel in case
of flooding, and so that they produce the most adverse heeling moment.
(iii) The heeling moment due to launching of survival craft is calculated assuming_
(A) All survival craft, including davit-launched liferafts and rescue boats, fitted on the side to which the vessel
heels after sustained damage, are swung out if necessary, fully loaded and ready for lowering;
(B) Persons not in the survival craft that are swung out and ready for lowering are distributed about the center line
of the vessel so that they do not provide additional heeling or righting moments; and
(C) Survival craft on the side of the vessel opposite that to which the vessel heels remain stowed.
(iv) The heeling moment due to wind pressure is calculated assuming_
(A) A wind pressure of 120 Newtons per square meter;
(B) The wind acts on an area equal to the projected lateral area of the vessel above the waterline corresponding to the
intact condition; and
(C) The wind lever arm is the vertical distance from a point at one-half the mean draft, or the center of area below the
waterline, to the center of the lateral area.
(5) Each vessel must have an angle of equilibrium that does not exceed_
(i) 7 degrees for one compartment flooding;
(ii) 12 degrees for two compartment flooding; or
(iii) 15 degrees for one or two compartment flooding where_
(A) The vessel has an area under each righting arm curve, when the equilibrium angle is between 7 degrees and 15 degrees,
of at least 0.035 meter-radians, measured from the angle of equilibrium to the smaller of the angle at which downflooding
occurs or the angle of vanishing stability; and
(B) The vessel has positive righting arms for at least 20 degrees beyond the angle of equilibrium.
(6) The margin line of the vessel must not be submerged when the vessel is in the equilibrium condition.
(7) Each vessel must have a maximum angle of equilibrium that does not exceed 15 degrees during each earlier stage of
flooding.
(8) Each vessel must have a maximum righting arm of at least 0.05 meter and positive righting arms for a range of at least
7 degrees during each earlier stage of flooding. Only one breach in the hull and only one free surface need be assumed
when meeting the requirements of this paragraph.
(g) Damage survival for vessels authorized to carry more than 12 passengers on an international voyage. A vessel is
presumed to survive assumed damage if it is shown by design calculations to comply with the damage stability required
for that ship by the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 as amended, chapter II-1, part
B, regulation 8.

Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region; Vessel Monitoring System

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues a proposed rule that would implement an experimental vessel monitoring system (VMS) program in the pelagic
longline fishery around Hawaii. Under this program, vessels operating in this fishery would have to carry vessel
monitoring equipment owned and operated by NMFS. The equipment provides immediate vessel identification and location,
and would be used by NMFS and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to facilitate enforcement of regulations that prohibit
fishing in closed areas. This experimental program would operate for 
3 years or less, during which time the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and NMFS would conduct
reviews of the performance and cost effectiveness of the program and make recommendations regarding the future use
of VMSs in this and other fisheries. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Amendment 3 (56 FR 52214, October 18, 1991) to the Fishery Management Plan for the Pelagic Fisheries of the Western
Pacific Region (FMP) created a protected species zone of 50 nautical miles (am) around the Northwestern Hawaiian
Islands (NWHI), which is closed to pelagic longline fishing. This action was taken to protect endangered Hawaiian
monk seals from longline fishing activity. 



Amendment 4 (56 FR 51849, October 16, 1991) to the FMP established an administrative procedure to govern the Council's
review of VMS technology and possible adoption of VMS requirements for the fishery. This action was taken to develop
an effective way of monitoring longline fishing vessels without placing excessive restrictions on fishermen. 

Amendment 5 (57 FR 7661, March 4, 1992) to the FMP created closed areas to pelagic longline fishing around the main Hawaiian
Islands to prevent gear conflicts between pelagic longline and small-boat fishermen. The closed areas are generally
within 75 nm of the Islands of Kauai, Niihau, and Oahu, and within 50 nm of the Islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe,
and Hawaii and vary in size on a seasonal basis. Further adjustments may be made through an administrative procedure
that includes an opportunity for public comment. 


Because the longline fleet has been growing rapidly, Amendment 7 (59 FR 26979, May 25, 1994) established a limited
entry program for the Hawaii longline fishery for pelagic species in order to prevent adverse impacts on pelagic resources,
protected species such as the Hawaiian monk seal and sea turtles, and other fishing vessels. 

Patrolling area closures is an expensive and difficult task for NMFS enforcement agents and the USCG. The distances
that have to be covered are large, and there is minimal logistic support for patrol aircraft or patrol vessels in the
NWHI. Given these enforcement difficulties, NMFS and the USCG have explored alternative methods of monitoring closed
areas. One promising alternative is the use of a VMS. A VMS consists of equipment placed aboard a vessel that is capable
of transmitting to NMFS and the USCG the identity and location of that vessel. By monitoring these transmissions,
illegal fishing by the vessels in closed areas might be detected immediately without using patrol aircraft and vessels.


In addition to compliance monitoring, a VMS offers several other potential uses. First, a VMS would enhance at-sea
safety by allowing NMFS and the USCG to locate vessels immediately in the event of distress situations. Second, available
computer attachments would enable users to either receive or transmit information such as news and weather broadcasts,
or personal communications. Finally, in this fishery, consistent with an incidental take statement issued in conjunction
with a Biological Opinion dated June 10, 1993, information collected could be used to verify the accuracy of logbook
reports, thereby aiding in the conservation of protected species such as threatened and endangered sea turtles.


In 1991, the Council, NMFS, and the USCG coordinated a demonstration of several automated vessel monitoring technologies
to confirm whether remote communication links would be reliable in the Western Pacific. The purpose of the demonstration
was to review the available vessel monitoring technologies for routine enforcement operations and to assist the
Council in deciding how VMS could be used for enforcement. This effort helped the Council develop minimum performance
criteria to be used for designing a fleet-wide VMS. Each technology that was examined represented a different approach
to providing vessel position information.

The minimum performance standards identified by the Council for enforcement applications of satellite or radio
vessel monitoring technology are the following: 
a. The system must deliver accurate, real-time data for processing at a station on shore; 
b. Position reports must contain vessel identification, the latitude and longitude of the vessel, and the date and
time of the fix (i.e., positional fix); 
c. Shipboard equipment must be capable of providing fully automatic, hands-off position reports and battery-powered
operation for a given period of time. Units should also accept vessel power to charge internal batteries; 
d. Shipboard equipment must be self-initializing when power is interrupted to maintain automatic operation; 
e. The Global Positioning System should be used for VMS units where communication transmitters are linked with navigation
receivers in order to obtain accurate position information; 
f. The shipboard equipment must be built to withstand the rigors of operation on a commercial high-seas fishing vessel
in the Central and Western Pacific; 
g. The system must not require routine maintenance, and should be easily serviceable by trained technicians; 
h. The system design should permit the exchange, at sea, of sealed components by individuals who may not be trained
technicians; and 
i. The shipboard equipment must be capable of monitoring vessels throughout their range. 
After the establishment of these performance standards, NMFS and the USCG conducted a second test. This test indicated
that one of the initial technologies examined might meet the performance requirements established by the Council,
and merited further study in a larger experimental program. 
At a regular meeting of the Council on December 2, 1992, the members adopted a VMS policy to ensure that the development
and application of a VMS in the Central and Western Pacific is carried out in a manner that is comprehensive, attendant
to the needs of management authorities, cost-effective, and fair to the fishing industry. That policy states that
the Council recognizes that electronic monitoring systems may be an effective and desirable technology for use in
fisheries management. 
The Council established a VMS Committee to develop and review proposed VMS initiatives, policies, and other related
topics addressed in the Council's fishery management plans under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation
and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Significant VMS decisions that would involve changes in the equipment or costs
to be borne by the fishermen will be made by the full Council. 
On March 31, 1994, NMFS published a policy (59 FR 15180) that established standards for all VMS used in U.S. fisheries.
The policy covers the technical requirements of the equipment, the security of the system, and the confidentiality
of the data. Implementation of the proposed rule would be consistent with that policy. 
While VMSs are a promising alternative and supplement to existing enforcement techniques, uncertainties remain.
These uncertainties include, but are not limited to: 
1. The extent to which the entire range of the vessels throughout the Pacific can be covered in practice; 
2. The amount of other enforcement resources necessary to confirm apparent violations detected through use of the
system; 
3. The feasibility of applying the system to other fisheries with different fishing characteristics; 
4. The extent to which the VMS hardware and software used would allow the integration of U.S. fishing vessels into developing
regional VMS systems; 
5. The cost effectiveness, from an enforcement perspective, of VMSs as compared to traditional methods of enforcement;
and 
6. The social and economic effects of establishing a VMS, such as assessing the impacts on the owners, captains, crew,
fishing behavior, and regulatory compliance. 
Given these considerations, NMFS proposes to implement an experimental VMS program. Under this program, all vessels
with a limited entry permit for the Hawaiian pelagic longline fishery would be required to carry a NMFS-owned vessel
monitoring unit. As units become available for installation, the NMFS Office of Enforcement would schedule vessels
for installation of a VMS unit. To the extent possible, installations would be scheduled to accommodate the vessel's
fishing schedule. Reasonable notice of the proposed installation date would be given to the holder of the limited
entry permit for the vessel. 
The NMFS headquarters Office of Enforcement would exercise overall supervision and evaluation of the program, and
determine when the objectives of the program have been met, thereby warranting termination of the experimental program.
Day-to-day responsibility for implementing this program, however, would rest with the NMFS Special Agent-in-Charge
(SAC) in Long Beach, CA. 
This proposed action follows an extensive review of such systems by the Council under the guidance of Amendment 4 to
the FMP and was approved by the Council at its meeting on 
September 14-16, 1993. The following elements were approved by the Council and are incorporated in this proposed
rule: 
1. NMFS would select the necessary VMS equipment and provide it at no cost to the permit holder. This equipment would
remain the property of NMFS and must be returned to NMFS upon request; 
2. All equipment would meet the performance standards adopted by the Council listed above; 
3. Interfering with the equipment in any way would be prohibited;

<DOCNO> FR940810-1-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940810-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. The SAC would be authorized to permit a vessel owner to have additional equipment linked to the VMS unit, e.g., computer
terminal for communications and data transfer; 
5. Vessels with VMS units would not be required to notify NMFS when transiting the protected species zone (as they are
now required to do); and 
6. The Council and NMFS would evaluate the VMS program for a period of time not to exceed 3 years, and make decisions regarding
the continued or modified use of VMSs in this fishery and other fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Council. 
In addition, NMFS would also evaluate this VMS program in regard to the uses of VMSs in fisheries in other areas. 
A Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement under the Endangered Species Act were issued by NMFS on this fishery
on June 10, 1993. The Biological Opinion concluded that the longline fishery is not likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of any endangered or threatened species of sea turtle, provided that certain conditions set forth in an
incidental take statement were met. This statement includes, as a reasonable and prudent measure, use of an automated
VMS to confirm the location of those vessels without observers to help verify the accuracy of logbook reports. While
being promulgated for enforcement purposes, this proposed rule would also help NMFS satisfy the automated VMS requirements
set forth in the incidental take statement. A new Biological Opinion on this fishery is expected to be issued by NMFS
during the summer of 1994. 
NMFS is sensitive to the concerns fishermen might have with regard to their fishing locations becoming widely known.
NMFS will be reviewing the level of accuracy and precision required to meet the above obligations with enforcement
agents and scientists and will determine the degree of monitoring required. Whatever final decisions are made on
the frequency of reports needed, data indicating individual vessel positions would be treated as confidential in
accordance with the Trade Secrets Act. 


Classification 


This proposed rule is published under the authority of the Magnuson Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 

et seq., 

and was prepared at the request of the Council. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has initially
determined that this proposed rule is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. 
This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. All the costs of installing and operating
the proposed reporting system are to be borne by NMFS. Installation of the required equipment is to be done at minimal
inconvenience to the vessel owner. Implementing the proposed action also will relieve vessel operators from the
current requirement to notify NMFS of the vessel's entrance and exit from the protected species zone. The installed
equipment may be used, in conjunction with supplemental equipment provided by the vessel, by the vessel operator
at the vessel's own expense, for vessel communications such as obtaining updated weather reports or communication
to the vessel owner. The Council has concurred with the establishment of a mandatory observer program and an electronic
VMS for the longline fishery as required by the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement, issued on June 10,
1993.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes to amend existing regulations for certain programs administered by the National Institute
on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR). These proposed amendments result primarily from the Rehabilitation
Act Amendments of 1992 (the Amendments). The proposed regulations add new definitions and program activities consistent
with the Amendments and reflect new statutory requirements. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 These proposed regulations primarily implement statutory changes made by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of
1992 
(Pub. L. 102-569). Some of the changes are to conform terminology of the regulations with terminology in the
Act, specifically in the use of ``individual with a disability'', ``children with disabilities'', ``individual
with a mental disability'', and similar phrases to replace phrases using the word ``handicapped'', ``handicapped
individual'', or ``disabled individual''. 



These proposed regulations in  350.4 include new statutory definitions for many of the terms used in Section
7 of the Rehabilitation Act, including the definitions of such key terms as ``disability'', ``individual with a disability'',
``rehabilitation technology'' and ``rehabilitation engineering'', and ``research utilization''. The NPRM further
reflects new statements in the statute about the purpose of each of the programs and the activities authorized within
them. 

These proposed regulations in  350.21 implement Section 21(b)(6) of the Act, which states that all applicants
must address the needs of individuals with disabilities from minority backgrounds. They also include suggestions
for ways to meet this requirement, and incorporate attention to needs of minorities with disabilities into the selection
criteria for each of the four programs addressed in this NPRM. The NPRM in  350.41 reflects the new statutory
requirement in Section 20 of the Act that all funded projects must make applicants for or recipients of vocational
rehabilitation services and their families aware of the Client Assistance Program in their States. 

These proposed regulations in   352.33 and 353.33 also include the new statutory standard 60-month grant
periods for RRTCs in Section 204(b)(2)(L) and RERCs in Section 204(b)(3)(E), and specify conditions under which
awards of lesser duration are appropriate under the law. The NPRM in  350.20 describes the conditions under
which applicants must send copies of their applications to the Vocational Rehabilitation agencies in their States,
as required by statute. This provision clarifies Sections 204(c) and 301(i) of the current law and regulations by
describing the context in which transmittal of these applications would be appropriate. 

These proposed regulations in   352.40 and 353.40 state that each RRTC and RERC must have an advisory board,
of which the majority of the members must be individuals with disabilities, their parents, family members, guardians,
advocates, or authorized representatives. This would extend the new statutory requirement in Section 204(b)(3)(D)(II)
of the Act_that certain types of RERCs must have such advisory boards_to all RERCs and RRTCs. The Secretary has determined
that most RRTCs and RERCs have advisory boards that meet or approach meeting this requirement. It should not be a hardship
for the remaining centers to meet this requirement. The overwhelming importance of involving the Department's constituents_in
this case, individuals with disabilities and their families or representatives_in activities supported by the
Department makes this requirement imperative. 

These proposed regulations support the National Education Goals, particularly National Education Goal 5, which
calls for every adult American to be literate and to possess the skills necessary to compete in a global economy and
exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 



Executive Order 12866 



1. Assessment of Costs and Benefits 



These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically
associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble
under the heading 

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of the proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs.

<DOCNO> FR940810-1-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940810-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 

To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comments on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.




2. Clarity of the regulations 


Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. 

The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers
to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the
regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the
regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would
the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded
by the symbol `` '' and a numbered heading; for example,  350.3 What regulations apply to these programs?)

 (4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful
in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making regulations easier to understand?
(5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand? 

A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand
should be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue
SW., (Room 5125, FOB-6), Washington, D.C. 20202-2241. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by applying for Federal funds under these programs.
However, the regulations will not have a significant economic impact on the entities affected because the regulations
will not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



Sections 350.20, 350.21, 350.34, 352.31, and 353.31 contain information collection requirements. As required
by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. 

Public and private entities, including institutions of higher education and Indian tribes and tribal organizations,
are eligible to apply for awards under these programs. The Department uses this information to assist in making awards.
The annual public reporting burden for these programs is estimated to be 30 hours. 

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
D.C.; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. 



Invitation to Comment 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. 

All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will be available for public inspection, during
and after the comment period, in Room 3431, Mary E. Switzer Building, 330 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C., between
the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the proposed regulations in this document would require
transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United
States.

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes to amend the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program regulations. These amendments
are needed to implement changes in the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), giving the Secretary additional
powers to assure the safety of reserve funds and assets maintained by guaranty agencies insuring educational loans
under the FFEL Program pursuant to agreements with the Secretary. The amendments would further define ``reserve
funds and assets'' and establish the substantive standard for the return of ``unnecessary'' reserves. They would
also provide procedural due process for challenges to these orders and for orders requiring that reserve funds and
assets outside of the guaranty agency's control be returned to it or to the Secretary. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



The FFEL Program regulations (34 CFR Part 682) govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental
Loans for Students Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program (formerly the Guaranteed
Student Loan programs). 
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66) (OBRA), enacted August 10, 1993, added section
422(g)(1) of the HEA. The conference report on OBRA states, ``* * * the conferees wish to emphasize
that this language is not intended to diminish the longstanding and judicially-supported view that a guaranty agency's
assets are dedicated to the loan programs and may not be used for unauthorized purposes. It is the conferees' further
intention that all references to guaranty agency reserves contained in amendments to section 422 refer only to the
'federal portion' of such reserves.'' In the course of the negotiated rulemaking the industry negotiators stated
that ``* * * Section 422 defines the federal portion of reserves as federal advances and earnings made
on those advances, and states that non-Federal reserves are not subject to recall, repayment or recovery by the Secretary,
except in the case of the termination of the guarantor's agreement with the Secretary in accordance with Sections
428(c)(9) (E) and (F).'' To protect the Federal fiscal interest, OBRA authorized the Secretary to direct (1) the return
of ``unnecessary'' reserves from guaranty agencies (section 422(g)(1)(A)), (2) the return to the guaranty agency
or to the Secretary of guaranty agency reserves and assets held by, or under the control of, any other party (section
422(g)(1)(B)), and (3) guaranty agencies to cease and desist from ``misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure''
of reserve funds and assets (section 422(g)(1)(C)). 


Negotiated Rulemaking 



OBRA expressly provides that determinations under section 422(g)(1) (A) and (B) be based on standards set forth in
regulations subject to negotiated rulemaking. The negotiated regulations are also to contain procedures for administrative
due process. Although no such requirement was made for determinations under section 422(g)(1)(C), the conference
report on OBRA expressed the conferees' intent that the issue of ``recovery'' in the case of misuse, misapplication,
or improper expenditure be ``addressed'' during the negotiated rulemaking over the first two subsections.

Monthly negotiated rulemaking sessions were held from January through June 1994 in and around Washington, DC. 


Proposed Regulatory Changes 



The Secretary submitted drafts of proposed regulatory language to implement section 422(g)(1) (A) and (B) for discussion
at the negotiated rulemaking sessions. Although not required by OBRA to be negotiated, a draft regulation to implement
section 422(g)(1)(C) was also submitted by the Secretary at the request of industry negotiators but was withdrawn
when substantial opposition to its approach was expressed. Nevertheless, the dialogue with the other negotiators
was quite helpful, and the Secretary intends to reconsider the approach and propose regulatory language on this subject
in the regular course at a later time after consultation with interested parties. Consensus was reached on all aspects
of the other rules and the accompanying preamble. In reaching consensus, the negotiators agreed that all of the rules
proposed in this notice properly come within the Secretary's statutory powers, but they reserve the right to challenge
the validity of the underlying statutes or subsequent interpretations of the rules by the Secretary. 
The following summarizes the major changes in this notice of proposed rulemaking:


Section 682.410 Fiscal, administrative and enforcement requirements 


Paragraph (a) of this section currently establishes fiscal requirements for guaranty agencies by (1) defining reserve
funds in terms of sources and permitted uses, (2) regulating the investment of those funds, (3) providing for reimbursement
of reserve funds in the event that revenue is derived from assets developed or purchased with those funds or those assets
are converted to uses unrelated to the FFEL Program and (4) establishing minimum reserve fund levels. At the outset
of the negotiated rulemaking proceeding industry negotiators requested a better definition of the reserve fund,
and many of the proposed amendments to this section are intended to be responsive to that request. 
Paragraph (a)(1) specifies the receipts that must be credited to the reserve fund. The Secretary proposes to amend
that paragraph to clarify certain matters. First, paragraph (a)(1)(ii) currently refers only to funds ``appropriated
by'' a State for the loan guaranty programs, but funds received from a State in any other manner for that purpose are
already covered by paragraph (a)(1)(ix). Accordingly, the Secretary proposes to substitute the broader phrase
``received from'' in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) to obviate any possibility of confusion. Second, paragraph (a)(1)(vi),
which now refers to administrative cost allowance payments, is proposed to be amended to add transitional support
payments under section 458(a) of the HEA, which Congress created in OBRA when it eliminated the administrative cost
allowance. Third, although paragraph (a)(1)(vii) currently includes funds collected by the guaranty agency without
any qualification, this paragraph has always been understood to apply only to collections on FFEL loans on which a
claim has been paid. That qualification is now proposed to be made explicit. Finally, the Secretary proposes to rearrange
the wording of paragraph (a)(1)(ix) for stylistic reasons only. 
Paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) currently specify the permitted uses of the reserve fund. Since the former statutory provisions
that segregated certain reserve fund receipts for restricted uses were later repealed, it is no longer necessary
to have two different sets of permitted uses. To simplify the regulation the Secretary proposes to combine the two
paragraphs by redesignating current paragraph (a)(3)(i) as paragraph (a)(2)(x) and removing the balance of the
current paragraph (a)(3). Although it is already well understood that neither the current paragraph (a)(3) nor the
current paragraph (a)(2)(ii) was meant to permit excessive or otherwise unreasonable expenditures, the Secretary
plans to make that understanding explicit in the subsequent rule proposal on misuse, misapplication, and improper
expenditures. The Secretary now also proposes to add three new paragraphs to paragraph (a)(2). Paragraph (a)(2)(viii)
would make explicit the currently-understood authority for guaranty agencies to use reserve funds to make borrower
refunds arising from claims and defenses. Paragraph (a)(2)(ix) would authorize the reversal of prior credits to
the reserve funds under certain conditions, including contemporaneous documentation that the amounts were received
as only temporary infusions of capital. Finally, the guaranty agency representatives questioned the legality and
fairness of any retroactive application of the other proposed amendments to this section and requested that paragraph
(a)(2)(xi) be added. Under this provision prior actions would remain lawful if a guaranty agency had acted in good
faith, as measured by the laws, rules, standards, customs, and practices prevailing at the times of the actions. Although
the Secretary's representatives defended the general power of the Secretary to amend retroactively regulations
governing guaranty agencies, they agreed to the requested paragraph in the interest of fairness. 
The Secretary recognizes that the customary problems involved in allocating shared expenses among different activities
conducted within a single entity or among related entities and the particular problems created by the limited life
expectancies of some guaranty agencies as a result of OBRA may pose difficulties for the agencies in determining the
propriety of payments from the reserve fund under paragraph (a)(2). In the subsequent rulemaking proceeding on misuse,
misallocation, and improper expenditures the Secretary plans to establish procedures for the formal review of cost
allocation programs and major capital expenditures by guaranty agencies. In the meantime, the staff of the Department
of Education stands ready to assist program participants by providing informal advice in these areas. 
The Secretary proposes to add a new paragraph (a)(3) to clarify the appropriate accounting method for reserve fund
reporting. Generally-accepted accounting principles provide for the deferral of certain items of income and the
accrual of certain items of expenses on financial statements to match related income and expenses, and many guaranty
agencies have established these accounts. On the other hand, part E of ED Form 1130, the annual report for guaranty
agencies, requires that sources and uses of program funds be reported to the Secretary strictly on a cash basis. See
ED Form 1130 Instructions (May 1993 ed.), pp. 79-80. To avoid any confusion, the new paragraph (a)(3) would expressly
provide that deferrals and accruals for reserve fund reporting be made only with the prior approval of the Secretary.

The Secretary also proposes to add a new paragraph (a)(4) to clarify the obligation of guaranty agencies to reflect
accurately in their accounting records the computation of reserve fund balances in accordance with this section
and to provide a mechanism for correcting those records. Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(iii) would restate the
general obligation to maintain correct accounting records and to correct them when necessary. Paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)
and (a)(4)(iv) would establish specific mechanisms for the correction of erroneous credits to the reserve fund and
for general accounting record reconstructions. In both cases, the Secretary would not allow a guaranty agency to
change its accounting records if other parties, such as lenders or students who had relied on the guaranty agency's
stated financial condition, would be unfairly prejudiced. In the case of general accounting record reconstructions,
the Secretary intends to grant the required approval only on the basis of an audit plan submitted before any work on
the reconstruction actually commences. 

The current paragraph (a)(4) limits the investment of reserve funds to low-risk securities and restates the fiduciary
duty of guaranty agencies in making those investments. This paragraph would be redesignated as paragraph (a)(5)
in the proposed amendment, and the wording of the paragraph would be rearranged for stylistic purposes. The Secretary
understands that investment risk can arise from the maturity of securities investments as well as from the identity
of their issuers and will deal with this subject in the subsequent rule proposal on misuse, misapplication and improper
expenditures. 

The current paragraph (a)(5) requires proportionate reimbursement to the reserve fund when a guaranty agency derives
revenue from an asset developed or purchased with the reserve fund or converts the asset to a use not related to the FFEL
Program. This paragraph is based on the fundamental principle that reserve funds are to be used solely for the FFEL
Program and retain that character when incorporated into other assets. It provides a remedy for any deviation from
this principle in addition to disallowance of any payment that was not permitted by paragraph (a)(2) in the first place.
The Secretary does recognize, however, that there may be economies in having assets shared by program and nonprogram
activities. For example, purchasing a single computer with sufficient capacity for both the FFEL Program and an unrelated
agency activity will ordinarily cost less than the total of separate computers for each, thereby creating a saving
to be shared between the two activities. Such legitimate joint utilization of assets should not be stifled by regulation.


The proper scope of this paragraph was discussed in the negotiated rulemaking proceeding at great length. The basic
policy issue was whether the additional remedy provided by the paragraph should be limited to situations in which
assets are acquired by the guaranty agency with reserve funds in a technical purchase-and-sale transaction or should
apply to all asset-related transactions in which reserve funds are used. The basic legal issue was whether the use
of the word ``purchase'' in section 422(g)(1) of the HEA precludes the latter result. The Secretary's position is
that, although ``purchase'' and ``develop'' are not synonymous in their everyday usage, the word ``develop'' was
added to this paragraph in a 1992 rulemaking proceeding (57 FR 60355) merely to emphasize the broad meaning traditionally
given to the word ``purchase'' in the law. 

See, for example, 

26 U.S.C.  338(h)(3); 

Dasho 

v. 

Susquehanna Corp.,

 380 F.2d 262 (7th Cir. 1967); U.C.C.  1-201(32). The industry negotiators argued, on the other hand, that
``purchase'' is a different term from ``develop,'' and the Secretary was not authorized to expand the statutory scope
by rulemaking. In addition to disagreeing with this narrow reading of the statute, the Secretary's representatives
expressed concern over attempting to accommodate the other negotiators' comments on its original rulemaking proposals
only to have them undermine any consensus by later claiming that the Secretary was acting outside the scope of statutory
authority in adopting the very regulation to which they had consented. After extensive discussion of these issues,
all the negotiators agreed to substitute a more discriminating set of remedies for the current monolithic approach
of the paragraph, to put aside their differences over the proper scope of the paragraph by using only the word ``develop''
in the rule, and not to question the Secretary's authority to promulgate a rule in this form. 

In current paragraph (a)(5), redesignated as paragraph (a)(6), the proposed revision would provide different consequences,
depending upon the relationship between the initial cost allocation and the use for nonprogram purposes. If the use
for nonprogram purposes was not substantial, no remedy at all would be necessary. If the use was substantial but the
initial cost allocation was correct, the consequences of revenue receipts or subsequent conversion to nonprogram
purposes would be governed by the reserve fund's recorded ownership interest in the asset. If the use was substantial
and the agency had attempted in good faith to allocate the cost between the program and nonprogram purposes but had
done so erroneously, the agency would only be required to correct the allocation. If there was no such good faith allocation
attempt at the outset, however, the Secretary would be given a choice of remedies: The Secretary could either require
the agency to correct the allocation or require it to correct the recorded ownership of the asset to reflect the fair
proportionate interests of the Department. This proposed election of remedies for the Secretary is based on the traditional
legal principle that a beneficiary has the choice of either disavowing or ratifying a misuse of assets by a fiduciary.
An analysis of fair proportionate interests would utilize the criteria customarily used in the financial world with
regard to the development of new businesses, would include both monetary and other contributions to the total development
cost, and would consider both the magnitude and the relative risk of all of these contributions.

The Secretary proposes to add a new paragraph (a)(7) to state the principle that any claim by a guaranty agency to recover
funds and assets for the reserve fund from a third party is also Federal property. 

The guaranty agencies requested the addition of proposed paragraph (a)(8), which would apply one of the traditional
fiduciary standards for non-arm's length transactions to guaranty agencies' use of reserve funds and assets. 

Finally, the guaranty agency negotiators also requested the addition of the first sentence of paragraph (a)(9) to
clarify the applicability of the definition of reserve funds and assets in this section throughout sections 422 and
428 of the HEA. The departmental negotiators, in response, added the second sentence to reference the Secretary's
authority under section 428(c)(9)(F)(vi) of the HEA to use all funds and assets of the guaranty agency under the circumstances
specified in that section. 



Section 682.417 Determination of reserve funds or assets to be returned 



The Secretary proposes to add a new section to establish the substantive standard for orders to guaranty agencies
to return unnecessary reserves. The section would also establish a process by which a guaranty agency may challenge
an order that it return reserves or an order that it require the return to itself or to the Secretary of reserve funds
or assets that are held by, or under the control of, another party. Since the Secretary is not aware of any circumstances
under which all of those funds and assets would not be required for the orderly termination of the agency's operations
or the orderly liquidation of its assets, no further substantive standard has been proposed for orders for the return
of property not in the hands of the guaranty agencies. 

Proposed paragraph (a) would simply restate the statutory provisions. 

In paragraph (b) the Secretary proposes the substantive standard for ``unnecessary'' reserves. Under this paragraph
the Secretary would not initiate a proceeding for the recovery of unnecessary reserves unless the guaranty agency's
reserve fund ratio exceeded a specified level for each of the two preceding Federal fiscal years. In exercising discretion
whether to initiate such a proceeding during the first two years that this rule is effective, the Secretary will consider
that the effects of OBRA on guaranty agencies were not reflected at all in the 1993 fiscal year and will probably not
have been fully reflected in the 1994 fiscal year, either. If the Secretary does initiate a proceeding, projections
of the agency's future financial condition would be used as the basis for the decision. As soon as possible, the Secretary
intends to propose a system of uniform financial projections for guaranty agencies that could not only be used in these
proceedings, but would also give the Secretary better general information on the current and future financial health
of the guaranty agency industry. In the meantime, the Secretary would be able to require a guaranty agency to submit
special projections for the proceeding. If the Secretary determined to recover reserves from an agency, the agency
would be entitled to retain sufficient reserves at least to satisfy the ``trigger'' level specified in the regulation
and to maintain a sufficient cushion over the statutorily-mandated reserve requirements to perform its responsibilities
as a guaranty agency over a specified future period. The Secretary proposes to use a higher standard than the statutory
minimum in order to enable agencies to continue to guarantee new loans and perform their other obligations as guaranty
agencies, not simply to satisfy their existing guarantees and service out their existing portfolios. 

Proposed paragraph (c) would set forth the contents and procedural requirements for the notice by which the Secretary
or an authorized Departmental official would initiate a proceeding under this section. The proposed notice is designed
to provide the agency with the information that it needs to respond to the officer's initial determination. The notice
would also include a description of any actions that the guaranty agency would be required to take to assure the safety
of the reserve funds or assets that are the subject of the proceeding while the proceeding was pending. 

In paragraph (d) the Secretary proposes to provide the procedural and substantive requirements for the appeal of
an initial determination under paragraph (c). The appeal would be decided by a different Departmental official who
was not a subordinate of the one who made the initial determination. The guaranty agency would have the burden of production
and persuasion in such an appeal. It would be entitled to an oral argument to the deciding official promptly after submitting
all material that is required for the appeal but not to a formal hearing. The record would be closed to evidence before
this oral argument unless the deciding official determined otherwise. 

Under section 428(c)(9)(J) of the HEA, the Secretary is required to protect the confidentiality of financial information
collected by the Secretary under that section. In light of this requirement, only the guaranty agency and the Department
would be considered parties to a proceeding under this section with any formal rights of participation. The Department,
however, always appreciates receiving information from all persons having relevant information about matters
within its jurisdiction, and it particularly solicits input from students and schools in these proceedings. Accordingly,
in paragraph (e) the Secretary proposes to provide an opportunity for public input by publishing a notice of the initial
determination of funds or assets to be returned in the 

Federal Register

. In the interest of fairness, the guaranty agency would be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to any public
input if the deciding official considered the information adverse to the agency.

In paragraph (f) the Secretary proposes to specify the procedures for, and content of, the decision on appeal. Judicial
review could not be sought until this decision was issued. 

Paragraph (g) would contain the substantive and procedural requirements for compliance with any order of the Secretary
issued under this section. 



Executive Order 12866 



1. 

Assessment of costs and benefits 

These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this proposed regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the Title IV, HEA programs effectively and efficiently.
Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are explained elsewhere in
this preamble under the heading of Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 

The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 

To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the Title
IV, HEA programs. 

2. Clarity of the regulations 

Executive order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. 

The Secretary invites comments on how to make these regulations easier to understand, including answers to questions
such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the regulations contain
technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping
and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be
easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol
`` '' and a numbered heading; for example,  682.410 Fiscal, administrative, and enforcement requirements.)
(4) Is the description of the proposed regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble
helpful in the understanding of the proposed regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the
proposed regulations easier to understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to
understand? 

A copy of any comments that concern whether these proposed regulations are easy to understand should also be sent to
Stanley Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., (Room 5125
FOB-6), Washington, DC 20202-2241. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these regulations are small organizations
that contract with guaranty agencies to administer aspects of the agencies' participation in the FFEL programs.
However, the regulations would not have a significant impact on these small entities, because the regulations would
not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose
minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds. 



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



Sections 682.410 and 682.417 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, the Secretary will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review.


Guaranty agencies receive payments from the Secretary and others for exclusive use in the FFEL programs, and the accumulated
surplus of those payments over permissible expenditures are Federal property, to be returned to the Secretary upon
the agency's termination or under certain other circumstances. The Secretary needs and uses the information to enable
him to determine whether the guaranty agencies comply with the requirements for safeguarding this Federal property
and the limitations on its use. 

Annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden contained in the collection of information proposed in these regulations
is estimated to be 90 hours, including the time for searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the
data needed, completing and reviewing the collection information, and submitting materials. 

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should submit
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 10235, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok.

) These amounts were originally received by the agency under appropriate contemporaneous documentation specifying
that receipt was on a temporary basis only; 

(

2

) The objective for which these amounts were originally received by the agency has been fully achieved; and 

(

) Repayment of these amounts would not cause the agency to fail to comply with the minimum reserve levels provided by
paragraph (a)(10) of this section, except that the Secretary may, for good cause, provide written permission for
a payment that meets the other requirements of this paragraph (a)(2)(ix)(A) of this section. 

(B) The repayment, prior to December 29, 1993, of amounts credited under paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) or (ix) of this section,
if the agency demonstrates that_ 

(

) These amounts were originally received by the agency under appropriate contemporaneous documentation that receipt
was on a temporary basis only; and 

(

2

) The objective for which these amounts were originally received by the agency has been fully achieved. 

(x) Any other payments necessary to perform functions directly related to the agency's guaranty activities and for
their proper administration; 

(xi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any other payment that was allowed by law or regulation
at the time it was made, if the agency acted in good faith when it made the payment or the agency would otherwise be unfairly
prejudiced by the nonallowability of the payment at a later time; and 

(xii) Any other amounts authorized or directed by the Secretary. 

(3) 

Accounting basis.

 Except as approved by the Secretary, a guaranty agency shall credit the items listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section
to its reserve fund upon their receipt, without any deferral for accounting purposes, and shall deduct the items listed
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section from its reserve fund upon their payment, without any accrual for accounting purposes.


(4) 

Accounting records.

 (i) The accounting records of a guaranty agency must reflect the correct amount of sources and uses of funds under paragraph
(a) of this section. 

(ii) A guaranty agency may reverse prior credits to its reserve fund if_ 

(A) The agency gives the Secretary prior notice setting forth a detailed justification for the action; 

(B) The Secretary determines that the credits were made erroneously and in good faith; and 

(C) The Secretary determines that the action would not unfairly prejudice other parties. 

(iii) A guaranty agency shall correct any other errors in its accounting or reporting as soon as practicable after
the errors become known to the agency. 

(iv) If a general reconstruction of a guaranty agency's historical accounting records is necessary to make a change
under paragraphs (a)(4) (ii) and (iii) of this section or any other retroactive change to its accounting records,
the agency may make this reconstruction only upon prior approval by the Secretary and without any deduction from its
reserve fund for the cost of the reconstruction. 

(5) 

Investments.

 The guaranty agency shall exercise the level of care required of a fiduciary charged with the duty of investing the
money of others when it invests the assets of the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. It may
invest these assets only in low-risk securities, such as obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or
a State. 

(6) 

Development of assets.

 (i) If the guaranty agency uses in a substantial way for purposes other than the agency's guaranty activities any funds
required to be credited to the reserve fund under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or any assets derived from the reserve
fund to develop an asset of any kind and does not in good faith allocate a portion of the cost of developing and maintaining
the developed asset to funds other than the reserve fund, the Secretary may require the agency to_
(A) Correct this allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section; or 

(B) Correct the recorded ownership of the asset under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section so that_ 

(

1

) If, in a transaction with an unrelated third party, the agency sells or otherwise derives revenue from uses of the
asset that are unrelated to the agency's guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall deposit into the reserve
fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section a percentage of the sale proceeds or revenue equal to the fair percentage
of the total development cost of the asset paid with the reserve fund monies or provided by assets derived from the reserve
fund; or 

(

2

) If the agency otherwise converts the asset, in whole or in part, to a use unrelated to its guaranty activities, the
agency promptly shall deposit into the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section a fair percentage
of the fair market value or, in the case of a temporary conversion, the rental value of the portion of the asset employed
for the unrelated use. 

(ii) If the agency uses funds or assets described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section in the manner described in
that paragraph and makes a cost and maintenance allocation erroneously and in good faith, it shall correct the allocation
under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. 

(7) 

Third-party claims.

 If the guaranty agency has any claim against any other party to recover funds or other assets for the reserve fund, the
claim is the property of the United States. 

(8) 

Related-party transactions.

 All transactions between a guaranty agency and a related organization or other person that involve funds required
to be credited to the agency's reserve fund under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or assets derived from the reserve
fund must be on terms that are not less 
advantageous to the reserve fund than would have been negotiated on an arm's-length basis by unrelated parties. 

(9) 

Scope of definition.

 The provisions of this  682.410(a) define reserve funds and assets for purposes of sections 422 and 428 of the
Act. These provisions do not, however, affect the Secretary's authority to use all funds and assets of the agency pursuant
to section 428(c)(9)(F)(vi) of the Act.

(

a

) 

General.

 The procedures described in this section apply to a determination by the Secretary that_ 

(1) A guaranty agency must return to the Secretary a portion of its reserve funds that the Secretary has determined
is unnecessary to pay the program expenses and contingent liabilities of the agency; and 

(2) A guaranty agency must require the return to the agency or the Secretary of reserve funds or assets within the meaning
of section 422(g)(1) of the Act held by or under the control of any other entity, that the Secretary determines are necessary
to pay the program expenses and contingent liabilities of the agency or that are required for the orderly termination
of the guaranty agency's operations and the liquidation of its assets.

(b) 

Return of unnecessary reserve funds. 

(1) The Secretary may initiate a process to recover unnecessary reserve funds under paragraph (a)(1) of this section
if the Secretary determines that a guaranty agency's reserve fund ratio under  682.410(a)(10) for each of the
two preceding Federal fiscal years exceeded 2.0 percent. 
(2) If the Secretary initiates a process to recover unnecessary reserve funds, the Secretary requires the return
of a portion of the reserve funds that the Secretary determines will permit the agency to_

(i) Have a reserve fund ratio of at least 2.0 percent under  682.410(a)(10) at the time of the determination;
and 
(ii) Meet the minimum reserve fund requirements under  682.410(a)(10) and retain sufficient additional reserve
funds to perform its responsibilities as a guaranty agency during the current Federal fiscal year and the four succeeding
Federal fiscal years. 
(3)(i) The Secretary makes a determination of the amount of the reserve funds needed by the guaranty agency under paragraph
(b)(2) of this section on the basis of financial projections for the period described in that paragraph. If the agency
provides projections for a period longer than the period referred to in that paragraph, the Secretary may consider
those projections. 
(ii) The Secretary may require a guaranty agency to provide financial projections in a form and on the basis of assumptions
prescribed by the Secretary. If the Secretary requests the agency to provide financial projections, the agency shall
provide the projections within 60 days of the Secretary's request. If the agency does not provide the projections
within the specified time period, the Secretary determines the amount of reserve funds needed by the agency on the
basis of other information. 
(c) 

Notice. 

(1) The Secretary or an authorized Departmental official begins a proceeding to order a guaranty agency to return
a portion of its reserve funds, or to direct the return of reserve funds or assets subject to return, by sending the guaranty
agency a notice by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(2) The notice_

(i) Informs the guaranty agency of the Secretary's determination that the reserve funds or assets must be returned;

(ii) Describes the basis for the Secretary's determination and contains sufficient information to allow the guaranty
agency to prepare and present an appeal; 
(iii) States the date by which the return of reserve funds or assets must be completed; 
(iv) Describes the process for appealing the determination, including the time for filing an appeal and the procedure
for doing so; and 
(v) Identifies any actions that the guaranty agency must take to ensure that the reserve funds or assets that are the
subject of the notice are maintained and protected against use, expenditure, transfer, or other disbursement after
the date of the Secretary's determination, and the basis for requiring those actions. The actions may include, but
are not limited to, directing the agency to place the reserve funds in an escrow account. If the Secretary has directed
the guaranty agency to require the return of reserve funds or assets held by or under the control of another entity,
the guaranty agency shall ensure that the agency's claims to those funds or assets and the collectability of the agency's
claims will not be compromised or jeopardized during an appeal. The guaranty agency shall also comply with all other
applicable regulations relating to the use of reserve funds and assets. 
(d) 

Appeal.

 (1) A guaranty agency may appeal the Secretary's determination that reserve funds or assets must be returned by filing
a written notice of appeal within 20 days of the date of the guaranty agency's receipt of the notice of the Secretary's
determination. If the agency files a notice of appeal, the requirement that the return of reserve funds or assets be
completed by a particular date is suspended pending completion of the appeal process. If the agency does not file a
notice of appeal within the period specified in this paragraph, the Secretary's determination is final. 
(2) A guaranty agency shall submit the information described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section within 45 days of
the date of the guaranty agency's receipt of the notice of the Secretary's determination unless the Secretary agrees
to extend the period at the agency's request. If the agency does not submit that information within the prescribed
period, the Secretary's determination is final. 
(3) A guaranty agency's appeal of a determination that reserve funds or assets must be returned is considered and decided
by a Departmental official other than the official who issued the determination or a subordinate of that official.

(4) In an appeal of the Secretary's determination, the guaranty agency shall_ 
(i) State the reasons the guaranty agency believes the reserve funds or assets need not be returned; 
(ii) Identify any evidence on which the guaranty agency bases its position that the reserve funds or assets need not
be returned; 
(iii) Include copies of the documents that contain this evidence; 
(iv) Include any arguments that the guaranty agency believes support its position that the reserve funds or assets
need not be returned; and 
(v) Identify the steps taken by the guaranty agency to comply with the requirements referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(v)
of this section. 
(5)(i) In its appeal, the guaranty agency may request the opportunity to make an oral argument to the deciding official
for the purpose of clarifying any issues raised by the appeal. The deciding official provides such an opportunity
promptly after the 
expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 
(ii) The agency may not submit new evidence at or after the oral argument unless the deciding official determines otherwise.
A transcript of the oral argument is made a part of the record of the appeal and is promptly provided to the agency. 
(6) The guaranty agency has the burden of production and the burden of persuading the deciding official that the Secretary's
determination should be modified or withdrawn. 
(e) 

Third-party participation.

 (1) If the Secretary issues a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary promptly publishes
a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing the portion of the reserve fund to be returned by the agency and providing interested persons an opportunity
to submit written information relating to the determination within 30 days after the date of publication. The Secretary
publishes the notice no earlier than five days after the agency receives a copy of the determination. 
(2) If the guaranty agency to which the determination relates files a notice of appeal of the determination, the deciding
official may consider any information submitted in response to the 

Federal Register

 notice. All information submitted by a third party is available for inspection and copying at the offices of the Department
of Education in Washington, D.C., during normal business hours.

(f) 

Adverse information.

 If the deciding official considers information in addition to the evidence described in the notice of the Secretary's
determination that is adverse to the guaranty agency's position on appeal, the deciding official informs the agency
and provides it a reasonable opportunity to respond to the information without regard to the period referred to in
paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 

(g) 

Decision. 

(1) The deciding official issues a written decision on the guaranty agency's appeal within 45 days of the date on which
the information described in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section is received, or the oral argument referred
to in paragraph (d)(5) of this section is held, whichever is later. The deciding official mails the decision to the
guaranty agency by certified mail, return receipt requested. The decision of the deciding official becomes the final
decision of the Secretary 30 days after the deciding official issues it. In the case of a determination that a guaranty
agency must return reserve funds, if the deciding official does not issue a decision within the prescribed period,
the agency is no longer required to take the actions described in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section. 

(2) A guaranty agency may not seek judicial review of the Secretary's determination to require the return of reserve
funds or assets until the deciding official issues a decision. 

(3) The deciding official's written decision includes the basis for the decision. The deciding official bases the
decision only on evidence described in the notice of the Secretary's determination and on information properly submitted
and considered by the deciding official under this section. The deciding official is bound by all applicable statutes
and regulations and may neither waive them nor rule them invalid. 

(h) 

Collection of reserve funds or assets.

 (1) If the deciding official's final decision requires the guaranty agency to return reserve funds, or requires the
guaranty agency to require the return of reserve funds or assets to the agency or to the Secretary, the decision states
a new date for compliance with the decision. The new date is no earlier than the date on which the decision becomes the
final decision of the Secretary. 

(2) If the guaranty agency fails to comply with the decision, the Secretary may recover the reserve funds from any funds
due the agency from the Department without any further notice or procedure and may take any other action permitted
or 
authorized by law to compel compliance.

Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airport Proceedings


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rule (NPRM); extension of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document announces an extension of the comment period on Notice 92-18, entitled, ``Rules of Practice for
Federally Assisted Airport Proceedings,'' Docket No. 27783 (59 FR 29880, June 9, 1994). The notice provided a comment
period extending until August 8, 1994. The comment period for the notice is extended until September 15, 1994. The
extension responds to requests by the Airports Council International_North America (ACI-NA), the American
Association of Airport Executives (AAAE), and the Air Transport Association of America (ATA). The extension will
permit interested parties additional time to develop comments and will provide commenters the opportunity to consider
the effects of any legislation adopted by Congress that may affect the proposed policy and rules.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 9, 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and the FAA issued two related notices on the subject
of Federal policy on airport rates and charges. A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding
Airport Rates and Charges,'' listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believe define Federal policy
on the rates and fees that an airport proprietor can charge to aeronautical users of the airport. (59 FR 29874). Notice
94-18, a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airports,'' proposed
detailed procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against airports for alleged
violation of Federal requirements involving rates and charges and other airport-related requirements.


By letters filed in both dockets, ACI-NA, AAAE, and ATA request an extension of the comment period for both notices.
The commenters request an extension because they believe that additional time is needed to coordinate with members
of each organization and formulate a position, and because legislation now under consideration by Congress could
require DOT/FAA to make changes in one or both notices. The commenters request an extension of 4 weeks from the date
a conference report is issued on the pending legislation or from the date of enactment of new legislation.
In order to provide persons interested in the notices the opportunity to consider their positions in light of congressional
action, and to provide additional time to prepare comments, the OST and the FAA find that it would be in the public interest
to extend the comment period for a reasonable time. Accordingly, the comment periods for the notice of proposed policy
and the notice of proposed rulemaking are both extended from August 8 to September 15, 1994.
In the event that legislation is enacted that requires that a final policy statement and final rule be issued by a certain
date, the OST and the FAA may issue a subsequent notice shortening the comment period if necessary to meet the statutory
deadline for a final rule. Notice of any further change in the comment period would be published in the 

Federal Register

.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule contains: a proposed definition of ``income'' for families and households, a proposed change in the calculation
of the planning and administration limitation; a proposed change removing the special protection afforded program
income in revolving funds; a proposed change to the  570.207(b)(4) definition of ineligible income payments;

to prescribe the manner of its submission, to permit consolidation of amendment submissions, and to add a provision
for describing ``float-funded'' activities in the statement; a proposed change specifying three situations in
which income earned on grant funds must be remitted to the U.S. Treasury; a proposed change restricting use of CDBG
funds outside the jurisdiction of the recipient; a proposed change to require transfer of excess program income to
the line of credit; a proposed change to authorize the Department to delay making a CDBG grant to any community whose
Grantee Performance Report (GPR), at the time the grant is to be awarded, has not been submitted in a manner consistent
with the GPR Form Instructions; and proposed performance standards to replace the Housing Assistance Plan (HAP)
standards at  570.903, for determining whether a grantee has carried out its certification concerning following
its Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS). 



Most of the described changes are proposed in response to problems HUD has identified in its administration of the
program. Many of these proposals are the direct recommendations or suggestions of the Department's Inspector General.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



This proposed rule would revise the Community Development Block Grant Program (24 CFR Part 570) to respond to perceived
problems and abuses HUD has identified in the program. This rule contains: 1) a proposed definition of ``income''
for families and households that will continue to allow some grantee discretion in the selection of a definition while
setting the parameters of the choices; 2) a proposed change in the calculation of the planning and administration
limitation to establish the specific, exclusive method for calculation; 3) a proposed change removing the special
protection afforded program income in revolving funds; 4) a proposed change to  570.207(b)(4) clarifying
the definition of ineligible income payments and lessening its coverage; 5) a proposed change to reorganize the section
of the rule describing the statement of community development objectives, to prescribe its content and the manner
of its submission, to permit consolidation of amendment submissions, and to add a provision for describing how ``float-funded''
activities must be shown in the statement; 6) a proposed change to specify when income earned on grant funds must be
remitted to the U.S. Treasury; 7) a proposed change restricting use of CDBG funds outside the jurisdiction of the recipient
to instances in which such use will principally benefit residents of the recipient; 8) a proposed change that will
remove an incentive for grantees to make loans to earn income by requiring transfer of excess program income to the
line of credit; 9) a proposed change to authorize the Department to delay making a CDBG grant to any community whose
Grantee Performance Report (GPR), at the time the grant is to be awarded, has not been submitted in a manner consistent
with the GPR Form Instructions; and 10) proposed performance standards to replace the Housing Assistance Plan (HAP)
standards at  570.903, for determining whether a grantee has carried out its certification concerning following
its Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS). Many of these proposals are the direct recommendations
or suggestions of the Department's Inspector General. 

The Department recently published consolidated submission and reporting requirements, in another proposed rule.
Differences between this program-specific rule and that more broad-based rule be resolved before final regulations
are issued.

Definition of Income 



Changes are proposed at 24 CFR 570.3. This proposed rule would for the first time define what constitutes income for
purposes of determining whether persons or households qualify as low or moderate income under the CDBG program. To
preserve the flexibility of the program while ensuring greater uniformity in the critical program issue of determining
the extent to which low- and moderate-income persons benefit from CDBG-funded activities, the Department is proposing
that the grantee be required to select either of the Section 8, Census Long Form, or IRS Adjusted Gross definitions
of what is income for each type of activity benefiting low- and moderate-income persons. (The rule makes slight modifications
to the Section 8 definition to bring it into accord with the CDBG program purposes.) The option to choose a definition
does not apply to activities that qualify for the low- and moderate-income area benefit criteria in  570.208(a)(1)
except when the recipient carries out a survey. Activities qualifying under  570.208(a)(1) generally must
use the area income data, which is taken from the decennial census and supplied to recipients by HUD. 

HUD believes a definition of income is desirable to ensure that when CDBG funds are used to address the national objective
of benefiting persons of low and moderate income, those deemed to benefit are actually low- and moderate-income persons.
The Department repeatedly has received questions about the definition of income, and is aware of the potential for
abuse in this area.

In 1984, HUD proposed definitions of low- and moderate-income household, low- and moderate-income person, low-income
household, low-income person, moderate-income household, and moderate-income person that included a reference
to the definition of income under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program at 24 CFR Part 813. As the September
6, 1988, preamble to the Final Rule stemming from that proposal noted:

 


The majority of commenters objected to the reference * * * because they concluded that grantees would
be required to calculate income eligibility for the CDBG program in exactly the same manner as for the Section 8 program.
Several commenters pointed out that the use of the Section 8 methodology would make many low- and moderate-income
homeowners ineligible for rehabilitation activities and for jobs created by economic development projects. This
was the case, commenters said, because under Section 8 procedures real property assets are considered in determining
income levels.

 


At the time the referenced definitions were proposed, HUD only intended to reflect the requirements at section 102(a)(20)
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (the Act) that the 

income limits

 established for CDBG purposes must be equivalent to those used in the Section 8 program. Therefore, the proposed reference
to the definition of annual income at part 813 was removed in the Final Rule, and the following was added: ``The method
for determining income under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program need not be used for this purpose.''
This rule proposes to remove the quoted sentence wherever it appears. The definitions proposed in this rule would
be used in calculating incomes of individual families and households to be applied against the established income
limits in determining whether such families and households are low or moderate income under the CDBG program. 

The Inspector General has repeatedly expressed its preference that the CDBG program have an easily verifiable definition
of income to standardize income qualification across the country and to help limit the risk of abuse in this area. 

In developing a proposed definition, the Department decided to review a number of Federal definitions already in
use by grantees and beneficiaries before beginning completely anew. Use of an established definition should pose
fewer training problems and lower changeover costs for grantees, as well as offering the potential of ``doubling
up'' on verifications. Before proposing the definition in this rule, the Department reviewed the definitions used
under Section 8, Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Food Stamps, National Student Lunch, and Food Distribution
Programs, and the Census and IRS definitions of income. In selecting the approach proposed in this rule, HUD used the
following criteria in judging the various definitions reviewed: comprehensiveness (covered most sources/fewest
exclusions); verifiability; familiarity of the definition to HUD staff, grantees and beneficiaries; fit with the
objectives and practices of the CDBG program; and ease of administration. The three definitions that HUD believes
most closely meet the above criteria are the Section 8 definition, the Census definition, and the IRS Adjusted Gross
Income definition. 

One option considered was a modified Section 8 definition of annual income. The Section 8 definition is second to the
IRS definition in comprehensiveness of income sources considered and its exclusions are close to the other aid program
definitions. (Census has no exclusions, and IRS has a very limited number.) Agencies verifying income under the Section
8 definition could validate beneficiaries' income by direct contact with employers or assistance agencies. This
definition is familiar to many HUD staff and the housing staff of many CDBG grantees. While it may be familiar to persons
administering housing-related assistance under the CDBG program, it is less likely to be familiar to grantee and
subrecipient staff administering economic development and public service activities. Because the CDBG program
considers income of the family or household 

at the time assistance is provided,

 ease of administration primarily means ease in explaining the definition to the beneficiary and calculating income.
(Considering income at the time assistance is provided means that the annual income of the family or household, as
applicable, should be projected based on the prevailing rate of income of each person at the time assistance is provided.)
The Section 8 definition, with a fairly large number of exclusions from income, can take some time to explain and calculate.
In particular, estimating the value of Net Family Assets and calculating the income attributable to the assets in
excess of $5000 can sometimes be difficult. For example, if a grantee wants to provide an economic development loan
to a business for working capital, and intends to meet the national objective of low- and moderate-income job creation
and retention, each of the benefiting employees would have to undergo an assets review if the use of the section 8 definition
were to be mandatory. Note that the need to apply the Net Family Asset calculation is probably perfunctory in the Section
8 (rental assistance) program since persons receiving a rental subsidy are not likely to own a house and few would have
many other includable assets. On the other hand, it is arguable that, from the standpoint of the objectives of the CDBG
program, inclusion of some part of the value of major non-income producing assets would be desirable to help focus
assistance on the more needy, particularly with respect to the elderly who may not have much annual income but have
high value assets. 

The Census definition reviewed was that used for the decennial census so called ``long form.'' It has both the fewest
inclusions and the fewest exclusions of the definitions reviewed. All of the inclusions except ``net income from
operation of a business'' could be easily verified by contacting employers and assistance agencies. There are no
exclusions. Grantee and HUD staff and beneficiaries are not likely to be familiar with the definition, unless they
have recently completed a census long-form questionnaire. It is noteworthy that income based on the Census definition
is used by HUD for CDBG formula allocation and low- and moderate-income summary data by Census tract and block group.
The definition would probably be easy to explain to beneficiaries and to calculate, and would likely be the simplest
definition to use for an income survey for determining the percent of low- and moderate-income persons in an area.
The definition does not attribute income to ownership of non-income-producing assets.

The IRS definition of ``adjusted gross income'' on IRS Form 1040 has the largest number of inclusions and a very small
number of adjustments. Adjusted gross income can be verified by calling employers and assistance agencies, as well
as by reviewing actual tax returns (that, although they may not be submitted to the IRS at the same time as the assistance
was provided, can provide a validity check for the income reported by the beneficiary then). The IRS definition is
very likely to be familiar to grantee and HUD staff, and to most beneficiaries. While it is not designed to calculate
family or household income (including dependents), it can easily be adapted. For some beneficiaries, calculating
all the inclusions (such as business income or loss) may be difficult. With few exclusions to consider, the definition
should be moderately easy to explain and administer. A further advantage of the IRS definition is that agencies can
easily take advantage of inexpensive off-the-shelf software to automate and document its use. This definition also
does not attribute income to ownership of non-income-producing assets. This definition is likely to be the easiest
to administer for special economic development activities in cases in which the assisted business is collecting
income information. Most of these businesses will not be familiar with any federal income definition other than that
of the IRS. 

In this rule, the Department is proposing that a recipient be allowed to select and use the Section 8, Census, or IRS
Adjusted Gross Income definition for each of its CDBG activity types. (A grantee could also elect to use one definition
for all its activity types.) When the CDBG activity is homeowner rehabilitation, the net value of the primary residence
of the beneficiary may be excluded from Net Family Assets where the recipient is using the Section 8 definition. As
noted, all CDBG entitlement recipients would be required to use one of the three definitions for each activity. For
administrative reasons, the Department recommends, but does not propose to require, use of the modified Section
8 definition for housing and housing-related activities, especially those that are also assisted by other HUD programs
(such as HOME or HOPE or Section 8). Also, the Department is aware that grantees may follow somewhat different standards
when computing relocation payments. 

This rule would not change the requirements at  570.506(b) regarding records to be maintained when information
on income by family size is required. That is, the grantee could still elect to keep records to show either that 1) the
person assisted qualified under another assistance program with income qualification standards at least as restrictive
as the CDBG definitions, 2) a copy of a verifiable certification (based on one of the three proposed definitions) from
the assisted person was obtained, or 3) the person was referred from an agency that determined the individual's income
status and maintains appropriate documentation. 

One further note: this rule does 

not

 propose to require recipients to use a particular standard procedure for determining the amount of benefit to be provided,
such as that used in HUD's housing programs for determining a family's contribution toward rent. This rule only specifies
what components must be included in the calculation of income. Each recipient remains free to determine the level
of benefit, such as the amount of rehabilitation subsidy, it considers to be necessary and reasonable for each CDBG-assisted
activity. 



Calculating the Planning and Administration Limitation 



This proposed rule includes changes at  570.200(g). The language at  570.200(g) on the 20 percent limitation
on expenditures for planning and administration for entitlement recipients would be revised to establish the specific,
exclusive method for calculation of this limitation. While the vast majority of entitlement recipients have followed
the guidelines in the current rules for calculating expenditures without regard to the source year of funds used to
pay for such costs, some recipients have continued to claim compliance based on individual source years. Recipients
would no longer be allowed to demonstrate compliance by apportioning planning and administrative expenses to each
source year of CDBG funds. 

The Department has determined that it is no longer advisable to allow entitlement recipients to meet this requirement
on a ``source year'' basis for the following reasons: 

a) The Grantee Performance Report (GPR), HUD's principal tool for determining compliance with the 20 percent limitation,
does not track expenditures on a source year basis; and, 

b) the Department has concluded that the allocation of expenditures for program administration against individual
activities is inherently arbitrary, and thus is likely to result in an inaccurate measure of how much of the total expenditures
for administration in a given year applies to any individual activity. For example, a recipient may have spent $100,000
administering an ongoing rehabilitation loan program in FY 1992. The money used to fund the loans in FY 1992 included
grant funds received in FY 1992 and previous years, and program income from repayments of loans received over multiple
years. To make the calculations necessary to allocate the $100,000 expenditure for program administration on a source
year basis, the recipient must assign each dollar spent for making loans that year to a source year. Such assignment
is a cumbersome, difficult task fraught with the potential for error. With this proposed regulation, HUD would assure
the uniformity of the procedures used by all entitlements, and further ensure that the administrative and planning
limitation will be calculated in the most efficient way. 



Prohibition of Income Payments 



The prohibition against income payments at  570.207(b)(4) in the current rule was principally intended to
keep CDBG funds from providing ongoing cash payments directly to individuals to provide for their subsistence. For
example, this would include making monthly payments to an individual to allow that individual to pay for housing,
food, clothes, day care, or utilities. However, the Department has determined that the current provision goes too
far beyond that objective. The proposed redefinition at  570.207(b)(4) reflects this determination. The
Department has further determined that, although downpayment assistance is listed as an example of an income payment
in the current rule, a one-time payment for downpayment assistance should not be classified as an income payment for
these purposes. Therefore, under this proposed rule downpayment assistance to individual homebuyers would be provided
with CDBG in one of three ways: (1) under the Direct Homeownership provision of the National Affordable Housing Act
(NAHA) (currently due to terminate in October, 1994); (2) under  570.202(b)(1) to assist acquisition for the
purpose of rehabilitation; or (3) under  570.201(e) as an eligible public service activity. The Department
has also determined that 

loans

 to individuals to provide for their subsistence are not ongoing cash payments and therefore proposes that they be
considered eligible public services rather than income payments. A conforming change is also being proposed in  570.201(e).

Reorganization, Standard Submission, and Float-Funded Activities in the Statement of Community Development Objectives
(Final Statement) 



This portion of the rule proposes several changes at  570.301 to the requirements for the statement of community
development objectives, generally known as the final statement, that grantees are required to submit to HUD in order
to receive their grants. On March 28, 1990, HUD published a proposed regulation to implement certain statutory changes
to the CDBG program made in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242, approved February
5, 1988) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development_Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1989 (Pub.
L. 100-404, approved August 19, 1988). A final rule implementing these 1987 changes has not yet been issued.
Section 570.301 is among the sections of the CDBG rule that will be altered from the rule presently in effect in the forthcoming
final rule. This proposed rule deals with and clarifies matters that were not addressed by the previous proposed rule.
Readers should note that the text proposed here for  570.301(c) was developed on the premise that the basic requirements
of  570.301 (a) and (b), as published in the previous proposed rule, will be similar to those expected to be published
in the final rule. The Department recently published consolidated submission requirements, in another proposed
rule. Differences between this program-specific rule and that more broad-based rule will be resolved before final
regulations are issued. 

In this rule, first, for clarity, the rule would be reorganized into sections on sources and uses of funds, content
of the statement, citizen participation, and float-funded activities. Second, the final statement would be required
to be submitted in a manner prescribed by HUD. Third, the details concerning required content and citizen participation
would be more clearly specified. Fourth, the rule would permit final statement amendments to be submitted to HUD in
consolidated form at the end of the program year. Finally, float-funded activities and the circumstances under which
they would be authorized would be defined and a procedure described for identifying such activities in the statement.


The second and third changes, which would require the final statement to contain certain specific details and to be
submitted in a manner prescribed by HUD, are intended to serve four purposes. First, citizens would be better able
to follow CDBG activities through the entire program cycle because the prescribed submission would share many common
elements with the grantee performance report (GPR). Second, a standard submission would ensure that all citizens
receive a comparable basic level of information on all proposed activities. Third, standard submissions would improve
the efficiency of HUD's processing of the final statement, and its ability to train grantee and HUD staff on final statement
requirements. Finally, making the final statement submission standard for all grantees would facilitate automation
of the statement, linking that automation to an automated GPR. Ultimately, this automation could save grantees and
HUD much time and effort, while preserving grantee flexibility in deciding how funds will be used. 

The fourth change, allowing consolidation of amendment submissions, is being proposed for the sake of increased
efficiency for grantees. 

The final change is being proposed because of difficulties experienced by HUD with management of ``float'' activities,
including those identified in the Inspector General's audit of CDBG interim financing. For purposes of this section,
an activity that uses undisbursed funds in the line of credit or program account that have been previously budgeted
in a final statement for one or more activities that do not need the funds immediately would be called a ``float-funded
activity.'' HUD has long held that a float-funded activity must meet all of the same requirements that apply to CDBG-assisted
activities generally. However, the regulations have been silent on managing these activities. After review, the
Department has determined that the primary risks to the CDBG program inherent in the float funding process are, first,
that the float-funded activity will not generate sufficient program income in a timely manner to allow for timely
undertaking of previously budgeted activities. Second, if proposed float-funded activities and the possible consequences
of their default are not disclosed to citizens in sufficient detail, they will not be afforded sufficient information
to fully understand how they may be affected by each activity, and thus not have the opportunity to object to such a use
of the funds. Third, in undertaking a float-funded activity that exceeds a certain size or duration, grantees apparently
assume that they will receive sufficient additional CDBG funds in future years to continue funding previously budgeted
activities until the float-funded activity generates program income. However, grantees are only authorized to
use such a funding technique (e.g. banking on future CDBG funds as assurance to backstop a large loan for a particular
activity in the present) under the section 108 Loan Guarantee program. 

The proposed rule would either eliminate the first risk by requiring one of two forms of guarantee for the float funds,
or limit it by requiring a commitment for timely identification of specific previously budgeted activities that
would be deleted. The second risk would be limited by requiring more detailed information to be provided to citizens
on each float-funded activity. The third factor would be minimized by limiting CDBG float-funded activities to those
that are expected to generate program income within a period of time defined in the regulation. The proposed time limit
was selected keeping the standards at  570.902(a) in mind. Sixty days prior to the end of any program year, the
amount of CDBG funds in the line of credit should be no more than 1.5 times the amount of the current grant amount. Then,
at the beginning of any program year, with the new grant in the line of credit, the maximum amount in the line of credit
could be as much as 2.5 times the annual grant amount. Therefore, 2.5 years was selected as the maximum duration of any
float-funded activity, since this is the maximum time period that a grantee could be reasonably certain of having
CDBG funds available absent additional appropriations. The Department requests comment on these provisions and
also whether the rule should additionally specify a limit on the proportion of a grantee's funds that it could use for
float-funded activities at any one period in time.

Spending Funds Outside the Jurisdiction of the Recipient 


This portion of the proposed rule would add a new  570.309. In the early years of the CDBG program, HUD would likely
find an application that proposed spending CDBG funds outside of the jurisdiction of the grantee to be plainly inappropriate
to address the identified needs of the jurisdiction. Under the statute then, such a finding was the basis for HUD to
disapprove the application. Since 1981, the regulations have been silent on this matter, but the Department has ruled
in several cases that a grantee's decision to spend CDBG funds outside the jurisdiction was allowable. The Department
now believes that it would be helpful to state clearly the circumstances under which this practice is allowed in order
to remove any uncertainty on the part of grantees and auditors. The limitation proposed (i.e. that the principal benefit
of such an activity must be for residents of the jurisdiction of the recipient) is important to ensure that the community's
share of the national appropriation of entitlement funds, which is based on the community's relative share of needs,
is expended in a manner that addresses the needs for which the funds were provided. What would be precluded by this change
is the lending of CDBG funds to entities outside the grantee's jurisdiction when the principal benefit to the jurisdiction
would be interest earned on the loan. Thus an urban county would not be authorized to loan funds to non-participating
units of general local government within the boundaries of the county unless the urban county could make the required
determination that the activity (without regard to the use of the interest expected to be earned on a loan made for the
activity) would principally benefit citizens within the urban county. 


Revolving Funds 


This portion of the proposed rule includes changes at 
  570.500(a)(1)(viii), 570.502(a)(5), 570.500(b), and 570.504(b)(2)(i). A revolving fund is defined
at  570.500(b) to mean ``* * * a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other
program accounts) established for the purpose of carrying out specific activities which, in turn, generate payments
to the fund in carrying out the same activities.'' Revolving funds are used most frequently in connection with rehabilitation
and economic development projects that involve loans. 
Revolving funds are established and administered typically in the following manner. A loan is made with CDBG funds
(e.g., to a private property owner to rehabilitate her home). Payments on that loan (i.e., principal or interest,
or both) constitute program income that is credited as CDBG program income on the grantee's books and held in an account
independent of other program accounts. The program income in that account, including interest earned on the funds
while on deposit pending their re-use, becomes the source of financing for additional loans of the same type (e.g.,
housing rehabilitation). Hence, the term ``revolving fund'' has been used to describe such a fund. 
Of course, much of the same objective could be achieved without the need to establish an independent account. Loan
payments could simply be placed in the grantee's general CDBG account. (The entity used for other CDBG funds would
vary from community to community; however, CDBG funds are often budgeted and accounted for in a special revenue fund.)
Program income generated by a particular activity could be earmarked in advance for use in carrying out additional
transactions (e.g., loans) involving the same kind of activity (e.g., housing rehabilitation). 
However, the use of a revolving fund has another advantage over the fund used to budget and account for other CDBG funds,
besides the fact that the community does not have to reconsider the use of program income generated by a particular
activity following its receipt. The second advantage is the special treatment given program income in revolving
funds under the current CDBG regulations. A recipient that establishes a revolving fund to carry out a particular
activity must substantially disburse any program income in that fund before making additional cash withdrawals
from the Treasury for the same kind of activity; however, the recipient may make additional withdrawals from the Treasury
for other activities before substantially disbursing the program income from the revolving fund. This authority
appears to have created an incentive for some grantees to create revolving funds to shelter the program income on hand
from cash withdrawal requirements and to earn interest income from the investment of the program income pending its
use for the revolving fund activity. There is also some indication that it has created the incentive for some grantees
to delay the reuse of the funds, since the longer the funds stay in the account the more interest they earn while on deposit.

The HUD Inspector General has identified a number of cases where funds in a revolving account were clearly not being
used in a timely manner. Because of the fact that the grantees involved were allowed to leave the funds in a revolving
account and to draw funds from their lines of credit to meet their cash needs for other CDBG assisted activities, this
has resulted in additional, and seemingly unwarranted, cost to the U.S. Treasury. HUD is generally in favor of the
use of revolving funds, since it is a sensible way to program funds to meet ongoing needs, such as housing rehabilitation
and business assistance. However, it must also be concerned about avoiding unnecessary costs to the Treasury. Under
this proposed rule, recipients would no longer be authorized to shelter program income in revolving funds. The proposed
rule would require that all program income, including program income in a revolving fund, be disbursed before further
cash withdrawals are made from the U.S. Treasury. 
The changes made by this rule would not preclude the use of funds in a revolving manner. However, the Department recognizes
that compliance with the proposed rule's requirement that all program income be disbursed before additional cash
withdrawals are permitted would make administration of revolving funds more complicated. This additional complexity
may, as a practical matter, make revolving funds infeasible for some grantees. 
Other options that HUD believes might be used to address the problem include: 
(1) limiting the amount of program income in any revolving fund to the amount that could be expected to be needed for
funding the activity within a certain time period (such as 30 days); and 
(2) limiting the number of revolving funds per recipient. 
However, each of these has a drawback. A limitation on the amount allowed in a revolving account would mean additional
administrative burden for both the grantee and HUD to ensure compliance with such a limitation. A limit on the number
of revolving funds might pose an undesirable restriction on a grantee's capacity to address its needs in the most sensible
way. Because of these problems and since these options would still permit funds to be withdrawn from the Treasury for
other purposes while program income is available to the recipient, they were not selected to be proposed for this rule.

The Department requests comments on this proposed provision that explain how the benefits of using revolving funds
as they are under current rules might be considered to outweigh the costs to the U.S. Treasury. Comments are particularly
solicited that would identify the advantages of the current system that go beyond the obvious ones of administrative
convenience and the additional interest income earned by a grantee as a result of the investment of program income
while sheltered in a revolving account. Specifically, the Department would be interested in determining the amount
of any additional program costs that might result from administering revolving fund activities under this proposed
rule so that cost could be compared with the likely savings to the Treasury. 
Therefore, the changes proposed in this rule would remove the language at   570.504(b)(2)(i) and (ii)
that permits recipients to shelter program income in revolving funds. The proposed rule would require all program
income to be substantially disbursed before additional cash withdrawals were made. The reference at  570.500(a)(1)(viii)
to interest earned in revolving funds would be removed, and the subparagraph would be reserved. The definition of
revolving fund at  570.500(b) would be removed and the paragraph reserved. 


Income Earned on Grant Funds 


The proposed rule includes a change at  570.500(a)(2) concerning interest earned on ineligible loans and reimbursed
funds. This change is one of several in this rule resulting from the HUD Inspector General's review of the CDBG program.
It also reflects a recent decision by the Comptroller General of the United States (issued May 11, 1992) with respect
to interest earned on unauthorized loans of Federal grant funds. 
This proposed rule specifies three situations in which income earned on grant funds must be remitted to HUD for transmittal
to the U.S. Treasury. The first is interest earned from the investment of the initial proceeds of a grant advance by
the U.S. Treasury (e.g., funds wire-transferred to a recipient pursuant to a withdrawal from its line of credit for
a grant). The second situation is income (e.g., interest) earned on loans or forms of assistance made with CDBG funds
that are used for activities determined by HUD either to be ineligible or to fail to meet a national objective in accordance
with the requirements of subpart C of this part, or fail substantially to meet any other requirement of this part. The
third situation is interest earned on amounts that have been reimbursed pursuant to  570.910(b)(5) prior to
the funds being used for eligible purposes. 


Return of Excess Program Income 


This portion of the proposed rule includes changes at 
 570.504(b)(2) and  570.503(b)(3). Under the current rules, there is an incentive for a recipient to
make quick turnaround loans_even if the recipient does not earn interest on the loans. By making such a loan, the recipient,
in effect, quickly changes the nature of the funds to program income. It may then place them in its program account and
earn interest pending the use of the funds to meet cash needs of the program. The proposed changes would remove an incentive
for recipients to make loans to earn income rather than using the funds strictly for community development purposes.
The rule does this by requiring all program income held by an entitlement recipient that is in excess of one-twelfth
of the most recent grant made pursuant to  570.304 to be remitted to HUD to be restored to the recipient's line
of credit, and by requiring that each subrecipient agreement specify that any program income held by the subrecipient
that is in excess of one-twelfth of its estimated annual expenditure of CDBG funds be remitted to the recipient (thus,
if the subrecipient agreement is for a twelve-month period, the amount of program income would be one-twelfth of the
agreement amount).

Grant Delays for GPRs that are Inconsistent with Instructions 



This portion of the proposed rule includes changes at 
  570.304, 570.900 and 570.910. The Department considers the Grantee Performance Report (GPR) to be
the foundation of HUD's ability to fulfill the statutory requirement that it review each grantee's performance at
least annually. Some time ago, the Department, through its Financial Management Task Force, determined that it needed
to take action against grantees that failed to submit reports in the prescribed forms in a timely manner. To accomplish
this, the Task Force recommended that HUD amend the CDBG regulations to authorize HUD to hold back on making grants
in cases where previous GPRs have not been submitted in a manner consistent with GPR Form Instructions. The purpose
of the rule is to bring pressure to bear on grantees that are seriously delinquent in this matter. The language of the
rule would only affect the most egregious cases, because a GPR is due nine months before the next grant is made. (For
example, City X ends its program year 15 on June 30, 1993. HUD then makes the grant for program year 16 on July 1. The city's
GPR for program year 15 will be due on September 30, 1993. If that GPR is not properly submitted by June 30, 1994, this
rule would allow HUD to delay making the program year 17 CDBG grant, otherwise due on July 1, 1994, until the overdue
report is properly submitted.) The rule would not permit delaying the grant simply because the GPR was submitted late,
if it is submitted in proper form by the time the new grant is to be made, although persistent lateness by a grantee could
be addressed through the use of the sanctions provisions at   570.910, 570.911, and 570.913. 



CHAS Performance Standards for CDBG Entitlements 



This proposed rule describes the review standards HUD proposes to use in determining whether a CDBG entitlement recipient
is following a current HUD-approved Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), as it is required to certify
under  570.303(l). These standards would replace those for the Housing Assistance Plan (HAP) that itself has
been replaced by the CHAS. 

The proposed standards relate to the CHAS implementation process. Thus, a grantee would be held accountable for taking
all planned actions to meet CHAS goals; and for pursuing all resources it indicated it would pursue. To assure that
each community's non-profit and other housing developers that may apply to HUD for assistance are fairly considered
for certifications of consistency with the CHAS, where such a certification is a prerequisite for application, a
grantee would be expected to provide certifications of consistency in a fair and impartial manner that furthers attainment
of the purposes and objectives of the grantee's housing strategy. The final specific standard is that no grantee may
hinder implementation of the CHAS by action or willful inaction. 

Failure on the part of a grantee to meet its annual CHAS goals for persons and households to be assisted would not, in
itself, constitute failure to follow the CHAS. While the Department would like to see every CHAS goal met, it is more
concerned that the process of developing and implementing the CHAS be carried out in a manner that furthers achievement
of the goal of the National Affordable Housing Act_that every American family be able to afford a decent home in a suitable
environment. To this end, the proposed CHAS performance standards for entitlement recipients will focus on the CHAS
implementation process, and, initially, if this process has been adequately followed, a lack of results would be
viewed as signalling a need for further technical assistance or for modifying the CHAS. (See the recently published
proposed rule for a Consolidated Plan, which would replace the CHAS.) 



Other Matters 



Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules
Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street
SW., Washington, DC 20410. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule
before publication and by approving it certifies that this proposed rule does not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule is limited to the effecting of relatively minor procedural
amendments within the structure of the CDBG program regulations. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the proposed rule is not subject to review
under the order. The proposed rule is limited to making relatively minor, procedural amendments within the structure
of the CDBG program regulations. 



Executive Order 12606, the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family

, has determined that this proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance,
and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD
policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to
family concerns. 



Regulatory Agenda 



This proposed rule was listed as item number 1633 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published
on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20457) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

that if the CDBG assistance being provided is homeowner rehabilitation under  570.202, the value of the homeowner's
primary residence may be excluded from any calculation of Net Family Assets); 

(ii) Income as reported under the Census long-form for the 1990 decennial Census. This definition includes: 

(A) Wages, salaries, tips, commissions, etc.; 

(B) Self-employment income from own non-farm business, including proprietorships and partnerships; 

(C) Farm self-employment income; 

(D) Interest, dividends, net rental income, or income from estates or trusts; 

(E) Social security or railroad retirement; 

(F) Supplemental Security Income, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or other public assistance or public
welfare programs; 

(G) Retirement, survivor, or disability pensions; and 

(H) Any other sources of income received regularly, including Veterans Administration payments, unemployment
compensation, and alimony; or 

(iii) Adjusted gross income as defined for purposes of reporting under IRS Form 1040 for individual Federal income
tax purposes. 

(2) The annual income of the family or household, as applicable, should be projected based on the prevailing rate of
income of each person at the time assistance is provided for the individual, family or household, and shall include
income from all family or household members. Income or asset enhancement derived from the CDBG-assisted activity
shall not be considered in calculating income. Grantees may select any of the three listed definitions for each activity,
except that integrally related activities of the same type and having the same qualifications as those set forth in
 570.208(a), shall use the same definition of annual income. The option to choose a definition does not apply
to activities that qualify under  570.208(a)(1) except when the recipient carries out a survey. Activities
qualifying under  570.208(a)(1) generally must use the area income data supplied to recipients by HUD.

 The general rule is that CDBG funds may not be used for income payments. For purposes of the CDBG program, income payments
means a series of subsistence-type grant payments made to an individual or family for items such as food, clothing,
housing (rent or mortgage), day care or utilities, but excludes one-time emergency payments made to the provider
of such items or services on behalf of an individual or family.

 570.301

 Presubmission and citizen participation requirements. 



* * * * * 



(c) Develop a statement of community development objectives and projected use of funds annually. The principal purpose
of the statement is for the grantee to describe to HUD and its citizens how it plans to use CDBG funds. When completed
and submitted to HUD, it is known as the final statement. The grantee must amend its final statement whenever it decides
not to carry out an activity described in the final statement, to carry out an activity not already included in the final
statement, or to change substantially the purpose, scope, location, or beneficiaries of an activity described in
the statement. The statement and any amendments must be prepared in accordance with the following: 

(1) 

Sources and uses.

 All available CDBG funds must be identified and accounted for in the statement by clearly identifying the source and
planned use of all CDBG funds that the grantee expects to receive during the upcoming program year, plus any CDBG funds
received in the current program year that are not included in the current year's final statement. 

(i) The sources of CDBG funds to be included in the statement are: 

(A) The annual grant to be received for that grant year; 

(B) Program income expected to be received during that program year; 

(C) Program income received during the preceding program year that has not been included in a final statement; 

(D) Program income expected to be received during the program year and in future program years from float-funded activities
described in the final statement (the amount of such income and the year(s) in which it is expected to be received must
be identified and the grantee must also explain how it will respond to any delays in the receipt of such future year income
(as required in paragraph (c)(4) of this section); 

(E) Program income expected to be received during that program year from a float-funded activity that was described
in an identified preceding final statement; 

(F) Surplus funds from any urban renewal settlement for community development and housing activities; and 

(G) Any grant funds returned to the line of credit, the planned use of which has not been included in a final statement.


(ii) The use of all such CDBG funds must be identified for specific activities and allowable contingencies, as described
in paragraph (c)(2). 

(2) 

Content.

 The statement must be submitted in the manner prescribed by HUD and must, at minimum, describe: 

(i) The community development objectives the grantee proposes to pursue; 

(ii) The community development activities the grantee proposes to carry out with anticipated CDBG funds to address
its community development objectives. 

(A) The statement must show how all of the funds expected to be available during the program year are expected to be used.
This means that all of the funds identified under the sources section must be programmed for use in specific activities,
except for any program income identified in the statement as stemming from a float-funded activity identified in
a final statement from a preceding program year, and except that an amount not to exceed ten percent of such total available
funds may be identified for the contingency of cost overruns in any of the activities contained in the statement. 

(B) An activity may not be included in a final statement, whether originally or by amendment, unless the activity was
previously described in the proposed statement, or a proposed amendment to the final statement, and has been properly
subject to citizen participation under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Neither may an activity be included in a
form that has been substantially modified from the form in which it was made known to citizens pursuant to paragraph
(c)(3). This means that, although the grantee has the final say as to which activities are selected for funding, it
cannot elect to include a new or substantially modified activity that has not been subject to or derived from the process
of citizen review. 

(iii) Each activity must be described in sufficient detail, including the specific regulatory provisions under
which it is eligible and is expected to meet a national objective, the amount of funds expected to be used, the location
of the activity, the amount of program income expected to be generated, and when such income is expected to be available
for use. The description must be in sufficient detail to permit a clear understanding of the nature of the activity
and to allow citizens to determine the degree to which they may be affected. For activities for which the grantee has
not yet decided on a specific location, such as when the grantee is allocating an amount of funds to be used for making
loans or grants to businesses or for residential rehabilitation, the description shall identify who may apply for
the assistance, the process by which the grantee expects to select who will receive the assistance (including selection
criteria) and how much and under what terms the assistance will be provided. The statement may include an ``urgent
needs'' activity (one that is not expected to qualify under  570.208 (a) or (b)) only if the grantee identifies
the activity in the statement and certifies that the activity is designed to meet other community development needs
having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare
of the community and other financial resources are not available. 

(iv) The statement must also describe where citizens may obtain additional information about activities described
in the statement. 

(v) Float-funded activities, described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, must be specifically identified as
such in the statement. 

(3) 

Citizen participation.

 (i) 

Statement.

 The grantee must prepare a statement identifying in the detail prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) the activities it proposes
to carry out, and must publish the statement community-wide to afford affected citizens an opportunity to examine
the statement and to provide comments on it. Publishing the proposed statement in a newspaper of general circulation
will be considered to constitute community-wide publication. Simply publishing a notice that the statement is available
in public libraries is not adequate for this purpose, unless such publication is accompanied by a broad distribution
of the statement among neighborhood or similar citizen groups representing virtually all areas of the community
whose residents are predominantly low and moderate income or that are blighted. After comment on the proposed statement
has been received, the grantee must consider the comments and make such modifications to the proposed statement as
the grantee considers appropriate. Upon completion, the grantee must make the final statement available to the public.

(ii) 

Amendment.

 Before amending a final statement, the grantee must provide for citizen participation concerning proposed amendments.
The grantee must provide citizens a reasonable amount of time to consider a proposed amendment and shall consider
any citizens' comments and may make such modifications to the proposed amendment as the grantee considers appropriate.
Upon completion, the grantee must make the amendment available to the public and must submit to HUD a description of
changes adopted. The grantee may submit a copy of each statement amendment to HUD as it occurs, or the grantee may simply
notify HUD in writing that the amendment has been made and, at the end of the program year, submit copies of all amendments
made during the year. Letters notifying HUD of amendments and those transmitting copies of amendments must be signed
by the official representative of the grantee authorized to take such action. 

(4) 

Float-funded activities and guarantees.

 A recipient may use undisbursed funds in the line of credit and its CDBG program account that are budgeted in statements
for one or more other activities that do not need the funds immediately, subject to the limitations described in paragraph
(c)(4). Such funds shall be referred to as the ``float'' for purposes of this section. Each activity carried out using
the float must meet all of the same requirements that apply to CDBG-assisted activities generally, and must be expected
to produce program income in an amount at least equal to the amount of the float so used. Whenever the recipient proposes
to fund an activity with the float, it must include the activity in its statement or amend the final statement for the
current program year. For purposes of this section, an activity that uses such funds will be called a ``float-funded
activity.'' Each float-funded activity must be individually listed and described as such in the statement. 

(i) The expected duration between obligation of assistance for a float-funded activity and receipt of program income
in an amount at least equal to the full amount drawn from the float to fund the activity may not exceed 2.5 years. A loan
for a longer term may not be funded from the float, but may be included in a statement if it is funded from CDBG funds other
than the float (e.g., grant funds, or proceeds from an approved Section 108 Loan guarantee). 

(ii) Unlike other projected program income, the full amount of income expected to be generated by a float-funded activity
must be shown in the sources section of the statement containing the activity whether or not some or all of the income
is expected to be received in a future program year. To justify the inclusion of activities that exceed the sources
of funds shown in the statement as expected to be received in the program year covered by the statement, and to assure
that citizens can clearly understand the risks inherent in undertaking such a float-funded activity, the recipient
must specify in the sources section of the statement the total amount of program income expected to be received and
the month(s) and year(s) that it expects the float-funded activity to generate each portion of such program income.


(iii) To help citizens assess the degree of risk to activities they support in case the float-funded activity fails
to generate program income as scheduled, the recipient must also clearly declare its commitment to undertake one
of the following options in the statement that identifies the float-funded activity. The recipient may commit either
to: 

(A) Amend or delete activities in an amount equal to any default or failure to produce sufficient income in a timely
manner. If the grantee makes this choice, it must include a description of the process it will use to select the activities
to be amended or deleted, how it will involve citizens in that process, and it must amend the applicable statement(s)
showing those amendments or deletions promptly upon determining that the float-funded activity will not generate
sufficient or timely program income; or 

(B) Obtain an irrevocable line of credit from a commercial lender for the full amount of the float-funded activity
and describe the lender and terms of such line of credit in the statement that identifies the float-funded activity.
To qualify for this purpose, such line of credit must be unconditionally available to the recipient in the amount of
any shortfall within 30 days of the date that the float-funded activity fails to generate the projected amount of program
income on schedule; or 

(C) Transfer general local government funds in the full amount of any default or shortfall to the CDBG line of credit
within 30 days of the float-funded activity's failure to generate the projected amount of the program income on schedule.


(iv) When preparing a statement for a year in which program income is expected to be received from a float-funded activity
and such program income has been shown in a prior statement, the sources section of the current statement shall identify
the expected income and explain that the planned use of the income has already been described in prior statements,
and shall identify the statements in which such description may be found.

 Restriction on location of activities. 



CDBG funds may assist an activity outside the jurisdiction of the grantee only if the grantee determines that the principal
benefit of such an activity will be for residents within the jurisdiction of the grantee. The grantee shall document
the basis for any such determination. 

9. Section 570.500 would be amended by removing and reserving paragraphs (a)(1)(viii) and (b), and by revising paragraphs
(a)(2) and (a)(3), to read as follows:

(2) Program income does not include income earned (except for interest described in  570.513) on grant advances
from the U.S. Treasury. The following items of income earned on grant advances must be remitted to HUD for transmittal
to the U.S. Treasury and will not be reallocated under section 106(c) or (d) of the Act: 

(i) Interest earned from the investment of the initial proceeds of a grant advance by the U.S. Treasury; 

(ii) Income (e.g., interest) earned on loans or other forms of assistance provided with CDBG funds that are used for
activities determined by HUD either to be ineligible or to fail to meet a national objective in accordance with the
requirements of subpart C of this part, or that fail substantially to meet any other requirement of this part; and 

(iii) Interest earned on the investment of amounts reimbursed to the CDBG program account pursuant to 
 570.910(b)(5) prior to the use of the reimbursed funds for eligible purposes. 

(3) Examples of other receipts that are not considered program income are proceeds from fund raising activities carried
out by subrecipients receiving CDBG assistance; funds collected through special assessments used to recover the
non-CDBG portion of a public improvement; and proceeds from the disposition of real property acquired or improved
with CDBG funds when the disposition occurs after the applicable time period specified in  570.503(b)(8) of
this part for subrecipient-controlled property, or in  570.505 of this part for recipient-controlled property.

(i) Program income in excess of one-twelfth of the most recent grant made pursuant to  570.304 shall be remitted
to HUD to be restored to the recipient's line of credit; 

(ii) Substantially all other program income shall be disbursed for eligible activities before additional cash withdrawals
are made from the U.S. Treasury.

(3) In conducting performance reviews, HUD will rely primarily on information obtained from the recipient's performance
report, records maintained, findings from on-site monitoring, audit reports, and the status of the line of credit.
Where applicable, the Department may also consider relevant information pertaining to a recipient's performance
gained from other sources, including litigation, citizen comments and other information provided by the recipient.
A recipient's failure to maintain records in the prescribed manner may result in a finding that the recipient has failed
to meet the applicable requirement to which the record pertains. A recipient's failure to submit a performance report
in the prescribed manner may result in a finding that the recipient has substantially failed to meet the requirements
of the program.

14. Section 570.903 would be revised to read as follows: 



 570.903


 Review to determine if the recipient is meeting its CHAS responsibilities. 



(a) 

Review timing and purpose. 

HUD will review an entitlement grant recipient's CHAS performance prior to acceptance of a grant recipient's annual
certification under  570.303(l) to determine whether the recipient followed its HUD-approved CHAS for the
most recently completed fiscal year, and that any housing activities assisted with CDBG funds during that period
were consistent with that CHAS. 

(b) 

Following a CHAS. 

The recipient has taken all of the planned actions, and has met the goals described in its annual plan. This includes,
but is not limited to: 

(1) Pursuing all resources identified in its investment plan which the grantee indicated it would pursue; 

(2) Providing certifications of consistency, when requested to do so by applicants for HUD programs for which the
grantee indicated in its investment plan that it would support application by other entities, in a fair and impartial
manner; and 

(3) Not hindering implementation of the CHAS by action or wilful inaction. 

(c) 

Disapproval. 

If HUD determines that an entitlement grant recipient has not met the criteria outlined in paragraph (b) of this section,
the recipient will be notified and provided up to 45 days to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it
has followed its CHAS, considering all relevant circumstances and the recipient's actions and lack of actions affecting
the provision of housing covered by the CHAS within its jurisdiction. Failure to so demonstrate in a timely manner
will be cause for HUD to find that the recipient has failed to meet its certification. A complete and specific response
by the recipient should describe: 

(1) Any factors beyond the control of the recipient that prevented it from following its CHAS and any actions the recipient
plans to take to alleviate such factors; and 

(2) Actions taken by the recipient, if any, beyond those described in the CHAS performance report to facilitate following
the CHAS, including the effects of such actions. 

15. Section 570.910 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (b)(9) to read as follows: 



 570.910


 Corrective and remedial actions. 



* * * * * 



(b) * * *

(9) In the case of an entitlement recipient which has failed to submit a previously due performance report in the prescribed
manner, delay making the grant until any outstanding performance report has been properly submitted to HUD.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) of the Department of the Interior (DOI) proposes a
Federal program to regulate coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal
and non-Indian lands in the State of Arizona. This includes surface effects of underground coal mining. This proposed
program is necessary in order to regulate surface coal mining activities that may be taken in Arizona under applicable
provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), and under regulations found in 30 CFR
Part 736, in the absence of a State program.

I. Public Comment Procedures 



Availability of Copies



Copies of the proposed Arizona Federal regulatory program and all written comments received in response to this notice
will be available for public inspection and may be obtained at the OSM office listed above under ADDRESSES

 Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 4:00 pm local time, excluding holidays.



Written Comments



Written comments on the proposed rules should be specific, pertain to issues pertinent to the proposed rules, and
explain the reason for any recommendation. Where possible, commenters should submit three copies of their comments
(see 

ADDRESSES

). Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or delivered to addresses other than Albuquerque, New Mexico will not necessarily be considered or included in the
Administrative Record for the final rule.



Public Hearing



OSM will hold public hearings on the proposed rule on request only. The time, date, and address scheduled for the hearing
in Phoenix, Arizona, is specified previously in this notice (see 

DATES

 and 

ADDRESSES

).


Any person interested in participating at the hearing should inform Mr. Ehmett or Ms. Broderick (see 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

) either orally or in writing by 4:00 p.m. local time September 9, 1994. If no one has contacted Mr. Ehmett or Ms. Broderick
to express an interest in participating in a hearing by that date, the hearing will not be held. If only one person expresses
an interest, a public meeting rather than a hearing may be held and the results included in the Administrative Record.

If a hearing is held, it will be transcribed and will continue until all persons in attendance wishing to testify have
been heard. To assist the transcriber and ensure an accurate record, OSM requests that persons who testify at a hearing
give the transcriber a copy of their testimony. To assist OSM in preparing appropriate questions, OSM also requests
that persons who plan to testify submit an advance copy of their testimony to OSM, at least two working days prior to
the hearing. The testimony should be submitted to the address previously specified for the submission of written
comments (see 

ADDRESSES

). Any disabled individual who has need for a special accommodation to attend a public hearing should contact the individual
listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.



II. Background



Under  504(a) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMRCA), 30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq., the Secretary
of the Interior (the Secretary) is required to promulgate a Federal program for a State for, among other reasons, the
failure of the State to submit a proposed State program to the Secretary. Upon promulgation of a Federal regulatory
program, the Secretary becomes the regulatory authority.

Once a decision is made that a Federal regulatory program is necessary for a State, the Secretary must make several
determinations before promulgating a program. Section 504(a) of SMCRA requires that the Secretary take into consideration
the nature of the State's terrain, climate, biological, chemical, and other relevant physical conditions. This
requirement is also set forth in the regulations for the promulgation of Federal programs at 30 CFR Part 736. Section
505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 736.22(a)(1) also provide that if a State has more stringent land use and environmental protection
laws or regulations, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA or the Secretary's regulations. If
the State's laws or regulations establish more stringent standards than those of SMCRA or the Secretary's regulations,
or if the State regulates any aspect of the environment which neither SMCRA nor the Secretary's regulations protect,
the Secretary would then specifically preserve those State standards in the Federal program. Thus the Secretary
believes that the requirements of  505(b) of SMCRA can best be met by identifying any State laws and regulations
which impose equivalent or more stringent environmental controls and by listing them in  903.700(e) of the
Federal program.

Also, in promulgating a program for a State, Section 504(g) of SMCRA specifies that any State statutes or regulations
which regulate surface mining and reclamation operations subject to SMCRA will be superseded and preempted by the
Federal program to the extent that they interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of SMCRA and
the Federal program. This provision is reinforced by  505(a) of SMCRA, which states that only those State laws
and regulations that are inconsistent with SMCRA and its implementing regulations shall be superseded by the Federal
program. Thus, State statutes and rules regulating the same activities as those covered by the Federal statute and
regulations, but which do not provide as much protection as do the Federal statute and regulations are considered
to interfere with the achievement of the purposes of SMCRA and must be identified and preempted.

Finally, according to  504(h) of SMCRA, a Federal program must include a process for coordinating the review
and issuance of surface mining permits with other Federal or State permits applicable to the proposed operation.
The Federal statutes with which compliance must be coordinated in the issuance of a surface mining permit are set out
at 30 CFR 736.22(c). State statutes for which a permit is required must be identified in the process of promulgating
a Federal program, and the Federal program must provide for coordination with the permit review and issuance procedures
required by those statutes.

Federal programs are based on the Secretary's permanent program regulations, 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapters A,
F, G, H, J, K, L, and M, which implement five essential aspects of the surface coal mining regulatory program: permitting,
performance standards, designation of lands as unsuitable for mining, bonding, and inspection and enforcement.
These regulations establish procedures and performance standards under SMCRA and form the benchmark for State and
Federal regulatory programs.


The permanent regulations refer to the ``regulatory authority,'' which is the Secretary under a Federal program.
The Secretary has delegated all of his authority under SMCRA to the Assistant Secretary_Land and Minerals Management.
(Secretarial Order No. 3013, Nov. 9, 1977, and Order No. 3099, Dec. 22, 1983). With limited exceptions, the Assistant
Secretary has in turn redelegated all of this authority under SMCRA to the Director, OSM (216 Departmental Manual
1, November 9, 1977). Thus, the Director of OSM is the official directly responsible for the implementation of a Federal
regulatory program.

The parts of the permanent regulatory program regulations that must be included in a Federal program are listed at
30 CFR 736.22(b). They include general requirements and definitions (Parts 700 and 701), the exemption for coal extraction
incident to government-financed highway or other construction (Part 707), the designation of lands as unsuitable
for surface mining (Parts 761, 762, and 769), permits and permit applications (Subchapter G), small operator assistance
(Subchapter H), reclamation bonding (Subchapter J), performance standards (Subchapter K), inspection and enforcement
(Parts 842, 843, and 845), and blaster training and certification (Subchapter M).

Federal programs are promulgated by means of cross-referencing the permanent program rules which set the substantive
standards. Cross-referencing avoids duplication of the full text of the permanent regulatory program rules for
each Federal program. The proposed Federal regulatory program for Arizona would establish 30 CFR Part 903. Sections
within Part 903 would cross-reference the counterpart permanent program rules. For example, for general requirements
for permits and permit applications, proposed  903.773 of the Arizona Federal regulatory program would cross-reference
30 CFR Part 773 of the permanent program rules by stating that 30 CFR Part 773 shall apply to any person who makes application
for a permit to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations.

For each particular permanent program regulation which needs to be modified for use in a Federal program, an additional
paragraph or paragraphs would be added under the appropriate section to modify that particular permanent regulatory
program standard to make it applicable to the Federal program State or to add additional requirements or standards.

One effect of cross-referencing in a Federal program is that if a permanent program rule is revised, the corresponding
Federal program rule would be similarly revised. However, the notice of proposed rulemaking would invite comments
not only on the proposed rule generally, but also on how it might affect a particular Federal program. If certain changes
were needed for a Federal program, then a separate provision would be added to the Federal program regulation that
is the counterpart to the permanent program rule.
Several provisions of the permanent program rules are already applicable to all Federal programs because they were
promulgated for application to all regulatory programs and therefore need not be cross-referenced here. These provisions
are 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter P_Protection of Employees; Part 706-Restrictions on Financial Interests
of Federal Employees; Part 769_Petition Process for Designation of Federal Lands Unsuitable for Surface Coal Mining;
Subchapter D_Federal Lands Program; Part 955_Certification of Blasters in Federal Program States and on Indian
lands.
On October 6, 1982, OSM published in the 

Federal Register

 a proposed Federal program to regulate coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-
Federal and non-Indian lands in Arizona (47 FR 44194). During the public comment period, OSM was informed by Arizona
officials that all known coal reserves in Arizona are located on Indian lands. Based on this information, OSM determined
at that time that a Federal program for Arizona for non-Federal and non-Indian lands was not necessary. Therefore,
by notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 4, 1983, OSM withdrew its proposal for a Federal program (48 FR 273).
Subsequently, OSM has determined that a regulatory program in Arizona is needed in the event that coal exploration
and surface coal mining and reclamation operations should occur on non-Federal and non-Indian lands in Arizona in
the future. The State of Arizona has elected not to pursue primacy under a State program at this time. Consequently,
pursuant to  504(a) of 
SMCRA, OSM is once again proposing a Federal program in Arizona to regulate coal exploration and surface coal mining
and reclamation operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands.


III. Discussion of Proposed Rule


As mentioned above, when promulgating a Federal program for a State, the Secretary is required by Section 504(a) of
SMCRA to take into consideration the nature of the terrain, climate, biological, chemical, and other relevant physical
conditions of that State. OSM has reviewed the Arizona laws and regulations to determine whether they suggest that
special provisions may be necessary or appropriate based on special terrain or other physical conditions in the State.


Review of State Law


In connection with its 1982 proposal, OSM reviewed Arizona State statutes to determine which ones provide regulatory
requirements for coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations as defined by SMCRA, and to
identify provisions that might be either more stringent than or inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA. The
more stringent requirements, whether State or Federal, would be adopted for this program by listing in the proposed
rules the Arizona State statutes that set different controls and for which compliance is required in the surface coal
mining and reclamation operation. Determining whether the State statutes are more stringent than the Federal regulations
was done on a case-by-case basis. Citation in the proposed Federal program of State statutes with which compliance
is required is not meant as an adoption of those State statutes and regulations for purposes of enforcement by OSM.
Citation of such statutes is intended as an aid to persons who must comply with both the Federal program requirements
and State statutes. However, if a State law is cited below as interfering with the achievement of the purposes of SMCRA,
it would be superseded to the extent that it is less stringent than the Federal program.
In accordance with 30 CFR Part 736, OSM has tentatively identified the following statutes and regulations which,
in certain circumstances, impose stricter environmental controls than are provided for under SMCRA or the Federal
regulations. Section 903.700(e) of the proposed Federal program for Arizona lists the Arizona laws which OSM has
tentatively identified as setting more stringent land use and environmental controls for surface mining. The list
set forth below is based in part on the list published on October 6, 1982 (47 FR 44194), and may need to be updated in a final
rule adopting an Arizona Federal program. Those more stringent Arizona statutes are described and summarized as
follows:
(1) The Arizona Commission of Agriculture and Horticulture has authority to abate public nuisances including noxious
weed seeds. Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) Section 3-231 to Section 3-242. Violation of this statute
is a misdemeanor.
(2) It is unlawful to injure any bird or harass any bird upon its nest to remove the nests or eggs of any bird without prior
authorization of the Arizona Game and Fish Commission. A.R.S. Section 17-236.
(3) A bridge, dam, dike, or causeway may not be constructed over or in a navigable river or other navigable water without
the authorization of the Governor. A.R.S. Section 18-301.

<PARENT> FR940810-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) The Department of Mineral Resources has jurisdiction over the mining of minerals, and oil and gas under Title 27
of the Arizona Revised Statutes. One of the functions of that Department is the prevention and elimination of hazardous
dust conditions. A.R.S. Section 27-128. Violation of orders of state mine inspectors respecting dust prevention
and control is a misdemeanor. 

(5) Roads leading into waste dump areas and tailing areas from inhabited or public areas are required to be blocked
off and warning signs posted on the perimeter of such areas. A.R.S. Section 27-317.

(6) The primary responsibility for the control and abatement of air pollution rests with the Arizona Department of
Health Services and its Hearing Board. The Department is responsible for the establishment and enforcement of air
pollution emission standards and ambient air quality standards as a part of a comprehensive air quality plan for Arizona.
A.R.S. Title 49.

(7) The Arizona Department of Water Resources has jurisdiction over State water, including ``surface waters.''
``Surface waters'' means ``the waters of all sources, flowing in streams, canyons, ravines or other natural channels,
or in definite underground channels, whether perennial or intermittent, flood, waste or surplus water, and of lakes,
ponds, and springs on the surface.

For the purposes of administering this title surface water is deemed to include Central Arizona Project water.''
A.R.S. Section 45-101. It is a misdemeanor to knowingly use the water of another, or divert water from a stream,
waste water or obstruct water flowing into a water work. A.R.S. Section 45-112. Possession of water lawfully
denied to the possessor is prima facie evidence of one's guilt. A.R.S. Section 45-112. If water is to be used for
mining purposes, the water rights may be severed from the land rights and transferred separately. The separation
and transference of water rights are subject to numerous limitations, A.R.S. Section 45-172.

(8) Dams are defined as ``any artificial barrier, including appurtenenant works for the impounding or diversion
of water except those barriers for the purpose of controlling liquid borne material, twenty-five or more in height
or the storage capacity of which will be more than fifty acre feet, but does not include any such barrier which is or will
be less than six feet in height, regardless of storage capacity, or which has or will have a storage capacity not in excess
of fifteen acre feet, regardless of height.'' A.R.S. Section 45-701. The construction, operation, repair
or alteration of any dam without the prior approval of the Director of Water Resources is a misdemeanor. A.R.S. Section
45-702 to Section 45-716.

In accordance with 30 CFR Part 736, OSM has tentatively identified the following statutes and regulations as which,
in certain circumstances, interfere with achievement of the purposes of SMCRA and the Federal program. Accordingly,
OSM proposes to preempt them to the extent they relate to surface coal mining and reclamation operations subject to
regulation under SMCRA. Section 903.700(f) of the proposed Federal program for Arizona lists the Arizona statutes
and regulations which OSM has tentatively identified as interfering with the achievement of the purposes of SMCRA.
The list set forth below is based on the list published on October 6, 1982 (47 FR 44194), and may need to be updated in a
final rule adopting an Arizona Federal program. Those less stringent Arizona statutes and regulations are:

(1) Arizona Open Pits Mining Statute, A.R.S. Section 27-421 to Section 27-425.

(2) Arizona Administrative Code Rules 11-1-1301 through 11-1-1315.

Thus, OSM proposes that the Arizona statutes and regulations described above be followed only to the extent that they
are not inconsistent with the regulation of coal exploration, surface coal mining operations, or the reclamation
of surface coal mined lands in the State of Arizona pursuant to the proposed Federal regulations.

Comment is invited on whether the Arizona laws identified in Section 903.700(e) of the proposed Federal Program accurately
reflect more stringent Arizona environmental controls which adequately modify the permanent program for application
to Arizona so as to take into consideration the nature of the State's relevant physical conditions. Comment is similarly
invited on whether the Arizona laws identified in Section 903.700(f) of the proposed Federal Program would interfere
in certain circumstances with achievement of the purposes of SMCRA and the Federal program.

Comment is also invited concerning any other Arizona laws and regulations which establish more stringent or less
stringent land use and environmental controls than SMCRA, which may not be included in this proposed rule, or which
may have been revised or adopted since 1982.

Content and Organization of the Federal Program



This proposed rule, 30 CFR Part 903, is consistent with the previously proposed rulemaking of October 6, 1982 (47 FR
44194), except that this rulemaking includes modifications to account for revisions to the permanent program rules
that have taken place during the period between proposed rulemakings.

The content and organization of the proposed Federal program for Arizona would generally follow the permanent program
regulations. However, as discussed above, instead of the full text appearing, each section includes only a reference
to the pertinent permanent program regulation section. Sections 903.700(e) and (f) set out both more stringent and
inconsistent State statutes. A separate paragraph is proposed to be added under each section where there are deviations
from the Federal permanent program regulations for the Arizona Federal program. These paragraphs will generally
be found in a subsection (b). The content and organization of the proposed Arizona Federal program would be based on
the following provisions of the Federal permanent program regulations, 30 CFR Chapter VII:




Subchapter A_General

Subchapter F_Areas Unsuitable for Mining

Subchapter G_Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations Permits and Coal Exploration Systems under Regulatory
Programs


Subchapter H_Small Operator Assistance

Subchapter J_Bond and Insurance Requirements for Bonding of Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations

Subchapter K_Permanent Program Performance Standards


Subchapter L_Permanent Program Inspection and Enforcement Procedures


Part 955_Certification Program for Blasters




Technical literature cited by OSM in the preambles to the permanent regulatory program (44 FR 14901-15309,
March 13, 1979) and the regulatory reform rulemaking notices ending September 30, 1983, was relied upon in developing
the Arizona Federal program. The reader is referred to those preambles for a discussion of the bases and purposes of
the permanent program rules proposed to be referenced in the Arizona program without substantive change.

The numbering system of the permanent program regulations has been incorporated into the numbering system for the
proposed Arizona Federal program. Subchapter T of 30 CFR Chapter VII has been established to include regulatory programs
by State in alphabetical order, and each State has been assigned a part number. As previously indicated, the regulatory
program for Arizona is assigned Part 903. Program elements have been categorized under headings similar to the subchapter
titles of the permanent program in 30 CFR Chapter VII.



Detailed Discussion of the Arizona Program



General



Section 903.700 would contain six subsections: the first four subsections, 903.700(a), (b), (c), and (d), would
contain general statements on the scope and applicability of the program. Section 903.700(e) would indicate Arizona
State laws that have been identified as having provisions that regulate activities involved in surface coal mining
operations and that have provisions that in some instances are more stringent than SMCRA and the Secretary's regulations.
Section 903.700(f) would identify Arizona State laws and regulations that interfere with achievement of the purpose
of SMCRA and Federal regulations. These identified State laws and regulations would be preempted and superseded.

Sections 903.701 through 903.707 would establish the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter
A, 

General. 

Section 903.701(a) would contain all applicable general requirements, including the definitions in 30 CFR 700.5
and 701.5. Subsection (b) is proposed to be added at  903.701 to make clear that beginning on the effective date
of this program and continuing until an operation has a permanent program permit issued by OSM, compliance with the
interim program standards in 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter B is required. Section 502(c) of SMCRA provides that all
surface coal mining operations on lands on which such operations are regulated by a State shall comply with the interim
program standards until a permanent program permit is issued. Paragraph (c) of  903.701 would provide that
records required by 30 CFR 700.14 to be made available locally to the public shall be retained at the OSM Albuquerque
Field Office. Section 703.702 would establish the same requirements as Part 702, 

Exemption for Coal Extraction Incidental to the Extraction of Other Minerals. 

Section 903.707 would establish the same requirements as Part 707, 

Exemption for Coal Extraction Incident to Government-Financed Highway or Other Construction.



Permit Fees



Section 903.736 Permit fees, would establish the same provisions as 30 CFR section 736.25.



Areas Designated Unsuitable for Mining



Sections 903.761 through 903.764 would establish the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter
F, Areas Unsuitable for Mining. 

However, 30 CFR 736.15(b)(1) provides that the procedures and criteria for designating lands unsuitable shall be
implemented one year after a Federal program is made effective for a State. Therefore,  903.764 provides that
Part 764 shall apply beginning one year after the effective date of the Arizona program. No separate section for Federal
lands is proposed because 30 CFR Part 769 is directly applicable and need not be made a part of a Federal program for a
State.

Permits and Coal Exploration Approvals



Sections 903.772 through 903.785 would establish the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter
G, 

Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations Permits and Coal Exploration Systems Under Regulatory Programs.

 The following amplifications are being proposed: For exploration applications where 30 CFR 772.12 applies,  903.772(b)
would require that upon receipt of notification from the regulatory authority of the submission of an administratively
complete application for an exploration permit, the applicant shall publish one public notice of the filing in a newspaper
of general circulation in the county of the proposed exploration area, and provide proof of this publication to the
regulatory authority within one week after the newspaper notice is published.

Section 903.772(c) would allow thirty (30) days after publication of the public notice for persons adversely affected
to file written comments. Section 903.772(d) would require the regulatory authority to act upon a complete exploration
application and any written comments within 15 days from the close of the comment period unless additional time is
necessary due to the number of, or complexity of the issues.

In  903.773, 

Requirements for permits and permit processing,

 proposed subsection (b) would list Federal laws and corresponding or relevant State laws that need coordination
by OSM to prevent or minimize duplication of effort with Arizona. Section 905.773(c) as proposed contains the stipulation
that no person may conduct coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operations without first obtaining
all other necessary permits from the State. This section, which lists State laws with which the Secretary will endeavor
to coordinate when issuing a permit under this Federal program, is based on the list published on October 6, 1982, (47
FR 44194) and may have to be updated in a final rule establishing a Federal program for Arizona. The State laws requiring
coordination are summarized below:

(1) Arizona towns and cities are given long-range development and planning responsibility for their jurisdictions,
are authorized to issue zoning ordinances and regulate the industrial use of municipal land and establish special
zoning districts (A.R.S. Section 9-461 to Section 9-462-01). Arizona counties have general permitting
authority and violation of a county building permit is a petty offense. A.R.S. 11-322 et seq. Each County's Board
of Supervisors has responsibility for promulgating and enforcing the zoning ordinances for the county, and it is
unlawful to use land in violation of a zoning regulation, ordinance or permit; violation of such regulation, ordinance
or permit is a misdemeanor. A.R.S. Section 11-808, Section 11-803, and A.R.S. Section 11-821.

(2) The Arizona law concerning the perfection of mining claims and the establishment of claims to mineral rights is
found in A.R.S. Section 27-201 to 27-210. Notice of such a claim must be recorded within 90 days in the appropriate
office of the County having jurisdiction over the recording of land claims. A.R.S. Section 27-203.

(3) A mineral exploration permit is required before prospecting is allowed on public land. A.R.S. Section 27-251
to Section 27-256.

(4) A permit from the Department of Health Services is required for the discharge of solid wastes and air pollutants.
A.R.S. Title 49, Chapters 1 and 2.

(5) An installation permit is required before any pollution-causing equipment may be installed. Before the equipment
can commence operation an operating permit is required. The permits are not automatically transferable. It is a misdemeanor
to violate any air pollution permit, ordinance or statute, and criminal intent is not an element of proof. A.R.S. Title
49.

(6) The Department of Health Services has the responsibility for issuing water pollutant discharge permits. A.R.S.
Title 49, Chapter 2.

(7) It is unlawful to discharge wastes or drainage into State waters or reduce water quality below water quality standards
or discharge pollutants into waters without a permit from the Department of Health Services, A.R.S. Title 45.

(8) The Department of State Lands has the responsibility for issuing mineral prospecting permits for State lands.
A.R.S. Section 37-231.

(9) The waters from all sources belong to the State and are subject to appropriation and beneficial use. In order to
appropriate water or make a beneficial use of water, a permit is required from the Director of the Department of Water
Resources. The approval of the Director is required before such a permit may be transferred. A secondary permit from
the Director is required before use may be made of reservoir waters. A.R.S. Title 45.

Comment is invited concerning the accuracy of this list, and is also invited concerning any other Arizona laws requiring
coordination under Section 903.773 which may not be included in this proposed rule, or which may have been revised
or adopted since 1982.

In addition to the requirements under the permanent program rules, OSM proposes adding other provisions for permit
review. More detail is necessary when OSM is the regulatory authority in order to provide direction to the permit applicant.
Section 903.773(d) would establish specific permit application review procedures. This is necessary to dispose
of grossly deficient applications early in processing, to provide a procedure for obtaining additional information,
and to indicate the procedure for determinations of completeness. The proposed rule at  903.773(e) would allow
OSM to require an applicant to submit supplemental information to ensure compliance with applicable Federal laws
and regulations other than SMCRA and its implementing regulations. The proposed rule at  903.773(f) would
establish, pursuant to 30 CFR 773.15(a)(1), a time period of 60 days from the close of the comment period for the regulatory
authority to issue a written decision unless additional time is necessary due to the number of, or complexity of the
issues. The proposed rule at  903.773(g) would establish a procedure for ensuring confidentiality of qualified
permit application information. Such information would have to be labeled confidential and submitted separately
to be reviewed by OSM for withholding from disclosure. In addition,  903.773(g)(1) would require the public
notice required by  903.773(d)(3) to identify the type of information considered to be confidential. Finally,
 903.773(g)(2) would require OSM to rule on the confidentiality of labeled application information within
ten days of the last publication of the notice required under  903.773(d)(3).

The proposed rule at  903.774(b) would provide that a revision of the permit that may have the potential to adversely
impact the potential for the achievement of reclamation and the post-mining land use shall be considered significant.
In addition, the rule provides that WSC shall consider the following factors as well as other relevant factors in determining
the significance of a proposed revision: (1) Changes in production or recoverability of the coal resource; (2) The
environmental effects; (3) The public interest in the operation, or likely interest in the proposed revision; and
(4) Possible adverse impacts from the proposed revision on fish or wildlife, endangered species, bald or golden eagles,
or cultural resources.

A significant revision would require public notice and would be subject to a formal hearing if one is requested.

The proposed rule at  903.774(c) would require that OSM approve or disapprove non-significant permit revisions
within a reasonable amount of time. The proposed rule at  903.774(d) would allow 30 days for any person having
an interest that is or may be adversely affected by a decision on the transfer, assignment, or sale of permit rights
to submit written comments after publication of the notice required by 30 CFR 774.17(b)(2). The proposed rule at  903.774(e)
would allow interested persons and public entities 30 days from the last publication of the notice to submit written
comments of objections on an application for significant revision or permit renewal.

The permanent program regulations at 30 CFR 779.19(a) give the regulatory authority discretion to require a map that
delineates vegetation types in the proposed permit area. The proposed rule at  903.779(b) requires the applicant
for a surface mining permit to submit such a map. Similarly, the proposed rule at  903.783(b) requires a vegetation
map for underground mining permits.



Small Operator Assistance



Section 903.795 would establish the same standards for the small operator assistance program (SOAP) as are found
in Part 795 of the permanent program rules. OSM expects during its administration of the SOAP in Arizona that Federal
funds will be sufficient to provide for authorized services, and does not expect to exercise its option at 30 CFR 795.11(b).
That option allows OSM to establish a formula for allocating limited funds to provide the service pursuant to Part
795. OSM will award SOAP contracts to qualified laboratories utilizing a streamlined procurement system that complies
with the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Prior to issuing a Request for Proposals, OSM will announce its intention
through publication in the Commerce Business Daily. OSM will qualify labs as part of its contracting process.



Bonding



Section 903.800 establishes the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter J, 

Bond and Insurance Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations.

 The proposed rule at  903.800(b) would require the operator to file an application for release of performance
bond no later than 30 days prior to the end of the growing season. In addition, OSM is requesting information pertaining
to any bonding requirements which may have been placed on existing surface coal mining operations in Arizona.



Performance Standards



Section 903.815 through 903.828 would establish the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter
K. The following changes would be made:

Proposed  903.816(b) would require: (1) That the standards for Revegetation success for surface mining activities
shall be those specified at 30 CFR 816.116(a)(2), and (2) that the statistically valid sampling techniques for measuring
success shall be included in the mining and reclamation plan.

Proposed  903.817(b) would require: (1) That the standards for revegetation success for underground mining
activities shall be those specified in 30 CFR 817.116(a)(2); and (2) that the statistically valid sampling techniques
for measuring success shall be included in the mining and reclamation plan. 


Inspection and Enforcement Procedures



Sections 903.842, 903.843, 903.845, and 903.846 establish the same provisions as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter
L, 

Permanent Program Inspection and Enforcement Procedures

. No changes to the inspection and enforcement provisions of the permanent program regulations are proposed for the
Arizona Federal program. The proposed rules at   903.842(b) and 903.843(b) would require OSM to furnish
to a designated Arizona State agency with jurisdiction over mining, on request, copies of inspection reports and
enforcement actions, respectively.



Blaster Training and Certification



Section 903.955 cross-references 30 CFR Part 955 of the permanent program regulations.

IV. Procedural Matters 


Federal Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule does not contain collections of information which require approval by the Office of Management and Budget
under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

. 



Executive Order 12866 



This rule is not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Department of the Interior has determined pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

, that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because
no small entities are expected to apply for permits under the Arizona Federal Program and the total number of permits
applied for under the program is expected to be very small. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



Section 702(d) of SMCRA provides that promulgation of a Federal program shall not constitute a major Federal action
under the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 433. Thus, no environmental assessment or environmental
impact statement is required for this rulemaking. 



Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778,
``Civil Justice Reform'' (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of section 2(b)(2) are covered by the preamble
discussion of this rule. Individual elements of the order are addressed below: 

A. What would be the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation?

As provided for under SMCRA, the proposed regulatory program would have a preemptive effect with respect to State
laws and regulations less stringent than SMCRA, as provided for under SMCRA (see above under 

Discussion of Proposed Rule

). 

B. What would be the effect of the regulation on existing Federal law or regulation, if any, including all provisions
repealed or modified? 

The proposed regulation would implement SMCRA in the State of Arizona, as described herein, and is not intended to
modify the implementation of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of the proposed action specifies
the Federal regulatory provisions that are affected by the proposed revision. 

C. Would the regulation provide a clear and certain legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard,
while promoting simplification and burden reduction? 

The standards established by this rule are as clear and certain as practicable, given the complexity of the topics
covered and the mandates of SMCRA. 

D. What would be the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation?

 There would be no retroactive effect to the proposed regulation.

E. Are administrative proceedings required before parties may file suit in court? Which proceedings apply? Is the
exhaustion of administrative remedies required? 

No administrative proceedings would be required before parties may file suit in court challenging the provisions
of the proposed revision. Prior to any judicial challenge of the application of the rule, however, administrative
procedures must be exhausted. Applicable administrative procedures may be found at 43 CFR Part 4. 

F. Would the proposed action define key terms, either explicitly or by reference to other regulations or statutes
that explicitly define those items? 

Terms which are important to the understanding of the proposed action are set forth in 30 CFR 700.5 and 740.5. 

G. Would the regulation address other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship of regulations
set forth by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, that
are determined to be in accordance with the purposes of the Executive Order? 

The Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget have not issued any guidance on this requirement.

 903.700 

Arizona Federal Program.


(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Arizona
which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
(b) Certain of the rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program rules in this chapter.
The full text of a cross-referenced rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the Arizona
Federal Program.
(c) This part applies to all coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Arizona conducted
on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. To the extent required by 30 CFR Part 740, this part also applies to operations
on Federal lands in Arizona.
(d) The information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 in its approval of the information collection requirements contained in the permanent
regulatory program.
(e) The following provisions of Arizona law generally provide for more stringent environmental control and regulation
of some aspects of surface coal mining and reclamation operations than do the provisions of the Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act of 1977, and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of the Act,
they shall not generally be construed to be inconsistent with the Act, unless in a particular instance the rules in
this chapter are found by OSM to establish more stringent environmental or land use controls:
(1) The Arizona Commission of Agriculture and Horticulture has authority to abate public nuisances including noxious
weeds and noxious weed seeds. A.R.S. Sections 3-231 to 3-242. Violation of this statute is a misdemeanor.

(2) It is unlawful to injure any bird or harass any bird upon its nest or remove the nests or eggs of any bird without prior
authorization of the Arizona Game and Fish Commission. A.R.S. Section 17-236.

(3) A bridge, dam, dike or causeway may not be constructed over or in a navigable river or other navigable water without
the authorization of the Governor. A.R.S. Section 18-301.

(4) The Department of Mineral Resources has jurisdiction over the mining of minerals, and oil and gas under Title 27
of the Arizona Revised Statutes. One of the functions of that Department is the prevention and elimination of hazardous
dust conditions. A.R.S. Section 27-128. Violation of orders of state mine inspectors respecting dust prevention
and control is a misdemeanor.

(5) Roads leading into waste dump areas and tailing areas from inhabited or public areas are required to be blocked
off and warning signs posted on the perimeter of such areas. A.R.S. Section 27-317.

(6) The primary responsibility for the control and abatement of air pollution rests with the Arizona Department of
Environmental Quality and its Hearing Board. The Department is responsible for the establishment and enforcement
of air pollution emission standards and ambient air quality standards as a part of a comprehensive air quality plan
for Arizona. A.R.S. Title 49.

(7) The Arizona Department of Water Resources has jurisdiction over State water, including ``surface waters.''
``Surface waters'' means ``the waters of all sources, flowing in streams, canyons, ravines or other natural channels,
or in definite underground channels, whether perennial or intermittent, flood, waste or surplus water, and of lakes,
ponds and springs on the surface. For the purposes of administering this title, surface water is deemed to include
Central Arizona Project water.'' A.R.S. Section 45-101. It is a misdemeanor to knowingly use the water of another,
or divert water from a stream, waste water or obstruct water flowing into a water work. A.R.S. Section 45-112.
Possession of water lawfully denied to the possessor is prima facie evidence of one's guilt. A.R.S. Section 45-112.
If water is to be used for mining purposes the water rights may be severed from the land rights and transferred separately.
The separation and transference of water rights is subject to numerous limitations, A.R.S. Section 45-172.

(8) Dams are defined as ``any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works for the impounding or diversion of
water except those barriers for the purpose of controlling liquid borne material, twenty-five feet or more in height
or the storage capacity of which will be more than fifty acre feet, but does not include any such barrier which is or will
be less than six feet in height, regardless of storage capacity, or which has or will have a storage capacity not in excess
of fifteen acre feet, regardless of height.'' A.R.S. Section 45-701. The construction, operation, repair
or alteration of any dam without the prior approval of the Director of Water Resources is a misdemeanor. A.R.S. Section
45-702 to Section 45-716..

(f) The following are the Arizona laws and regulations that generally interfere with the achievement of the purposes
and requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, preempted and superseded. Other
Arizona laws may in an individual situation interfere with the purposes and achievements of the Act and may be preempted
and superseded with respect to the performance standards of   903.815 through 903.828 as they affect
a particular coal exploration or surface mining operation by publication of a notice to that effect in the 

Federal Register

.

(1) Arizona Open Pits Mining Statute, A.R.S. Section 27-421 to Section 27-425.
