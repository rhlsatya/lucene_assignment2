<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Affirmation of interim rules as final rules. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are adopting as final rules, without change, two interim rules that amended the imported fire ant regulations.
The first interim rule designated all or portions of the following as quarantined areas: 5 counties in Arkansas, 6
counties in Georgia, 6 counties in Mississippi, 17 counties in North Carolina, 4 counties in Oklahoma, 4 counties
in South Carolina, and 5 counties in Tennessee. The second interim rule added Laurens County, SC, as a quarantined
area and corrected the description of the quarantined area in York County, SC. The interim rules were necessary to
prevent the artificial spread of the imported fire ant to noninfested areas of the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


In an interim rule effective and published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 21, 1994 (59 FR 3313-3316, Docket No. 93-138-1), we amended the imported fire ant regulations
by designating all or portions of the following counties as quarantined areas: Desha, Grant, Hempstead, Hot Springs,
and Howard Counties in Arkansas; Franklin, Gilmer, Pickens, Stephens, Fannin, and Lumpkin Counties in Georgia;
Bolivar, DeSoto, Marshall, Panola, Quitman, and Tate Counties in Mississippi; Anson, Cumberland, Dare, Duplin,
Hoke, Lenoir, Martin, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Pitt, Richmond, Robeson, Sampson, Scotland, Tyrrell, Union, and
Washington Counties in North Carolina; Carter, Bryan, Marshall, and McCurtain Counties in Oklahoma; Abbeville,
Anderson, Greenville, and York Counties in South Carolina; and Fayette, Hardeman, Hardin, McNairy, and Wayne Counties
in Tennessee. Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before March 22, 1994. We received one
comment, which was in favor of the interim rule. 
In a document effective on January 21, 1994, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6531, Docket No. 93-138-2), we corrected two editorial errors in Docket No.
93-138-1. 

In an interim rule effective and published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 2, 1994 (59 FR 22491-22492, Docket No. 93-138-3), we amended the imported fire ant regulations
by adding Laurens County, SC, as a quarantined area and by correcting the description of the quarantined area in York
County, SC. Comments on this interim rule were required to be received on or before July 1, 1994. We received one comment,
which was in favor of the interim rule. 
The facts presented in these interim rules still provide a basis for the rules. 
This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rules concerning Executive Order 12866 and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Paperwork
Reduction Act. 
Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive
Order 12866.

Spearmint Oil Produced in the Far West; Expenses and Assessment Rate for the 1994-95 Fiscal Year 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without changes, the provisions of the interim
final rule which authorized expenditures and established an assessment rate for the Spearmint Oil Administrative
Committee (Committee) under 
Marketing Order 985 for the 1994-95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables the Committee to incur
expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer this program. Funds to administer this program are derived
from assessments on handlers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 985 [7 CFR Part 985] regulating the handling of spearmint
oil produced in the Far West. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, spearmint oil produced in the Far West is subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable oil produced during the 1994-95 fiscal year, beginning
June 1, 1994, through May 31, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 8 handlers of spearmint oil regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately
260 producers of spearmint oil in the Far West. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business
Administration [13 CFR  121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural
service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers
and producers may be classified as small entities. 

The marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year
apply to all assessable oil handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by the
Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department
for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of spearmint oil. They are familiar with the
Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus,
all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. 

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of oil. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. 

The Committee met on February 23, 1994, and unanimously recommended a total expense amount of $228,705, which is 
$30,705 more in expenses than in the 1993-94 fiscal year.

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.09 per pound for the 1994-95 fiscal year,
which is a $0.01 increase in the assessment rate from the previous fiscal year. The assessment rate, when applied to
anticipated shipments of 1,727,388 pounds, would yield $155,464.92 in assessment income. This along with $8,000
in interest income and $65,240.08 from the Committee's authorized reserves will be adequate to cover estimated expenses.

Major expense categories for the 1994-95 fiscal year include $94,200 for salaries, $30,000 for market development,
and $20,000 for travel. Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $169,166.84, will be within
the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.

An interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 [59 FR 18948, April 21, 1994] and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. One comment was received.

The comment states that the interim final rule should be revised to comply with Executive Order 12770 directing preferential
use of the metric system of measurement by Federal departments and agencies. Projects or programs that directly affect
individual farmers or farm programs have been granted a general exemption from this directive. The Department has
determined that Marketing Agreements and Orders fall under this exemption. The industries involved do not use the
metric system in the marketing of their products. To convert their trading practices to the metric system would disrupt
trade and inflate costs. Changing order regulations to accommodate the metric system would not benefit the industry
or consumers.

Therefore, for the reasons stated, the Department is not making any changes in this final rule.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act.

It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994-95 fiscal year for the program began June 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate
of assessment apply to all assessable oil handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action
which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule. One comment was received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action
as a final rule without change.

Spearmint Oil Produced in the Far West; Revision of the Salable Quantity and Allotment Percentage for ``Class 3''
Native Spearmint Oil for the 1993-94 Marketing Year



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule to increase the quantity of Class 3 (Native) spearmint oil produced in the Far West that handlers may purchase
from, or handle for, producers during the 1993-94 marketing year. This rule was recommended by the Spearmint
Oil Administrative Committee (Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order
for spearmint oil produced in the Far West. This rule was recommended in order to avoid extreme fluctuations in supplies
and prices and thus help to maintain stability in the spearmint oil market.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 985 (7 CFR Part 985), regulating the handling of spearmint oil produced
in the Far West (Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and designated parts of California, Nevada, Montana, and Utah), hereinafter
referred to as the ``order.'' This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
(7 U.S.C 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''



The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing
order now in effect, salable quantities and allotment percentages may be established for classes of spearmint oil
produced in the Far West. This rule increases the quantity of Class 3 spearmint oil produced in the Far West that may
be purchased from or handled for producers by handlers during the 1993-94 marketing year, which ended on May
31, 1994. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are eight spearmint oil handlers subject to regulation under the order and approximately 260 producers of spearmint
oil in the regulated production area. Of the 260 producers, approximately 160 producers hold ``Class 1'' (Scotch)
oil allotment base, and 145 producers hold ``Class 3'' (Native) oil allotment base. Small agricultural service firms
have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than
$5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000.
A minority of handlers and producers of Far West spearmint oil may be classified as small entities.

The interim final rule was issued on April 20, 1994, and published in the April 28, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 21917), with an effective date of April 28, 1994. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended May 31,
1994. No comments were received.

The Far West spearmint oil industry is characterized by producers whose farming operations generally involve more
than one commodity and whose income from farming operations is not exclusively dependent on the production of spearmint
oil. The U.S. production of spearmint oil is concentrated in the Far West, primarily Washington, Idaho, and Oregon
(part of the area covered by the order). Spearmint oil is also produced in the Midwest. The production area covered
by the order normally accounts for 75 percent of the annual U.S. production of spearmint oil.

This rule continues in effect the increase in the salable quantity and allotment percentage of Native spearmint oil
that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers during the 1993-94 marketing year, which ended on
May 31, 1994. This rule also continues in effect the increase in the salable quantity from 714,665 pounds to 772,611
pounds and the allotment percentage from 37 percent to 40 percent for Native spearmint oil.

The salable quantity is the total quantity of each class of oil which handlers may purchase from, or handle on behalf
of, producers during a marketing year. Each producer is allotted a share of the salable quantity by applying the allotment
percentage to the producer's allotment base for the applicable class of spearmint oil.

The initial salable quantities and allotment percentages for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils for the 1993-94
marketing year were recommended by the Committee at its October 15, 1992, meeting. The Committee recommended salable
quantities of 714,665 pounds and 716,164 pounds for Native and Scotch oils, respectively, and allotment percentages
of 37 percent and 41 percent for Native and Scotch oils, respectively.

A proposed rule incorporating the Committee's October 15, 1992, recommendation was published in the December 7,
1992, issue of the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 57695). Comments on the proposed rule were solicited from interested persons until January 6, 1993. No comments
were received. Accordingly, based upon analysis of available information, a final rule establishing the Committee's
recommendation as the salable quantities and allotment percentages for the 1993-94 marketing year was published
in the May 13, 1993, issue of the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 28340).

Pursuant to authority contained in sections 985.50, 985.51, and 985.52 of the order, at its February 23, 1994, meeting
in Pasco, Washington, the Committee recommended that the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint
oil for the 1993-94 marketing year be increased. The Committee vote resulted in seven members in favor and one
member opposed to the recommendation. The member voting in opposition believes current demand for Native spearmint
oil is not adequate enough to warrant an increase in the salable quantity and allotment percentage.

The Committee's recommendation to increase the allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil by three percent results
in a 57,946 pound increase in the salable quantity, from 714,665 to 772,611 pounds. Growers currently hold in reserve
1,436,020 pounds of Native oil and 948,063 pounds of Scotch oil. However, the Committee states that not all producers
have reserve oil available to fill their increase in the salable quantity. In those cases, no additional oil is made
available to the market. Therefore, this rule provides an actual increase of 55,553 pounds of additional base rather
than the calculated amount. This small difference between the calculated and actual amounts of released oil will
not have a significant impact on the availability of marketable oil.

The Committee, in reaching its decision to recommend an increase in the 1993-94 salable quantity and allotment
percentage for Native spearmint oil, took into consideration the current supply and anticipated demand for both
Native and Scotch spearmint oils. The available supply of Native and Scotch spearmint oil as of February 23, 1994,
is 59,599 pounds and 175,000 pounds, respectively. When considering its initial recommendation for the 1993-94
season, the Committee estimated that the recommended salable quantity and allotment percentage would result in
an approximate carryover of 90,000 pounds of Native oil. This places the current available supply for the effective
period of Native oil below the expected carryover.

Over the past five years, the average utilization of Native oil between March 1 and May 31 is 91,375 pounds. This figure
is considerably more than the existing available supply. In addition, a majority of spearmint oil buyers indicated
they will be in a position to buy additional Native spearmint oil if it is made available. By increasing the Native spearmint
oil allotment percentage by three percent, the available supply (as of February 23, 1994), continues in effect with
an increase by 55,553 pounds, from the original 59,599 pounds to 115,152 pounds.

In its deliberations on how best to meet the anticipated demand, Committee members and other industry participants
indicated that the available Native spearmint oil supply should be increased by three to seven percent. The majority
of the individuals recommending some level of increase favored three percent, indicating a higher level may push
Native oil supply into a surplus situation before the end of the marketing year. The Committee did not recommend an
increase in the supply of Scotch spearmint oil since it is anticipated that there will be a surplus supply of this type
of oil by the end of the marketing year.

The Department, based on its analysis of available information, has determined that an allotment percentage of 40
percent should remain established for Native spearmint oil for the 1993-94 marketing year. This percentage
provides an increase in the salable quantity of Native spearmint oil from 714,665 pounds to 772,611 pounds.

Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this final rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including that contained in the prior proposed and final rules
in connection with the establishment of the salable quantities and allotment percentages for Native and Scotch spearmint
oils for the 1993-94 marketing year, the Committee's recommendation and other available information, it is
found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 21917, April 28, 1994), will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The proposed rule on sugar marketing assessments, published 
December 31, 1992, (57 FR 62486) is adopted as final, with certain changes as required by amendments made by the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Reconciliation Act) to the Agricultural Act of 1949 (1949 Act). This final rule
reflects changes required by amendments to the statutory provisions which authorize the assessments, clarifies
the regulations, and enhances the collection of the assessments. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 



This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. OMB has determined that this rule is significant.




Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Executive Vice President, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), certifies that this final rule will not have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Consequently, a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis is not required under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



Executive Order 12778 



This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this final rule do not
preempt State law to the extent such laws are not inconsistent with the provisions of this final rule. This final rule
is not retroactive. Before any action may be brought regarding the provisions of this final rule, the administrative
appeal rights set forth at 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted. 



Environmental Evaluation 



It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality
of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement
is needed for this final rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This final rule does not impose new information collection or recordkeeping requirements on the public. The information
collection requirements of the current rule at 7 CFR Part 1435 have been approved through July 31, 1995, by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) and
has been assigned OMB No. 0560-0138. 



Executive Order 12372 



The program covered by this final rule is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR
29115 (June 24, 1983). 



Background 



Section 1105(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended section 206(i) of the 1949 Act to provide
that, only for the 1991 through 1995 crops of sugarcane and sugar beets, the first processor of sugarcane or sugar beets
shall remit to CCC a nonrefundable marketing assessment in an amount equal to 0.18 cents per pound of raw cane sugar
processed by the processor from domestically produced sugarcane and an amount equal to 0.193 cents per pound of beet
sugar processed by the processor from domestically produced sugar beets. The amendment also provided for the imposition
of civil penalties if any persons were to fail to remit such assessments or to comply with such requirements for recordkeeping
which are required to carry out section 206(i). 

Because the 1991 crop year was to begin on July 1, 1991, an interim rule was promulgated to implement these assessments,
which became effective on June 19, 1991 (56 FR 28034). Based on consideration of the comments received, a final rule
was promulgated effective on November 1, 1991 (56 FR 55606). 

Subsequently, the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (the 1991 Act, also known as
the technical corrections to the 1990 Farm Act), which became effective on December 13, 1991, amended section 206(i)
of the 1949 Act, to: 

(1) Provide that the assessments would apply only for marketings of raw cane sugar and beet sugar during the 1992 through
1996 fiscal years, 

(2) Specify the timing of collections of marketing assessments, and 

(3) Clarify that the assessments would apply to sugar derived from sugar beet molasses or sugarcane molasses. 

A proposed rule was promulgated on December 31, 1992 (57 FR 62486) to reflect the statutory amendments enacted in the
1991 Act and, at the same time, to ease the regulatory burden of the assessments and to further clarify certain provisions
of the regulations. 

Section 1107 (a) of the Reconciliation Act (Pub. L. 103-66), which became effective on August 10, 1993, amended
section 206 of the 1949 Act, to provide that: 

(1) Assessments would apply to the marketings of raw cane sugar and beet sugar for two additional fiscal years, through
fiscal 1998, 

(2) The assessments for fiscal years 1995 through 1998 would be 10 percent higher per pound of sugar than assessments
for fiscal years 1992 through 1994, and 

(3) Processors who knowingly market sugar in excess of the allocation of the processor shall pay an assessment which
is double the applicable assessment required per pound of sugar marketed. 

In this final rule, CCC is adding amendments to the regulations to reflect the statutory amendments enacted in the
Reconciliation Act. 



Summary of Comments 



One national and two State sugar associations commented on the proposed rule. All three were critical of  1435.203(e)
which requires remitting the marketing assessment fee by October 30 on the quantity of sugar produced during the preceding
fiscal year but not marketed by September 30. Even though such sugar would not be subject to a second assessment when
it is marketed, the payment on sugar inventories was considered an unfair burden on the processors. Two of the commenters
recommended that the marketing assessment should be imposed only when the sugar is actually marketed, except that
in the last fiscal year (fiscal 1998), any (1991- through 1997-crop) sugar not marketed by September 30, would be subject
to the marketing assessment fee. Regardless of the merits of the recommendation, CCC is required by statute to implement
 1435.203(e) as written in the proposed rule and therefore adopts the section as final. The third commenter
agrees that current statutes uphold the need for  1435.203(e), but asks CCC to acknowledge the inequity and
thereby pave the way for remedial legislation. 

One commenter contended that Hawaiian producers should be permitted credit for assessments paid on sugar processed
during July 1 through September 30, 1991 ``as was done for beet processors.'' CCC addressed this issue extensively
in the proposed rule and maintains that the assessment rules were applied consistently among all processors, both
beet and cane. 

Thus, CCC adopts the provisions as provided in the proposed rule, except for revisions to   1435.200,
1435.202, and 1435.204 to reflect statutory requirements of  1107 (a) of the Reconciliation Act.

Subpart_Sugar Marketing Assessments 



 1435.200

General statement. 



(a) This subpart sets forth the terms and conditions for the payment to CCC of marketing assessments for beet sugar
and raw cane sugar produced during the 1991 through 1997 crop years and marketed during the 1992 through 1998 fiscal
years. 

(b) The marketing assessment applies to: (1) The marketing by first processors of all raw cane sugar produced from
the 1991 through 1997 crops of domestically produced sugarcane or sugarcane molasses and marketed during the 1992
through 1998 fiscal years; and 

(2) The marketing by first processors of all beet sugar produced from the 1991 through 1997 crops of domestically produced
sugar beets or sugar beet molasses and marketed during the 1992 through 1998 fiscal years. 

(c) All first processors of sugar beets and sugarcane are responsible to remit the marketing assessments. 

(d) The marketing assessments shall be due and payable to CCC by the thirtieth calendar day following the end of the
month in which the beet sugar or raw cane was marketed. 



 1435.201

Definitions. 





Beet sugar

 means sugar, whether or not principally of crystalline structure, which is processed directly or indirectly from
domestically produced sugar beets (including sugar produced from sugar beet molasses). 
 


Crop year

 and 

crop

 shall have the same meanings as are ascribed to such terms in  1435.3 of this part, with the customary allowance
for a continuous harvest as provided for in  1435.5(a)(2) of this part. In addition, beet sugar or raw cane sugar
processed from molasses or thick juice produced from domestically produced sugar beets or sugarcane shall be considered
to have been produced during the crop year in which such sugar beets or sugarcane was harvested. 
 


First processor

 means a person who commercially produces beet sugar or raw cane sugar, directly or indirectly, from domestically
produced sugar beets or sugarcane, or from molasses or thick juice derived from domestically produced sugar beets
or sugarcane. 
 


Fiscal year

 means CCC's fiscal year which runs from October 1 to 
September 30. 
 


Integrated processor-refiner

 means a first processor of raw cane sugar who also refines raw cane sugar into refined sugar. 
 


Market or marketing

 means the sale or disposition of raw cane sugar or beet sugar in commerce in the 50 United States, the several territories,
the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, including, with respect to any integrated processor-refiner, the movement
of raw cane sugar into the refining process. For purposes of this subpart, the forfeiture to the CCC of raw cane sugar
or beet sugar used as collateral for a price support loan is also considered a marketing. 



Raw cane sugar

 means any sugar, cane syrup or edible molasses, whether or not principally of crystalline structure, processed from
domestically produced sugarcane or sugarcane molasses. 



Raw value

 shall have the same meaning as is ascribed to such term in  1435.401 of this part. 



 1435.202

Amount of the marketing assessment. 



(a) The amount of the beet sugar marketing assessment to be remitted shall be the sum determined by multiplying the
number of pounds of beet sugar marketed in a calendar month by the assessment rate. The assessment rate for fiscal years
1992 through 1994 shall be 1.0722 percent of the loan level for raw cane sugar, but not more than 0.193 cents per pound.
For marketings during each of fiscal years 1995 through 1998, the assessment rate per pound of beet sugar shall be 1.1794
percent of the loan level established for raw cane sugar, but not more than 0.2123 cents per pound of beet sugar. 

(b) The amount of the marketing assessment on raw cane sugar to be remitted to CCC shall be the sum determined by multiplying
the number of pounds, raw value, of raw cane sugar marketed, or estimated to be marketed in accordance with  1435.203(c)(1)
of this subpart, in a calendar month by the assessment rate. The rate for fiscal years 1992 through 1994 shall be 1.0
percent of the loan level for raw cane sugar, but not more than 0.18 cents per pound. For marketings during each of fiscal
years 1995 through 1998, the assessment rate per pound of raw cane sugar shall be 1.1 percent of the loan level established
for raw cane sugar but not more than 0.198 cents per pound of raw cane sugar.

 1435.203

Remittance. 



(a)(1) First processors shall remit marketing assessments to CCC by the thirtieth calendar day following the end
of the month in which the beet sugar or cane sugar subject to the assessment was marketed. 

(2) Mailed remittances will be considered timely if they are postmarked not later than the thirtieth calendar day
following the month in which the beet sugar or cane sugar subject to the assessment was marketed. 

(3) Electronic remittances must be received by CCC by the thirtieth calendar day following the month in which the beet
sugar or cane sugar subject to the assessment was marketed. 

(4) Any processor who fails to file a remittance by the date on which it is due shall be assessed a civil penalty and interest
in accordance with  1435.204 of this subpart. 

(b)(1) First processors shall prepare and submit a fully and accurately completed form CCC-80 each month that
shows the quantity of: 

(i) Beet sugar marketed during the previous calendar month, and 

(ii) Raw cane sugar, raw value, marketed during the previous calendar month. 

(2) First processors who do not operate on a calendar month basis may pay their assessments based on marketings that
include several extra days or fewer days than the calendar month reporting period, consistent with the processor's
standard accounting months. However: 

(i) Assessments must be paid on all marketings of specific crop year sugar in the fiscal year it is due, and 

(ii) The marketing assessments must be remitted monthly and by the dates specified in paragraph (a) of this section.


(3) The entire assessment that is due and payable shall be remitted with the Form CCC-80. 

(c)(1) If, when a raw sugar assessment is due and payable, the first processor cannot determine the exact raw value
of such sugar, an estimate of raw value based on the recent experience of the processor shall be made and the assessment
submitted on the estimated quantity. 

(2) Whenever an assessment is based on an estimate of raw value pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any necessary
adjustments to the quantity of raw sugar subject to the assessment shall be made by filing a corrected CCC-80
no later than 30 calendar days after the last day of the month in which the estimated assessment was paid. If, according
to the corrected CCC-80: 

(i) The assessment was underpaid, the first processor shall remit the additional assessment due with the corrected
CCC-80, and 

(ii) If the assessment was overpaid, the first processor shall subtract the overpayment from any assessment due at
the time the corrected CCC-80 is filed, or if none is due at that time, from the assessment next due. 

(d) Any first processor, who paid an assessment on beet sugar or raw cane sugar processed during the first three months
of the 1991 crop year (July 1 through September 30, 1991) and then paid another assessment upon the marketing of the
same sugar after September 30, 1991, may receive a credit for any assessment paid on such sugar prior to fiscal year
1992. The credits will be handled by procedures to be developed by the Controller, CCC. 

(e) By October 30 of each year, first processors shall determine the quantity of beet sugar or raw cane sugar on hand
that was produced during the preceding fiscal year but not marketed by September 30 of such preceding fiscal year and
shall remit a marketing assessment to CCC as if the sugar had been marketed in September of such preceding fiscal year.
Such sugar shall not be subject to a second assessment when it is marketed. 

(f) First processors shall send remittances and CCC-80 forms as specified by CCC. 



 1435.204

Civil penalties and interest. 



(a) A first processor shall be liable for a civil penalty of up to 100 percent of the relevant national average price-support
loan rate times the quantity of raw cane sugar or beet sugar involved in the violation if the processor: 

(1) Fails to remit, on a timely basis, the entire amount of any marketing assessment in accordance with this subpart;


(2) Fails to submit form CCC-80 fully and accurately completed; or 

(3) Fails to maintain and permit inspection of records as required by  1435.205 of this subpart. 

(b) Also, a processor who knowingly markets sugar in excess of the allocated allotment of the processor under section
359d of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 shall pay an assessment in an amount that is double the applicable assessment
required under  1435.202 of this subpart. 

(c) In addition to any civil penalty assessed in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, interest on
unpaid assessments or deficiencies in assessments paid shall be due and payable at the rate specified in part 1403
of this chapter, beginning on the first day of the month after the marketing assessment was due in accordance with  1435.203
of this subpart. Such interest shall continue to accrue until such amount is paid. However, if full payment of an assessment
is received within 30 calendar days of the date on which the assessment was due, no interest shall apply. 

(d) The Controller, CCC, shall assess civil penalties and interest. 

(e) Affected first processors may appeal civil penalties by filing a notice of appeal within 15 calendar days of receipt
of certified written notification by the Controller, CCC, of such assessment of civil penalties. Such notice of appeal
shall be sent to the Director, National Appeals Division, ASCS, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013-2415. 



 1435.205

Maintenance and inspection of records. 



Representatives of CCC shall have the right to have access to the premises of the first processor in order to inspect,
examine, and make copies of the books, records, accounts, and other data as are deemed necessary by CCC or CCC's agents
to verify compliance with the requirements of this subpart. Such books, records, accounts, and other written data
shall be retained by the first processor for not less than three years from the date the remittance is made to CCC. 



 1435.206

Refunds. 



Marketing assessments are nonrefundable. However, upon presentation of evidence acceptable to the Controller,
CCC, adjustments to an assessment may be made by CCC to reflect the actual marketings of beet sugar or raw cane sugar,
or a 
first processor may adjust the amount of the assessment due in accordance with  1435.203 of this subpart.

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document publishes in the 

Federal Register

 an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) 93-24-13 that was sent previously to all known U.S.
owners and operators of The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Model F-28C, F-28C-2, F-28F,
280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters by individual letters. This AD requires inspecting the trim motor, wiring,
and relays (trim system) for failure, rewiring the trim system, and replacing the trim actuator circuit breaker.
This amendment is prompted by three reports of trim system failures resulting in inadvertent trim motor operation
due to struck relays. A stuck relay could cause the trim motor to deploy to the full trim position, resulting in high
cyclic control forces that significantly reduce the controllability of the helicopter. The actions specified by
this AD are intended to prevent failure of the trim motor relay that could result in full deployment of the trim system,
high cyclic control forces, and loss of control of the helicopter.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 6, 1993, the FAA issued Priority Letter AD 93-24-13, applicable to The Enstrom Helicopter
Corporation Model F-28C, F-28C-2, F-28F, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters, which
requires inspecting the trim motor, wiring, and relays (trim system) for failure, rewiring the trim system, and replacing
the trim actuator circuit breaker. That action was prompted by three reports of trim system failures resulting in
inadvertent trim motor operation due to stuck relays. A stuck relay could cause the trim motor to deploy to the full
trim position, resulting in high cyclic control forces that significantly reduce the controllability of the helicopter.
The cyclic control is a critical part of the rotorcraft flight control system. The cyclic control tilts the tip-path
plane of the rotating main rotor in the direction of the desired horizontal movement, either forward, sideward, or
backward. Therefore, any uncontrolled trim force applied to the cyclic control creates an unsafe condition. This
condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the trim motor relay that could result in full deployment of
the trim system, high cyclic control forces, and loss of control of the helicopter.



The FAA has reviewed and approved The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Directive Bulletin No. 0082, Revision
A, dated March 18, 1993, that describes procedures for inspecting the trim system for failure; replacing any failed
trim system part; rewiring of the trim system to preclude trim overtravel; replacing the trim actuator circuit breaker;
and, verifying proper operation of the trim system and the limit switch stop position.

Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other helicopters of the same type design, the
FAA issued Priority Letter AD 93-24-13 to prevent failure of the trim motor relay that could result in full
deployment of the trim system, high cyclic control forces, and loss of control of the helicopter. The AD requires inspecting
the trim system for failure; replacing any failed trim system part; rewiring of the trim system to preclude trim overtravel;
replacing the trim actuator circuit breaker; and, verifying proper operation of the trim system and the limit switch
stop position. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation
Service Directive Bulletin No. 0082, Revision A, dated March 18, 1993, described previously.

Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment
thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately
by individual letters issued on December 6, 1993, to all known U.S. owners and operators of The Enstrom Helicopter
Corporation Model F-28C, F-28C-2, F-28F, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters. These
conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published in the 

Federal Register

 as an amendment to section 39.13 of part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) to make it effective to
all persons.



Comments Invited



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93-SW-24-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model
206A, 206B, 206L, 206L-1, 206L-3, and 206L-4 series helicopters. This action requires a one-time
inspection for cracks in a portion of the main rotor blade (blade) trailing edge and the inboard trim tab, and replacement
of the blade or trim tab as necessary. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks in the blade trailing edge near
the inboard trim tab. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of a main rotor blade and subsequent
loss of control of the helicopter.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (BHTI)
Model 206A, 206B, 206L, 206L-1, 206L-3, and 206L-4 series helicopters. Reports indicate that cracks
have occurred in the blade trailing edge at the inboard trim tab radius affecting the upper and lower trim tabs. In one
instance, the crack propagated through the trailing edge strip, through both the upper and lower blade skins, and
forward to the blade spar. Field and laboratory investigations revealed that the cracks started at sanding or grinding
marks in the trim tab radius areas. The FAA has reviewed the reports and determined that cracks in the blade trailing
edge or the inboard trim tab could create an unsafe condition. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure
of a main rotor blade and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 


The FAA has reviewed and approved BHTI Alert Service Bulletin 206-93-77 and Alert Service Bulletin 206L-93-92,
both dated November 17, 1993, which describe procedures for a one-time inspection for cracks in a portion of the blade
trailing edge and the inboard trim tab within 50 hours' time-in-service (TIS), and replacing the blade or inboard
trim tab as necessary; or reworking the blade trailing edge and trim tab. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other BHTI Model 206A, 206B, 206L,
206L-1, 206L-3, and 206L-4 series helicopters of the same type design, this AD is being issued to
prevent failure of a main rotor blade and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. This AD requires, within 50
hours' TIS, a one-time inspection for cracks in each blade's trailing edge and inboard trim tab, and replacement of
the blade or inboard trim tab as necessary or rework of the blade trailing edge and trim tab. The actions are required
to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767 Series Airplanes Equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4 or
General Electric CF6-80A Series Engines



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series
airplanes, that currently requires inspections, adjustments, and functional tests of the thrust reverser system.
This amendment adds a requirement for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature, periodic
functional tests of that locking feature following its installation, and repair of any discrepancy found. This amendment
is prompted by the identification of a modification that ensures that the level of safety inherent in the original
type design of the thrust reverser system is further enhanced. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent
possible discrepancies in the thrust reverser control system that can result in inadvertent deployment of a thrust
reverser during flight.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 92-03-03,
amendment 39-8157 (57 FR 3004, January 27, 1992), which is applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4870). The action proposed to require inspections, adjustments, and functional tests of
the thrust reverser system; installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature; periodic functional
tests of that locking feature following its installation; and repair of any discrepancy found.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.

One commenter supports the proposed rule.

The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of its members, requests that a note or provision be added
to the proposal to indicate that relief provided by the Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) is not revoked by the adoption
of this AD. The commenter states that deactivation of a thrust reverser is not considered to be an unsafe procedure
and is, therefore, not the subject of the proposed rule.

The FAA concurs. The FAA agrees that certain relief may be provided to operators as requested by the commenter, and
finds that the airplane may be operated in accordance with the provisions and limitations specified in the FAA-approved
MMEL, provided that no more than one thrust reverser on an airplane is inoperative and that no synch-lock on that airplane
is in an unlocked position. The FAA has revised paragraph (e) of the final rule accordingly.

The ATA also questions the requirement contained in paragraph (e) of the proposal for repetitive functional tests
of the synch-lock installation. The ATA states that its members are not opposed to accomplishing the proposed tests
as part of their maintenance programs, but are opposed to accomplishing the tests as part of the requirements of an
AD. The ATA reasons that the ``intent'' of the proposed rule is to terminate the tests required by AD 92-03-03.

The ATA questions the rationale for the proposed repetitive functional tests of the synch-lock installation, since
the synch-lock configuration has not been shown to be unsafe. The ATA acknowledges the FAA's statement in the Discussion
section of the proposal that the synch-lock is a new design whose reliability has not been adequately proven through
service experience. The ATA states that, under this rationale, an operator's maintenance program for newly certificated
airplanes would simply consist of Certification Maintenance Requirement (CMR) items, since the reliability of
newly designed systems has not been adequately proven through service experience. The ATA believes that AD control
of the proposed repetitive tests is justified only if it can be shown that the tests cannot be administered safely within
an operator's maintenance program.

The ATA acknowledges that without issuance of an AD, the proposed repetitive tests may not be incorporated into every
operator's maintenance program in a common manner at common intervals. In light of this consideration, the ATA requests
that an alternative to accomplishment of the repetitive tests be provided in the final rule. The suggested alternative
for paragraph (e) of the AD follows: Within 3 months after accomplishing the synch-lock installation, revise the
FAA-approved maintenance inspection program to include a functional test of the synch-lock. The initial test would
be accomplished within 1,500 hours time-in-service after modification. The AD would no longer be applicable to operators
that have acceptably revised their maintenance programs. Operators choosing this alternative could use an alternative
recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by section 91.417 or section 121.380 of the Federal Aviation Regulation
(14 CFR 91.417 or 121.380). The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators
electing this alternative.

The ATA believes that its proposal should be adopted because the proposed repetitive tests will likely continue for
as long as Model 767 series airplanes are operated. The ATA adds that, while there are numerous AD's that require repetitive
inspections that would continue for the life of the aircraft, in such cases, either a satisfactory terminating action
has not been developed or service experience has shown that control of the inspections cannot be safely administered
through an operator's maintenance program. The ATA's proposal is intended to minimize the impact of the AD process
on an operator's maintenance program.

The FAA recognizes the concerns of the commenter regarding the requirement for periodic functional tests of the synch-lock
following its installation, as required by paragraph (e) of this AD. However, the FAA has determined that such tests
are necessary in order to provide an adequate level of safety and to ensure the integrity of the synch-lock installation.
The actions required by this AD are consistent with actions that have been identified by an industry-wide task force
as necessary to ensure adequate safety of certain thrust reverser systems installed on transport category airplanes.
Representatives of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America, Inc., and the FAA comprise that task force.
Representatives from other organizations, such as the ATA, have participated in various discussions and work activities
resulting from the recommendations of the task force.

The FAA acknowledges that the functional tests specified in paragraph (e) of this 
AD and CMR items are similar in terms of scheduled maintenance and recordkeeping. 
However, this AD addresses an unsafe condition and requires installation of the synch-lock to correct that unsafe
condition. The FAA has determined that the requirement for 
functional tests is necessary in order to ensure the effectiveness of that installation in 
addressing that unsafe condition. As discussed in the preamble of the proposal, this 
determination is based on the fact that the synch-lock is a new design whose reliability has 
not been adequately proven through service experience. In addition, service experience to 
date has demonstrated that failures can occur within the synch-lock that may not be 
evident during normal operation of the thrust reverser system and may not result in 
activation of the synch-lock ``unlock'' indicator. The FAA notes that the ATA's suggested 
alternative to accomplishment of the functional tests would permit each operator to 
determine whether and how often these tests should be conducted. In light of the severity 
of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA has determined that allowing this degree of 
operator discretion is not appropriate at this time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to 
ensure that operators accomplish tests of the integrity of the synch-lock installation in a 
common manner and at common intervals. 



The ATA also requests that the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service 
for accomplishment of the repetitive functional tests specified in paragraph (e) of the 
proposal be extended to 1,500 hours time-in-service. The ATA explains that Boeing has 
recommended an interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service for inclusion in the next 
Maintenance Review Board (MRB) report. If the FAA denies an extension of the 
proposed interval, the ATA requests that the FAA explain why its analysis is so stringent 
in comparison with Boeing's recommendation. The ATA believes that AD compliance 
times should be consistent with operators' regularly scheduled maintenance unless a risk 
analysis requires otherwise. The ATA reasons that compliance times that are inconsistent 
with scheduled maintenance holds force operators to reschedule maintenance actions at 
considerable expense and disruption to their operations. 



The FAA has reconsidered the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service for 
accomplishment of the initial and repetitive functional tests required by paragraph (e) of 
this AD. The FAA recognizes that an initial and repetitive interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service for accomplishment
of these functional tests, as recommended by Boeing, 
corresponds more closely to the interval at which most of the affected operators conduct 
regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. In light of the safety implications of the addressed unsafe 
condition and the practical aspects of accomplishing orderly functional tests of the fleet 
during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance 
personnel will be readily available, the FAA finds that accomplishment of the tests at 
intervals of 4,000 hours time-in-service will provide an acceptable level of safety. 
Paragraph (e) of the final rule has been revised accordingly. 



The ATA also requests that the cost of parts be included in the economic impact 
information, below, in order to present a total cost impact of the rule on the ``U.S. public.'' 
The ATA recognizes that Boeing plans to supply parts at no cost to operators; however, 
the ATA suspects the parts costs borne by Boeing would be substantial. The FAA does 
not concur with the commenter's request. The total cost impact figures shown in the 
economic impact information, below, represent the costs for time necessary to perform the 
inspections, adjustments, tests, and modification required by this AD. The cost analysis in 
AD rulemaking actions typically does not include parts costs when those parts are 
provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Such costs are not attributable to 
the AD; the manufacturer would incur these costs even if no AD were issued. 



The FAA has revised paragraph (d) of the final rule to specify that the correct 
reference for Boeing Service Bulletin 767-78-0061 is Revision 1, rather than Revision 2, 
as cited in the proposal. The issue date of Revision 1 (August 5, 1993) appeared correctly 
in the proposed rule. 



The FAA also has revised paragraphs (a) and (b) of the final rule to clarify the 
appropriate compliance time. Those paragraphs restate requirements for accomplishment 
of certain actions required by AD 92-03-03. The FAA's intent is that the tests, 
inspections, and adjustments required by those paragraphs would have been accomplished 
within 60 days after January 27, 1992 (the effective date of AD 92-03-03). 



After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will 
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 



There are approximately 119 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General 
Electric CF6-80A series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA 
estimates that 69 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The inspections, 
adjustments, and functional tests required currently by AD 92-03-03 require 
approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, at an 
average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of 
those actions on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General 
Electric CF6-80A series engines is estimated to be $60,720, or $880 per airplane. 



For U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric 
CF6-80A series engines, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 786 work hours 
per airplane to accomplish the modification required by this AD, and 1 work hour to 
accomplish the required functional tests, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. 
Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on 
these figures, the total cost impact of those actions on U.S. operators of Model 767 series 
airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6-80A series engines is estimated to be 
$2,986,665, or $43,285 per airplane. 



There are approximately 95 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & 
Whitney JT9D-7R4 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA 
estimates that 30 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The inspections, 
adjustments, and functional tests required currently by AD 92-03-03 require 
approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, at an 
average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of 
those actions on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & 
Whitney JT9D-7R4 series engines is estimated to be $26,400, or $880 per airplane. 



For U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney 
JT9D-7R4 series engines, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 812 work 
hours per airplane to accomplish the modification required by this AD, and 1 work hour to 
accomplish the required functional tests, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. 
Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on 
these figures, the total cost impact of those actions on U.S. operators of Model 767 series 
airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4 series engines is estimated to be 
$1,341,450, or $44,715 per airplane. 



The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 



The number of required work hours for accomplishing the required functional 
tests, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of those tests required by 
this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice, those 
tests for the most part will be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally 
scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the 
actual number of necessary additional work hours for accomplishment of the functional 
tests will be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special 
airplane scheduling will be minimal. 



The FAA recognizes that the required modification will require a large number of 
work hours to accomplish. However, the 5-year compliance time specified in paragraph 
(d) of this AD should allow ample time for the synch-lock installation to be accomplished 
coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby 
minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. 



The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 



For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

intervals not to exceed 4,000 hours time-in-service: Perform functional tests of the synch-
lock in accordance with the ``Thrust Reverser Synch-Lock Test'' procedures specified 
below. If any discrepancy is found during any test, prior to further flight, correct it in 
accordance with procedures described in the Boeing 767 Maintenance Manual. The 
airplane may be operated in accordance with the provisions and limitations specified in the 
FAA-approved Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL), provided that no more than 
one thrust reverser on an airplane is inoperative and that no synch-lock on that airplane is 
in an unlocked position. 





Thrust Reverser Synch-Lock Test 



1. 


General 





A. 


There are two thrust reverser synch-locks on each engine. The thrust 
reverser synch-locks are installed on the lower non-locking hydraulic 
actuator of each thrust reverser sleeve. 



B. 


This task has two parts that must be accomplished: 

(1) 


The first part does a test of the electrical circuit which controls the 
operation of each thrust reverser synch-lock. 



(2) 


The second part does a test of the mechanical condition of each 
thrust reverser synch-lock. 

C. 


The thrust reverser synch-lock is referred to as the ``synch-lock'' in this 
procedure. 



2. 


Thrust Reverser Synch-Lock Integrity Test

INSTRUCTION, INJURIES TO PERSONS OR DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR WHEN THE THRUST REVERSERS ARE EXTENDED. 

(6) Move the reverser thrust levers for the two engines to extend the thrust reversers with hydraulic power. 






Note:

 If the thrust reversers extend, the synch-locks are serviceable. If the thrust reversers do not extend, the applicable
synch-locks did not operate correctly. 




(7) Replace the applicable synch-locks on the thrust reverser that did not extend when you moved the reverse thrust
levers. 

E. Put the airplane back to its usual condition. 

(1) Move the reverse thrust levers to fully retract the thrust reversers on the two engines with hydraulic power. 

(2) Remove the hydraulic power if it is not necessary. 

(3) Remove the electrical power if it is not necessary. 

(4) Close the fan cowl panels. 

(f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. 






Note: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Seattle ACO.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series
airplanes, that currently requires that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program include inspections
which will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant Item (SSI).
This amendment requires the inclusion of additional airplanes to the candidate fleet. This amendment is prompted
by a recommendation from the Airworthiness Assurance Working Group, Model 747 Structures Task Group. The actions
specified by this AD are intended to ensure the continued structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 93-06-01,
amendment 39-8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993), which is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 4, 1994 (59 FR 265). The action proposed to require that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program
be revised to include inspections which will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each
Structural Significant Item (SSI). That action was prompted by a recommendation from the Airworthiness Assurance
Working Group, Model 747 Structures Task Group (STG). The requirements of that AD are intended to ensure the continued
structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.

One commenter supports the proposed rule.

Several commenters request that the selection of airplanes in the candidate fleet be determined by the STG, which
is comprised of representatives from various operators, the FAA, and Boeing. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined
that retired airplanes, hull losses, or parked airplanes that are in the current candidate fleet must be replaced
with in-service airplanes to maintain the candidate fleet size of 117 in-service airplanes. In selecting replacement
airplanes for the candidate fleet, the FAA evaluates, among other factors, age and service history of in-service
airplanes. The FAA will continue to consider recommendations from the STG for replacement airplanes; however, the
responsibility for determining the suitability of airplanes for the candidate fleet ultimately rests with the FAA.

One commenter questions the validity for including Boeing Model 747SR series airplanes in the Supplemental Structural
Inspection Document (SSID) candidate fleet. This commenter states that the FAA's justification for including these
airplanes was based upon the conversion of these airplanes from passenger operations to cargo operations, which
the commenter alleges is incorrect. The commenter further states that the FAA needs to consider the inclusion of airplanes
based upon maintenance requirements, especially airplanes that have been modified in accordance with supplemental
type certificates (STC). The FAA does not concur. The FAA points out that it included certain Boeing Model 747SR series
airplanes because these airplanes were no longer operated as Model 747SR series airplanes (at low gross weights and
at reduced engine thrusts), not because they were converted from passenger operations to cargo operations. 
Since those airplanes are now operated similarly to other airplanes that are in the Boeing Model 747 SSID candidate
fleet and that are operated as both freighter and passenger airplanes, the FAA has determined that they, too, should
be included in the SSID candidate fleet. As noted above, the FAA considers many factors when selecting airplanes for
inclusion into the candidate fleet, including age and service history of the airplane, which may be affected by modifications
that were performed in accordance with STC's.

Since AD 86-19-01 requires structural inspections and repairs or replacements on certain Model 747-100SR
series airplanes, a number of commenters request that AD 86-19-01, Amendment 39-5395 (51 FR 29212,
August 15, 1986), be revised to exclude Model 747SR series airplanes that are now included in this rulemaking action
to avoid redundant requirements for inspection. One of these commenters requests that the requirement to inspect
SSI's, required by AD 86-19-01, be exempt from the requirements of this AD. The FAA concurs. The FAA will,
in a separate rulemaking action, revise AD 86-19-01 to exclude Model 747-100SR series airplanes
that have been included in this final rule.

One commenter requests an extension in the compliance time until such time that a review of the damage tolerance rating
(DTR) check forms has been completed and a revised SSID has been issued. The FAA does not concur. To extend the compliance
time for this action would be inappropriate, since the FAA has determined that an unsafe condition exists and that
inspections must be conducted to ensure continued safety. Additional rulemaking may be considered, however, once
the DTR check forms have been reviewed and incorporated into the revised SSID.

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.

There are approximately 128 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry and 8 U.S. operators will be affected by this AD. Incorporation of the
SSID program into an operator's maintenance program, as required by AD 93-06-01, and retained in this
AD, is estimated to necessitate 1,000 work hours (per operator) at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost to the 8 affected U.S. operators to incorporate the SSID program is estimated to be
$440,000, or $55,000 per U.S. operator.

The recurring inspections cost, as required by AD 93-06-01, and retained in this AD, is estimated to be
1,275 work hours per airplane at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the annual recurring
cost required by AD 93-06-01, and retained in this AD, is estimated to be $6,100,875 for the affected U.S.
fleet, or $70,125 per airplane.

Since no new operators have been added by this AD, there will be no new costs associated with incorporating the SSID
program into an operator's maintenance program. Therefore, the future economic cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators
is now only the cost of the recurring inspections for these additional airplanes.

The number of required work hours for the recurring inspections in this AD, as indicated above, is presented as if the
accomplishment of the actions were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' action. However, in actual practice, these
actions, for the most part, will be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane
inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of necessary additional work hours
will be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling will be minimal.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAC 1-11 200 and 400 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAC 1-11
200 and 400 series airplanes. This action requires a one-time inspection to determine the tension of the control cables
of the thrust reversers, and correction of the tension, if necessary; a one-time inspection of the cables to detect
breakage, damage, wear, or signs of corrosion, and replacement of discrepant cables with serviceable cables; lubrication
of the cables; and reporting the results of the inspections to the manufacturer. This amendment is prompted by a report
of a frayed and corroded control cable. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the control
cables, which may lead to the inability of the thrust reversers to deploy, and subsequently, adversely affect stopping
distances and controllability of the airplane on the runway during landing.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all British Aerospace Model BAC 1-11 200 and 400 series airplanes.
The CAA advises that it has received a report from an operator of Model BAC 1-11 500 series airplanes that the control
cable of the thrust reverser was severely corroded and frayed. Severely corroded and frayed control cables of the
thrust reverser could result in failure of the control cable. This condition, if not corrected, could result in the
inability of the thrust reversers to deploy, and subsequently, adversely affect stopping distances and controllability
of the airplane on the runway during landing. 


Since the thrust reverser system on Model BAC 1-11 500 series airplanes is similar in design to that on the Model
BAC 1-11 200 and 400 series airplanes, these airplanes are also subject to the same unsafe condition. 
British Aerospace Airbus, Ltd., has issued Campaign Wire 76-CW-PM6031, dated May 12, 1994, which describes
procedures for performing an inspection to determine the tension of the control cables of the thrust reversers and
correction of the tension, if necessary; a detailed visual inspection of the control cables to detect breakage, damage,
wear, or signs of corrosion (swelling), and replacement of discrepant control cables with serviceable cables; lubrication
of the cables; and reporting the results of the inspections to the manufacturer. The CAA classified this campaign
wire as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the control cables, which may
lead to the inability of the thrust reversers to deploy, and subsequently, adversely affect stopping distances and
controllability of the airplane on the runway during landing. This AD requires a one-time inspection of the control
cables of the thrust reversers to determine the tension of the control cable, and correction of the tension, if necessary;
a one-time inspection of the control cables to detect breakage, damage, wear, or signs of corrosion, and replacement
of discrepant control cables with serviceable cables; lubrication of the cables; and reporting the results of the
inspections to the manufacturer. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the campaign wire
described previously. 
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking.

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``ADDRESSES.''
All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-115-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives: Luscombe Model 8 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment supersedes AD 79-25-05, which currently requires repetitively inspecting the existing
aluminum vertical stabilizer forward attach fitting for cracks on Luscombe Model 8 series airplanes, and replacing
any cracked parts. Steel fittings are now available that, when installed, will eliminate the need for repeated removal
and inspection of the aluminum fitting, which could result in damage to the fastener holes. This action requires replacing
the existing aluminum fitting with a steel vertical stabilizer forward attach fitting on Luscombe Model 8 series
airplanes that have round-tipped vertical stabilizer installations. The actions specified by this AD are intended
to prevent failure of the vertical stabilizer as a result of a cracked fitting, which could result in loss of control
of the airplane.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to Luscombe
Model 8 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 12, 1994 (59 FR 1676). The action proposed to supersede AD 79-25-05 with a new AD that would require
replacing the existing aluminum vertical stabilizer forward attach fitting, P/N 28444 or P/N 28453, with a steel
fitting manufactured by the Univair Aircraft Corporation (P/N U28444) or FAA-approved equivalent part.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the four comments received from three different commenters.

Two commenters propose including Luscombe part number (P/N) 28415 in the list of vertical stabilizer attach fittings
that should be replaced as specified in paragraph (a) of the proposal. The FAA concurs and has changed paragraph (a)
of the AD to include this P/N as well as P/N 28444 and P/N 28453.

These same two commenters request including Luscombe P/N 28455 as a replacement part for the vertical stabilizer
attach fittings. This part has type design approval from the FAA, and the Don Luscombe Aviation History Foundation
(DLAHF) holds a Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA). The FAA concurs that this part should be referenced in the AD and
has changed paragraph (a) of the AD to include the following:




Replace the aluminum vertical stabilizer forward attach fitting, * * * with either Luscombe P/N 28455
manufactured by the DLAHF; a welded steel fitting manufactured by the Univair Aircraft Corporation, P/N U28444;
or an FAA-approved equivalent part.




Both of these commenters request replacing the installation instructions referenced as Figure 1 in the proposal
with DLAHF Service Recommendation 

#

1, dated November 28, 1993. The commenters state that this publication is basically identical to Figure 1. The FAA
concurs that this action should be accomplished in accordance with DLAHF Service Recommendation 

#

1, dated November 28, 1993, and has changed the AD accordingly.

The third commenter recommends that the FAA more clearly state the Applicability of the proposal by only incorporating
those Luscombe Model 8 series airplanes with round tip vertical stabilizers. This commenter states that all the applicable
service difficulty history is based upon those stabilizers with round tips and there is no service difficulty history
for those with square tips. The FAA concurs and has changed the Applicability statement of the AD to include: ``Model
8 Series airplanes (all serial numbers) that have round-tipped vertical stabilizer installations, certificated
in any category.''

After careful review of all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for (1) the addition of the
part numbers to the listing of the existing and replacement parts for the AD; (2) the incorporation of the DLAHF Service
Recommendation 

#1

, dated November 28, 1993, into the AD; (3) the Applicability change to the AD that limits the action to only those affected
airplanes with round-tipped vertical stabilizer installations; and (4) minor editorial corrections. The FAA has
determined that none of the AD modifications described above will change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional
burden upon the public than was already proposed.

The FAA estimates that 2,029 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
4 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an
hour. Parts cost approximately $121 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $1,097,689. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected operator has accomplished this
action.

The Univair Aircraft Corporation has informed the FAA that 194 Luscombe
 P/N U-28444 tail fin fittings have been sold since 1984. Based on the assumption that each of these 194 fittings
is installed on an affected airplane, the future cost impact estimate for this AD is reduced by $66,154 (4 hours labor
 x  $55+$121 parts  x  194 airplanes) from $1,097,689 to $1,031,535.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided

Airworthiness Directives; Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-76A Series Helicopters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-76A
series helicopters, that currently requires an initial and repetitive inspections of the tail rotor (T/R) blade
spar elliptical centering plug (centering plug) for disbonding and adds a retaining pad between the T/R gearbox output
shaft and the inboard T/R spar. This amendment requires the same design changes and procedures as the previous AD,
except that it would eliminate the 500 hours' time-in-service repetitive inspections for centering plug disbonding.
This amendment is prompted by an improved bonding and repair procedure and the lack of reports concerning the movement
or disbonding of the centering plug. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the centering plug from
disbonding and moving out of position, which could result in loss of tail rotor control, and subsequent loss of control
of the helicopter. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 84-06-02, Amendment
39-4829 (49 FR 10922, March 23, 1984) which is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-76A series helicopters,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41442). That action proposed to require the same design changes and procedures as the previous
AD, except that it would eliminate the 500 hours' time-in-service repetitive inspections for centering plug disbonding.
This amendment is prompted by an improved bonding and repair procedure and the lack of reports concerning the movement
or disbonding of the centering plug. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. However, for consistency of word
usage throughout the AD and to make the language more consistent with the Sikorsky Aircraft Alert Service Bulletin
76-65-35A, Revision A, dated February 29, 1984, the word ``pressure'' that describes the part has been
changed to ``retaining'' and all forms of the word ``debond'' have been changed to ``disbond.'' Other minor editorial
changes were made, also. Therefore, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption
of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase
the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
There are approximately 190 Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-76A series helicopters of the affected design in the
worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 150 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will save
approximately 4 work hours per helicopter by discontinuing the current 500 hours' time-in-service repetitive inspections,
and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the annual cost savings of the proposed
elimination of these AD inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be $33,000 annually. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of 12 supplemental
new animal drug applications (NADA's) filed by The Upjohn Co. The applications concern the use of Type A medicated
articles containing melengestrol acetate (MGA) (alone and in combination) to manufacture certain combination
drug Type B and Type C medicated feeds for heifers fed in confinement for slaughter. The supplements provide for a revised
tolerance of 25 parts per billion (ppb) MGA residues, which is a change in the regulation of medicated feed applications
to a Category I drug, and the removal of the requirement for a 48-hour preslaughter withdrawal period.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI 49001, filed 12 supplemental NADA's revising the conditions of use of melengestrol
acetate (MGA) Type A medicated articles to make Type B and Type C medicated feeds for heifers being fed in confinement
for slaughter. The NADA's supplemented are: 


(1) NADA 34-254: MGA 100/200.
(2) NADA 39-402: MGA Liquid 500.
(3) NADA 124-309: MGA 100/200 plus Monensin.
(4) NADA 125-476: MGA 500 Liquid plus Monensin.
(5) NADA 138-792: MGA 100/200 plus Monensin and Tylosin.
(6) NADA 138-870: MGA 500 Liquid plus Monensin and Tylosin.
(7) NADA 138-904: MGA 100/200 plus Lasalocid and Tylosin.
(8) NADA 138-992: MGA 500 Liquid plus Lasalocid and Tylosin.
(9) NADA 138-995: MGA 100/200 plus Tylosin.
(10) NADA 139-192: MGA 500 Liquid plus Tylosin.
(11) NADA 139-876: MGA 100/200 plus Lasalocid.
(12) NADA 140-288: MGA 500 Liquid plus Lasalocid.
The supplements provide for the following actions: (1) Deleting the 48-hour preslaughter withdrawal period for
use in heifers being fed in confinement for slaughter for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency,
and suppression of estrus; (2) amending the classification in  558.4 

Medicated Feed Applications

 (21 CFR 558.4) from Category II to Category I because the use of the drug no longer requires a withdrawal period; and
(3) revising the tolerance for residues of MGA in uncooked, edible cattle tissues from no residue to a finite tolerance
of 25 ppb. The tolerance was set based on the determination that the endpoint of toxicological concern is hormonal
activity and that residues of MGA at or below 25 ppb in edible tissues of treated animals will not elicit a hormonal response.
Also,  556.380 (21 CFR 556.380) includes a gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) method of analysis for residues
of MGA in tissues. That method was in the regulation recodified from food additives to animal drugs in 1970. The Official
Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), 15th ed., 1990, in section 976.36
(pp. 629-631) provides an updated GLC method for determining MGA residues in animal tissues. The procedure
is also published in the 

Journal of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists

, JAOAC 59: 507-515, 1976. FDA is removing the analytical method in  556.380 and relying on the AOAC for
the method of analysis for MGA.
These are new animal drugs used in Type A medicated articles to make Type B and C medicated feeds. With approval of these
supplements, MGA is a Category I drug which, as provided in  558.4, does not require an approved form FDA 1900
for making a Type B or C medicated feed from a Type A medicated article. Approved form FDA 1900's may be withdrawn at the
request of the sponsor.
The supplements are approved as of June 29, 1994. 21 CFR 556.380 is revised to remove the existing text and provide for
a finite tolerance. Section 558.4 is revised to remove the MGA entry from the Category II table and add it to the Category
I table. 21 CFR 558.342 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), (c)(2)(ii), (c)(3)(ii), (c)(4)(ii), (c)(5)(ii),

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), these
supplements for food-producing animals do not qualify for marketing exclusivity because the supplements do not
contain new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human food safety
studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the
applicant.
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(i) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Revision of Delegations of Settlement Authority for Administrative Claims Against the Federal Bureau of Investigation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Attorney General is revising a delegation of authority she has made to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(``FBI''), to settle certain administrative claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act and 31 U.S.C. 3724, so as to allow
redelegation to the primary legal advisors of FBI field offices.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under 28 CFR 0.89a, the Attorney General has delegated to the Director of the FBI the authority to determine and settle
administrative claims against the FBI pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act for amounts not exceeding $10,000 in
any one case, and pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3724 for amounts not exceeding $50,000 in any one case. The Attorney General
has also authorized the Director of the FBI to redelegate this authority to the Assistant Director, Legal Counsel
Division, or his designee within that division, and has provided that this authority shall not be further redelegated.



Restructuring of FBI Headquarters and efficient processing of the large volume of administrative claims against
the FBI will be enhanced by further redelegation. This rule revises the current delegation to allow the General Counsel
of the FBI to exercise the Director's delegated authority, and to allow for redelegation of the General Counsel's
authority to the primary legal advisors of the FBI field offices.

Public comment will not be necessary on this rule because its subject is limited to a matter of internal Departmental
procedure. This rule is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to that order. As required by the Regulating Flexibility
Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), it is hereby certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on small business entities.

Redelegation of Authority of Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, to Act as Central Authority or Competent
Authority Under Treaties and Executive Agreements on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 0.64-1 of Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, authorizes the Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Criminal Division to act as the Central or Competent Authority under treaties and executive agreements between
the United States and other countries on mutual assistance in criminal matters. Section 0.64-1 also authorizes
the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division to redelegate her authority to her Deputy Assistant
Attorneys General and to the Director of the Office of International Affairs. This final rule amends  0.64-1
to include Deputy Directors of the Office of International Affairs among those in the Criminal Division to whom such
authority of the Assistant Attorney General may be redelegated.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Over the past several years, the United States has entered into an increasing number of treaties and executive agreements
regarding mutual assistance in criminal matters. Examples of agreements which have come into force recently are
mutual legal assistance treaties with Spain, Thailand, Uruguay and Mexico, and narcotics-related executive agreements
with the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.



The expansion of international cooperation in criminal matters has led to a significant increase in the number of
formal requests either made or received by the United States under treaties or executive agreements. These requests
are often time sensitive, and are forwarded to foreign Central Authorities in aid of federal, state and local law enforcement
authorities.

Under the current rule, when the Director of the Office of International Affairs is unavailable to act as Central Authority,
a request must be forwarded for action by a Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Attorney General or by the Assistant
Attorney General for the Criminal Division. Including Deputy Directors of the Office of International Affairs among
the Criminal Division officials to whom the authority of the Assistant Attorney General may be redelegated will promote
more effective and efficient processing of requests for assistance made pursuant to such treaties and agreements.

This rule is a matter of internal Department management. It has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with section
1(b) of Executive Order 12866. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and accordingly this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget.

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Attorney General has reviewed this rule
and by approving it certifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This rule will not have a substantial direct impact upon the states, on the relationship between the national government
and the states, or on distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Executive Office for Immigration Review; Rules of Practice and Procedure for Administrative Hearings Before Administrative
Law Judges in Cases Involving Allegations of Unlawful Employment of Aliens and Unfair Immigration-Related Employment
Practices




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule amends 28 CFR part 68, which contains the rules of practice and procedure for administrative hearings
conducted to enforce sections 274A, 274B, and 274C of the Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA''). These amendments
are necessary to bring the practices and provisions established in part 68 into conformity with the provisions of
the INA. Specifically, these amendments clarify the amount of time a party has to appeal to the United States Court
of Appeals an Administrative Law Judge's order in a section 274A or a section 274C proceeding.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Sections 274A, 274B, and 274C of the INA require that hearings be held before Administrative Law Judges in cases involving
allegations that a person or other entity has:



(1) Hired, or recruited or referred for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing that the alien is
unauthorized to work in the United States; or has so hired or referred or recruited for a fee, any individual when the
hiring person or entity fails to comply with the employment eligibility verification requirements (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1));

(2) Continued to employ an alien in the United States knowing that the alien is or has become unauthorized with respect
to such employmnet (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(2));

(3) Imposed, in the hiring, recruiting, or referring for employment of any individual, any requirement that the individual
post a bond or security, pay or agree to pay any amount, or otherwise guarantee or indemnify against any potential liability
under 8 U.S.C. 1324a for unlawful hiring, recruiting or referring of such individual (8 U.S.C. 1324a(g)(1));

(4) Engaged in unfair immigration-related employment practices (8 U.S.C. 1324b); or

(5) Knowingly participated in activities involving fraudulent creation or use of documents for the purposes of satisfying,
or complying with, a requirement of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324c).

On November 24, 1987, the Department of Justice published an interim final rule establishing administrative practices
and procedures to implement sections 274A and 274B of the INA. 52 FR 44972. After receiving comments, the Department
published the final rule on November 24, 1989. 54 FR 48593. That rule governed all cases properly brought before an
Administrative Law Judge that complied with the requirements of the INA. Then, on November 28, 1990, Congress enacted
the Immigration Act of 1990, which amended sections 274A and 274B of the INA, and added section 274C. These amendments
necessitated certain revisions to the practices and procedures established by part 68, which were set forth in an
interim rule with request for comments, published October 3, 1991. 56 FR 50049. After receiving comments, the Department
published the final rule on December 7, 1992. 57 FR 57669. The final rule, however, did not distinguish between the
time the Administrative Law Judge issues an order and the time a final order is issued. This distinction is critical
in clarifying the amount of time a party has to appeal a final agency order in a section 274A or a section 274C proceeding
to the United States Court of Appeals. A proposed rule clarifying this time period was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 18, 1994. 59 FR 2548. Although comments were requested, none were received. Based upon experience gained
by the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer in implementing the hearing procedures and the statutory
language regarding the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer's review authority found at sections 274A(e)(7) and
274C(d)(4),  68.2 paragraph (i) is revised to reflect the reference made to the definition of ``entry'' in the
revised definition of ``issued'' at  68.2(k), and  68.2 paragraph (k) is amended to account for the thirty
(30) days the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer has to modify or vacate an Administrative Law Judge's order in
a section 274A or 274C proceeding after the Administrative Law Judge enters the order.

This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866, section 1(b). The Attorney
General has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, section
3(f), and accordingly this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

The Attorney General, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation
and by approving it certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.

Ocean Dumping; Designation of Site 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA designates a deep ocean dredged material disposal site 
(SF-DODS) located off San Francisco, California, for the disposal of 
suitable dredged material removed from the San Francisco Bay region 
and other nearby harbors or dredging sites. EPA has determined that 
the site selected in the Final EIS as the preferred site will be the 
site designated as SF-DODS in this Final Rule. The center of the SF-DODS is located approximately 49 nautical
miles (91 kilometers) west 
of the Golden Gate and occupies an area of 6.5 square nautical miles 
(22 square kilometers). Water depths within the area range between 
8,200 to 9,840 feet (2,500 to 3,000 meters). The center coordinates 
of the oval-shaped site are: 37
 39.0
' North latitude by 123
 29.0
' 
West longitude (North American Datum from 1983), with length (north-south axis) and width (west-east axis) dimensions
of approximately 4 
nautical miles (7.5 kilometers) and 2.5 nautical miles (4.5 
kilometers), respectively. This action is necessary to provide an 
acceptable ocean dumping site for disposal of suitable dredged 
material; the suitability of proposed dredged material is determined 
by appropriate sediment testing protocols. The designation of SF-DODS 
is for a period of 50 years, with an interim capacity of 6 million 
cubic yards of dredged material per calendar year until December 31, 
1996. Site capacity following December 31, 1996 will be determined 
based on either a comprehensive long-term management strategy for 
management of dredged materials from San Francisco Bay or on a 
separate alternatives-based EPA evaluation of the need for ocean 
disposal. Disposal operations at the site will be prohibited if the 
site management and monitoring program is not implemented.

Section 102(c) of the Marine Protection, Research, and 
Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) of 1972, as amended, 33 U.S.C. Sections 1401 


et seq.

, gives the Administrator of EPA authority to designate sites 
where ocean dumping may be permitted. On October 1, 1986 the 
Administrator delegated authority to designate ocean dredged material 
disposal sites (ODMDS) to the Regional Administrator of the EPA Region 
in which the sites are located. The SF-DODS designation action is 
being made pursuant to that authority. 

The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR 228.4) state 
that ocean dumping sites will be designated by publication pursuant to 
40 CFR part 228. This site designation is being published as final 
rulemaking in accordance with  228.4(e) of the Ocean Dumping 
Regulations, which permits the designation of ocean disposal sites for 
dredged material. 

The center of the SF-DODS is located approximately 49 nautical 
miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate and occupies an area of 
approximately 6.5 square nautical miles (22 square kilometers). Water 
depths within the area range between approximately 8,200 to 9,840 feet 
(2,500 to 3,000 meters). The center coordinates of the oval-shaped 
site are: 37
 39.0
' North latitude by 
123
 29.0
' West longitude 
(North American Datum from 1983), with length (north-south axis) and 
width (west-east axis) dimensions of approximately 4 nautical miles 
(7.5 kilometers) and 2.5 nautical miles (4.5 kilometers), 
respectively. EPA Region IX now designates SF-DODS as an ocean 
dredged material disposal site for continued use for a period of 50 
years, with an interim capacity of 6 million cubic yards of dredged 
material per calendar year until December 31, 1996. 

Site use is subject to implementation of the specific site 
management and monitoring requirements contained in this Final Rule, 
which are now identified as the Site Monitoring and Management Plan 
(SMMP) for the SF-DODS. The Proposed Rule designating the SF-DODS did 
not set forth specific management and monitoring requirements in the 
Rule itself. Instead, Region 9 had proposed that provisions 
concerning site management and monitoring would be contained in a 
separate Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) document. Though 
this separate SMMP document would not, strictly, have been part of the 
Rule designating the SF-DODS, Region 9 did signal its intent in the 
Preamble accompanying the Proposed Rule that implementation of the 
provisions of the SMMP document would have been mandatory. The 
Proposed Rule specifically would have required that the SMMP be 
implemented as a condition of site use. Comments received on the 
proposed Rule have convinced Region 9 that the mandatory nature of 
site management and monitoring would be placed on a clearer legal 
footing if the SMMP were made a part of the Rule instead of being set 
forth in a separate planning document. 

The SMMP provisions in the Final Rule are closely related to 
Region 9's previous proposals on site monitoring and management. 
These proposals have been put forth for public review and comment on 
at least two occasions. First, Region 9 outlined its proposals 
concerning site monitoring and management in the Preamble accompanying 
the Proposed Rule designating the SF-DODS. Region 9 published the 
Proposed Rule in the 

Federal Register

 on February 17, 1994 (59 FR 7952), and held open a public comment period on the Proposed Rule 
until March 18, 1994. Second, Region 9 completed a draft of a 
separate SMMP document and made this document available for public 
review and comment. Region 9 published this SMMP document as an EPA 
Public Notice on April 20, 1994 and accepted comments on this document 
until June 6, 1994. The SMMP provisions in the Final Rule were 
drafted after considering the public comment received in response to 
the Proposed Rule Preamble and the SMMP document. 

See

 Responses to 
Comments, Section F. below. 

Region 9 is also preparing a Site Management and Monitoring Plan 
Implementation Manual (SMMP Implementation Manual). This manual will 
provide detailed guidance on practical aspects of implementing the 
SMMP provisions in the Final Rule. 



B. EIS Development 



Section 102(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 
1969, 42 U.S.C. Sections 4321 

et seq

., requires that Federal agencies 
prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on proposals for major 
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment. The object of NEPA is to build into the agency decision-making process careful consideration of all
environmental aspects of 
proposed actions, including evaluation of reasonable alternatives to 
the proposed action. 

A Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS was published in the 


Federal Register

 on December 11, 1992 discussing EPA's intent to 
designate a deep water ocean dredged material disposal site off San 
Francisco (57 FR 58805). The Draft EIS, titled: Draft Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS) for San Francisco Bay Deep Water Dredged 
Material Disposal Site Designation, evaluated a range of potential 
alternative disposal sites as summarized below. The comment period 
closed on January 25, 1993. EPA received 35 comment letters on the 
Draft EIS and incorporated changes where appropriate. On September 
10, 1993, notice of availability for public review and comment on the 
Final EIS was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47741). The 
comment period for the Final EIS closed on October 29, 1993. 



EIS Alternatives Analysis


 Several million cubic yards of dredged material are generated annually in the San Francisco Bay area. Traditionally,
most of this dredged material has been disposed at sites within the San Francisco Bay estuary. However, existing upland
and in-bay sites have limited capacity for disposal of large volumes 
of dredged material, and concerns about the potential environmental 
impacts of continued large-scale disposal within the estuary have 
grown steadily in recent years. 

EPA's analysis of alternatives included detailed examination of 
several potential ocean dump sites for dredged materials from San 
Francisco Bay and a preliminary, less-detailed review of potential 
alternative means of handling these dredged materials other than 
disposal at an ocean dump site. For EPA's present purposes, a limited 
review of alternatives to ocean dumping of dredged materials was 
appropriate. EPA needed only to determine whether alternatives to 
ocean dumping now appear to offer sufficient capacity for all dredged 
material that will be generated in the future. Greater detail 
concerning alternatives to ocean dumping of dredged material is not 
necessary at this stage because designation of an ocean dumping site 
under 40 CFR part 228 is essentially a preliminary, planning-like 
measure. The practical effect of such a designation is only to 
require that if future ocean dumping activity is permitted under 40 
CFR part 227, such dumping should normally be consolidated at the 
designated site. Designation of an ocean dumping site does not 
authorize any actual dumping and does not preclude EPA or the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers from finding that alternative means of 
managing dredged materials from San Francisco Bay are available and 
environmentally preferable.

EPA has determined that it is appropriate to designate an ocean dumping site for dredged materials from San Francisco
Bay site now, even if alternatives to ocean dumping should eventually prove to be available, because it appears unlikely
that alternative means of managing dredged material will accommodate all of this dredged material that will be generated
in the future. As discussed in the Final EIS, there are many substantial obstacles involved with the potential alternatives
to ocean dumping of dredged material. As noted, one alternative that is currently being employed is disposal of dredged
material within San Francisco Bay itself. Several resource and regulatory agencies, however, have indicated that
disposal of dredged material within San Francisco Bay may be endangering the Bay ecosystem, and some of these agencies
have suggested or are working towards setting low ceilings on the annual volume of dredged material that may be placed
in the Bay. Disposing of dredged materials in upland locations or employing them for various beneficial uses are other
alternatives which may prove feasible. Current information, 
however, which is recited in the Final EIS, suggests that it is unlikely that these alternatives will feasibly accommodate
all dredged materials likely to be generated from San Francisco Bay in the future. 

EPA and several other agencies are currently participating in a comprehensive evaluation of management of dredged
materials from San Francisco Bay, known as the ``Long-Term Management Strategy'' (``LTMS''). As part of this LTMS
effort, all disposal options, including beneficial reuse, upland, in-bay, and ocean disposal alternatives, are
being further evaluated in a separate LTMS Policy EIS/EIR. The LTMS agencies intend to set forth policies for the ongoing
development of such alternatives, and for comprehensive management of all such sites, in the Policy EIS/EIR. 

EPA's site designation decision reflects this LTMS effort. Today, EPA is setting an interim site capacity for the
SF-DODS of six million cubic yards of dredged material per year, which shall be in effect only until December
31, 1996. As the LTMS is completed, EPA will reexamine the appropriate site capacity for the SF-DODS and will
establish in a separate rulemaking a capacity for the SF-DODS that reflects the LTMS policy. In addition, in
all cases (now, and in the future under a comprehensive management plan for the region), the disposition of dredged
materials from individual projects will be 
evaluated by EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District on a case-by-case basis and EPA, taking into account
all the alternatives available at the time of permitting. Beneficial reuse alternatives will be preferred over ocean
disposal whenever they are practicable and would cause less adverse impacts than ocean disposal. 

The following ocean disposal alternatives were evaluated in detail in the Final EIS: 



1. No Action 



Failure to designate a permanent ocean disposal site pursuant to Section 102 of the MPRSA would have significant negative
consequences. First, the continued foreseeable need to have an appropriate site for disposal of suitable sediments
from various San Francisco Bay dredging projects would place pressure on the Corps and EPA to approve on a project-by-project
basis the use of existing in-Bay or temporary ocean dumping locations pursuant to either Clean Water Act Section 404
or MPRSA Section 103. Continued, exclusive 
reliance on existing in-bay disposal sites would not address concerns about environmental impacts of in-bay disposal,
and would not address concerns about economic impacts due to delays and uncertainty associated with limited capacity
at these existing sites. Second, the Water Resources Act of 1992 prohibits the continued use of ocean dump sites which
have not been designated by EPA as Section 102 dump sites by the end of 1997. If EPA fails to designate the SF-DODS
by that date, then ocean disposal of dredged materials taken from San Francisco Bay projects will be effectively precluded.




2. Deepwater Alternative Site 3 



This site is located approximately 47 nautical miles (87 kilometers) from the Golden Gate in an area where depths range
approximately 4,590 to 6,230 feet (1,400 to 1,900 meters). EPA has eliminated this site from further 
consideration, primarily because of its proximity to Pioneer Canyon and associated hardbottom areas. This site
would have greater impacts to benthic organisms than the preferred alternative (Site 5), and would affect relatively
scarce hardbottom habitats. 



3. Deepwater Alternative Site 4 



This site is located approximately 50 nautical miles (93 kilometers) from the Golden Gate in an area where depths range
approximately from 6,230 to 6,900 feet (1,900 to 2,100 meters). EPA has eliminated this site from further 
consideration, primarily because of its proximity to Half Moon Bay and its high usage as commercial fishing grounds
as compared to Alternative Site 5. This site would also have greater impacts to benthic organisms than the preferred
alternative (Site 5). 



4. Deepwater Alternative Site 5 (Preferred Alternative) 



The Final EIS identified this site as the preferred alternative based on 
comparison to the alternative sites listed above, and to the specific selection criteria listed in 40 CFR 228.6(a).
Alternative Site 5 is located furthest from the coast (approximately 49 nautical miles west of the Golden Gate) and
in the deepest depth range (approximately 8,200 to 9,840 feet, or 2,500 to 3,000 meters). The 6.5 square nautical mile
site represents approximately one percent of the total area encompassing the slope region studied by EPA Region IX.
Bathymetric and sediment surveys indicate Alternative Site 5 is located in a depositional area which, because of
existing topographic containment features, is likely to retain dredged material which reaches the sea floor. No
significant impacts to other resources or amenity areas, such as marine sanctuaries, are expected to result from
designation of Alternative Site 5. Existing and potential fisheries 
resources within Alternative Site 5 are minimal and the site is removed from more important fishing grounds located
closer to the other alternative sites. Abundances and biomass of demersal fishes and megafaunal invertebrates,
as well as abundances and diversity of infaunal invertebrates, at Alternative Site 5 are lower than those at the other
alternative sites. Conservative modeling predicted only localized detectable perturbations following disposal
of dredged materials within the disposal site. Therefore, potential impacts to 
surface and mid-water dwelling organisms, such as seabirds, mammals, and midwater fishes, are expected to be insignificant.
Finally, disposal of low-level radioactive wastes and chemical and conventional munitions occurred historically
in the vicinity of Alternative Site 5. Disposal within the site has also occurred as part of a Navy MPRSA Section 103
permit approved for up to 1.2 million cubic yards of suitable dredged material. Therefore, designation of this site
also minimizes cumulative effects compared to the alternative ocean disposal sites. 

EPA has determined that Alternative Site 5, identified in the Final EIS as the preferred site, will be the site designated
as SF-DODS in this Final Rule. This site represents the environmentally preferred alternative for designation
of a deep ocean disposal site for the San Francisco Bay area. Its selection, along with the specific restrictions on
site use adopted and described in this Final Rule, avoids and minimizes environmental harm from ocean disposal of

suitable dredged material to the maximum extent practicable. A Record of Decision (ROD) will not be issued as a separate
document; instead this Final Rule serves as the ROD for designation of the SF-DODS.

C. Regulatory Requirements
 


Consistency With the Coastal Zone Management Act 



EPA prepared a Coastal Consistency Determination (CCD) document based on the evaluations presented in the Final
EIS. The CCD evaluated whether the 
proposed action_designation of Alternative Site 5 as described in the Final EIS as an ocean disposal site for up to
50 years, and with an annual capacity of 6 million cubic yards of dredged material meeting ocean disposal criteria_would
be consistent with the provisions of the Coastal Zone Management Act. The CCD was formally presented to the California
Coastal Commission at their public hearing on April 12, 1994. The Commission staff report recommended that the Commission
concur with EPA's CCD, and the Commission voted unanimously to concur on the CCD without revision. 



Endangered Species Act Consultation 



During the EIS development process, EPA consulted with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) pursuant to provisions of the Endangered Species Act, regarding the potential for
designation and use of any of the alternative ocean disposal sites under study to jeopardize the continued existence
of any federally listed threatened or endangered species. This consultation process is fully documented in the Final
EIS. NMFS and FWS concluded that none of the three alternative disposal sites, including Alternative Site 5, if designated
and used for disposal of dredged material meeting ocean disposal criteria as described in the EIS, would jeopardize
the continued existence of any federally listed threatened or endangered species. 



Compliance With Ocean Dumping Criteria 



Five general criteria are used in the selection and approval of ocean disposal sites for continuing use (40 CFR 228.5).
First, sites must be selected to minimize interference with other activities, particularly avoiding 
fishery areas or major navigation areas. Second, sites must be situated such that temporary (during initial mixing)
water quality perturbations caused by disposal operations would be reduced to normal ambient levels before reaching
any beach, shoreline, sanctuary, or geographically limited fishery area. Third, if site designation studies show
that any interim disposal site does not meet the site selection criteria, use of such site shall be terminated as soon
as an alternate site can be designated. Fourth, disposal site size must be limited in order to localize for identification
and control any 
immediate adverse impacts, and to facilitate effective monitoring for long-range effects. Fifth, EPA must, wherever
feasible, designate ocean dumping sites beyond the edge of the continental shelf and where historical disposal has
occurred. As described in the Final EIS, SF-DODS was specifically selected to comply with these general criteria.


The SF-DODS meets these 5 general criteria. First, as discussed further below in discussing the 11 specific
site selection criteria, the SF-DODS is not a significant fishery area, is not a major navigation area and otherwise
has no geographically limited resource values that are not abundant in other parts of this coastal region. Second,
as also discussed further below, dredged material deposited at the site is not expected to reach any significant area
such as a marine sanctuary, beach, or other important natural resource area. 
Third, the SF-DODS is not an interim disposal site. Fourth, the site has an appropriately limited size and has
been selected to allow for effective monitoring. Fifth, the site is beyond the continental shelf and is located in
an area historically used for dumping. 

In addition to the 5 general criteria, 11 specific site selection criteria are listed in 40 CFR 228.6(a) of the EPA Ocean
Dumping Regulations for evaluation of all candidate disposal sites. The 5 general criteria and the 11 specific factors
overlap to a great degree. The SF-DODS site, as discussed below, is also acceptable under each of the 11 specific
criteria. 



1. Geographical Position, Depth of Water, Bottom Topography and Distance From Coast [40 CFR 228.6(a)(1). 



The center of the SF-DODS is located approximately 49 nautical miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate
and occupies an area of 6.5 square nautical miles (22 square kilometers). Water depths within the area range 
between 8,200 to 9,840 feet (2,500 to 3,000 meters). Bathymetric and sediment surveys indicate that the site is located
in a depositional area with natural topographic containment features. The site's depositional nature and natural
topography will minimize the extent of potential impacts to the benthos, and will facilitate long-term containment
of deposited material as well as site monitoring activities. 



2. Location in Relation to Breeding, Spawning, Nursery, Feeding, or Passage Areas of Living Resources in Adult or
Juvenile Phases [40 CFR 228.6(a)(2)]



The SF-DODS site provides feeding and breeding areas for common resident benthic species. Floating larvae
and eggs of various species are expected to be found at and near the water surface at the site as well as the alternative
sites evaluated. However, designation of the site will not affect any geographically limited (

i.e.

, unique) habitats, breeding sites, or critical areas that are essential to rare or endangered species. Both in comparison
to on-shelf areas and to the other alternative sites evaluated, the site has the least potential for adverse impact
to commercially important 
species. 



3. Location in Relation to Beaches and Other Amenity Areas [40 CFR 228.6(a)(3)]



The SF-DODS site is approximately 49 nautical miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate, 30 nautical miles
(56 kilometers) from Pioneer Canyon, 6 nautical miles (11 kilometers) from the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine
Sanctuary (GFNMS) boundary, and 24 nautical miles (45 kilometers) from the Farallon Islands. Ocean currents flow
primarily to the northwest in the upper 2,600 to 3,000 feet (800 to 900 meters) of the water column, although periodic

reversals in flow occur. Currents below 3,000 feet (900 meters) are generally weaker than near-surface currents.
Therefore, any residual suspended solids from the SF-DODS site will move primarily in the north-northwest
direction. Water column modeling results using a conservative approach and assuming disposal of 6 million cubic
yards of dredged sediments per year indicate that suspended solid levels would decrease to background levels by the
time the plume reaches the nearest amenity area (GFNMS boundary). Deposition modeling using a conservative approach
and assuming disposal of 6 million cubic yards 
of dredged sediments per year indicates that the bulk of the disposed material would be deposited within the disposal
site. For the above reasons, EPA has determined that aesthetic impacts of plumes, transport of dredged material to
any shoreline, and alteration of any habitat of special biological significance or marine sanctuary will not occur
if this site is designated.

4. Types and Quantities of Wastes Proposed to be Disposed of, and Proposed Methods of Release, Including Methods of
Packing the Waste, if any [40 CFR 228.6(a)(4)]



EPA is setting an interim site capacity for the SF-DODS of six million cubic yards of dredged material per calendar
year, which shall be in effect only until December 31, 1996. As the LTMS comprehensive dredged material management
planning effort is completed, EPA will reexamine the appropriate site capacity for the SF-DODS and will establish
in a separate rulemaking a final capacity. Typical composition of dredged material disposed at the site is expected
to range between two types: predominantly ``clay-silt'' versus 
``mostly sand''. These material types are based on data from historical 
projects from the San Francisco Bay region. The expected disposal method would involve split-hull barges, with capacities
ranging between 1,000 to 6,000 cubic yards, which would be towed by ocean-going tugboats. Dredged material would
not be packaged. All dredged material proposed for disposal at the site must be suitable for ocean disposal. This determination
will be made by EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District based upon the results of physical, chemical and
biological tests before a MPRSA Section 103 permit can be issued. Dumping of prohibited materials or other industrial
or municipal wastes will not be permitted at the site [40 CFR 227.5 and 227.6(a)]. 

Existing information and modeling analysis suggests that it is appropriate to dispose, via split hull barges, of
the type of dredged material that will be removed from San Francisco Bay at the SF-DODS. The dredged material
can be predicted mostly to settle rapidly to the ocean bottom within the dump site boundaries and not to create plumes
which will reach significant areas such as marine sanctuaries, recreational areas, or geographically limited habitats
at greater than background concentrations. Disposing dredged material at the site 
which meets regulatory criteria for ocean dumping will create some limited alteration or destruction of benthic
habitat within site boundaries, but should not create substantial adverse impacts extending beyond site boundaries.
For these reasons, no significant adverse impacts are expected to be associated with the types and quantities of dredged
material that may be disposed at the site. 



5. Feasibility of Surveillance and Monitoring [40 CFR 228.6(a)(5)] 



EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District share the responsibilities of managing and monitoring the disposal
site, and, with the on-site assistance of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), to enforce permit conditions within the limits
of their jurisdiction. Although SF-DODS would be the deepest and farthest off shore of any ocean disposal site
so far designated in the U.S., standardized equipment and techniques would be used for surveillance and monitoring
activities. In addition, recent Navy mid-project monitoring activities confirmed the feasibility of surveillance
and monitoring at the SF-DODS. EPA has therefore determined that the Site Management and Monitoring provisions
of the Final Rule are fully feasible to 
implement. 



6. Dispersal, Horizontal Transport and Vertical Mixing Characteristics of the Area, Including Prevailing Current
Direction and Velocity, if any [40 CFR 228.6(a)(6)]



Current meter studies indicate that any residual suspended solids from disposal operations at SF-DODS will
move primarily north-northwest, away from the continental shelf and the GFNMS. Water column modeling results, as
indicated in the Final EIS, using a conservative approach (

e.g.

, modeling parameters adjusted for worst case conditions) and assuming disposal of 6 million cubic yards of dredged
sediments per year, indicate that suspended solid would decrease to background levels by the time the plume reaches
the nearest amenity area (GFNMS boundary). Deposition modeling using a conservative approach and assuming disposal
of 6 million cubic yards of dredged sediments per year indicate that the bulk of the disposed material would deposit
within the disposal site. For these reasons, EPA has determined that the dispersal, transport and mixing characteristics
of the site, and its 
current velocities and directions, are appropriate for its designation as a dredged material disposal site. 



7. Existence and Effects of Current and Previous Discharges and Dumping in the Area (Including Cumulative Effects)
[40 CFR 228.6(a)(7)]



Under an MPRSA Section 103 permit, the Navy is discharging up to 1.2 million cubic yards of dredged material at their
Navy disposal site which is contained within the EPA-preferred Alternative Site 5. No other documented disposal
of dredged material has occurred within the site. However, disposal of radioactive waste containers was conducted
in the vicinity of Alternative Site 5 from 1951-1954. Likewise, chemical and conventional munitions were 
disposed in the general area from approximately 1958 to the late 1960's at the Chemical Munitions Disposal Area. Therefore,
EPA has determined that potential cumulative effects of designating a dredged material disposal site are less at
SF-DODS than at the alternative sites evaluated, which did not have these historic impacts. 

In addition, no other discharges occur in the immediate vicinity of SF-DODS. The effects of municipal discharges
from the San Francisco Southwest Ocean Outfall (5.4 nautical miles or 10.2 kilometers from shore), the City of Pacifica
Outfall (0.4 nautical miles or 0.8 kilometers from shore), and Northern San Mateo County Outfall (0.4 nautical miles
or 0.8 kilometers from shore) are limited to local areas near the outfalls and do not extend to the vicinity of the dredged
material disposal site. Discharge of dredged sand at the Channel Bar ODMDS (3.0 nautical miles or 5.6 kilometers from
shore) is also limited to that local area and is not expected to result in impacts in the vicinity of the SF-DODS.
Therefore, EPA has determined that cumulative effects of dredged material disposal are minimized by designation
of SF-DODS. 



8. Interference With Shipping, Fishing, Recreation, Mineral Extraction, Desalination, Fish and Shellfish Culture,
Areas of Special Scientific Importance and Other Legitimate Uses of the Ocean [40 CFR 288.6(a)(8)]



In evaluating whether dumping activity at the site could interfere with shipping, fishing, recreation, mineral
extraction, desalination, areas of scientific importance and other legitimate uses of the ocean, EPA considered
both the direct effects from depositing millions of cubic yards of dredged material on the ocean bottom within the
SF-DODS boundaries and the indirect effects associated with increased vessel traffic that will result from

transportation of dredged material to the dump site. Existing information indicates that the site is not a significant
fisheries area, is not used for water contact recreation and is not otherwise a significant recreational area, contains
no harvestable minerals, is not a potential staging ground or intake area for desalination activity, is not scientifically
important in itself, and otherwise has no geographically limited resource values that are not abundant in other parts
of this coastal region. Accordingly, depositing dredged 
material at the site will not interfere with these activities. 

Increased vessel traffic involved in transportation of dredged material to the SF-DODS should also cause no
substantial interference with any of the activities discussed above. Even with around-the-clock disposal operations
(assuming 3 trips in a 24-hour period), disposal operations would augment existing vessel traffic in the region by
less than 2 percent. In addition, the potential interference with recreational and scientific boat traffic and marine
resources (e.g., birds and mammals) near the Farallon Islands should 
be prevented by requirements that barges remain at least 3 nautical miles from the Islands. 



9. The Existing Water Quality and Ecology of the Site as Determined by Available Data or by Trend Assessment or Baseline
Surveys [40 CFR 228.6(a)(9)]



Existing information and regional studies described in the Final EIS provide the following determinations: Water
quality at the SF-DODS is indistinguishable from the water quality of nearby areas. Sediments contain background
levels or low concentrations of trace metal and organic contaminants. The demersal fish community within Alternative
Site 5 has lower numbers of species and lower abundances than the other alternative sites. Alternative Site 5 contains
moderate numbers of megafaunal invertebrate species (sea cucumbers, brittlestars, sea pens) but lower overall
abundances 
compared to the other alternative sites. Infaunal invertebrates (polychaetes, amphipods, isopods, tanaids) within
Alternative Site 5 also show lower diversity and abundance compared to Alternative Sites 3 and 4. Although there have
been higher numbers of marine bird and mammal sightings, and mid-water organisms including juvenile rockfishes
are more abundant seasonally relative to the other alternative sites evaluated, Alternative Site 5 is not considered
to have geographically limited resource values that are not abundant in 
other alternative sites or other parts of this coastal region. Based on these Final EIS conclusions EPA has determined
that, compared to the alternative sites evaluated, this is the environmentally preferred location for ocean disposal
site designation.

10. Potentiality for the Development or Recruitment of Nuisance Species in the Disposal Site [40 CFR 228.6(a)(10)]



Local opportunistic benthic species characteristic of disturbed conditions 
are expected to be present and abundant at any ODMDS in response to physical deposition of sediments. Opportunistic
polychaetes, such as 

Capitella,

 may colonize the disposal site. However, these worms can become food items for local bottom-feeding fish and are not
directly harmful to other species. No recruitment of species capable of harming human health or the marine ecosystem
is expected to occur at the site. In addition, recruitment of nuisance species from within the dredged material disposed
at the site is unlikely, due to 
significant differences in water depth and environment at the disposal site as compared to the relatively shallow
dredging sites in the San Francisco Bay region. 



11. Existence at or in Close Proximity to the Site of any Significant Natural or Cultural Feature of Historical Importance
[40 CFR 228.6(a)(11)]



The California State Historic Preservation Officer has determined there are no known historic shipwrecks nor any
known aboriginal artifacts at the SF-DODS or in the vicinity. 



D. Action 



EPA Region IX has concluded that the SF-DODS may appropriately be 
designated for use over a period of 50 years, with an interim capacity of 6 million cubic yards of dredged material per
calendar year until December 31, 1996. After this date, site capacity shall be reevaluated based on the results of
comprehensive regional dredged material management planning underway at the time of this rulemaking, or independently
by EPA if a comprehensive management plan is not yet completed. No disposal shall occur after December 31, 1996 unless
and until EPA establishes a new site capacity. 

Designation of the SF-DODS complies with the general and specific criteria used for site evaluation. The designation
of the SF-DODS as an EPA-approved Ocean Dumping Site is being published as a final rulemaking. Management of
this site will be the responsibility of the Regional Administrator of EPA Region IX in cooperation with the Corps'
South Pacific Division Engineer and the San Francisco District Engineer, based on requirements defined in the Final
Rule. Operational details for carrying out the Rule's required management and monitoring activities will be contained
in a SMMP Implementation Manual prepared by EPA following the opportunity for public review. Subsequent revisions
of the SMMP Implementation Manual will also be 
proposed through separate Public Notices. 

It is emphasized that ocean dumping site designation does not constitute or imply EPA Region IX's or the Corps' San
Francisco District's approval of actual ocean disposal of dredged materials. Before ocean dumping of dredged material
at the site may begin, EPA Region IX and the Corps' San Francisco District must evaluate permit applications according
to EPA's Ocean Dumping Criteria. EPA Region IX or the Corps' San Francisco District will deny permits if either agency
determines that the Ocean Dumping Criteria of MPRSA have not 
been met. The requirement for compliance with the Ocean Dumping Criteria of the MPRSA may not be superseded by the provisions
of any future comprehensive regional management plan for dredged material. 



E. Regulatory Assessments
 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all Rules
which may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. EPA has determined that this action
will not have a significant impact on small entities since the site designation will only have the effect of providing
a disposal option for dredged material. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis. 

This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or cause any of the other effects
which would result in its being classified by the Executive Order as a major Rule. Consequently, this Rule does not
necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. 



F. Responses to Comments on the Site Designation Proposed Rule and the Proposed SMMP Public Notice 



EPA received 37 letters in support of the Proposed Rule and 14 letters critical of the Proposed Rule. Many of these 37
letters contained specific comments regarding the proposed SMMP. EPA also received, after the close of the comment
period for the site designation Final EIS, a mass mailing of 105 similar letters containing some comments relating
to site designation. Finally, EPA received 11 additional comment letters in response to the separate proposed SMMP
Public Notice. All these comments have been carefully 
considered, and appropriate changes have been made in the Final Rule based on them. The comments have been grouped
into similar categories for the purposes of preparing the following responses.

1. Site Designation Process 



Commentors participating in the mass-mailing were concerned that EPA was ``fast-tracking'' the designation 
process for the ocean disposal site off San Francisco. 


Response




EPA has expended considerable effort to ensure adequate 
opportunities for public input in the site designation process. This 
site designation process is now in its fifth year, as public scoping 
meetings began in 1989. The Ocean Studies Plan (OSP), which was the 
blueprint for the extensive biological and oceanographic studies that 
characterized the study region, was developed with the consensus of 
the Long Term Management Strategy (LTMS) Ocean Studies Work Group 
(OSWG). The LTMS is comprised of Federal and State agencies, regional 
scientific experts, public interest and environmental groups. Based 
on the studies performed, EPA evaluated alternative sites and selected 
the preferred alternative site with the consensus of the OSWG. The 
Draft EIS was then noticed in the 

Federal Register

 and issued for 
public comment in December, 1992. Following revisions to the EIS 
based on comments received, the Final EIS was prepared and noticed in 
the 

Federal Register

 in September, 1993. A Proposed Rule to designate 
the preferred alternative site as described in the Final EIS was 
noticed in the 

Federal Register

 and issued for public comment on 
February 17, 1994. In addition, the proposed Site Management and 
Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for this ocean disposal site was issued for 
public comment under a separate EPA Public Notice on April 20, 1994. 
The comment period for this Public Notice ended on June 6, 1994. 
Therefore, EPA believes that ample opportunities have been provided 
for interested parties to comment throughout the site designation 
process. 


2. Need for Ocean Dumping



Several commentors stated that the 
proposal to designate the site for a 50-year period and for up to 300 
million cubic yards of dredged material was not based on an evaluation 
of the actual need for ocean disposal based on comprehensive regional 
planning. Other commentors stated that it is unlikely that as much as 
6 million cubic yards per year of sediments meeting ocean dumping 
criteria could be dredged from the contaminated San Francisco Bay. 


Response




The Final Rule has been significantly revised regarding 
site capacity. An interim site capacity of 6 million cubic yards per 
calendar year is being established from the date of site designation 
until December 31, 1996, only. Site capacity following December 31, 
1996 will be determined based on either a comprehensive long-term 
management strategy for management of dredged materials from San 
Francisco Bay (a Long Term Management Strategy draft EIS is currently 
under development, and is expected to be issued for public review in 
the spring of 1996) or, should a comprehensive Long Term Management 
Strategy not be available by that date, on a separate alternatives-based EPA evaluation of the need for ocean disposal.
This new site 
capacity will be established via a separate formal rulemaking process. 
The volume of sediment assumed in the site designation Final EIS 
and Proposed Rule to be dredged from San Francisco Bay over the next 
50 years (400 million cubic yards total) represents a planning 
estimate provided by the Corps. The actual volumes dredged over the 
next 50 years cannot be accurately predicted because the overall need 
for dredging will depend on many factors, including: Commercial 
shipping trends (i.e., continued use of Oakland as a major cargo 
port); decisions to initiate port expansions (i.e., for larger deep-draft vessels); changes in the use of closing
military facilities; and 
resources available to undertake these projects (i.e., availability of 
funds or Congressional authorizations for specific projects). 
However, for ocean site evaluation purposes, EPA assumed that 6 
million cubic yards per year (which equates to 80% of the assumed 
dredging average of 8 million cubic yards per year) would meet EPA 
Ocean Dumping criteria, and used this volume for modeling the fate of 
dredged material disposed at the alternative ocean disposal sites. 
The results indicated that disposal of this volume would not result in 
significant impacts at the proposed disposal site; therefore, this 
site is being designated with an interim capacity of up to 6 million 
cubic yards per year. Additional modelling would be necessary if a 
greater annual disposal volume were to be proposed. 
No matter the nominal site capacity at any time, it should be 
noted that site designation is not a blanket approval for disposal of 
any dredged material at the site. The actual need for ocean dumping 
is determined on a project-by-project basis at the time of permitting: 
Each and every project must be individually reviewed to determine both 
its need for ocean disposal and the suitability of its proposed 
dredged material for disposal. 


3. Alternatives Analysis



Several commentors stated that EPA has 
failed to consider a range of alternatives to ocean dumping of dredged 
material. Other commentors recommended that the ocean site 
designation be delayed until other disposal alternatives can be made 
available (

e.g., 

via the LTMS process). 






Response




EPA has determined that there is an overall need to 
designate an ocean disposal site for the San Francisco Bay region at 
the present time, based on the present lack of available upland and 
beneficial reuse sites, policies of the state agencies to generally 
further restrict disposal at in-Bay sites to maintenance dredging 
projects, impending plans for large new-work dredging projects, and 
limited existing in-Bay disposal site capacity. However, as discussed 
above, the ocean site is now being designated with an interim capacity 
only, which will be reevaluated based on the results of comprehensive 
management planning efforts now underway. 


4. Consistency Wth International Agreements




Several commentors 
wrote that the ocean disposal site designation ignores the 
precautionary approach which the U.S. has adopted in the context of 
several international agreements, because the site designation is 
unconditional except for a very large annual dumping limit for the 50-year period. These commentors recommended
that there should be 
precautionary conditions for site use, including: (1) A waste audit 
to evaluate all possible options to reduce the amount of dredged 
materials to be dumped at the ocean site and reduce the contamination 
of those sediments; (2) implementation of pollution prevention 
measures for San Francisco Bay and its drainage basin to guarantee 
that less contaminated sediments would be destined for the ocean site 
in the future; and (3) specific limitations on the contamination 
levels in sediments to be dumped at the site, with progressive 
reduction in those levels over 50 years so that the site will 
eventually only receive uncontaminated sediments. 


Response




The Final Rule has been revised to establish an interim 
site capacity only. In addition, even this interim annual dumping 
limit is only one of many conditions for site use. As noted above, 
site designation is not in itself a permit for ocean disposal of 
dredged material. Each project must be reviewed on a case-by-case 
basis to determine suitability of the proposed dredged material for 
ocean disposal and to determine the need for ocean dumping (including 
the availability of alternatives that reduce the amount of dredging). 
Alternatives such as beneficial use will be encouraged wherever 
practicable. This process of evaluating disposal options already 
occurs and will continue during permit reviews. Nevertheless, in 
addition to project-by-project alternatives analyses, overall dredged 
material management alternatives are being evaluated via the 
State/Federal LTMS process on a programmatic basis. The project-by- 
project need for ocean disposal will be reduced as alternatives to 
ocean disposal (including beneficial re-use sites) become available.

Pollution prevention is an important aspect of sediment 
management, as it is for most environmental issues. A variety of 
federal, state, and local pollution prevention efforts are underway 
that should result in long-term reductions in the degree to which 
sediments become contaminated. However, sediments also act as ``sinks'' 
for contaminants discharged in the past, and dredging projects by 
their very nature can expose this historic contamination. Therefore 
pollution prevention efforts in the foreseeable future are not 
expected to eliminate the dredging of contaminated sediments. 
Finally, there is no need to systematically tighten ocean suitability 
criteria because existing criteria do not allow toxic or highly 
contaminated sediments to be disposed at the site (suitability 
criteria are not tied to existing levels of contamination in area 
sediments). 


5. Compliance Wth Ocean Site Selection Criteria




Two commentors 
disagreed with EPA's determination that the regulatory requirements of 
the MPRSA were fully satisfied by the proposed site designation, 
particularly regarding the assessment of impacts to existing and 
potential fisheries, fish habitat and marine sanctuaries. 


Response 



EPA's determination of insignificant impacts to fisheries 
used conservative modelling of the worst case (highly dispersive) 
disposal scenarios. The evaluation indicated only localized impacts 
within the disposal site boundaries, based on: the highly mobile 
nature of the fish species present; the fact that the disposal site 
has relatively low abundances of commercially important fish species; 
and the fact that the site does not comprise unique fish habitat 
within the slope and shelf region. 
With respect to impacts to marine sanctuaries, the Final EIS 
documented that the expected increase in vessel traffic and resultant 
increased chance for accidents (

i.e., 

dredged material spills) during 
transportation through the sanctuaries will not be significant. 
Nevertheless, specific requirements to minimize any such risks are 
incorporated in the Final Rule. 


6. Requirement to Implement Site Management and Monitoring




Several 
commentors were concerned that the Proposed Rule did not clearly state 
that implementation of the site management and monitoring provisions 
is a strict condition for site use. 


Response



EPA intends that full implementation of the SMMP is a 
strict requirement of site use, and revisions have been be 
incorporated into the Final Rule to emphasize this and remove any 
ambiguity. 


7. Unique Nature of the Disposal Site



Several commentors stated 
that they were not satisfied that the SMMP as summarized in the 
Proposed Rule accounts for risks associated with a site which is the 
deepest and farthest from shore of any so far designated in the U.S., 
or that there is sufficient information on how dredged material will 
behave following disposal at such a deep site. 


Response


EPA recognizes that the proposed SF-DODS, as well as the 
potential alternative ocean sites evaluated in the Final EIS, is the 
deepest and the farthest from shore of any ocean disposal site so far 
designated in the U.S. However, EPA has expended considerable effort 
to adequately characterize this previously not well-studied region of 
the California coast. Studies were conducted in accordance with an 
Ocean Studies Plan which was developed with input from Federal and 
State agencies as well as environmental and public interest groups. 
Because of the deep depths and distance from shore, EPA performed 
conservative (worst case) modeling to assess the fate of dredged 
material disposal at the alternative sites. The modeling results 
indicate that the bulk (75 to 90 percent) of the dredged material 
would be deposited on the seafloor within the disposal site 
boundaries, and that residual suspended material in the water column 
would be dissipated to background concentration levels within the 
disposal site boundaries, as well. These modeling predictions were 
confirmed by recent monitoring of actual dredged material disposal in 
the vicinity of the SF-DODS by the U.S. Navy, performed as a 
requirement of their MPRSA Section 103 project-specific site 
designation. Preliminary results of their field studies confirmed 
that plumes in the water column could be tracked until they dissipated 
to background levels, and that the plumes dissipated to background 
levels within the disposal site boundaries. Furthermore, their 
findings confirmed that the sediment deposit footprint on the seafloor 
could be mapped, and that the sediment deposited within the disposal 
site boundary as predicted by the modeling performed for EPA's site 
designation EIS. Finally, the SMMP was developed to address the 
uncertainties and risks associated with use of this disposal site. 


8. Impacts to Nearby Marine Sanctuaries



One commentor stated that 
past disposal of chemical munitions, explosives, radioactive 
materials, sulfuric acid, and oil refinery waste at the site or nearby 
locations does not justify designating a disposal site near federally 
protected marine sanctuaries such as the Gulf of the Farallones 
National Marine Sanctuary and the Monterey Bay National Marine 
Sanctuary. 


Response




National marine sanctuaries are continuous along the 
coastline of the study region. The ocean disposal site is located off 
the continental shelf, at the extreme point of the Zone of Siting 
Feasibility established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and 
several miles beyond the outer boundary of the nearest sanctuary. It 
is therefore as far removed from sanctuary boundaries as practicable. 
Furthermore, extensive oceanographic and modelling studies indicate 
that suspended sediment plumes should dissipate to background levels 
within the disposal site boundaries, and that under prevailing 
conditions (currents predominately to the north-northwest) the 
probability of any detectable sediment plumes drifting into the marine 
sanctuaries is extremely remote. The seafloor in the vicinity of the 
site has already been somewhat degraded by historic disposal of 
military munitions and other wastes so that, compared to alternative 
sites evaluated, cumulative effects to the deep benthos are minimized 
at this site. Indeed, there may even be a long-term beneficial effect 
within the disposal site as a result of cleaner (ocean suitable) 
dredged material being deposited on a previously degraded seafloor. 
Finally, designation of this site is consistent with guidance in the 
Ocean Dumping Regulations [40 CFR  228.5(e)] to locate disposal sites 
beyond the continental shelf and in areas of historical dumping where 
possible.

9. Long Term Impacts 


Several commentors noted that the Final EIS 
stated that significant long-term impacts at the proposed dump site 
are likely to occur from ocean disposal of dredged material. 


Response 


The Final EIS classified physical impacts to benthos within 
the disposal site boundaries as significant (

e.g.,

 potential changes 
in sediment texture, and some smothering of infauna are unavoidable). 
Other significant (e.g., toxicological) impacts are not expected 
because of requirements for extensive pre-disposal physical, chemical, 
and biological testing of proposed dredged material. In addition, 
controls will be implemented through permit conditions and the 
provisions of the SMMP to prevent any significant impacts occurring 
outside the disposal site boundaries. 


10. Exclusion From Testing 


One commentor expressed concern that 
certain materials, based upon their physical characteristics and their 
location in relation to sources of contamination, would be dumped into 
the ocean without chemical and biological testing. They also 
expressed concern that the person who determines this exclusion not be 
an employee of the dredging or dumping company. 


Response 


The ocean dumping regulations [40 CFR 227.13(b)] set forth 
conditions under which dredged material may be determined to be 
suitable for ocean disposal without chemical and biological testing 
(``exclusion criteria''). The determination of exclusion from testing 
is made by EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers in accordance with 
these criteria, and not by the dredging company or the permit 
applicant. 


11. Need for Mitigation for Disposal Site Use 


One commentor estimated, based on a draft Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) analysis, that at least 60 acres of habitat
would be needed to replace 
habitat value losses at the 6.5 square nautical mile ocean disposal 
site, and stated that EPA should consider including compensatory 
mitigation as a component of the site designation and monitoring 
process. 


Response 


The commentor's draft analysis is based in part on a 
misunderstanding of the site designation EIS, and incorrectly assumes 
that significant impacts will occur well beyond the boundaries of the 
disposal site. EPA does not share the commentor's conclusion that 
compensatory mitigation is needed for use of the ocean disposal site 
in part because: (1) The site location has been selected specifically 
to minimize any off-site impacts due to disposal of dredged material, 
as documented in the Final EIS; (2) only suitable non-toxic sediments 
may be disposed at the site, in accordance with EPA's Ocean Dumping 
Criteria; (3) unlike upland or wetland ``fills,'' disposed sediments 
will not alter the site's basic habitat type (

e.g.

, disposal of 
suitable dredged material at the site is not the same as permanently 
changing a wetland into an upland, or a seasonal wetland into a tidal 
wetland); and (4) ongoing site monitoring, and management actions as 
necessary, will ensure that no significant off-site adverse impacts 
will occur or persist during the 50-year period of site use. 


12. Sea Surface Microlayer 


Several commentors stated that EPA has 
ignored concerns raised about contamination of the sea surface 
microlayer as a result of dredged material disposal at the site, and 
has missed opportunities to resolve this issue through field studies. 


Response 


EPA has fully considered comments regarding potential 
contamination of the sea surface microlayer. In addition, EPA 
consulted with the LTMS technical review panel (see listing in Table 
5.2-1 of the Final EIS) on this issue. Based on the available 
information regarding the sea surface microlayer, EPA has determined 
that the potential for significant contamination of or impacts to the 
sea surface microlayer as a result of disposal site use is not 
significant. The specific characteristics of this deep ocean disposal 
site (including its location in a turbulent open ocean environment 
approximately 50 miles offshore), and the characteristics of the 
dredged material that is expected to be disposed there (suitability 
for ocean disposal established by extensive physical, chemical, and 
biological testing), support this conclusion. The LTMS technical 
review panel view was consistent with EPA's determination. 
Consequently, monitoring of the sea surface microlayer is not included 
in the SMMP at this time. However, EPA does not discourage 
independent sampling in the vicinity or submission of any data 
collected in or near the site. 


13. Discussion of ``Alternative Site 2'' 


One commentor recommended that EPA emphasize that significant commercial fish abundances and fish habitats exist
in this area which would have precluded designation of a site in this area, even if the Monterey Bay National Marine
Sanctuary did not exist. 


Response 


The site designation Final EIS describes the greater 
importance of the continental shelf, including Study Area 2, for 
commercially important fish species relative to SF-DODS and the other 
off-shelf alternative sites. The Final EIS also notes that since 
Study Area 2 is within the boundaries of the Monterey Bay National 
Marine Sanctuary, it would not comply with EPA's site designation 
criteria and therefore could not be designated. 


14. Inclusion of SMMP in the Site Designation Rule 


Several 
commentors recommended that the entire SMMP be included as part of the 
regulation designating the site. 


Response 


The Final Rule has been revised to include specific 
provisions governing site monitoring and site management. These 
provisions establish the legal basis for requiring site monitoring and 
site management and establish the basic criteria for adequate site 
monitoring and management measures. These provisions further 
establish the basic criteria for using site monitoring data to make 
adjustments to site management or site use. The provisions of the 
Final Rule are sufficient, in EPA's view, to create environmentally 
appropriate and legally enforceable site monitoring and site 
management regimes. 
On April 20, 1994, EPA published a Public Notice in the 

Federal 
Register 

indicating the availability of a proposed SF-DODS Site 
Monitoring and Management Plan (``SMMP'') and soliciting public comment 
on the SMMP. As noted above, EPA has now incorporated the major 
aspects of the proposed SMMP directly into the Rule. In addition, EPA 
will publish the ``SMMP Implementation Manual'' based upon the SMMP. 
The SMMP Implementation Manual will provide operational details 
concerning site monitoring and management measures that are not 
necessary or appropriate for inclusion in EPA's Final Rule designating 
the SF-DODS (also see response to comment number 25, below). The SMMP 
Implementation Manual will serve to document EPA's interpretation of 
the specific measures that are appropriate for implementing the 
provisions required in the Final Rule. EPA intends to notify the 
public and solicit public comments if any future changes are made to 
the SMMP Implementation Manual.

15. Feasibility and Validity of the Site Monitoring


Several commentors wrote that the details of the SMMP should be known before the Final Rule is issued in order to assess
its scientific validity 
and the feasibility of surveillance and monitoring. 


Response 


In the Public Notice accompanying the Proposed Rule designating the SF-DODS, EPA discussed the broad outlines
of site surveillance and monitoring envisioned by EPA. EPA subsequently supplemented this step by making available
for public review and comment the proposed SMMP (see response above), and by incorporating many specific site management
and monitoring requirements into the 
Final Rule itself as requested by several commentors. In EPA's view, 
the public has had ample opportunity to comment upon the scientific 
validity and the feasibility of EPA's proposed site surveillance and 
monitoring measures, and as a result these measures have been 
strengthened. 
In EPA's view, the surveillance and monitoring measures that EPA 
will require for the SF-DODS are feasible and will provide the 
necessary scrutiny of site use for a full evaluation of the potential 
for adverse environmental impacts. The monitoring and surveillance 
measures for the SF-DODS are based upon successful measures taken at 
other designated disposal sites in Region 9 and other parts of the 
United States, including those required by EPA to be implemented by 
the U.S. Navy on a project involving the disposal of dredged sediments 
at a temporary dump site in the vicinity of the SF-DODS. The 
monitoring measures for the SF-DODS were further developed with the 
benefit of conservative (environmentally protective) modeling of post-disposal dispersion of dredged sediments
at the site. This modeling, 
discussed in the Final EIS, has been demonstrated at other ocean 
disposal sites to have a high degree of accuracy in predicting 
dispersion of dumped sediments. 


16. Management Action Trigger Levels and Significance Criteria 


Several commentors stated that the trigger levels or criteria for 
determining when site use can be modified or terminated were 
inappropriate or too vague in the site designation Proposed Rule, and 
appear to limit EPA's ability to take action to restrict ocean dumping 
until significant adverse impacts have already occurred. 


Response 


EPA's authority to protect marine resources in the vicinity 
of a disposal site is described in the Ocean Dumping regulations at 40 
CFR 220.4, 228.3, 228.7, 228.8, 228.9, 228.10, and 228.11. EPA can 
require that site use be modified or terminated based on several 
factors, including: (1) exceedance of Federal water quality criteria 
after disposal within the site or beyond the SF-DODS boundary; (2) 
significant movement of disposed material toward important biological 
resource areas or marine sanctuaries; (3) significant adverse changes 
in the structure of the benthic community outside the disposal site 
boundary; (4) significant adverse bioaccumulation in organisms 
collected from the disposal site or areas adjacent to the site 
boundary, compared to the reference site; and (5) significant adverse 
impacts upon commercial or recreational fisheries resources near the 
site. EPA can take action based on these criteria at any time; the 
site designation Rule in no way restricts EPA's authorities in this 
regard. 
In addition to these existing authorities, the Final Rule now 
includes additional authority for determining management actions, such 
as site use modifications or even site use termination, as warranted 
by site monitoring results. For example, clarifications have been 
made to how sediment chemistry monitoring results would ``trigger'' 
management actions. 
With respect to EPA taking actions before significant adverse 
impacts have occurred, monitoring data will be collected periodically 
(

i.e.,

 there will be annual sampling of monitoring stations) and any 
corrective management action taken following an annual review of 
monitoring data could therefore occur after some impacts have already 
occurred. However, because of extensive physical, chemical, and 
biological testing of the sediments proposed for ocean disposal, 
potential adverse impacts, if any, are expected to be physical in 
nature (

i.e.,

 sediment textural changes and smothering of some 
infauna) and confined within the boundaries of the disposal site. 
Furthermore, if warranted by onboard observations (

i.e.,

 direct 
observations of significant disturbance of marine birds and mammals 
near disposal operations) more immediate action can be taken. 


17. Frequency of Monitoring 


One commentor wrote that the proposed 
frequency of monitoring (after a period of one year or after 6 million 
cubic yards have been dumped), is not adequate and that monitoring 
should be more frequent to determine seasonal differences in the plume 
and sediment footprint. 


Response 


EPA's conservative modeling of the fate of dredged material 
disposed at the alternative sites utilized current meter data from a 
full year's deployment. Seasonal variability of oceanographic 
conditions is therefore generally known, and was considered in the 
site designation Final EIS and in development of the SMMP. The 
existing seasonal data, together with the monitoring requirements of 
the Final Rule, are adequate to address seasonal variation in 
oceanographic conditions. 


18. Need for Periodic Review 


Several commentors objected to the 
designation of the site for a full 50 years without any stringent 
requirement for periodic review. 


Response 


The Final Rule now more clearly states that there will be 
periodic review of monitoring data to determine if the site is 
performing as predicted (

i.e.,

 no significant adverse impacts outside 
of the disposal site boundaries), if site modifications are necessary, 
or if site use should be terminated. Necessary changes in site 
management can be made based on any of these reviews. Site monitoring 
will be a strict requirement of site use. If site monitoring is not 
implemented, disposal of dredged material will be prohibited at the 
ocean site. 


19. Baseline Data 


Several commentors wrote that the proposed SMMP, 
as summarized in the Proposed Rule, is flawed because of inadequate 
baseline data. These commentors urged a rigorous monitoring program 
during the first year of dumping in order to develop a more 
scientifically sound baseline for the site. 


Response 


Although the site designation studies were broad in 
geographic scope, the data collected in these studies serve as an 
appropriate baseline given the variability of biological parameters 
which is typical of this oceanic area. The region, overall, is 
significantly affected by many factors, including: interannual changes 
in regional climate; climate-induced variability in abundance and 
spatial distribution of biological populations, and human-induced 
impacts such as heavy vessel traffic and substantial commercial and 
recreational fishing. A focussed, localized one-year study of the 
site itself ignores the temporal and spatial complexity of the area, 
and would not produce a meaningful ``baseline'' for the site.

20. Preliminary Drafts of the Proposed SMMP


One commentor stated that the Proposed Rule does not reflect comments received by the agency on various preliminary
drafts of the SMMP. 



Response


As indicated above, on April 20, 1994, EPA issued a Public Notice soliciting comment on its proposed SMMP which set
forth proposed monitoring and management measures for the SF-DODS. In addition, the Public Notice accompanying
the Proposed Rule designating the SF-DODS broadly outlined EPA's proposed site monitoring and management
measures for the SF-DODS. The provisions in the Final Rule setting forth site monitoring and management requirements
for the SF-DODS now being promulgated by EPA reflect the public comments received in response to these two Public
Notices, as well as all other comments EPA previously received concerning preliminary drafts of the SMMP. 



21. Enforceability of the Proposed SMMP


One commentor stated that 
both permit conditions and the site management and monitoring 
provisions themselves must be enforceable not only by EPA, but by 
members of the public with standing to represent the marine resources 
at risk. 


Response


As indicated above, the Final Rule has been revised to 
include specific provisions governing site monitoring and site 
management. These provisions establish the legal basis for requiring 
site monitoring and site management and establish the basic criteria 
for adequate site monitoring and management measures. These 
provisions will be enforceable by EPA as well as by citizens who meet 
the requirements for filing suit under MPRSA section 105(g), 33 U.S.C. 
1415(g). 



22. Performance of Site Monitoring Field Work


Some commentors were 
concerned that reliable information may not be collected if site 
monitoring field work could be conducted by the permittee or, for 
federal projects, by the Corps of Engineers. These commentors 
recommended that all site monitoring work be conducted by EPA and/or 
by independent third parties. 


Response


The Final Rule has been revised to clarify that monitoring 
information required to be submitted by permittees must be collected 
and/or certified as being accurate by independent Quality Control 
contractors, who are not employees of the permittee. However, the 
Corps of Engineers shares site management and enforcement authority 
with EPA and, for disposal operations conducted by or for the Corps of 
Engineers, the Corps of Engineers may directly collect and submit the 
required information. EPA and the Corps of Engineers retain the 
authority to independently monitor, and conduct surveillance and 
enforcement operations on, all permitted disposal operations at the 
site. In addition, EPA may independently monitor Corps of Engineers 
disposal operations. 


23. Relevance of Navy Monitoring Data


One commentor recommended 
that the U.S. Navy mid-point monitoring data should not be used or 
cited because a final report has not yet been received on this 
monitoring. 


Response


References to the Navy mid-point monitoring have been retained, since this work entails the only monitoring of actual
dredged material disposal to date in the vicinity of the SF-DODS. Given concerns expressed in public comments
about the actual (versus modeled) behavior of disposed dredged material at what will be the deepest ocean disposal
site so far designated in the U.S., EPA believes that the information is very relevant. Although the Navy's final monitoring
report has not yet been received, the results contained in the preliminary reports reviewed by EPA are adequate to
reach basic conclusions about site performance regarding plume behavior and deposition of dredged material on the
bottom. 



24. Corps of Engineers Site Designation Authority


One commentor requested that the Final Rule include more specific and accurate 
language regarding the responsibilities of the Army Corps of Engineers 
in issuing permits for dredging projects and managing the disposal 
site, and questioned whether the prohibition on site use (if the site 
management and monitoring provisions are not implemented) affects the 
Army Corps of Engineers' independent authority to designate temporary 
(project-specific) disposal sites under Section 103 of the MPRSA. 


Response


Nothing in the Rule affects the independent authorities of 
other agencies. The Corps' authority to issue permits for ocean 
disposal is fully described in 40 CFR part 225. Also, under Section 
103 of the MPRSA, the Army Corps of Engineers may designate temporary, 
project-specific ocean disposal sites if an EPA-designated (Section 
102) ocean disposal site is unavailable. If, due to a lack of funding 
to implement the site management and monitoring provisions required in 
the Final Rule, EPA's SF-DODS site were technically ``unavailable'' for 
use, the Army Corps of Engineers could propose to designate a 
temporary site. However, under these circumstances, it is likely that 
the SF-DODS site itself is the only location that could be justified 
or designated for temporary use, since EPA's Final EIS identified it 
as the best overall location for disposal. Proposed use of any other 
location would likely require the collection of substantial 
supplemental data, and could result in greater cumulative impacts than 
continued use of SF-DODS. It is EPA's position that responsibility to 
implement all monitoring requirements for use of a temporary Corps-designated site would rest with the Corps, and
that temporary 
designation of the SF-DODS site by the Corps would require them to 
fully implement the site's existing monitoring requirements. 


25. Detailed Comments on the Proposed SMMP


Several comments were 
received regarding specific details of the proposed SMMP as summarized 
in the site designation Proposed Rule. These included comments 
regarding methods for monitoring impacts to particular marine 
resources, and specific methods (including specific instrumentation) 
for tracking the dispersal and migration of sediments suspended in the 
water column. 


Response


The SMMP included in the Final Rule incorporates overall 
requirements for site monitoring and management. However, all the 
operational details for achieving the SMMP requirements are not 
included in the Rule itself. This is because there are in many cases 
more than one methodology or technology that could be used to achieve 
the SMMP goals. It would be unreasonable to require more specific 
methodologies in the Rule itself, since the ability to select 
alternate approaches that may be more effective or efficient would be 
restricted by the requirement to first go through formal rulemaking. 
EPA believes that the degree of specificity in the SMMP is appropriate 
for the Final Rule. In addition, particular technologies and 
methodologies to be used at any time will be specified in the separate 
SMMP Implementation Manual, which will be subject to ongoing public 
review (also see response to comment number 14, above).

Delegation of management authority for ocean dumping sites. 



* * * * * 


(b) * * * 
(70) San Francisco Deepwater Ocean Site (SF-DODS) Ocean Dredged 
Material Disposal Site_Region IX. 
Location: Center coordinates of the oval-shaped site are: 37
  39.0
' 
North latitude by 123
  29.0
' West longitude (North American Datum from 
1983), with length (north-south axis) and width (west-east axis) 
dimensions of approximately 4 nautical miles (7.5 kilometers) and 2.5 
nautical miles (4.5 kilometers), respectively. 

Size: 6.5 square nautical miles (22 square kilometers). 
Depth: 8,200 to 9,840 feet (2,500 to 3,000 meters). 
Use Restricted to Disposal of: Dredged materials. 
Period of Use: Continuing use over 50 years from date of site 
designation, subject to restrictions and provisions set forth 
below. 
Restrictions/Provisions: The remainder of this Rule constitutes the 
required Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for the SF-DODS. 
This SMMP shall be supplemented by a Site Management and Monitoring 
Plan Implementation Manual (SMMP Implementation Manual) containing 
more detailed operational guidance. The SMMP Implementation Manual 
may be periodically revised as necessary; proposed revisions to the 
SMMP Implementation Manual shall be made following opportunity for 
public review and comment. SF-DODS use shall be subject to the 
following restrictions and provisions: 
(i) 

Type and capacity of disposed materials. 

The interim site 
disposal capacity shall be 6 million cubic yards of suitable dredged 
material per year until December 31, 1996. Thereafter, the capacity 
of the SF-DODS shall be set in a separate rulemaking based on either a 
comprehensive long-term management strategy for management of dredged 
materials from San Francisco Bay (reflected in an EPA-prepared dredged 
material management planning document) or a separate alternatives- 
based EPA evaluation of the need for ocean disposal. This separate 
rulemaking will identify the appropriate site capacity for the 
remaining life of this site designation. No disposal at the SF-DODS 
may occur after December 31, 1996 without subsequent promulgation by 
Rule of appropriate annual site disposal capacity. 

(ii) 

Permit/project conditions. 

Paragraph (b)(70)(ii)(A) of this 
section sets forth requirements for inclusion in permits to use the 
SF-DODS, and in all Army Corps of Engineers federal project 
authorizations. Paragraph (b)(70)(ii)(B) of this section describes 
additional project-specific conditions that will be required of 
disposal permits and operations as appropriate. Paragraph 
(b)(70)(ii)(C) of this section describes how alternative permit 
conditions may be authorized by EPA and the Corps of Engineers. All 
references to ``permittees'' shall be deemed to include the Army Corps 
of Engineers when implementing a federal dredging project. 

(A) 

Mandatory Conditions. 

All permits or federal project 
authorizations authorizing use of the SF-DODS shall include the 
following conditions, unless approval for an alternative permit 
condition is sought and granted pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(70)(ii)(C) of this section: 



(1) 

Transportation of dredged material to the SF-DODS shall only 
be allowed when weather and sea state conditions will not interfere with safe transportation and will not create risk
of spillage, leak or other loss of dredged material in transit to the SF-DODS. No disposal vessel trips shall
be 
initiated when the National Weather Service has predicted combined seas in excess of eighteen feet or has issued a
gale warning for local waters during the time period necessary for the disposal vessel to complete dumping operations.




(2) 

All vessels used for dredged material transportation and disposal must be load-lined at a level at which dredged material
is not expected to be spilled in transit under anticipated sea state conditions. Disposal vessels shall not be filled
above their load limitations. Before any 
disposal vessel departs for the SF-DODS, an independent quality control inspector must certify that it is filled
correctly. For purposes of paragraph (b)(70)(ii) of this section, ``independent'' means not an employee of the 
permittee; however, the Corps of Engineers may provide inspectors for Corps of Engineers disposal operations. 


(3) 

Dredged material shall not be leaked or spilled from disposal vessels during transit to the SF-DODS. 


(4) 

Disposal vessels in transit to and from the SF-DODS shall 
remain at least three nautical miles from the Farallon Islands at all times. 


(5) 

When dredged material is discharged within the SF-DODS, no 
portion of the vessel from which materials are released (for example, a hopper dredge vessel or a towed barge) can be
further than 3,200 feet from the center of the target area, centered at 37
 39
'N, 123
 29
'W.


(6) 

No more than one disposal vessel may be present within the 
permissible dumping target area referred to in paragraph (b)(70)(ii)(A)

(5)

 of this section at any time. 


(7) 

Disposal vessels shall use an appropriate navigation system 
capable of indicating the position of the vessel carrying 
dredged material (for example, a hopper dredge vessel or a 
towed barge) with a minimum accuracy and precision of 100 
feet during all disposal operations. If the positioning 
system fails, all disposal operations must cease until the 
navigational capabilities are restored. 


(8) 

The permittee shall maintain daily records of the amount of 
material dredged and loaded into barges for disposal, the times that disposal vessel depart for, arrive at and return
from the SF-DODS, the exact locations and times of disposal, and the volumes of material disposed at the SF-DODS
during 
each vessel trip. The permittee shall further record wind 
and sea state observations at intervals to be established in 
the permit. 


(9) 

For each disposal vessel trip, the permittee shall maintain 
a computer printout from a Global Positioning System or 
other acceptable navigation system showing transit routes 
and disposal coordinates, including the time and position of 
the disposal vessel when dumping was commenced and 
completed. 


(10) 

An independent quality control inspector (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(70)(ii)(A)(

2

) of this section) shall observe 
all dredging and disposal operations. The inspector shall 
verify the information required in paragraphs 
(b)(70)(ii)(A)(

8

) of this section and (

9

). The inspector shall promptly 
inform permittees of any inaccuracies or discrepancies 
concerning this information and shall prepare summary 
reports, which summarize all such inaccuracies and 
discrepancies, from time to time as shall be specified in 
permits. Such summary reports shall be sent by the 
permittee to the District Engineer and the Regional 
Administrator within a time interval that shall be specified 
in the permit. 


(11) 

The permittee shall report any anticipated or actual permit 
violations to the District Engineer and the Regional 
Administrator within 24 hours of discovering such 
violations. In addition, the permittee shall prepare and 
submit reports, certified accurate by the independent 
quality control inspector, on a frequency that shall be 
specified in permits, to the District Engineer and the 
Regional Administrator setting forth the information 
required by paragraphs (b)(70)(ii)(A)(

8

) and (

9

).

(12) 

Permittees shall allow observers from the Point Reyes Bird Observatory or other appropriate independent observers
as specified in permits to be present on disposal vessels on all trips to the SF-DODS for the purpose of conducting
shipboard surveys of seabirds and marine mammals. In addition, permittees shall ensure that independent observers
are present on a sufficient number of vessel trips to characterize fully the potential impact of disposal site use
on seabirds and marine mammals, taking into account, to the extent feasible, seasonal variations in such potential
impacts. At a minimum, permittees shall ensure that independent observers are present on at least one disposal trip
in any calendar month in which a disposal trip to the SF-DODS is made. 



(13) 

At the completion of short-term dredging projects or annually for on-going projects, permittees shall prepare and
submit to the District Engineer and the Regional Administrator complete pre-dredging and post-dredging bathymetric
surveys showing the depth of all areas dredged, including side slope areas, before and after dredging. Permittees
shall include a report indicating whether any dredged material was dredged outside of areas authorized for dredging
or was dredged within project boundaries at depths deeper than authorized for dredging by their permits. 

(B) 

Project-specific conditions. 

Permits or federal project authorizations authorizing use of the SF-DODS may include the following conditions,
if EPA determines these conditions are necessary to facilitate safe use of the SF-DODS, the prevention of potential
harm to the environment or accurate monitoring of site use: 


(1) 

Permittees may be required to limit the speed of disposal vessels in transit to the SF-DODS to a rate that is safe
under the circumstances and will prevent the spillage of dredged materials. 



(2) 

Permittees may be required to use automated data logging systems for recording navigation and disposal coordinates
and/or load levels throughout disposal trips when such systems are feasible and represent an improvement over manual
recording methodologies. 



(3)

 Any other conditions that EPA or the Corps of Engineers determine to be necessary or appropriate to facilitate compliance
with the requirements of the MPRSA and this Rule may be included in site use permits. 
(C) 

Alternative permit/project conditions.

 Alternatives to the permit conditions specified in paragraph (b)(70)(ii) of this section in a permit or federal project
authorization may be authorized if the permittee demonstrates to the District Engineer and the Regional Administrator
that the alternative conditions are sufficient to accomplish the specific intended purpose of the permit condition
in issue and further demonstrates that the waiver will not increase the risk of harm to the environment, the health
or safety of persons, nor will impede monitoring of compliance with the MPRSA, regulations promulgated under the
MPRSA, or any permit issued under the MPRSA. 

(iii) 

Site monitoring. 

Data shall be collected in accordance with a three-tiered site monitoring program which consists of three interdependent
types of monitoring for each tier: physical, chemical and biological. In addition, periodic confirmatory monitoring
concerning potential site contamination shall be performed. 

Specific guidance for site monitoring tasks required by this paragraph shall be described in a Site Management and
Monitoring Implementation Manual (SMMP Implementation Manual) developed by EPA. The SMMP Implementation Manual
shall be reviewed periodically and any necessary revisions to the Manual will be issued for public review under an
EPA Public Notice. 

(A) 

Tier 1 monitoring activities. 

Tier 1 monitoring activities shall consist of the following: 



(1) Physical monitoring. 

Tier 1 Physical Monitoring shall consist of a physical survey to map the area on the seafloor within and in the vicinity
of the disposal site where dredged material has been deposited (the footprint). Such a survey shall use appropriate
technology (for example, sediment profile photography) to determine the areal extent and thickness of the disposed
dredged material, and to determine if any dredged material has deposited outside of the disposal site boundary. 



(2) Chemical monitoring. 

Tier 1 Chemical Monitoring shall consist of collecting, processing, and preserving boxscore samples of sediments
so that such sediments could be subjected to sediment chemistry analysis in the appropriate tier. Samples shall be
collected within the dredged material footprint, outside of the dredged material footprint, and outside of the disposal
site boundaries. Samples within the footprint shall be subjected to chemical analysis in annual Tier 1 activity.
Samples from outside of the footprint and outside of the disposal site boundaries shall be archived and analyzed only
when the criteria requiring Tier 2 as specified in paragraph (b)(70)(iv) are met. A sufficient number of samples shall
be collected so that the potential for adverse impacts due to elevated chemistry can be assessed with an appropriate
time-series or ordinal technique. 


(3) Biological monitoring. 

Tier 1 Biological Monitoring shall have two components: monitoring of pelagic communities and monitoring of benthic
communities. 



(i) Pelagic communities. 

Tier 1 Biological Monitoring shall include regional surveys of seabirds, marine mammals and mid water column fish
populations appropriate for evaluating how these populations might be affected by disposal site use. A combination
of annual regional and periodic (random) shipboard surveys of seabirds and marine mammals will be used. The regional
survey designs for each category of biota shall be similar to that used for the regional characterization studies
referenced in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for Designation of a Deep Water Ocean Dredged Material Disposal
Site off San Francisco, California (August 1993) with appropriate realignments to accommodate transects within
and in the vicinity of the SF-DODS. The periodic shipboard surveys shall be performed from vessels involved
in dredged material disposal operations at the SF-DODS as specified in permit conditions imposed pursuant
to paragraph (b)(70)(ii)(A)(

12

). The minimum number of surveys must be sufficient to characterize the disposal operations for each project, and,
as practicable, provide seasonal data for an assessment of the potential for adverse impacts for the one-year period.
An appropriate time-series (ordinal) and community analysis shall be performed using data collected during the
current year and previous years. 



(ii) Benthic communities. 

Tier 1 Biological Monitoring shall include collection and preservation of boxscore samples of benthic communities
so that such samples could be analyzed as a Tier 2 activity. 



(4) Annual reporting. 

The results of the annual Tier 1 studies shall be compiled in an annual report which will be available for public review.

(B) 

Tier 2 monitoring activities. 

Tier 2 monitoring activities shall consist of the following: 


(1) Physical monitoring. 

Tier 2 Physical Monitoring shall consist of oceanographic studies conducted to validate and/or improve the models
used to predict the dispersion in the water column and deposition of dredged material on the seafloor at the SF-DODS.
The appropriate physical oceanographic studies may include: the collection of additional current meter data, deployment
of sediment traps, and deployment of surface and subsurface drifters. 


(2) Chemical monitoring. 

Tier 2 Chemical Monitoring shall consist of performing sediment chemistry analysis on samples collected and preserved
in Tier 1 from outside of the footprint and outside of the disposal site boundaries. 



(3) Biological monitoring. 

Tier 2 Biological Monitoring shall involve monitoring of pelagic communities and monitoring of benthic communities.

(i) Pelagic communities. 

Tier 2 Biological Monitoring for pelagic communities shall include supplemental surveys of similar type to those
in Tier 1, or other surveys as appropriate. 



(ii) Benthic communities. 

Tier 2 Biological Monitoring for benthic communities shall include a comparison of the benthic community within
the dredged material footprint to benthic communities in adjacent areas outside of the dredged material footprint.
An appropriate time-series (ordinal) and community analysis shall be performed using data collected during the
current year and previous years to determine whether there are adverse changes in the benthic populations outside
of the disposal site which may endanger the marine environment. 



(4) Annual reporting. 

The results of any required Tier 2 studies shall be compiled in an annual report which will be available for public review.


(C) 

Tier 3 monitoring activities. 

Tier 3 monitoring activities shall consist of the following: 



(1) Physical monitoring. 

Tier 3 physical monitoring shall consist of advanced oceanographic studies to study the dispersion of dredged material
in the water column and the deposition of dredged material on the seafloor in the vicinity of the SF-DODS. Such
physical monitoring may include additional, intensified studies involving the collection of additional current
meter data, deployment of sediment traps, and deployment of surface and subsurface drifters. Such studies may include
additional sampling stations, greater frequency of sampling, more advanced sampling methodologies or equipment,
or other additional increased study measures compared to similar studies conducted in Tiers 1 or 2. 



(2) Chemical monitoring. 

Tier 3 Chemical Monitoring shall consist of analysis of tissues of appropriate field-collected benthic and/or epifaunal
organisms to determine bioaccumulation of contaminants that may be associated with dredged materials deposited
at the SF-DODS. Sampling and analysis shall be designed and implemented to determine whether the SF-DODS
is a source of adverse bioaccumulation in the tissues of benthic species collected at or outside the SF-DODS,
compared to adjacent unimpacted areas, which may endanger the marine environment. Appropriate sampling methodologies
for these tests will be determined and the appropriate analyses will involve the assessment of benthic body burdens
of contaminants and correlation with comparison of the benthic communities inside and outside of the sediment footprint.




(3) Biological monitoring. 

Tier 3 biological monitoring shall have two components: Monitoring of pelagic communities and monitoring of benthic
communities. 



(i) Pelagic communities. 

Tier 3 Biological Monitoring shall include advanced studies of seabirds, marine mammals and mid water column fish
to evaluate how these populations might be affected by disposal site use. Such studies may include additional sampling
stations, greater frequency of sampling, more advanced sampling methodologies or equipment, or other additional
increased study measures compared to similar studies conducted in Tiers 1 or 2. Studies may include evaluation of
sub-lethal changes in the health of pelagic organisms, such as the development of lesions, tumors, developmental
abnormality, decreased fecundity or other adverse sub-lethal effect. 



(ii) Benthic communities. 

Tier 3 Biological Monitoring shall include advanced studies of benthic communities to evaluate how these populations
might be affected by disposal site use. Such studies may include additional sampling stations, greater frequency
of sampling, more advanced sampling methodologies or equipment, or other additional increased study measures compared
to similar studies conducted in Tier 2. Studies may include evaluation of sub-lethal changes in the health of benthic
organisms, such as the development of lesions, tumors, developmental abnormality, decreased fecundity or other
adverse sub-lethal effect. 



(4) Reporting. 

The results of any required Tier 3 studies shall be compiled in a report which will be available for public review. 

(D) 

Periodic confirmatory monitoring. 

At least once every three years, the following confirmatory monitoring activities will be conducted and results
compiled in a report which will be available for public review: Samples of sediments taken from the dredged material
footprint shall be subjected to bioassay testing using one or more appropriate sensitive marine species consistent
with applicable ocean disposal testing guidance (``Green Book'' or related Regional Implementation Agreements),
as determined by the Regional Administrator, to confirm whether contaminated sediments are being deposited at the
SF-DODS despite extensive pre-disposal testing. In addition, near-surface arrays of appropriate filter-feeding
organisms (such as mussels) shall be deployed in at least three locations in and around the disposal site for at least
one month during active site use, to confirm whether substantial bioaccumulation of contaminants may be associated
with exposure to suspended sediment plumes from multiple disposal events. One array must be deployed outside the
influence of any expected plumes to serve as a baseline reference. 

(iv) 

Site management actions. 

Once disposal operations at the site begin, the three-tier monitoring program described in paragraphs (b)(70)(iii)
(A) through (C) of this section shall be implemented on an annual basis, through December 31, 1996, independent of
the actual volumes disposed at the site. Thereafter, the Regional Administrator may establish a minimum annual disposal
volume (not to exceed 10 percent of the designated site capacity at any time) below which this monitoring program need
not be fully implemented. The Regional Administrator shall promptly review monitoring reports for the SF-DODS
along with any other information available to the Regional Administrator concerning site monitoring activities.
If the information gathered from monitoring at a given monitoring tier is not sufficient for the Regional Administrator
to base reasonable conclusions as to whether disposal at the SF-DODS might be endangering the marine ecosystem,
then the Regional Administrator shall require intensified monitoring at a higher tier. If monitoring at a given tier
establishes that disposal at the SF-DODS is endangering the marine ecosystem, then the Regional Administrator
shall require modification, suspension or termination of site use.

(A) 

Selection of site monitoring tiers.

 



(1) Physical monitoring. 

Physical monitoring shall remain 
limited to Tier 1 monitoring when Tier 1 monitoring 
establishes that no significant amount of dredged material 
has been deposited or transported outside of the site 
boundaries. Tier 2 monitoring shall be employed when Tier 1 
monitoring is insufficient to conclude that a significant 
amount of dredged material as defined in paragraph 
(b)(70)(iv)(A)(

4

) of this section has not been deposited or 
transported outside of the site boundaries. 



(2) Chemical monitoring

. (

i

) Chemical monitoring shall remain limited to Tier 1 Chemical Monitoring when the results of Physical Monitoring
indicate that a significant amount of dredged material as defined in paragraph (b)(70)(iv)(A)(

4

) of this section has not been deposited or transported off-site, and Tier 1 Chemical Monitoring establishes that
dredged sediments deposited at the disposal site do not contain levels of chemical contaminants that are significantly
elevated above the range of chemical contaminant levels in dredged sediments that the Regional Administrator and
the District Engineer found to be suitable for disposal at the SF-DODS pursuant to 40 CFR part 227. 



(ii)

 Tier 2 monitoring shall be employed when the results of 
Physical Monitoring indicate that a significant amount of dredged material as defined in paragraph (b)(70)(iv)(A)(

4

) of this section has been deposited off-site, and Tier 1 Chemical Monitoring is insufficient to establish that dredged
sediments deposited at the disposal site do not 
contain levels of chemical contaminants that are significantly elevated above the range of chemical contaminant
levels in dredged sediments that the Regional Administrator and the District Engineer found to be suitable for disposal
at the SF-DODS pursuant to 40 CFR part 227. The Regional Administrator may employ Tier 2 monitoring when available
evidence indicates that a significant amount of dredged material as defined in paragraph (b)(70)(iv)(A)(

4

) of this section has been deposited near the SF-DODS site boundary. 



(iii)

 Tier 3 monitoring shall be employed within and outside the dredged material footprint when Tier 2 Chemical Monitoring
is insufficient to establish that dredged sediments deposited at the disposal site do not contain 
levels of chemical contaminants that are significantly elevated above the range of chemical contaminant levels
in dredged sediments that the Regional Administrator and the District Engineer found to be suitable for disposal
at the SF-DODS pursuant to 40 CFR part 227. 



(3) Biological monitoring

. 



(i) Pelagic communities. 

Biological monitoring for pelagic communities shall remain limited to Tier 1 monitoring when Tier 1 monitoring establishes
that disposal at the SF-DODS has not endangered the monitored pelagic communities. When Tier 1 monitoring is
insufficient to make reasonable 
conclusions whether disposal at the site has endangered the monitored pelagic communities, then Tier 2 monitoring
of pelagic communities shall be employed. When Tier 2 monitoring is insufficient to make reasonable conclusions
whether disposal at the site has endangered the monitored pelagic communities, then Tier 3 monitoring of pelagic
communities shall be employed. 



(ii) Benthic communities. 

Biological monitoring for 
benthic communities shall remain limited to Tier 1 
monitoring when physical monitoring establishes that a 
significant amount of dredged material has not been 
deposited outside of the site boundaries. If physical 
monitoring indicates that a significant amount of dredged 
material has been deposited or transported outside of the 
site boundaries, then Tier 2 analysis of benthic communities 
shall be performed. If Chemical Monitoring establishes that 
there is significant bioaccumulation of contaminants in 
organisms sampled from the within or outside the dredged 
material footprint, then Tier 3 Biological Monitoring of the 
disposal site shall be employed. Tier 3 Biological 
Monitoring may replace Tier 3 Chemical Monitoring if 
observed biological effects are established as surrogate 
indicators for bioaccumulation of chemical contaminants in 
sampled organisms. 



(4) Definition of significant dredged material accumulation.

 
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(70)(iv)(A) of this 
section, dredged material accumulation on the ocean bottom 
to a thickness of five centimeters shall be considered to be 
a significant amount of dredged material. The Regional 
Administrator may determine that a lesser amount of 
accumulation is significant if available evidence indicates 
that a lesser amount of off-site accumulation could endanger 
marine resources. 

(B) 

Modification, suspension or termination of site use.

 



(1)

 If the results of site monitoring or other information indicate that any of the following are occurring as a result
of disposal at the SF-DODS, then the Regional Administrator shall modify, suspend, or terminate site use overall,
or for individual projects as appropriate: 



(i)

 Exceedance of Federal marine water quality criteria within the SF-DODS following initial mixing as defined
in 40 CFR 227.29(a) or beyond the site boundary at any time; 



(ii)

 Placement or movement of significant quantities of disposed material outside of site boundaries near or toward significant
biological resource areas or marine sanctuaries; 



(iii)

 Endangerment of the marine environment related to 
potentially significant adverse changes in the structure of 
the benthic community outside the disposal site boundary; 



(iv)

 Endangerment to the health, welfare, or livelihood of 
persons or to the environment related to potentially 
significant adverse bioaccumulation in organisms collected 
from the disposal site or areas adjacent to the site 
boundary compared to the reference site; 



(v)

 Endangerment to the health, welfare, or livelihood of persons related to potentially significant adverse impacts
upon commercial or recreational fisheries resources near the site; or 



(vi)

 Endangerment to the health, welfare, or livelihood of 
persons or to the environment related to any other 
potentially significant adverse environmental impacts. 



(2)

 The Regional Administrator shall modify site use, rather 
than suspend or terminate site use, when site use 
modification will be sufficient to eliminate the adverse 
environmental impacts referred to in paragraphs 
(b)(70)(iv)(B)(

1

)(

i

) or (

ii

) of this section or the 
endangerment to human health, welfare or livelihood to the 
environment referred to in paragraphs (b)(70)(iv)(B)(

1

)(

iii

) 
through (

vi

) of this section. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of any permit or federal project authorization 
authorizing site use, the Regional Administrator shall 
order, following opportunity for public comment, any of the 
following modifications to site use that he or she deems 
necessary to eliminate the adverse environmental effect or 
endangerment to human health, welfare, or livelihood or to 
the environment: 

(i) Change or additional restrictions upon the permissible times, rates and total volume of disposal of dredged material
at the SF-DODS; 

(ii) Change or additional restrictions upon the method of disposal or transportation of dredged materials for disposal;
or 

(iii) Change or additional limitations upon the type or quality of dredged materials according to chemical, physical,
bioassay toxicity, or bioaccumulation characteristics. 

(3) The Regional Administrator shall suspend site use when site 
use suspension is both necessary and sufficient to eliminate 
any adverse environmental effect or endangerment to human 
health, welfare, or livelihood or to the environment 
referred to in paragraph (b)(70)(iv)(B)(

1

) of this section. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of any permit or federal 
project authorization authorizing site use, the Regional 
Administrator shall order, following opportunity for public 
comment, site use suspension until an appropriate management 
action is identified or for a time period that will 
eliminate the adverse environmental effect or endangerment 
to human health, welfare, or livelihood or to the 
environment. 

(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of any permit or federal 
project authorization authorizing site use, the Regional 
Administrator shall order, following opportunity for public 
comment, site use permanently terminated if this is the only 
means for eliminating the adverse environmental impacts 
referred to in paragraphs (b)(70)(iv)(B)(

1

)(

i

) or (

ii

) of 
this section or the endangerment to human health, welfare or 
livelihood to the environment referred to in paragraphs 
(b)(70)(iv)(B)(

1

)(

iii

) through (

vi

).

Pressure Testing Older Hazardous Liquid 
and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; partial withdrawal.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 RSPA recently published a final rule requiring the hydrostatic pressure testing of certain older hazardous liquid
and carbon dioxide pipelines that were never pressure tested to current standards. The final rule also disallowed
the use of petroleum as a pressure test medium. Because the prohibition on petroleum as a test medium was not specifically
proposed, RSPA indicated it would withdraw that prohibition if it received comments that the prohibition was not
in the public interest. RSPA received comments objecting to the prohibition and is therefore withdrawing the prohibition
and allowing the use of petroleum as a test medium under specified conditions.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On June 7, 1994, RSPA published a final rule, ``Pressure Testing Older Hazardous Liquid and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines,''
(59 FR 29379). The final rule prohibited the transportation of hazardous liquids or carbon dioxide in certain steel
pipelines that were constructed before specified dates, unless those pipelines had been pressure tested hydrostatically
according to current standards or are operated at 80 percent or less of a qualified prior test or operating pressure.
Pressure testing subjects a pipeline to a higher pressure than is experienced during normal operating conditions.
A qualified pressure test will disclose physical defects, if any, that are large enough to cause pipeline failure
during normal operations. The requirements for pressure testing are intended to ensure an adequate safety margin
between the test pressure and the maximum operating pressure to prevent pipeline accidents. 

Although most pipelines are pressure tested with water, previous  195.306 allowed the use of liquid petroleum
under specified conditions, to be used as the test medium for onshore pipelines. This provision was adopted in January
1971, when the requirements for hydrostatic testing only applied to newly constructed pipelines and existing pipelines
that were relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed. 

In the final rule published June 7, 1994, RSPA was concerned that if there were widespread testing of older pipelines
with petroleum and ruptures occurred, some of the spilled petroleum might create an environmental problem. To preclude
this possibility, the final rule disallowed the use of petroleum as a test medium. RSPA had not specifically proposed
this prohibition on the use of petroleum in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published May 22, 1991 (56 FR 23538).
In the preamble to the final rule, RSPA sought comments as to whether the prohibition was in the public interest. RSPA
indicated that it would withdraw the prohibition if it received comments that the prohibition of petroleum as a test
medium was not in the public interest. 



Discussion of Comments 



RSPA received 14 public responses to the final rule published on June 7, 1994. Although one pipeline operator stated
that the prohibition would not significantly affect its operations, comments from 11 pipeline operators and a Petition
for Reconsideration from the American Petroleum Institute opposed the prohibition. Williams Pipe Line Company,
which submitted comments in opposition to the prohibition, also submitted a Petition for Reconsideration asking
that RSPA exclude certain terminal piping systems from the requirements for pressure testing. This rule addresses
only the immediate issue of whether the prohibition on testing with petroleum should be withdrawn. In the near future,
RSPA intends to address the other issues in the two Petitions for Reconsideration.

Six commenters recommended that petroleum should continue to be allowed for pressure testing piping in pump stations,
tank farms, and other low pressure facilities where the location of the piping, often aboveground on property controlled
by the operator, allows for close monitoring during the test. The commenters also stated that the typical manifold
configurations at these facilities do not facilitate drainage of test water and residual water in piping after completion
of the testing can contaminate the petroleum products.
Four commenters stated that disallowing testing with petroleum creates the need for large volumes of test water and
equal volumes of polluted water. The commenters stated that, for those pipelines without ready access to a refinery,
operators would be forced to use truck transportation to a facility for treatment of the polluted water, and that this
increases the cost and time required for pressure testing. One of these commenters also stated that RSPA had not considered
the unavailability of test water in arid, remote locations. Another commenter stated that the inability to retain
flexibility to utilize petroleum as a test medium in appropriate situations would create an unreasonable and unnecessary
expense that ultimately would be shouldered by the general public.
Six commenters stated that operators are not issued the necessary permits from regional and state agencies for the
acquisition and disposal of test water in a timely manner and may not be able to schedule the pressure testing to meet
the compliance deadlines. Two commenters argued that they had insufficient opportunity for comment because the
NPRM did not propose to limit the use of petroleum as a test medium.
Two other commenters urged the withdrawal of the blanket prohibition and establishment of a reasonable set of criteria
that might include: location of pipeline, size of pipe, valve spacing, limit on stress level, operating history or
results of an inspection tool survey. Another commenter, also opposed to the blanket prohibition, recommended the
establishment of a risk assessment process to determine which pipelines could be tested with petroleum, and suggested
the process consider such factors as: age of pipeline, leak history, nearness to environmentally sensitive areas
and populated areas, corrosion history, and results of runs with instrumented internal inspection devices (smart
pigs).
The commenters pointed out these and other problems to illustrate their opposition to the prohibition of the use of
liquid petroleum, in appropriate situations, as a test medium.
