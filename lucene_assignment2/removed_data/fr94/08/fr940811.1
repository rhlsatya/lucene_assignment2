<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; withdrawal.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) GTSIO-520 series engines. That action would have required replacement
of the crankshaft counterweights, including attaching hardware and the engine viscous damper. Since the issuance
of the NPRM, TCM has issued a revision to the applicable Overhaul Manual, which specifies replacement of counterweights
at overhaul. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) GTSIO-520 series engines, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 8, 1991 (56 FR 662). The proposed rule would have required the replacement of the crankshaft counterweights,
including attaching hardware and the engine viscous damper in accordance with TCM Service Bulletin (SB) M90-12,
dated August 21, 1990. That action was prompted by reports of engine failure due to distress of the crankshaft counterweight
bushing and engine viscous damper. The proposed actions were intended to prevent an engine failure due to crankshaft
failure. 


The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received only 3 inflight service difficulty reports since 1989, indicative
that distress of the crankshaft counterweight bushing and engine viscous damper is not a wide-spread problem that
requires an AD. Also, TCM has issued a revision to the applicable overhaul manual, which specifies replacement of
the crankshaft counterweights, including attaching hardware and the engine viscous damper at each overhaul, which
was the interval specified in the proposed rule. The FAA has determined, based on TCM issuing the revision to the overhaul
manual, and reviewing the service history, that the safety concerns are adequately addressed, and accordingly,
the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. 
Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from
issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. Since this
action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore, is not
covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

The Withdrawal 


Accordingly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, Docket No. 90-ANE-22, published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 8, 1991, (56 FR 662), is withdrawn.

 

Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on August 3, 1994.

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of time for filing comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') has requested public comments on its Trade Regulation Rule on
Care Labeling of Textile Wearing Apparel and Certain Piece Goods (``the Care Labeling Rule'' or ``the Rule''). 59
FR 30733 (June 15, 1994).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 15, 1994, the Commission published a request for comments on the Care Labeling Rule as part of its oversight
responsibilities, to review Rules and guides periodically. Specifically, the Commission requested comments about
the overall costs and benefits of the Rule and its overall regulatory and economic impact as a part of its systematic
review of all current Commission regulations and guides. The Commission also requested comment on whether the Rule
should be modified so as to: (1) Permit the use of care symbols in lieu of words; (2) revise the requirements for care
instructions in order to provide consumers with information about whether a garment can be both washed and dry cleaned;
and (3) clarify the ``reasonable basis'' requirements of the Rule.



The comment period was scheduled to close on August 15, 1994. However, citing the complexity of the Rule, the American
Textile Manufacturers Institute requested that the Commission extend the comment period for 60 days, until October
15, 1994. To provide all interested parties with an adequate opportunity to address the issues on which comment is
sought, the Commission has determined to extend the comment period until October 15, 1994

Montana Permanent Regulatory Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; reopening and extension of comment period on proposed program amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 OSM is announcing receipt of additional explanatory information pertaining to a previously proposed amendment
to the Montana permanent regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Montana program'') under the Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The additional explanatory information addresses issues raised by OSM's review
of Montana's previously proposed program amendment submittal dated July 28, 1993 (Administrative Record No. MT-11-01);
this proposed amendment concerns ownership and control provisions, violation history updates, surface owner consent,
coal exploration (``prospecting'') under notices of intent, and editorial changes.



This document sets forth the times and locations that the Montana program and proposed amendment to that program are
available for public inspection and the reopened comment period during which interested persons may submit written
comments on the proposed amendment.




Dates:

 Written comments must be received by 4:00 p.m., m.d.t., August 26, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background on the Montana Program



On April 1, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Montana program. General background information
on the Montana program, Including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and conditions of approval
of the Montana program can be found in the April 1, 1980, 

Federal Register

 [45 FR 21560]. Subsequent actions concerning Montana's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 926.15
and 926.16.



II. Proposed Amendment



By letters dated June 16 and July 28, 1993 (Administrative Record No. MT-11-01), Montana submitted a proposed
amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Montana submitted the proposed amendment in response to statutory changes
adopted by the Montana 1993 Legislative session, regarding notice of intent for ``prospecting'', ownership and
control provisions, violation history updates, and editorial changes. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment
in the August 7, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 45303) and invited public comment on its adequacy. The public comment period ended September 27, 1993.

During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of Montana Code Annotated
(MCA) 82-4-224 concerning surface owner consent and MCA 82-4-226(8) concerning coal exploration
(``prospecting'') under notices of intent. OSM notified Montana of these concerns by letter dated January 19, 1994
(administrative record No. MT-11-18). Montana responded in a letter dated July 28, 1994 (Administrative
Record No. MT-11-19) by submitting additional explanatory information.

The additional explanatory material submitted by Montana includes the following:

1. Montana presents arguments that MCA 82-4-222(1)(d) and 82-4-231(4) provides adequate
statutory authority for the Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 26.4.303(15) and 26.4.405(6)(k);

2. Montana explains that the statutory definitions of ``waiver'' and ``written consent'' in MCA 82-4-203
no longer have a purpose within the statute, but pose no problem in administering the statute;

3. Montana presents arguments that any prospecting that is conducted to determine the location, quality, or quantity
of a coal deposit requires a prospecting permit, and that it is highly unlikely that any other prospecting activity
would remove more than 250 tons of coal;

4. Montana presents arguments that under MCA 82-4-266 (1) and (2), all prospecting operations for which
a permit must be obtained are subject to reclamation and bonding requirements, regardless of whether substantial
surface disturbance results; and

5. Montana states its intention to promulgate a regulatory definition of ``substantially disturbed,'' and regulatory
requirements for information in notices of intent, at some future date. Montana also addressed several editorial
comments OSM made on the initial June 16 and July 28, 1993, submission.



III. Public Comment Procedures



OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Montana program amendment to provide the public an opportunity
to reconsider the adequacy of the amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance with the
provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment, including the additional
materials submitted, satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed
adequate, it will become part of the Montana program.

Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Casper Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included
in the administrative record.



IV. Procedural Determinations



1. Executive Order 12866



This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



2. Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



3. National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



4. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



5. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, Santa Barbara
County Air Pollution Control District (SBCAPCD) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control
of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from organic liquid loading facilities. 


The intended effect of proposing approval of this rule is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated the rule and is proposing to approve
it under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient
air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Applicability 


The rule being proposed for approval into the California SIP is Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District's
(SBCAPCD) Rule 346, ``Loading of Organic Cargo Vessels.'' This rule was submitted by the California Air Resources
Board (ARB) to EPA on January 11, 1993. 


Background 


On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included SBCAPCD. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because this area was unable
to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA
approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238, 52.222. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified
the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the above district's portions
of the California SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in
the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted.
Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A)
of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably
available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991, for states to submit
corrections of those deficiencies. 
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance.

1

 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Santa
Barbara County Area is classified as moderate;
 therefore, this area was subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 





The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on January 11, 1993, including
the rule being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SBCAPCD's Rule 346, ``Loading
of Organic Cargo Vessels.'' SBCAPCD adopted Rule 346 on October 13, 1992. The submitted rule was found to be complete
on March 26, 1993, pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V
 and is being proposed for approval into the SIP. 




Rule 346 requires bottom loading and vapor recovery systems for the transfer of non-gasoline organic liquids from
facilities into cargo tanks. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rule was adopted
as part of the district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response
to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action
for this rule.

EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action



In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. 


For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). There
is no CTG applicable to Rule 346. However, the following CTG entitled, ``Control of Hydrocarbons from Tank Truck Gasoline
Loading Terminals (EPA-450/2-77-026),'' was used only as guidance in evaluating Rule 346. Further
interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 1. In general, these guidance documents
have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. 


SBCAPCD's Rule 346, ``Loading of Organic Cargo Vessels,'' is a new rule which was adopted to require bottom loading
and vapor recovery systems during the transfer of non-gasoline organic liquids from loading facilities into cargo
tanks. In bottom loading, the organic liquid is transferred to the tank through a fill pipe that is attached to the bottom
of the tank. This arrangement reduces the amount of organic liquid that is splashed in the tank, which reduces the formation
of organic liquid vapors. 


EPA has evaluated the submitted rule and has determined that it is consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA
policy. Therefore, SBCAPCD's Rule 346 is being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting
the requirements of section 110(a) and part D. 


Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 




Regulatory Process 




Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq

., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 


SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.

Approval and Promulgation of PM

10

 Implementation Plan for the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes full approval of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
for the purpose of attaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter with
an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM

10

). The SIP addresses sources impacting the Municipality of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico which has been designated nonattainment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (the Act), requires all areas that have measured a violation of the NAAQS be designated
nonattainment. The Municipality of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico was designated nonattainment for PM

10

 and classified as moderate based on violations measured in 1987 in the Municipality. The Act requires state or territorial
governments to revise the SIP for all areas that are designated as nonattainment to ensure that the NAAQS will be attained.
Under the context of the Act, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is regarded as a state. The reader should refer to the ``General
Preamble'' [see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)] for a more detailed discussion
of the designation of PM

10

 nonattainment areas. 


II. Clean Air Act Requirements for PM

10

 SIP's 


The air quality planning requirements for areas designated nonattainment for PM

10

 are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of Title I of the Act. EPA intends to review SIP's and SIP revisions submitted under Title
I of the Act, including those state submittals addressing moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas according to the ``General Preamble.'' Because EPA is describing the PM

10

 requirements here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the ``General Preamble'' for a more detailed discussion
of the PM

10

 requirements, and guidance on meeting those requirements. 
States containing moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things, the following elements by November 15, 1991: 
A. Regulations to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) [including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)] shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
B. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

C. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
D. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM

10

 also apply to major stationary sources of PM

10

 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the nonattainment area (sections 172(c), 188, and 189.) 
There are requirements for a New Source Review (NSR) permit program and contingency measures that are due at a later
date: 
E. States with a moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area were required to submit a NSR permit program SIP revision for the construction and operation of
new and modified major stationary sources of PM

10

 by June 30, 1992 [section 189 (a)(2)]. The specific NSR requirements for moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas are: 
1. Definition of the term ``major stationary source'' that reflects thresholds of 100 tons per year (tpy) for PM

10

 and, presumptively, 100 tpy for each PM

10

 precursor for determination of whether a source is subject to Part D requirements as a major source; 
2. Provisions to ensure that new or modified major stationary sources obtain emission offsets at an offset ratio of
at least one to one; 
3. Requirements applicable to major sources of PM

10

 are also applicable to major sources of PM

10

 precursors, except where EPA determines that the sources of PM

10

 precursors do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels which exceed the PM

10

 NAAQS in the area. The EPA generally considers sulfur dioxide (SO

2

), nitrogen oxides (NO

X

), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) to be PM

10

 precursors for NSR purposes; and 
4. Provisions to ensure that the significance threshold for a modification to be major, and therefore subject to the
section 173 permit requirements, is 15 tpy for PM

10

 and, presumptively, 15 tpy for each PM

10

 precursor. 
F. States must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which become effective without further action by
the state or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM

10

 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. This requirement is described in section 172(c)(9) of the Act and 57 FR
13543-13544. 
General requirements for implementation plans are contained in section 110 of the Act and sets out provisions governing
EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566). The Act requires states to observe certain procedural
requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of
the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a state must be adopted after reasonable notice and public
hearing.

1

 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a state under
the Act must be adopted by such state after reasonable notice and public hearing. EPA also must determine whether a
submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action [see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565].
EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at Title 40 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 51, Appendix
V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991).

III. Analysis of Puerto Rico's SIP Submission 


For a more detailed discussion of Puerto Rico's submittal and EPA's proposed action on the submittal, the reader should
refer to the Technical Support Document developed for this proposed action and found at the previously mentioned
addresses. 


A. Administrative Requirements 


The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico held a public hearing on October 15, 1993 to accept public comments on the implementation
plan for the Municipality of Guaynabo PM

10

 nonattainment area. Following the public hearing the plan was adopted by Puerto Rico and signed by the Secretary of
State on March 2, 1994. On November 14, 1993, the plan was submitted to EPA as a revision to the SIP. The submittal was
supplemented with administrative documents on March 18, 1994 and March 30, 1994. The SIP revision submitted on November
14, 1993 and supplemented on March 18, 1994 and March 30, 1994 was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance
with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR 51, and found to be complete. 
Previously, the Governor of Puerto Rico was notified on December 16, 1991 by the EPA Regional Administrator that Puerto
Rico had not submitted the PM

10

 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991. This action formally started both an 18-month Sanction clock and a 24-month
Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock. In a January 15, 1993 letter, the Governor was notified that another 18-month
Sanction clock and 24-month FIP clock, for the failure to submit a permit program for the NSR requirements by June 30,
1992, had begun. Since the November 14, 1993 submittal was found to be complete, the findings made on December 16, 1991
and January 15, 1993 of non-submittal have been corrected and no sanctions will be imposed. In this action, EPA is proposing
to approve the SIP revision submitted to EPA on November 14, 1993 and supplemented on March 18, 1994 and March 30, 1994.



B. Emissions Inventory 


Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, and
current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions
inventory should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area.
Because the submission of such inventories are necessary to an area's attainment demonstration, the emissions inventories
must be received with the submission (see 57 FR 13539). 
Puerto Rico submitted an emissions inventory for base year 1990. The base year inventory identified area sources
as the primary cause of PM

10

 nonattainment contributing approximately 79 percent of the total emissions during the time the violations were
recorded. Additional contributing sources included point sources (19 percent), microinventory sources including
fugitive dust sources (one percent), and marine vessels (one percent). 
EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive,
and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent
with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act.

C. RACM (Including RACT) 


As previously noted, moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including RACT) are implemented no later than December
10, 1993 [see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)]. The ``General Preamble'' contains a detailed discussion of
EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539-13545 and 13560-13561).

Puerto Rico submitted provisions to assure the implementation of RACM (including RACT) by December 10, 1993. The
SIP contains enforceable commitments by the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (PREQB) to achieve various
RACM requirements in the regulations as well as through Memoranda of Understanding (MOU). The PREQB has signed MOU's
with various entities to include details of how the various RACM requirements will be implemented. Further discussion
on the MOU's is included in the enforceability section `G'. The three RACM's contained in the SIP address measures
to control emissions from urban fugitive dust sources such as re-entrained road dust from paved roads, unpaved roads
and parking lots, and windblown dust from construction sites and other areas; 
1. The SIP determined that an efficiency of 25 percent was reasonable in controlling emissions of fugitive dust from
paved roads. 
2. The SIP determined that a control effectiveness of 70 percent was reasonable in controlling emissions of fugitive
dust from unpaved roads, based on the use of chemical stabilization. Also, a control effectiveness of 90 percent is
used for unpaved roads and parking lots located at industrial facilities in the Municipality of Guaynabo. 
3. Due to uncertainties in quantifying the emission reduction benefit for construction sites and other areas where
land is subject to wind erosion, no credit was taken in the attainment demonstration for emission reductions. However,
controlling these sources using Puerto Rico's SIP measures will further assure attainment of the NAAQS in the Municipality
of Guaynabo. 
In addition to the control measures for fugitive dust sources, five point source categories were identified as contributing
to the PM

10

 nonattainment problem in the Municipality of Guaynabo. RACT for these source categories are: 
1. Electric Utilities (greater than 25 megawatts of generating capacity) are limited to the use of 1.5 percent sulfur
in No. 6 fuel oil; 
2. Petroleum Refineries are limited to the use of 1.0 percent sulfur in No. 6 fuel oil; 
3. Grain Handling facilities must install control equipment that is 99.5 percent efficient; prohibit clam unloading
of barges; require all material handling operations including truck loading/unloading, and ship unloading to take
place in fully enclosed rooms and vented to a control device; and implement a street cleaning program for all yard activities
associated with vehicular activities; 
4. Asphalt Blowing facilities must install control equipment that controls 90 percent of the emissions; and 
5. Quarries/Rock Crushing operations must utilize water to suppress dust thus achieving a 70 percent reduction in
emissions. 
The RACT regulations will apply to sources in these source categories which are located in or have an impact on the Municipality
of Guaynabo. The following table includes the estimated PM

10

 emissions before and after controls for the source categories previously mentioned.

Puerto Rico commits to implementing the control measures (RACM and RACT) by December 10, 1993. Control of the point
source categories is expected to result in an estimated emission reduction in PM

10

 of 1,202.1 tpy in the area. EPA has reviewed Puerto Rico's explanation and associated documentation and concluded
that it adequately justifies its choice of control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Puerto Rico's
PM

10

 nonattainment plan control strategy will result in the attainment of the PM

10

 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. By this notice, EPA is proposing to approve the control strategy comprising RACM including
RACT. 



D. Demonstration of Attainment 


As previously noted, moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing that the plan will provide
for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the
Act). 
PREQB performed an attainment demonstration using the Industrial Source Complex (ISC2) dispersion model and five
years of National Weather Service meteorological data. This demonstration indicates the NAAQS for PM

10

 will be attained by December 31, 1994 in the Municipality of Guaynabo and maintained throughout the future to year
1999. The demonstration predicted the highest 24-hour average concentration by the attainment date of December
31, 1994 will be 111.3 

m

g/m

3

, compared to the 24-hour PM

10

 NAAQS of 150 

m

g/m

3

. The peak annual concentration predicted by the model for the attainment year is 48.9 

m

g/m

3

, compared to the annual PM

10

 NAAQS of 50 

m

g/m

3

. The demonstration also showed that the PM

10

 NAAQS will be maintained in future years through the year 1999. 


E. New Source Review PM



10

 Permit Program 


The general statutory permit requirements for moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas are contained in section 173 and in subpart 4 of Part D of the Act. For moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas, states must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, significance level
for modifications, and provisions for PM

10

 precursors. The following summarizes how Puerto Rico's SIP submittal addresses the NSR requirements. 
1. Puerto Rico has established a major source threshold of 100 tpy, a minimum offset ratio of one to one, and a modification
significance level of 15 tpy. These provisions meet the minimum federal requirements and are, therefore, approvable.

2. Puerto Rico has satisfied the requirement to demonstrate that the control requirements which are applicable to
major stationary sources of PM

10

, should also apply to major stationary sources of PM

10

 precursors, such as SO

2

, VOC and NO

X

. However, such requirements will not apply where the EPA Administrator and the Board determine that such sources
of PM

10

 precursors do not significantly contribute to PM

10

 levels which exceed the PM

10

 ambient standards. 
3. The provisions to ensure the lifting of construction bans previously imposed on states which did not have an approved
nonattainment NSR SIP are not applicable to Puerto Rico since it did not have a construction ban. 
4. The provisions to assure that calculation of emissions offsets, as required by section 173(a)(1)(A), are based
on the same emissions baseline used in the demonstration of RFP are already contained in Puerto Rico's existing regulations.

5. Puerto Rico's Rule 203 provides that a permit to construct or modify a source may be granted for a proposed new major
source or major modification of an existing major source only if the applicant has received a valid location approval.
Rule 201 provides that a location approval may be granted only if an emission offset is provided and the ``emission
reductions must [be] based in actual emissions and federally enforceable, through a permit condition made to the
existing source, by the time the new or modified source commences operation.'' EPA interprets these rules to require
an applicant for a new major source or a major modification to an existing major source to secure federally enforceable
emission reductions before a permit to construct or modify is granted, and to require that such emission reductions
be federally enforceable and in effect by the time the new or modified source commences operation. That is, the permit
condition for emission reductions by the existing source will not have an effective date beyond the date when the new
or modified source commences operation. EPA therefore proposes approval of these rules as satisfying requirements
in section 173(a & c). 
6. The provisions to assure that emissions increases from new or modified major stationary sources are offset by real
reductions in actual emissions as required by section 173(c)(1) are contained in the revised regulations, and are
therefore approvable. 
7. The provisions to prevent emissions reductions otherwise required by the Act from being credited for purposes
of satisfying the Part D offset requirements are contained in the regulations, and are therefore approvable. 
8. Provisions that, as a prerequisite to issuing any part D permit, require an analysis of alternative sites, sizes,
production processes, and environmental control techniques for proposed sources that demonstrates that the benefits
of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location,
construction, or modification, are included in the revised regulation, and are therefore approvable. 
9. Puerto Rico has included a provision, in accordance with section 173(d) of the Act, for supplying information from
nonattainment NSR permits to EPA's RACT/BACT/LAER clearinghouse. This provision is therefore approvable. 
EPA is proposing to approve the PM

10

 NSR permit program SIP revision. 


F. Quantitative Milestones and RFP 


The moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to
be achieved every three years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP toward attainment
by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). RFP is defined in section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions
in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator
for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date. 
For moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas, the emissions reductions progress made between the SIP submittal due date of November 15, 1991
and the attainment date of December 31, 1994 will satisfy the first quantitative milestone. The deminimis timing
differential makes it administratively impracticable to require separate milestone and attainment demonstrations.
Thus, EPA's policy is to deem that the emissions reductions progress made between the SIP submittal due date and the
attainment date will satisfy the quantitative milestone requirement for these areas (see 57 FR 13539). 


G. Enforceability 


All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the state and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A)
and 57 FR 13556). The EPA's criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions are stated in a September
23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al.
(see 57 FR 13541). Moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program which provides for enforcement of the control measures
and other elements in the SIP [see section 110(a)(2)(C)]. 
The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed under the section headed ``RACM (including RACT).''
These control measures apply to the types of activities identified in that discussion. The SIP provides that only
specific sources in the PM

10

 nonattainment area and/or that significantly impact the nonattainment area will be subject to the applicable control
measures. Several minor sources were excluded in the control strategy because they do not contribute significantly
to the modeled exceedances of the NAAQS.

<PARENT> FR940811-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Consistent with the attainment demonstration described above, the SIP requires that all affected stationary sources
must be in full compliance with the applicable RACT requirements by December 10, 1993. However, if a physical alteration
of the stationary source is necessary to achieve compliance, the SIP requires that construction of the alteration
must commence by February 15, 1994, and must be completed by November 30, 1994. Compliance with these RACT requirements
must be demonstrated using the applicable EPA Reference Test Methods. Puerto Rico has an enforcement program that
will ensure that these RACT requirements are adequately enforced. There are civil penalties for noncompliance with
the Regulation containing these RACT requirements. RACT for stationary point sources is also enforced by PREQB through
federally enforceable permit conditions. 
In addition to the RACT requirements for stationary sources, the SIP contains enforceable commitments by PREQB to
achieve various 
RACM requirements. To implement these measures, PREQB has signed an MOU with the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation,
the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the Municipality of Guaynabo, and the Port Authority that contain details
for how each of these entities will meet these RACM commitments. The commitments to implement the RACM requirements
are in the SIP itself, and thus are enforceable as requirements of the SIP. In addition, the MOU, having gone through
public review and comment, will be incorporated into the SIP by reference, and are effective as of the date each was
signed. The attainment demonstration, which shows attainment of the PM

10

 NAAQS by December 31, 1994, uses emissions reductions based on some of these RACM measures, and thus EPA expects them
to be implemented by that date. Once incorporated into the approved SIP, the requirements of the MOU may not be changed
except by a revision to the SIP submitted to and approved by EPA. 
Puerto Rico's revisions to the regulations include a new definition for ``PM

10

'' in Rule 102. Although test methods are not contained in Puerto Rico's definition of ``PM

10

'' as they are in 40 CFR 51.100 (qq), EPA proposes to approve Puerto Rico's definition of ``PM

10

,'' since the relevant test methods are found in other provisions of the regulations. 


H. Contingency Measures 


As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must include contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13543-44).
These measures must be submitted by November 15, 1993 for the moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's
control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination
by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM

10

 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. The Municipality of Guaynabo PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP contains the following six contingency measures and are included in Rule 423(D): 
1. Puerto Rico Department of Transportation sha
