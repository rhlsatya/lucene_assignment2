Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) has approved a new standard, which
will be published as FIPS Publication 187. This newly approved standard adopts ANSI/TIA/EIA-606-1993



On April 15, 1993 (58 FR 19663), a notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 that a proposed standard for Administrative Standard for the Telecommunication Infrastructure of Federal Buildings
was being proposed for Federal use.

The written comments submitted by interested parties and other material available to the Department relevant to
this standard was reviewed by NIST and the National Communications System (NCS). On the basis of this review, NIST
recommended that the Secretary approve the standard as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), and prepared
a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation.

The detailed justification document which was presented to the Secretary, and which includes an analysis of the written
comments received, is part of the public record and is available for inspection and copying in the Department's Central
Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania
and Constitution Avenues, NW, Washington, DC 20230.

This approved standard contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning

Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 187



(Date)



Announcing the Standard for Administration Standard for the Telecommunications Infrastructure of Federal Buildings



Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.



1. Name of Standard. 

Administration Standard for the Telecommunications Infrastructure of Federal Buildings (FIPS PUB 187) (Former
Draft Federal Standard 1094).



2. Category of Standard. 

Telecommunications Standard; Telecommunications Administration.



3. Explanation. 

This standard, by adoption of ANSI/TIA/EIA-606-1993, Administration Standard for the Telecommunications
Infrastructure of Commercial Buildings, specifies the administrative requirements of the telecommunications
infrastructure within a new, existing, or renovated office building or campus. Telecommunications infrastructure
can be thought of as the collection of those components (telecommunications equipment spaces, cable pathways, grounding,
wiring, and termination hardware) that provide the basic support for the distribution of all information within
a building or campus. Administration of telecommunications includes documentation (recordkeeping, drawings,
labeling, etc.) of telecommunications outlet boxes, connectors, cables, termination hardware, patching and cross-connect
facilities, conduits, other cable pathways, telecommunications closets, and other spaces.








Note: 

Development of ANSI/TIA/EIA-606-1993, which included Federal Government participation, was a joint
Canadian/U.S. effort, resulting in the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) publication of the Canadian equivalent
of the U.S. standard as CSA T528 at approximately the same time as publication of the American National Standard.








4. Approving Authority. 

Secretary of Commerce.



5. Maintenance Agency. 

National Communications System, Office of Technology and Standards.



6. Related Documents. 

a. Federal Information Resources Management Regulations subpart 201-20.303, Standards, and subpart 201-39.1002,
Federal Standards.

b. Federal Standard 1037B, Glossary of Telecommunications Terms.

c. Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 174, Federal Building Telecommunications
Wiring Standard (Former Draft Federal Standard 1090).

d. Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 175, Federal Building Standard for Telecommunications
Pathways and Spaces (Former Draft Federal Standard 1091).

e. Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 176, Residential and Light Commercial Telecommunications
Wiring Standard (Former Draft Federal Standard 1092).

f. Future Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB), Federal Building Grounding and Bonding
Requirements for Telecommunications (Draft Federal Standard 1093).

At the time of publication of this standard, the editions indicated above were valid. All publications are subject
to revision, and parties to agreements based on this standard are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying
the most recent editions of these publications.



7. Objectives. 

The purpose of this standard is to facilitate interoperability and transportability among telecommunication facilities
and systems of the Federal Government and compatibility of these facilities and systems at the computer-communications
interface with data processing equipment (systems) of the Federal Government. This standard specifies a uniform
telecommunications infrastructure administration scheme that is independent of applications, which may change
several times throughout the life of a building. This standard establishes guidelines for end users, manufacturers,
consultants, contractors, designers, installers, and facility administrators involved in the administration
of telecommunications infrastructure.



8. Applicability. 

This standard shall be used by all departments and agencies of the Federal Government in the administration of the
telecommunications infrastructure for all new office buildings. Use of the FIPS is recommended for the administration
of the telecommunications infrastructure within an existing or renovated office building or campus. Existing building
wiring systems, especially those installed prior to the emergence of digital communications and voice/data integration,
may not readily accept application of this standard. Modernization of the existing pathway, space, and wiring systems
to meet the FIPS 174, FIPS 175, and FIPS 176 infrastructure standards may require a significant monetary expenditures.
Agencies should conduct a thorough facility analysis of existing and renovated buildings to determine the cost of
applying the standards, and develop a migration plan where cost savings can be achieved. This plan will help to ensure
timely and efficient completion of the conversion process. The result of following this administration standard
will be a telecommunications infrastructure that is well documented and easily managed by the administrator over
the life cycle of the building. This standard is not intended to hasten the obsolescence of telecommunications administration
procedures currently in use in Federal facilities; nor is it intended to provide systems engineering or applications
guidelines.

9. Specifications. 

This FIPS adopts ANSI/TIA/EIA-606-1993, Administration Standard for the Telecommunications Infrastructure
of Commercial Buildings. The American National Standard specifies the administrative requirements for the telecommunications
infrastructure within a new, existing, or renovated office building or campus. Areas of the infrastructure to be
administered include:
(a) Terminations for the telecommunications media located in work areas, telecommunications closets, equipment
rooms, and entrance facilities;
(b) Telecommunications media between terminations;
(c) Pathways between terminations that contain the media;
(d) Spaces where terminations are located; and
(e) Bonding/grounding as it applies to telecommunications.
This standard also specifies requirements for the collection, organization, and presentation of as-built data.


10. Implementation. 

The use of this standard by Federal departments and agencies is compulsory and binding for the administration of the
telecommunications infrastructure of new buildings, effective February 10, 1995.
Use of the standard is recommended for the administration of the telecommunications infrastructure of existing
and renovated buildings.
Anyone associated with telecommunications equipment, wiring systems, wire termination products, and pathway/space
components will find this standard useful. By having one administration reference document, progress can be made
toward building consistently administered telecommunications infrastructures. Administration in accordance
with this standard can be accomplished by either paper- or computer-based systems. In today's increasingly complex
telecommunications environment, effective administration is enhanced by the use of computer-based systems. This
standard will also reduce the large number of incompatible and incomplete administrative approaches in existence.
Over time, the end user should expect manufacturers to provide telecommunications systems that include administrative
support complying with this standard. It is also expected that administrative products that comply with this standard
will become available.


11. Waivers. 

Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when:
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system or related telecommunications system, or 
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Governmentwide savings.
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Attn: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
room B-154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

.
When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the 

Commerce Business Daily 

as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after the
notice is published, by amendment to such notice.

documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(b), shall be
part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.


12. Where to Obtain Copies. 

Copies of this publication are for sale by the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,
Springfield, VA 22161. (Sale of the included specifications document is by arrangement with the Electronic Industries
Association.) When ordering, refer to Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 187 (FIPSPUB187),
and the title. Payment may be made by check, money order, purchase order, credit card, or deposit account.


Appendix


By adoption of ANSI/TIA/EIA-606-1993, this document provides Federal departments and agencies with
an approach for standardizing telecommunications administration for office buildings and building complexes.
This standardization of documentation, in conjunction with FIPS 174 (Former Draft FED-STD-1090), which
specifies telecommunications wiring, and FIPS 175 (Former Draft FED-STD-1091), which provides architectural
specification of telecommunications pathways and spaces, will facilitate systems compatibility and transportability
of terminals for Federal users.
Another companion standard, ANSI/EIA/TIA-570-1991, Residential and Light Commercial Telecommunications
Wiring Standard, has been adopted as Federal Information Processing Standard 176 (Former Draft FED-STD-1092).
This standard specifies telecommunications wiring for small buildings.
During the development of this family of building telecommunications standards, significant concern was expressed,
by both Government and industry, about the need for specification of electronic system grounding. This concern resulted
in proposed ANSI/TIA/EIA-607, Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications in Commercial
Buildings, which will be proposed for adoption as a future Federal Information Processing Standard (Draft FED-STD-1093).

Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of permit issuance.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the issuance of limited entry permits with ``Designated Species B'' gear endorsements for jack mackerel
north of 39




 North lat. in the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery off Washington, Oregon and California. This issuance is based
on the results of an inseason survey assessing the intent of current limited entry permit holders to harvest underutilized
species of groundfish. This action is intended to promote the full utilization of the jack mackerel resource north
of 39




 North lat. It provides for the needs of the limited entry fleet before making surplus amounts available to ``Designated
Species B'' applicants, as required by Amendment 6 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP),
and implementing regulations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Amendment 6 to the FMP was prepared by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), approved on September 4,
1992, and implemented by NMFS on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54001), through regulations codified at 50 CFR part 663, subpart
C. Amendment 6, also called the ``Limited Entry Plan,'' is intended to control the harvesting capacity of the groundfish
fishing fleet by: (1) Limiting the overall number of vessels; (2) limiting the number of vessels using each of the three
major gear types; and (3) limiting increases in vessel harvesting capacity by limiting vessel length.


Regulations at 50 CFR 663.37(3) state that the Fisheries Management Division (FMD), Northwest Region, NMFS, will
receive and prioritize applications for ``Designated Species B'' endorsements based on seniority (number of years
the vessel has fished for the designated species). ``Designated species'' are defined as Pacific whiting, jack mackerel
north of 39




 North lat., and shortbelly rockfish. To date, 29 applications have been received requesting ``Designated Species
B'' permits for the harvest of assorted amounts of underutilized species (many applications were for multiple species;
23 for Pacific whiting, eight for shortbelly, and seven for jack mackerel). The FMD has surveyed current limited entry
permit holders regarding their intent to harvest underutilized species in 1994. The survey indicated that an estimated
659,500 metric tons (mt) of Pacific whiting, 36,600 mt of jack mackerel, and 57,300 mt of shortbelly rockfish could
be taken by the current permit holders. Based on the results of the survey, the FMD estimates that current permit holders
will harvest the entire 1994 harvest guidelines for Pacific whiting (260,000 mt) and shortbelly rockfish (23,500
mt). The survey results indicated that current permit holders intended to harvest only 36,600 mt of the 52,600 mt harvest
guideline for jack mackerel, leaving a surplus of 16,000 mt which can be made available to those ``Designated Species
B'' permit applicants who applied for a permit to harvest jack mackerel in 1994. For this reason, the FMD is issuing
``Designated Species B'' permits to those applicants.
The regulations state that ``Designated Species B'' endorsements will be issued based on vessel seniority (number
of years the vessel has fished for the designated species) until vessel delivery commitments reach the harvest guideline
or quota for the designated species. The amount of jack mackerel requested by ``Designated Species B'' permit applicants
is nearly identical to the surplus amount. Therefore, all applicants can be accommodated, and there is no need to issue
permits based on vessel seniority this season.
The Regional Director concurs with the recommendation of FMD and hereby announces the issuance of ``Designated Species
B'' limited entry permits for the harvest of jack mackerel caught north of 39




 North lat. with groundfish trawl gear.


Classification


The determination to take this action is based on the most recent data available. The aggregate data upon which the
determination is based are available for public inspection at the office of the Regional Director, Northwest Region,
(see 

ADDRESSES

) during business hours.
This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 663.37(a)(3), and is in compliance with Executive Order 12866 and
the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Theater Missile Defense (TMD) Programmatic Life-Cycle Final Environmental Impact Statement



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Record of Decision text is as follows:





Introduction



This document records BMDO's decision to conduct research and development (R&D) that will eventually enable
the U.S. to produce and deploy a TMD system. This decision is the Proposed Action of the 

Theater Missile Defense Programmatic Life-Cycle Final Environmental Impact Statement

 (FEIS), dated September 1993.

As the lead agency, the United States Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (USASSDC) prepared the FEIS. BMDO and
the other military services_the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps_served as cooperating agencies. The FEIS was filed
with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and a Notice of Availability was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 8, 1994 (59 FR page 5758).

This Record of Decision (ROD) is submitted pursuant to the 

National Environmental Policy Act

 (NEPA), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500-1508), Department
of Defense (DoD) Directive 6050.1, 

Environmental Effects in the United States of Department of Defense Actions

 (34 CFR Part 188), and service regulations that implement these environmental laws and regulations.

Ideally, an operational TMD system would combine three components: 

Active Defense

 to destroy enemy missiles in flight; 

Counterforce

 to destroy an enemy's ability to launch missiles; and 

Passive Defense

 to evade detection and otherwise survive a missile attack. A Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence
(C3I) network would manage and integrate the various elements of the system. An operational TMD system could be deployed
by the mid- to late-1990s.

The Programmatic FEIS is a first-tier document. It addresses program-wide issues and the potential impacts of technologies
associated with the Proposed Action and its Alternatives. It considers the potential impacts of research, development,
testing, production, basing (not site-specific deployment), and eventual decommissioning of TMD. It also identifies
measures to mitigate those impacts. As the TMD program matures, decisions will be made regarding testing, and eventual
production and deployment. In the event these decisions have the potential for significant environmental impact,
they will be evaluated in accordance with NEPA and CEQ regulations. Supplemental or additional documentation tiered
from this EIS will be prepared, if appropriate.



Proposed Action and Alternatives



The Proposed Action is to conduct research and development that will enable the U.S. to produce and deploy an integrated,
comprehensive TMD system. The system would include three components: Active Defense, Counterforce, and Passive
Defense. The mixture of components would be based on mission needs, feasibility, lethality, mobility, technical
maturity and cost, as well as environmental considerations and other factors.

In addition to the Proposed Action, the FEIS also considered four Alternatives to the proposed Action:

1. Improve Active Defense Only
2. Improve Counterforce Only
3. Improve Passive Defense Only
4. No Action.

Although the first three alternatives are considered in the FEIS as separate Alternatives to the Proposed Action,
their evaluation also provides the information necessary to estimate the environmental impacts of a TMD system that
blends two or three components. Pursuing only one of the first three Alternatives would yield only a limited TMD capability
with only one technology area enhanced.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940811-2-00016 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940811-2-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the fourth Alternative, No Action, no new research, development, testing, production or basing would be conducted;
and, therefore, no integrated, comprehensive TMD system would be developed. Normal improvement and maintenance
of existing systems (aircraft, missiles, and radar) would continue, to assure their effectiveness against traditional
combatant forces. New systems leading to an integrated TMD would not be developed.



Impacts and Mitigation



The FEIS found no unavoidable, significant environmental impacts for the Proposed Action or any of the four Alternatives.
In other words, any 

unavoidable

 effect, such as construction noise, will be temporary and not significant. Any conceivable 

significant

 impact, such as destruction of archaeological artifacts during construction, may be readily avoided by taking normal
precautions and following standard procedures.

Alternative 3, Passive Defense, might be termed the 

environmentally preferred alternative,

 since its impacts were analyzed to be minimal or none. This is because Passive Defense does not entail basing and decommissioning.
Since no unavoidable, significant environmental impacts were identified for any Alternative, no unavoidable significant
cumulative impacts were identified for the Proposed Action. Furthermore, because decisions on specific components
and sites will be made later, specific and cumulative impacts will be addressed in the environmental documents that
form those decisions, if appropriate.

The No-Action Alternative involves no new development, but does continue routine improvement and maintenance of
existing systems. The analysis of impacts associated with those activities is outside the scope of the TMD FEIS. They
would be the subject of site-specific or program-specific documents prepared at a later date, if appropriate.



Decision



The Proposed Action arises from compelling national security needs. Recent political and military changes throughout
the world have required adjustments in U.S. defense strategy. Both Congress and the Executive Branch have placed
a high priority on Theater Missile Defense, now the number one priority initiative within BMDO.

The Missile Defense Act of 1991 stated ``* * * (it) is a goal of the United States to provide highly effective
theater missile defenses to forward deployed and expeditionary elements of the armed forces of the United States
and to friends and allies of the United States.'' This threat to U.S. interests is growing with improvements in missile
performance and warhead design, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and increasing numbers of missile-armed
nations.

In May 1993, the Secretary of Defense announced changes in the ballistic missile defense program, and assigned a high
priority to early deployment of improved theater missile defenses. He reiterated this priority in his September
1993 report on DoD's ``bottom-up'' review of ballistic missile defense. The requirement for a TMD capability relying
on more than one technology or component was articulated in the Joint Requirements Oversight Mission Needs Statement
(MNS) for TMD, ``* * * the theater missile threat cannot yet be countered by a single technical solution.''

The FEIS found that neither the Proposed Action, nor any of four alternative approaches to satisfying this national
security requirement, would create significant environmental impacts. In other words, there is no compelling environmental
argument against the Proposed Action or in favor of any one Alternative. After careful review of the FEIS and consideration
of national defense policy requirements, I [Director, BMDO] have decided to carry out the research and development
program, within the responsibilities of BMDO, as described in the Proposed Action.



Monitoring and Enforcement



In regard to TMD research and development activities and the contracts to support them, I [Director, BMDO] direct
BMDO Deputies and Program Executive Officers to monitor these activities and ensure that environmental standards
and controls described in this FEIS are followed. As subsequent decisions are made regarding system components and
basing locations, and as their accompanying environmental documents elaborate specific requirements for monitoring
and enforcement, I [Director, BMDO] will implement appropriate safeguards.



Date and Signature



Record of Decision was signed July 30, 1994 by Malcolm R. O'Neill, Lieutenant General, United States Army, Director,
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.

August 4, 1994. 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. Northern Natural Gas Company 


[Docket No. CP94-681-000] 



Take notice that on July 22, 1994, Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), 1111 South 103rd Street, Omaha, Nebraska
68124-1000, filed in Docket No. CP94-681-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to construct and operate facilities
to implement a new delivery point near Blair, Nebraska to accommodate natural gas deliveries to Peoples Natural Gas
Company (Peoples), under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-401-000,

1

 all as more fully set forth in the request for authorization on file with the Commission and open for public inspection.






Northern states it has entered into a transportation service agreement with Peoples for the firm transportation
and delivery of natural gas to Peoples at the proposed delivery point of up to 10 Bcf annually and 11,500 Mcf per peak
day. Northern holds a blanket transportation certificate pursuant to Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations issued
in Docket No. CP86-435-000.

2

 Peoples has requested a new delivery point from Northern so they may serve the new Cargill plant near Blair, Nebraska.
Northern states that the lateral pipeline route will begin at Northern's ``C'' mainline 24-inch takeoff in the NW



1/4 of Section 16, Township 18 North, Range 8 East, Dodge County, and continue in an easterly direction approximately
16 miles to Northern's town border station (TBS) following within 30 feet to the north or south, Northern's existing
6-inch lateral line servicing Blair. Northern states that Peoples will construct the entire 24 miles of 8-inch pipeline
from Northern's ``C'' mainline to the Cargill. Northern will own and operate approximately 16 miles of the 8-inch
lateral pipeline, and Peoples will own and operate 8 miles from Northern's TBS to the Cargill plant. 





Northern states that the total volumes to be delivered to 
the customer after the request do not exceed the total volumes authorized prior to the request. Northern states that
construction of the proposed delivery point is not prohibited by its existing tariff and that it has sufficient capacity
to deliver the requested gas volumes without detriment or disadvantage to it's other customers. Northern estimates
the cost of the proposed facilities at $192,000; which includes the meter run, the take-off from the ``C'' mainline
and the flange setting. 




Comment date: 

September 19, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



2. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation


[Docket No. CP94-692-000] 



Take notice that on August 1, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe line Corporation (Transco), Post Office Box 1396, Houston,
Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP94-692-000 an application pursuant to Section 7 (b) and (c) of the Natural
Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon approximately 0.86 miles of 30-inch pipeline and for a certificate
of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of approximately 0.86 miles of 30-inch
replacement pipeline on its Main Line A across the Neches River in Hardin and Jasper Counties, Texas and across the
Village Creek in Hardin County, Texas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

Transco proposes to: (1) Construct and operate approximately 4,270 feet of 30-inch pipeline by horizontal directional
drilling under the Neches River at its existing pipeline river crossing located 8 miles north of Beaumont, Texas and
20 miles west of the Texas-Louisiana boundary and construct and operate approximately 512 feet of conventionally
installed tie-in piping on the banks of the river to connect the drilled crossing to Transco's Main Line A; (2) construct
and operate approximately 260 feet of 30-inch pipeline by conventional ditching approximately 25 feet to the north
of its existing Village Creek crossing of Main Line A located 1.8 miles west of the Neches River crossing in Hardin County,
Texas with tie-ins to Main Line A on each river bank when the replaced portion of Main Line A is removed from service;
and (3) abandon by removal the portions of Main Line A replaced at the Neches River and the Village Creek crossings.
Transco states that the proposed replacements will restore the long-term integrity of its transmission system at
the Neches River and the Village River crossings and that the capacity will remain at the existing 624 MMcf per day.


Transco states that the abandonment of the portions of the Main Line A at the Neches River crossing will be completed
in two separate projects. Transco proposes to remove approximately 260 feet of the existing 30-inch line from the
point of tie-in on the west side of the river and approximately 80 feet of the existing 30-inch line from the point of
tie-in on the east side of the river in 1994, at the time of the pipeline replacement construction. The abandonment
of the remaining facilities at the Neches River crossing will be completed in 1995, as a separate project, after necessary
permits are obtained. Transco proposes to remove, in 1994, approximately 240 feet of its Main Line A at the Village
Creek crossing after the replacement line is constructed and tied in. Transco also requests temporary authorization
to complete the river crossing replacements if permanent authorization is not issued by August 19, 1994, for security
of gas service during the upcoming heating season. The estimated cost of construction is $4,694,455 with abandonment
cost estimated at $972,000. The cost will be initially financed by Transco by funds on hand and short-term loans which
will be rolled into permanent financing. 



Comment date: 

August 19, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



3. National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation


[Docket No. CP94-693-000] 




Take notice that on August 1, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo,
New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP94-693-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of
the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization to construct
and operate a new point of delivery to provide service to an existing customer, National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation
(Distribution), under National Fuel's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83-4-000, pursuant
to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and
open to public inspection. 

National Fuel states that the new delivery point will be located in the town of Grand Island, Erie County, New York,
at the same station at which National Fuel will interconnect with the facilities of Empire State Pipeline, an intrastate
pipeline, and will be used to provide service to Distribution, and to Distribution's present and future transportation
customers. 
Additionally, National Fuel states that the total volumes to be delivered are estimated to be no more than 3,200,000
Dth annually and will have no impact on National Fuel's total peak day and annual deliveries, but will make it more likely
that National Fuel will be able to make the deliveries at the points and in the quantities desired by Distribution and
its customers. National Fuel estimates that the total cost of constructing the delivery point is $1,525,000. 

National Fuel notes that it has previously applied for approval under Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for the acquisition
and construction of certain facilities, including construction of the Grand Island delivery point, and received
conditional approval by order issued June 1, 1994, in Docket Nos. CP94-112-000 and CP88-94-008
(67 FERC   61,270 (1994)). National Fuel states that it has been unable to commence acquisition and construction
because National Fuel cannot satisfy all the conditions included in the June 1 order. National Fuel contends that
it urgently needs to commence construction of the Grand Island station in September, in order to have the station in
operation by November 1. National Fuel asserts that the new station is necessary to relieve some of the load which currently
must be satisfied from gas fed into the eastern end of Line U because Line U operates at its absolute peak capacity on
a cold day. 



Comment date: 

September 19, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



4. Distrigas of Massachusetts Corporation


[Docket No. CP94-694-000]



Take notice that on August 1, 1994, Distrigas of Massachusetts Corporation (DOMAC), 200 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts
02109, filed in Docket No. CP94-694-000, an abbreviated application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural
Gas Act, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing DOMAC to install additional air stabilization
equipment at DOMAC's liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Everett, Massachusetts. DOMAC also requests, pursuant
to Section 157.17 of the Regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission), a temporary certificate
authorizing the installation and use, on a temporary basis, of leased air injection equipment, pending the installation
and operation of the requested permanent equipment, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940811-2-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940811-2-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

DOMAC states that it anticipates in the near future it will receive additional cargoes of higher Btu LNG that will require
air stabilization capability in excess of DOMAC's current installed capacity.

3

 In addition, DOMAC states that it needs to be able to accept LNG of varying thermal contents at any time of the year, whether
supplied through the long-term contracts of SONATRACH, Distrigas Corporation's Algerian supplier, or short-term
or spot transactions with other suppliers in the international marketplace. DOMAC states that the new facilities
will consist of one integrated unit of two electric driven compressors and will be constructed wholly within DOMAC's
existing Everett facility and placed on a concrete pad within a weather enclosure. DOMAC requests approval on an expedited
basis so that the permanent facilities can be installed and operational by January 1, 1995. 





DOMAC states that it will likely require additional air stabilization capacity for one or more cargoes in the fall
of 1994, before a permanent certificate can be issued and the permanent equipment can be installed and become operational.
DOMAC proposes to lease and install by September 1, 1994, temporary air stabilization equipment to permit DOMAC to
air stabilize regasified LNG before delivering it into the J-System of Algonquin at the high throughput rates expected
for that time period. DOMAC states that the leased temporary air stabilization equipment will consist of one integrated
unit of two truck-mounted diesel powered compressors. DOMAC requests that a temporary certificate be issued on or
before August 20, 1994, to permit DOMAC to install this leased equipment by September 1, 1994, and to operate the leased
equipment pending the Commission's determination concerning the permanent authorization and until such time as
the new permanent equipment is operational. 

DOMAC states that the estimated cost of the temporary leased air stabilization facilities will be approximately
$295,000, assuming a four-month period of operation, and the cost of the permanent air stabilization facilities
will be approximately $1,280,000. DOMAC further states that it will finance the facilities by using funds on hand
and it will be fully at risk for the cost of these proposed facilities. DOMAC also states that any financial risk associated
with the additional facilities will be borne by DOMAC alone, and not its customers. 



Comment date: 

August 14, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Black Marlin Pipeline Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



August 5, 1994.



Take notice that on August 3, 1994, Black Marlin Pipeline Company (Black Marlin) tendered for filing to become part
of Black Marlin's FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, proposed to be effective
September 1, 1994:






Second Revised Sheet No. 212

Second Revised Sheet No. 213




Black Marlin states that in Order No. 636, et seq. the Commission permitted pipelines to allocate capacity on the basis
of economic value to shippers rather than on a first-come, first-served basis which had been established as the standard
under Order No. 436. Virtually all pipelines now schedule and curtail interruptible capacity based on the price,
or rate, being paid for such capacity with a pro rata allocation, if necessary, among Shippers paying the same price.
Although Black Marlin is not a capacity constrained pipeline and scheduling and curtailment priorities have not
been issues in the Black Marlin proceedings, Black Marlin states that it is filing herein to change and clarify the
operation of the scheduling and curtailment provisions of its tariff.

The currently effective Section 9, Scheduling and Curtailment, of the General Terms and Conditions (GTC) of Black
Marlin's FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1 provides that scheduling and curtailment will be based on the
rate being paid for capacity within each scheduling and curtailment category. However, this Section also retains
language regarding the first-come, first-served basis and priority dates which were originally established pursuant
to Order No. 436.

Black Marlin states that it is filing herein to eliminate language regarding the first-come, first-served methodology
and priority dates so that it is clear that scheduling and curtailment on Black Marlin is done by price, and pro rata
at each price level.

Black Marlin requests that the Commission grant any and all waivers of its rules, regulations, and orders as may be
necessary, specifically (but not limited to) Section 154.22 of the Commission's Regulations, so as to permit the
tariff sheets submitted herewith to become effective September 1, 1994.

Additionally, although Black Marlin is posting the current log of allocation data for marketing affiliates, Black
Marlin states that it is not capacity constrained (current gas flow is approximately 50% of total capacity) and no
allocation of capacity is required. Therefore, Black Marlin requests waiver effective August 1, 1994 of 18 CFR 250.16(c)
that requires a log of data used to allocate capacity to be posted for marketing affiliates and maintained for non-affiliates,
and waiver of any other rules, regulations, and orders as may be necessary to allow such waiver to become effective
August 1, 1994.

Black Marlin further states that copies of the filing have been mailed to each of its customers affected by this filing
and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
August 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken,
but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Carnegie Natural Gas Co.; Submittal of Account No. 191 Reconciliation Report</DOCTITLE>



August 5, 1994.



Take notice that on July 29, 1994, Carnegie Natural Gas Company (Carnegie), pursuant to sections 31.3 (a)(5) and (b)(5)
of Carnegie's FERC Gas Tariff and the Commission's orders in Carnegie's restructuring proceeding in Docket No. RS92-30-000,
submitted a report regarding its Account No. 191 to indicate the final balance in its account, and to indicate the adjustments
necessary to the amounts collected or refunded to reflect the final posting to that account.

Carnegie states that its filing includes two separate Account No. 191 subaccount reconciliation reports. The first,
described in section 31.3(a), of Carnegie's tariff addresses unrecovered gas costs included in Account No. 191 prior
to October 1, 1993, excluding amounts direct billed to Carnegie Account No. 191 transition costs by its upstream pipeline
supplier, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern). Carnegie also states that the second report,
described in section 31.3(b), addresses transition costs directly billed to Carnegie by Texas Eastern.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214
and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 18 CFR 385.211). All motions or protests
should be filed on or before August 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a
party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public
inspection.

<DOCTITLE>CNG Transmission Corp.; Proposed Changes in Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



August 5, 1994.



Take notice that on August 2, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act,
Part 154 of the Commission's Regulations, and Section 12.9 of the General Terms and Conditions of CNG's FERC Gas Tariff,
filed the following revised tariff sheets for inclusion in Second Revised Volume No. 1 of its FERC Gas Tariff:




Second Revised Sheet No. 44




CNG requests an effective date for this proposed tariff sheet of April 30, 1994.

CNG states that the purpose of this filing is to reallocate certain take-or-pay costs that have been directed to CNG
by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company. In particular, Second Revised Sheet No. 44 apportions $11,279 in costs that CNG
had allocated to Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin), to Algonquin's former F-2 customers. CNG
further states that it does not seek to recover any additional upstream take-or-pay costs through this filing.

CNG states that copies of the filing were served upon CNG's jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before August 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference
Room.

<DOCTITLE>CNG Transmission Corp.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



August 5, 1994.



Take notice that on August 2, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), filed for inclusion in its FERC Gas Tariff,
Second Revised Volume 1, the following tariff sheets:




Sub. First Revised Sheet No. 31
2nd Sub. Alt. Third Revised Sheet No. 32
2nd Sub. Alt. Third Revised Sheet No. 33
First Revised Sheet No. 37




The proposed effective date of these tariff sheets is July 1, 1994.

CNG states that these tariff sheets have been revised to correct inadvertent errors on sheets filed by CNG on June 30,
1994. CNG states that it has: corrected the rate for Wheeling Service on Sheet No. 31, to properly mirror CNG's IT rates;
corrected the maximum volumetric surcharge for capacity release transactions, stated on Sheet Nos. 32 and 33, to
include the Section 18 (Transition Cost Adjustment) surcharge; removed note 6 from Sheet Nos. 32 and 33, which had
addressed CNG's proposed changes to gathering rates; and updated the surcharge applicable to incremental services
set forth on Sheet No. 37, to reflect the proper differential from CNG's revised Part 284 rates.

CNG states that copies of this letter of transmittal and enclosures are being mailed to CNG's customers and interested
state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825

<DOCTITLE>Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc., Petition for Limited Waiver of a Tariff Provision</DOCTITLE>



August 5, 1994.




Take notice that on August 3, 1994, Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc. (Granite State), filed a petition with the
Commission for a limited waiver of Section 21.1(a) of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third
Revised Volume No. 1, to extend to December 1, 1994, the period to direct bill and flow through to its former sales customers
out-of-period purchase gas costs for which Granite State expects to be billed by upstream suppliers.

Granite State states that it is a non-major downstream pipeline and that it commenced restructured operations on
November 1, 1993. It is further stated that Section 21.1(a) of the General Terms and Conditions of its tariff provided
for nine months after the termination of its purchase gas cost adjustment procedures to recover from its former sales
customers out-of-period purchase gas costs. Granite State states that its purchased gas cost adjustment procedures
terminated with the effectiveness of its restructuring tariff on November 1, 1993, and the nine month-period for
the recovery of out-of-period gas costs expired July 31, 1994.



According to Granite State, it purchased substantial quantities of gas for its system supply in the months of September
and October 1993, which were delivered by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) after Tennessee commenced
restructured operations on September 1, 1993. It is further stated that Tennessee experienced difficulties with
its nomination and scheduling procedures during the early months of its restructured operations and has recently
developed corrective information for its cash-out procedures for the months of September and October, 1993. Granite
State indicates that it expects in the near future to be directly billed by Tennessee for out-of-period gas costs related
to September and October, 1993 gas purchase activity.

Additionally, Granite State states that it expects that Tennessee's out-of-period billings will be passed through
to CNG Transmission Corporation and National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation, and then by these two pipelines to Algonquin
Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin) and, in turn, by Algonquin to Granite State.

In its petition, Granite State requests an extension to December 1, 1994, during which it can flow through to its former
customers the out-of-period billings for gas costs for which it will be directly billed by Tennessee, and the indirect
billings passed through by other upstream pipelines.


Granite State states that copies of its Petition have been served on its customers, Bay State Gas Company and Northern
Utilities, Inc., and on the regulatory commissions of the States of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.


Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a motion to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426
in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).
All such motions or protests should be filed on or before August 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's
Rules. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>New York State Prohibition on Marine Discharges of Vessel Sewage; Notice of Final Determination</DOCTITLE>



Summary



Today the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is noticing its final affirmative determination in response to
a petition from New York State to determine whether adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment
of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for the coastal waters of Huntington Harbor and Lloyd Harbor,
in the Town of Huntington, Suffolk County, New York. On November 9, 1993, notice was published that the State of New
York had requested that the Regional Administrator of the EPA, Region II make this determination and that EPA had made
a tentative affirmative determination in response to this petition (56 FR 59465). The Regional Administrator made
a final affirmative determination in this matter on April 21, 1994. This decision allows the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) to completely prohibit vessel sewage discharges into Huntington and Lloyd
Harbors.



Background



This petition was filed on July 1, 1993 by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) in
cooperation with the Town of Huntington, pursuant to Section 312(f) of Public Law 92-500, as amended by Public
Law 95-217 and Public Law 100-4, (the ``Clean Water Act'').

Section 312(f)(3) states:




After the effective date of the initial standards and regulations promulgated under this section, if any State determines
that the protection and enhancement of the quality of some or all of the waters within such State require greater environmental
protection, such State may completely prohibit the discharge from all vessels of any sewage, whether treated or not,
into such waters, except that no such prohibition shall apply until the Administrator determines that adequate facilities
for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for such water
to which such prohibition would apply.




Based on the information submitted by the NYSDEC and the Town of Huntington, EPA has made a final affirmative determination
regarding the adequacy of pump-out facilities.

The Town of Huntington is located on the north shore of Long Island and includes approximately 64 miles of tidal shoreline
contiguous to Long Island Sound. Huntington Harbor encompasses approximately 340 acres of tidal waters and surrounding
wetlands. Lloyd Harbor consists of approximately 800 acres that has been designated as a ``Significant Coastal Fish
and Wildlife Habitat Area'' by New York State. The NYSDEC application proposed that discharges would be prohibited
in an area including Huntington and Lloyd Harbors with the seaward boundary beginning at East Beach, extending south
to Huntington Lighthouse, and then landward to the Wincoma Peninsula.

Information submitted by the State of New York and the Town of Huntington states that there are seven existing pump-out
facilities available to service vessels which use Huntington and Lloyd Harbors, and one additional facility proposed
for construction. Five are located in the southern portion of Huntington Harbor and are open to the general public.
Of these, three facilities are owned and operated by the Town of Huntington. These three facilities are open continuously
from approximately April 15 until November 15 of each year and charge no fee for pump-out services. The Town of Huntington
has stated that one of the Town owned pump-out facilities, at a minimum, will remain in operation through the winter
months. The pump-out facilities can service vessels up to 60 feet in length with up to an 8 foot draft. The other two facilities
are privately owned and charge a $10.00 fee for pump-out services. These two facilities have vessel size limitations
of 65 foot length and 14 foot draft, and 40 foot length and 6 foot draft. Two additional facilities are located in nearby
Northport Harbor. One is a pump-out facility operated by the Town of Huntington and the other is a portable unit at a
privately owned marina which is designed to service vessels within their slips. The Town of Huntington is planning
to construct and operate a pump-out facility at the Castle Cove Marina, near the mouth of Huntington Harbor and closer
to Lloyd Harbor.

Vessel waste generated from the pump-out facilities in Huntington Harbor is transported to the Town sewage treatment
plant, which provides pretreatment and full secondary treatment. This plant operates under a State Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (SPDES) permit issued by the NYSDEC.

EPA's determination that adequate pump-out facilities exist for vessels which use Huntington and Lloyd Harbors
allows the NYSDEC to prohibit vessel sewage discharges in these waters. Questions in this matter may be directed to
Mr. Phil DeGaetano of the NYSDEC at (518) 457-2286, Mr. Glen Hulse of the Town of Huntington Department of Environmental
Control at (516) 351-3186 or Anne Reynolds, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 2, Water Permits
and Compliance Branch, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York, 10278, (212) 264-7674.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Region II is hereby providing public notice on its intent to establish Phased Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for
copper, mercury, lead and nickel in New York-New Jersey Harbor. The proposed TMDLs are being established in cooperation
with the States of New York and New Jersey.

A. Description of TMDLs 
B. Water Quality Standards 
C. List of Proposed TMDLs 


I. Background 


The New York-New Jersey Harbor (geographically defined as the Hudson River from the Tappan Zee Bridge extending out
to the Outer Harbor and including the Harlem River, East River to the Throgs Neck Bridge, Jamaica Bay, Newark Bay, Hackensack
River below the Oradell Dam, Passaic River below the Dundee Dam, Kill Van Kull, Arthur Kill, and the Raritan River/Bay
below the Fieldville Dam) was listed by the States of New York and New Jersey under section 304(l)(1)(B) (``the short
list'') of the Clean Water Act. Section 304(l)(1)(B) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires States to develop lists
of waters entirely or substantially impacted by point source discharges of pollutants. Section 304(l) also requires
States to develop individual control strategies for each point source. In order to establish individual control
strategies for point sources in the Harbor, the States of New York and New Jersey and EPA joined in a cooperative effort
to collect ambient and source data, develop a water quality model to assess relative loadings from all sources (municipal
and industrial discharges, storm water, combined sewer overflows, sediment flux, atmospheric deposition and tributaries),
and develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). This effort was conducted through work groups under the auspices of
the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary Program.

Due to the interstate nature of the New York-New Jersey Harbor and the desirability of consistency and equity among
dischargers, the State of New Jersey requested that EPA promulgate TMDLs for the New York-New Jersey Harbor. EPA will,
therefore, establish TMDLs as a federal action. Except for the Kill Van Kull and Arthur Kill, New York State has already
implemented the necessary water quality-based effluent limits for waterbodies within the Harbor by issuing individual
control strategies in the form of modified permits. EPA is establishing TMDLs for the remaining waterbodies for which
New York State has not established TMDLs as well as Harbor waterbodies in the State of New Jersey. The EPA promulgation
will result in the incorporation of TMDLs into State Water Quality Management Plans. In the State of New Jersey, this
promulgation will amend the Northeast, the Lower Raritan/ Middlesex County and the Monmouth County Water Quality
Management Plans. In New York State, this promulgation will amend the New York State Water Quality Management Plan.



II. Tentative Determination 


A. Description of TMDLs 





The EPA is hereby issuing public notice of its intent to establish Phased TMDLs for copper, mercury, nickel and lead
in New York-New Jersey Harbor. Based on ambient monitoring and/or water quality modeling efforts in New York-New
Jersey Harbor, certain waterbodies within the Harbor exceed or are projected to exceed applicable water quality
standards. In such cases, the Clean Water Act requires that the States calculate the maximum amount of the pollutant
that the waterbody can assimilate and still meet ambient water quality standards. This amount, called the total maximum
daily load, is then used to allocate loads among sources of pollutants. Loads allocated to point sources (e.g., municipal
dischargers) are termed Waste Load Allocations (WLAs). Loads allocated to nonpoint sources (e.g., atmospheric
inputs) are termed Load Allocations (LAs). 

Waterbodies within the Harbor which are known or projected to exceed applicable water quality standards and have
been determined to require TMDLs are denoted by an ``X'' in Table 1. Certain waterbodies in the Harbor do not require
TMDLs for all the metals of concern. For these waterbodies, no further action is being proposed. 







The proposed TMDLs for copper, mercury, nickel and lead use a phased TMDL approach. For copper, nickel, and lead, the
waterbodies listed in Table 1 exceed applicable water quality standards based on concentrations projected to occur
by the water quality model employed for this TMDL effort. Due to the limited ambient and loading data, the state of the
model calibration is uncertain for the Raritan River/Bay, the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers, and Newark Bay. Based
on the available ambient data, it has been determined that existing loads are adequate to meet applicable water quality
standards. The Phase I TMDLs for these waters will be based on limiting municipal and industrial point source dischargers
to existing loads. Additional data collection and modeling for the Hackensack River, Passaic River, Newark Bay,
Kill Van Kull, Arthur Kill, and Raritan River/Bay will be required. Once sufficient data have been collected and the
water quality model has been adequately calibrated, Phase II TMDLs will be developed, adopted and implemented, as
necessary, by the States of New York and New Jersey with assistance from EPA. However, if significant interstate issues
arise and the Commissioners of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection jointly request an EPA promulgation, EPA will promulgate Phase II TMDLs for the interstate
waters of New York-New Jersey Harbor.

As indicated in Table 1, both ambient and model projected exceedances of mercury standards occur throughout the Harbor.
Water quality modeling for mercury indicated that a significant portion of the total mercury load was not identified
by the monitoring conducted to support the TMDL effort. This load, attributed to atmospheric deposition, drives
exceedances of water quality standards. The proposed Phase I TMDLs for mercury are based on freezing existing point
source loads and reducing atmospheric deposition loading by a portion of the anticipated levels of reduction resulting
from the implementation of the Clean Air Act. Additional monitoring and water quality modeling will be conducted
to: reassess the previously identified sources; quantify loads from atmospheric deposition and sediment flux;
recalibrate the mercury water quality model; and to calculate Phase II TMDLs. 

Additional information regarding the technical development of TMDLs for the Harbor may be found in EPA's document
entitled ``Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for Copper, Mercury, Nickel and Lead in NY-NJ Harbor.'' 


B. Water Quality Standards 



States bordering interstate waters are required to assure compliance with the adjoining States' water quality standards,
as well as their own. For all waters of NY-NJ Harbor, the States agreed to develop and implement Phase I TMDLs based on
a uniform set of water quality criteria. The criteria, for mercury (0.025  u g/L), nickel (7.1  u g/L) and lead
(8.5  u g/L) are based on the marine chronic aquatic life criterion expressed as the total recoverable form of the
metal and represent the most stringent of the applicable NJ or NY standards. The copper criterion used to develop TMDLs
is 5.6  u g/L (expressed as dissolved metal). This value is the most stringent of the two proposed site-specific
copper criteria developed (7.9 [acute] and 5.6 [chronic]  u g/L dissolved) for the Harbor waters (for additional
information regarding the development of the site-specific copper criteria, refer to EPA's document entitled ``Development
of a Site-Specific Copper Criterion for the NY/NJ Harbor Complex Using the Indicator Species Procedure''). The site-specific
copper criteria will be proposed for adoption into NY and NJ State Water Quality Standards Regulations by separate
State rulemaking actions. Phase I TMDL-based permit modifications will not be implemented for copper until such
time as the proposed site-specific copper criteria are adopted by the States and approved by EPA. The above criteria
will be applied on a Harbor-wide basis. 


C. Listing of Proposed Phase I TMDLs 



Based on applicable water quality standards and an assessment of loadings to the Harbor, Phase I TMDLs were calculated
and allocated among municipal dischargers, industrial dischargers, combined sewer overflows, storm water, atmospheric,
and tributaries. 

For copper, nickel, and lead, the Phase I TMDLs/WLAs/LAs are based on existing loads from: industrial/municipal
dischargers identified as contributing significant loads of the above substances; combined sewer overflows; storm
water dischargers; atmospheric deposition; and tributary sources. 

For mercury, Phase I TMDLs/WLAs/LAs are based on existing loads for all point sources and a projected reduction in
atmospheric loads due to implementation of the Clean Air Act. 

Phase I TMDLs/WLAs/LAs are shown in Table 2. The TMDLs/WLAs/ LAs listed in the Tables below are not enforceable permit
limits. The enforceable permit limits for municipal and industrial dischargers will be developed by the States based

Rhone-Poulenc Animal Nutrition; Filing of Food Additive Petition (Animal Use)


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Rhone-Poulenc Animal Nutrition has filed a petition proposing
that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of poly(2-vinylpyridine-co-styrene) as
a coating agent in the preparation of rumen-stable, abomasum-dispersible nutrient products for dairy cattle and
dairy replacement heifers. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 2231) has been filed by Rhone-Poulenc Animal Nutrition, 42, Avenue Aristide Briand, B. P.
100, 92164 Antony Cedex, France. The petition proposes to amend the food additive regulations in  573.870 (21
CFR 573.870) to provide for the safe use of poly(2-vinylpyridine-co-styrene) as a coating agent in the preparation
of rumen-stable, abomasum-dispersible nutrient products for dairy cattle and dairy replacement heifers.


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before October
25, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and
4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will also place on public display any amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's
environmental assessment without further announcement in the 

Federal Register

. If based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition
results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's findings of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed expansion of system purpose, addition of a new category of records in the system, addition of new
routine uses, and administrative update.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

HCFA proposes revising the system notice for the ``Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS),'' System No.
09-70-6001, by: Adding ``drug data'' as a new category of records in the system; expanding the purpose
of the system to include actuarial forecasting and statistical profiling; modifying a current route use (number
5); and adding a new route use (number 6) for the release of data without individuals' consent



HCFA has developed drug data which will be helpful in supporting such things as research, policy, effectiveness of
care, and statistical reporting. These data are being added to the ``Categories of records in the system.''

The purpose of the system of records is also being expanded in order to be more specific, by including actuarial forecasting
and statistical profiling as distinct purposes.

Routine use No. 5 allows release to employees of a State for specific purposes. The modification would add the language,
``or for management and/or administration of the Medicaid program.''

The proposed new routine use would permit release of data to other Federal agencies. This routine use has two purposes.
First, disclosure would be permitted to another Federal agency to enhance the accuracy of Medicaid's payment of heath
benefits. Second, disclosure would be permitted when necessary to enable another Federal agency to fulfill the requirements
of a Federal statute or regulation. HCFA has recently received several requests from other Federal agencies asking
for help in coordinating benefits or implementing Federal statutes or regulations that involve Medicare and Medicaid
beneficiaries. A primary purpose of this system of records is to ensure high quality and effective use of data on the
Medicaid program. We believe that this purpose can be better accomplished through coordination of Medicaid beneficiary
data between and among Federal agencies.

In addition, administrative updates, such as current language and address changes are proposed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

We are publishing this notice to inform the public of our intent to expand the purpose, add a category of records, modify
a routine use, add a routine use, and make administrative and language updates to the MSIS System of Records. The purpose
of the system of records is being expanded in order to be more specific, by including actuarial forecasting and statistical
profiling as distinct purposes. HCFA has developed drug data which will be helpful in supporting such things as research,
policy, effectiveness of care, and statistical reporting. These data are being added as a ``Category of records in
the system.'' Routine Use No. 5, which allows release to employees of a State for specific purposes, is being modified
by adding, ``or for management and/or administration of the Medicaid program.'' The new routine use will be numbered
(6) and will read as follows:



6. To another Federal agency: (1) To contribute to the accuracy of HCFA's proper payment of Medicaid health benefits,
and/or (2) to enable such agency to administer a Federal health benefits program, or as necessary to enable such agency
to fulfill a requirement of a Federal statute or regulation, if HCFA:

(a) Determines that the use or disclosure does not violate legal limitations under which the data were provided, collected,
or obtained;
(b) Determines that the purpose for which the disclosure is to be made cannot reasonably be accomplished unless the
data are provided in individually identifiable form;
(c) Requires the recipient to:
(1) Establish reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure
of the record;
(2) Make no further use or disclosure of the record except:
(a.) In emergency circumstances affecting the health or safety of any individual;
(b.) For use on another project under the same conditions, and with written authorization from HCFA; and
(c.) When required by law;
(3) Secure a written statement attesting to the recipient's understanding of, and willingness to abide by the following
provisions:
(a.) Not to use the data for purposes that are not related to the subject project;
(b.) Not to publish or otherwise disclose the data in a form raising unacceptable possibilities that persons could
be identified (i.e., the data to be published must not be person-specific and must be aggregated to a level where no
data cells have 10 or fewer persons); and
(c.) Not to publish any aggregation of the data without HCFA's approval.
Because these proposed changes will change the purpose for which the information is collected or otherwise significantly
alter the system, we are preparing a report of altered system of records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(r). We are publishing the
notice in its entirety below for the convenience of the reader.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; System of Records</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of new system of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, we are proposing to establish a new system of records,
``Individuals Authorized Access to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Data Center,'' HHS/HCFA/BDMS,
No. 09-70-0064. We have provided background information about the system in the 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

 section below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

HCFA proposes to initiate a new system of records that controls and monitors access to and use of HCFA computerized
information and resources, pursuant to the authority of 42 CFR 401.101-401.148 and section 1106(a) of the Social
Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1306(a). These regulations and directives establish the conditions under which information
about the access to and use of HCFA's computerized information and resources shall be made available to the public
as well as Freedom of Information Act rules that apply to such disclosures of information.





Subsection (b)(3) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3)) permits us to disclose information without the consent
of the individual for ``routine uses''_that is, disclosure for purposes that are compatible with the purpose for
which we collect the information. The proposed routine uses in the system meet the compatibility criteria since the
information is collected for the purposes of assigning, controlling, tracking, and reporting authorized access
to and use of HCFA's computerized information and resources.

We anticipate that disclosure under the routine uses will not result in any unwarranted adverse effects on personal
privacy.

<DOCTITLE>Lodging of Final (Consent) Judgment Pursuant to the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act</DOCTITLE>


In accordance with Departmental Policy, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that a Final (Consent) Judgment in 

United States 

v. 

Westinghouse Communities of Naples, Inc., 

Civil Action No. 94-234-CIV-FTM-17D (M.D. Fla.), was lodged with the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Florida on July 18, 1994.
The proposed Final (Consent) Judgment concerns alleged violations of sections 301(a) and 404 of the Clean Water Act,
33 U.S.C. 1311(a) and 1344, and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. 403, as a result of the discharge
of fill material into a tidal pond and the unauthorized construction of a bulkhead. The Defendant, Westinghouse Communities
of Naples, Inc., was issued a permit by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1981, which authorized the filling of approximately
76 acres of wetlands as part of a residential development project. In mitigation, the permit required Defendant to
excavate a 5-acre tidal pond to create a shoreline habitat and it contained an express condition that no bulkhead or
other structures would be allowed in Clam Bay's system or adjacent wetlands. Defendant subsequently discharged
approximately 7 cubic yards of fill into the 5-acre mitigation pond in connection with the construction of a 400-foot-long
vertical bulkhead and a portion of the bulkhead was placed over the fill. Those activities were contrary to the specific
terms and conditions of the 1981 permit and, therefore, constituted violations of the Clean Water Act and the Rivers
and Harbors Act.
The site of the violations is north, east and west of Upper Clam Bay and south of Vanderbilt Beach Road (SR862) in Sections
32 and 33, Township 48 South, Range 25 East and Sections 4, 5, 8 and 9, Township 49, South, Range 25 East in Collier County,
Florida. The property contains wetlands adjacent to Upper Clam Bay-Pelican Bay and those wetlands are waters of the
United States as defined in the Clean Water Act.
The Final (Consent) Judgment requires Westinghouse Communities of Naples, Inc. to pay a civil penalty in the amount
of $15,000 for its violations of the permit. Under the settlement, the fill material and the bulkhead will be authorized
to remain in place under Nationwide Permit No. 32.
The Department of Justice will receive written comments relating to the Final (Consent) Judgment for a period of 30
days from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to Michael A. Cauley, Assistant U.S.
Attorney, Middle District of Florida, 500 Zack Street, Suite 400, Tampa, FL 33602, and should refer to 

United States 

v. 

Westinghouse Communities of Naples, Inc., 

Civil Action No. 94-234-CIV-FTM-17D (M.D. Fla.).
The Consent Decree may be examined at the Clerk's Office, United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida,
Forty Myers Division, First and Lee Street, Ft. Myers, Florida 33901.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Antitrust Division has drafted proposed new Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing and Acquisition of Intellectual
Property. The Guidelines, when adopted in final form by the Department of Justice, will state the antitrust enforcement
policy of the Department with respect to the licensing and acquisition of intellectual property, and will supersede
section 3.6 in Part I, ``Intellectual Property Licensing Arrangements,'' and cases, 6, 10, 11, and 12 in Part II of
the U.S. Department of Justice 1988 Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations. Comments should
be submitted in writing within 60 days of publication of these draft Guidelines.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

As announced by the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, Anne K. Bingaman, in published
speeches on January 10, 1994 and June 16, 1994, these proposed guidelines were drafted to state the current views of
Antitrust Division with respect to the licensing and acquisition of intellectual property.



The Guidelines are not intended to create or recognize any legally enforceable right in any person. They are not intended
to affect the admissibility of evidence or in any other way necessarily to affect the course or conduct of any present
of future litigation. Moreover, changes in the relevant statutory framework, legal precedent, and methods of internal
Department analysis may occur over time, and these changes will not always be simultaneously reflected in amendments
to the Guidelines. Parties seeking to know the Department's specific enforcement intentions with respect to any
particular transaction should consider seeking a Business Review pursuant to 28 CFR 50.5.




Dated: August 8, 1994.

U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing and Acquisition of Intellectual Property






1. Intellectual Property Protection and the Antitrust Laws



These Guidelines state the antitrust enforcement policy of the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the licensing
and acquisition of intellectual property protected by patent, copyright, and trade secret law.
 By stating its general policy, the Department hopes to assist those who need to predict whether the Department will
challenge a practice as anticompetitive. However, these Guidelines cannot remove judgment and discretion in antitrust
law enforcement. Moreover, the standards set forth in these Guidelines must be applied in unforeseeable circumstances.
Each case will be evaluated in light of its own facts, and these Guidelines will be applied reasonably and flexibly.





In the United States, patents confer rights to exclude others from making, using, or selling in the United States the
invention claimed by the patent for a period of seventeen years from the date of issue.
 To gain patent protection, an invention (which may be a product, process, machine, or composition of matter) must
be novel, nonobvious, and useful. Copyright protection applies to original works of authorship embodied in a tangible
medium of expression.
 A copyright protects only the expression, not the underlying ideas. Unlike a patent, which protects an invention
not only from copying but also from independent creation, a copyright does not preclude others from independently
creating similar expression. Trade secret protection applies to information whose economic value depends on its
not being generally known. Trade secret protection is conditioned upon efforts to maintain secrecy and has no fixed
term. As with copyright protection, trade secret protection does not preclude independent creation by others.








Although there are clear and important differences in the purpose, extent, and duration of protection provided under
the intellectual property regimes of patent, copyright, and trade secret, the governing antitrust principles are
the same. Antitrust analysis takes differences among these forms of intellectual property into account in evaluating
the specific market circumstances in which transactions occur, just as it does with other particular market circumstances.

The intellectual property laws and the antitrust laws share the common purpose of promoting innovation and enhancing
consumer welfare.
 The intellectual property laws provide incentives for innovation and its dissemination and commercialization
by establishing enforceable property rights for the creators of new and useful products, more efficient processes,
and original works of expression. In the absence of intellectual property rights, imitators could more rapidly exploit
the efforts of innovators and investors without compensation, thereby reducing the commercial value of innovation
and eroding the incentives to invest. The antitrust laws promote innovation and consumer welfare by prohibiting
certain actions by firms that deter those firms and others from competing with respect to either existing or new ways
of serving consumers.





2. General Principles





2.0

 These Guidelines embody three general principles: (a) For the purpose of antitrust analysis, the Department
regards intellectual property as being essentially comparable to any other form of property; (b) the Department
does not presume that intellectual property creates market power in the antitrust context; and (c) the Department
recognizes that intellectual property licensing allows firms to combine complementary factors of production and
is generally procompetitive.

2.1 Standard Antitrust Analysis Applies to Intellectual Property


The Department applies the same general antitrust principles to conduct involving intellectual property that it
applies to conduct involving any other form of tangible or intangible property. That is not to say that intellectual
property is in all respects the same as any other form of property. Intellectual property has important characteristics
that distinguish it from many other forms of property. These characteristics can be taken into account by standard
antitrust analysis, however, and do not require the application of fundamentally different principles.
Intellectual property law bestows on the owners of intellectual property certain rights to exclude others. These
rights help the owners to profit from the use of their property. An intellectual property owner's rights to exclude
are similar to the rights enjoyed by owners of other forms of private property. As with other forms of private property,
certain acquisitions of intellectual property, and certain types of agreements with respect to such property, may
have anticompetitive effects against which the antitrust laws can and do protect. Intellectual property is thus
neither particularly free from scrutiny under the antitrust laws, nor particularly suspect under them.


2.2 Intellectual Property and Market Power


Market power is the ability profitably to maintain prices above, or output below, competitive levels for a significant
period of time.
 The Department will not presume that a patent, copyright, or trade secret necessarily confers market power upon its
owner. Although the intellectual property right confers the power to exclude with respect to the 

specific

 product, process, or work in question, there will often be sufficient actual or potential close substitutes for such
product, process, or work to prevent the exercise of market power.
 If a patent or other form of intellectual property does confer market power, that market power does not by itself offend
the antitrust laws. As with any other tangible or intangible asset that enables its owner to obtain significant supracompetitive
profits, market power (or even a monopoly) that is solely ``a consequence of a superior product, business acumen,
or historical accident'' does not violate the antitrust laws.
 Nor does such market power impose on the intellectual property owner an obligation to license that technology to others.


See, e.g., SCM Corp. v. Xerox Copy.

, 645 F.2d 1195 (2d Cir. 1981), 

cert. denied

, 455 U.S. 1016 (1982). As in other antitrust contexts, however, market power could be illegally acquired or maintained,
or, even if lawfully acquired and maintained, would be relevant to the ability of an intellectual property owner to
harm competition through unreasonable conduct in connection with such property.






2.3 Procompetitive Benefits of Licensing


Intellectual property typically is one component among many in a production process and derives value from its combination
with complementary factors. Complementary components of production include manufacturing and distribution facilities,
workforces, and other items of intellectual property. The owner of intellectual property has to arrange for its combination
with other necessary inputs to realize its commercial value. Often, the owner finds it most efficient to contract
with others for these inputs, to sell rights to the intellectual property, or to enter into a joint venture arrangement
for its development, rather than supplying these complementary inputs itself.
Licensing, cross-licensing, or otherwise transferring intellectual property (hereinafter ``licensing'') can
facilitate its integration with complementary factors of production. This integration can lead to more efficient
exploitation of the intellectual property, benefiting consumers through the reduction of costs and the introduction
of new products. Such arrangements increase the value of intellectual property to consumers and to the developers
of the technology. By potentially increasing the expected returns from intellectual property, licensing also can
increase the incentive for its creation and thus promote greater investment in research and development.
Sometimes the use of one item of intellectual property requires access to another. An item of intellectual property
``blocks'' another when the second cannot be practiced without using the first. For example, an improvement on a patented
machine can be blocked by the patent on the machine. Licensing promotes the coordinated development of technologies
that are in a blocking relationship.
Field-of-use, territorial, and other limitations on intellectual property licenses may serve procompetitive
ends by allowing the licensor to exploit its property as efficiently and effectively as possible. These various forms
of exclusivity can be used to give a licensee an incentive to invest in the commercialization and distribution of products
embodying the licensed intellectual property and to develop additional applications for the licensed property.
The restrictions may do so, for example, by protecting the licensee against free-riding on the licensee's investments
by other licensees or by the licensor. They may also promote the licensor's incentive to license, by protecting the
licensor from competition in the licensor's own technology in a market niche that it prefers to keep to itself. These
benefits of licensing restrictions apply to patent, copyright, and trade secret licenses.

Example 1








Situation:

 Delta, Inc. develops a new software program for inventory management. The program has wide application in the health
field. Delta licenses the program in an arrangement that imposes both field of use and territorial limitations. Some
of Delta's licenses permit use only in hospitals; others permit use only in group medical practices. Delta charges
different royalties for the different uses. All of Delta's licenses permit use only in specified geographic areas.
The license contains no provisions that would prevent or discourage licensees from developing, using, or selling
any other program. None of the licensees are actual competitors of Delta in the sale of inventory management programs.



Discussion:

 The key competitive issue raised by the licensing arrangement is whether it harms competition that would likely have
taken place in its absence. (See section 3.) Such harm could occur if the licenses foreclose access to competing technologies
(in this case, most likely competing computer programs), prevent licensees from developing their own competing
technologies (again, in this case most likely computer programs), structure royalties to impose an effective requirements
contract upon licensees, or facilitate market allocation or price-fixing for any product or service supplied by
the licensees. If the license agreements contained such provisions, the Department would analyze their competitive
effects as described in sections 3-5 of these Guidelines. In this hypothetical, there are no such provisions,
and there is no apparent harm to competition. The arrangement appears to do no more than increase the value of the licensed
technology by subdividing it among different fields of use and territories and charging royalties that differ among
licensees. The Department therefore would be unlikely to object to this arrangement. The result would be the same
whether the technology was protected by copyright, patent, or trade secret. The Department's conclusion as to competitive
effects could differ if, for example, the license barred licensees from using any other inventory management program.



3. Antitrust Concerns and Modes of Analysis



3.1 Nature of the Concerns



While intellectual property licensing arrangements are typically welfare-enhancing and procompetitive, antitrust
concerns may arise when licensing arrangements impede competition that likely would have taken place in the absence
of the license. Licensing arrangements that may raise antitrust concerns include restrictions on goods or technologies
other than the licensed technology, contractual provisions that penalize licensees for dealing with suppliers
of substitute technologies, and acquisitions of intellectual property that lessen competition in a relevant antitrust
market.

For example, a licensing agreement that transfers little or no useful intellectual property, but imposes restraints
upon entities that otherwise would compete using alternative technologies, might have significant adverse effects
in downstream goods markets or in other markets. (See, e.g., Example 5.) An arrangement that effectively merges the
research and development activities of two of only a few entities that could plausibly engage in research and development
in the relevant field might harm competition for development of new intellectual property. (See section 3.2.3, ``Innovation
Markets.'')

Intellectual property licensing between actual or likely potential competitors
 may raise antitrust concerns by reducing or eliminating competition in the market(s) in which they compete or are
likely to compete. In addition, license restrictions with respect to one market may reduce competition in another
market by, for example, foreclosing access to or raising the price of an important input (other than as a natural consequence
of the licensee acquiring a licensed technology for its own use).





3.2 Markets Affected by Licensing Arrangements



A licensing arrangement may affect competition in a variety of markets. In general, for goods markets and technology
markets affected by a licensing arrangement, the Department will approach the delineation of relevant market and
the measurement of market share in the intellectual property area in the same way that it treats such questions under
section 1 of the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines. In addition, the Department may define an innovation market to
aid in assessing whether a licensing arrangement would be likely substantially to reduce investment in research
and development.



3.2.1 Technology Markets



Technology markets consist of the intellectual property that is licensed, transferred, or acquired and the technologies
that are close substitutes for it. The owner of a process for producing a particular good may be constrained in its conduct
with respect to that process not only by other processes for making that good, but also by other goods that compete with
the downstream good and by the processes used to produce those other goods.

<TEXT>
 

In many cases, particularly in the case of a product patent, there may be little to be gained by analyzing competitive
effects in a separate technology market in addition to analyzing effects in the associated goods market. Moreover,
there may be practical problems in gathering appropriate data to determine ``prices'' for the technology and its
substitute processes. For example, the technology may be licensed royalty-free in exchange for the right to use other
technology, or it may be licensed as part of a package license. When complicating factors preclude delineating a relevant
market in which the licensed technology competes, the Department may focus its attention on effects in the associated
goods markets. 

To estimate the market share of a participant using new technology, the Department generally will forecast market
acceptance over a two-year period using the best available information. For technologies not yet commercialized,
the two-year period will begin with commercial introduction. When market shares or other indicia of market power
are not readily available, and it appears that competing technologies are all equally efficient,
 the Department's analysis will treat each participant in the technology market as having an equal market share. 





3.2.2 Goods markets. A number of different goods markets may be relevant to evaluating the effects of a licensing
arrangement. A restraint in a licensing arrangement may have competitive effects in markets for final or intermediate
goods made using the intellectual property, or it may have effects upstream, in markets for goods that are used as inputs,
along with the intellectual property, to the production of other goods. 

3.2.3 Innovation markets. Firms compete in research and development that may result in new or improved products
or processes. If the capacity for research and development activity that likely will produce innovation in technology
is scarce and can be associated with identifiable specialized assets or characteristics of specific firms (which
may or may not currently participate in the relevant technology or goods markets), in may be appropriate to consider
separately the impact of the conduct in question on competition in research and development among those firms. The
firms identified as possessing these specialized assets or characteristics can be thought of as competing in a separate
innovation market. 

See

 Complaint, 

United States

 v. 

General Motors Corp.,

 Civ. No. 93-530 (D. Del., filed Nov. 16, 1993). Alternatively, innovation markets may be used to assist with
the identification of competitive effects in relevant goods and technology markets. 

See, e.g.

, Complaint, 

United States

 v. 

Flow International Corp., 

Civ. No. 94-71320 (E.D. Mich., filed Apr. 4, 1994). 



Example 2 





Situation:

 Two companies agree to cross-license future patents relating to the development of a new component for aircraft jet
turbines. Innovation in the development of the component requires the capability to work with very high tensile strength
materials. Aspects of the licensing arrangement raise the possibility that competition in research and development
of this and related components will be lessened. The Department is considering whether to define an innovation market
in which to evaluate the competitive effects of the arrangement. 



Discussion:

 If the firms that have the capability to work with very high tensile strength materials can be reasonably identified,
the Department will consider defining a relevant innovation market for development of the new component. If the number
of firms with the required capability is small, the Department may employ the concept of an innovation market to analyze
the competitive effects of the arrangement in that market, or as an aid in analyzing competitive effects in technology
or goods markets. In this analysis, the Department would take into account the specific nature of the restraint, the
likelihood that other firms may in the future acquire the requisite capability, other competitive factors, and any
efficiency justifications for the licensing arrangement. 

If the number of firms with the required capability is very large (either because there are a large number of such firms
in the jet turbine industry, or because there are many firms in other industries with the required capability), then
the Department will conclude that the innovation market is competitive. Under these circumstances, it is unlikely
that any single firm or plausible aggregation of firms could acquire a large enough share of the assets necessary for
innovation to have an adverse impact on competition. 

If the Department cannot reasonably identify the firms with the required capability, it will not attempt to define
an innovation market. 

Just as goods markets are improperly defined if the firms in the market, were they to coordinate their decisions, would
not profitably increase price above competitive levels, so too innovation markets are improperly defined if hypothetical
coordination among the firms in the candidate market would not profitably retard or restrict innovation in the technology.


When a relevant innovation market has been defined, the Department may assess the competitive significance of each
participant based on shares of those identifiable assets or characteristics upon which innovation depends, on shares
of research and development expenditures, on shares of the related product, or on equal shares assigned to reflect
the equal likelihood of innovating, depending on the facts of each case. 

Cf.

 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines  1,41 & n.15. In evaluating competitive effects, the Department would
also take into account other factors such as competitive harms from the elimination of alternative research paths
and efficiency benefits from the integration of complementary research and development programs. 



3.3 Horizontal and Vertical Relationships



As with other property transfers, antitrust analysis of intellectual property licensing arrangements examines
whether the relationship of the parties to the arrangement is primarily horizontal or vertical in nature, or whether
it has substantial aspects of both. 

A licensing arrangement has a horizontal component with respect to a technology market if it involves the acquisition
of rights to technologies that are economic substitutes for technologies that the licensee owns or controls. For
analytical purposes, the Department ordinarily will treat a relationship between a licensor and its licensees as
horizontal with respect to a particular goods market when the licensor and its licensees would be actual or likely
potential competitors in that market absent the license. 

An arrangement has a vertical component when it affects activities that are in a complementary relationship, as is
typically the case in a licensing arrangement. Such a relationship exists when the licensor and its licensees stand
in a seller-buyer relationship, or operate at different levels of the chain of production and distribution. For example,
the licensor's primary line of business may be in research and development, and the licensees, as manufacturers,
may be buying the rights to use technology developed by the licensor. Alternatively the licensor may be a component
manufacturer owning intellectual property rights in a product that the licensee manufactures by combining the component
with other inputs, or the licensor may manufacture the product, and the licensees may operate primarily in distribution
and marketing. Although licensing arrangements typically have a vertical component, the licensor and its licensees
may also have a horizontal relationship in the market containing the technology being licensed or in other markets
in which they are actual or likely potential competitors. 

The existence of a horizontal relationship between a licensor and its licensees is not inherently suspect. Identification
of such relationships is merely an aid in determining whether there may be anticompetitive effects arising from a
licensing arrangement. Such a relationship need not give rise to an anticompetitive effect, nor does a purely vertical
relationship assure that there are no anticompetitive effects. 

The following examples illustrate different competitive relationships among a licensor and its licensees.

Example 3





Situation: 

Alpha, a manufacturer of farm equipment, develops a new emission control technology for its tractor engines and licenses
it to Beta, another farm equipment manufacturer. Alpha's emission control technology is far superior to the technology
currently owned and used by Beta, so much so that Beta's technology does not discipline the prices that Alpha could
charge for its technology. Beta has no likelihood of developing an improved emissions control technology on its own.



Discussion:

 Alpha's and Beta's emission control technologies are not economic substitutes for each other. Beta is a consumer
of Alpha's technology and is not an actual or likely potential competitor of Alpha in the relevant market for technologically
superior emission control devices of the kind licensed by Alpha. This means that the relationship between Alpha and
Beta with regard to the supply and use of emissions control technology is vertical. Assuming that Alpha and Beta sell
farm equipment products that are economic substitutes for each other, their relationship is horizontal in the relevant
markets for farm equipment. 



Example 4 





Situation: 

Beta develops a new value technology for its engines and enters into a cross-licensing arrangement with Alpha, whereby
Alpha licenses its emission control technology to Beta and Beta licenses its valve technology to Alpha. Alpha already
owns an alternative valve technology that is an economic substitute for Beta's valve technology. Before adopting
Beta's technology, Alpha was using its own valve technology in its production of engines and was licensing (and continues
to license) that technology for use by others. As in Example 3, Beta does not own or control an emission control technology
that is an economic substitute for the technology licensed from Alpha. 


Discussion: 


Beta is a consumer and not a competitor of Alpha's emission control technology. As in Example 3, their relationship
is vertical with regard to this technology. The relationship between Alpha and Beta in the relevant market that includes
engine valve technology is vertical in part and horizontal in part. It is vertical in part because Alpha and Beta stand
in a complementary relationship, in which Alpha is a consumer of a technology supplied by Beta. However, the relationship
between Alpha and Beta in the relevant market that includes engine valve technology is also horizontal in part, because
both firms own valve technologies that are economic substitutes for each other. Whether the firms license their valve
technologies to others is not important for the conclusion that the firms have a horizontal relationship in this relevant
market. Even if Alpha's use of its valve technology were solely captive to its own production, the fact that the two
valve technologies are economic substitutes means that the two firms have a horizontal relationship. For the firms
to be in a horizontal relationship, it is also not necessary that Alpha actually uses its valve technology prior to
licensing technology from Beta, provided that Alpha's technology is an economic alternative to Beta's. 

As in Example 3, the relationship between Alpha and Beta is horizontal in the relevant markets for farm equipment.




3.4 The Rule of Reason and per se Rules 



In the vast majority of cases, restraints in intellectual property licensing arrangements are evaluated under the
rule of reason (

see 

section 4). In some cases, however, the courts conclude that a restraint's ``nature and necessary effect are so plainly
anticompetitive'' that it should be treated as unlawful per se, without an elaborate inquiry into the restraint's
purpose and effect, 

National Society of Professional Engineers 

v. 

United States, 

435 U.S. 679, 692 (1978). Among the restraints that have been held per se unlawful are naked price-fixing, output restraints,
and market division among horizontal competitors, as well as certain group boycotts and resale price maintenance.


To determine whether a particular restraint in a licensing arrangement is given per se or rule of reason treatment,
the Department will first determine whether the restraint in question can be expected to contribute to an efficiency-producing
integration of economic activity. In general, licensing arrangements promote such integration because they facilitate
the combination of the licensor's intellectual property with complementary factors of production owned by the licensee.
A restraint in a licensing arrangement may further such integration by, for example, aligning the incentives of the
licensor and the licensees to promote the development and marketing of the licensed technology, or by substantially
reducing transactions costs. 

In assessing whether a particular restraint contributes to an efficiency-producing integration, the Department
briefly will review, inter alia, the business of the parties to the license, the markets in question, and the purpose
and effect of the particular restraint. If there is no efficiency-producing integration of economic activity and
if the type of restraint is one that otherwise is appropriately accorded per se treatment, the Department will challenge
the restraint under the per se rule. Otherwise, the Department will apply a rule of reason analysis. 

Because licensing arrangements typically involve vertical relationships that create significant integrative
efficiencies, restraints associated with those arrangements usually will have sufficient relationship to an efficiency-producing
integration to merit analysis under the rule of reason. An ordinarily suspect restraint incorporated in a licensing
agreement will not escape per se treatment, however, if the putative integration itself is a sham or if there is an insufficient
relationship between the restraint and an efficiency-producing integration. 



Example 5 





Situation: 

Gamma, which manufactures Product X using its patented process, offers a license for its process technology to every
other manufacturer of Product X. The process technology does not represent an economic improvement over the available
existing technologies. Indeed, although several manufacturers accept licenses from Gamma, none of the licensees
actually uses the licensed technology. The licenses provide that each manufacturer has an exclusive right to sell
Product X manufactured using the licensed technology in a designated geographic area and that no manufacturer may
sell Product X, however manufactured, outside the designated territory. 



Discussion: 

The manufacturers of Product X are in a horizontal relationship in the goods market for product X. Those that are licensees
of Gamma's process technology would also be in a vertical relationship with Gamma if they actually used Gamma's technology,
although in this example, that is not the case. Any manufacturers of Product X that control technologies that are economic
substitutes for Gamma's process are also horizontal competitors of Gamma in the relevant technology market. 

The licensing arrangement restricts competition in the relevant goods market among manufacturers of Product X.
The restriction applies both to Product X that is manufactured with the licensed technology and to Product X manufactured
with any other technology. The latter restriction is the key competitive concern because it harms competition that
would have taken place in the absence of the licensing agreement. Such a restriction could conceivably benefit competition
by promoting the adoption of Gamma's technology (see Example 6). In this example, however, the technology is not being
used despite being licensed. If further investigation shows that there is no likelihood that the manufacturers of
Product X will use Gamma's technology, the Department is likely to conclude that there are no conceivable benefits
from the license restrictions. 

If the Department concludes that the restraint does not contribute to an efficiency-producing integration of economic
activity, the Department would be likely to challenge the arrangement under the per se rule as a horizontal territorial
market allocation scheme and to view the intellectual property aspects of the arrangement as a sham intended to cloak
its true nature. Since such a restraint is per se unlawful, the Department likely would challenge the arrangement
even absent proof of substantial market power by the licensor and the licensees. 

The competitive implications do not generally depend on whether the licensed technology is protected by patent,
is a trade secret or other know-how, or is a computer program protected by copyright. Nor do the competitive implications
generally depend on whether the allocation of markets is territorial, as in this example, or functional, based on
fields of use.

Example 6




Situation: 

As in Example 5, Gamma offers a license to every other manufacturer of Product X for the patented process that it uses
to manufacture Product X. The license provides that each manufacturer has an exclusive right to sell Product X manufactured
using the licensed technology in a designated geographic area, and that no manufacturer may sell Product X, however
manufactured, outside its designated territory. As in Example 5, several manufacturers accept licenses. In this
example, however, the licensed process is an advance over their previously used process. Furthermore, Gamma's licensed
process is the sole technology used by the licensees.



Discussion: 

The competitive relationships of the firms in this example are the same as in Example 5 and the licensing restraint
has a similar effect on competition among the manufacturers of Product X. This example is distinguished from the previous
example in that the licensed technology is useful, and, indeed, is used extensively by the licensees. As a consequence,
the vertical dimension of the licensing agreement, and the benefits of the licensing restrictions in promoting the
adoption of the technology, assume greater importance.

Again, the key competitive issue is the effect of the territorial restraint in the licensing arrangement on competition
in the goods market that includes Product X. The restraint applies to all sales of Product X, without regard to whether
it was made using the licensed technology. Such a restraint could have a benefit in promoting manufacturing and marketing
efforts on behalf of the licensed technology, in part by making it easier for Gamma to monitor use of its licensed technology.
The benefits come at the cost of restricting competition that would have taken place in the absence of the licensing
arrangement. If the restraint contributes to an efficiency-enhancing integration of economic activity, the Department
would evaluate this arrangement under the rule of reason. It would take into account such factors as the share of the
licensor and the licensees in the relevant markets affected by the licensing arrangement, the level of concentration
and difficulty of entry in these markets, and the promotional benefits to be gained by focusing manufacturing and
marketing efforts on the licensed technology.


4. General Principles Concerning the Department's Evaluation of Licensing Arrangements Under the Rule of Reason


4.1 Antitrust ``Safety Zone''


Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Department will not challenge a restraint in a licensing arrangement if
(1) The restraint is not of a type that normally warrants condemnation under the per se rule and (2) the licensor and
its licensees collectively account for no more than twenty percent of each relevant market affected by the restraint.
 This ``safety zone'' is designed to provide owners of intellectual property with a degree of certainty, so as to encourage
procompetitive licensing arrangements. It is not intended to discourage parties falling outside the safety zone
from adopting restrictions in their license arrangements that are reasonably necessary to achieve an efficiency-producing
integration of economic activity. The Department will analyze arrangements falling outside the ``safety zone''
based on the considerations outlined in this section.





This ``safety zone'' does not apply to transactions that amount to mergers or acquisitions, which are governed by
the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines.

The Department will include innovation market shares in its evaluation of whether a licensing arrangement falls
within the safety zone only if the assets required to compete in research and development are specialized and identifiable.
If not, the Department will confine its analysis to the goods and technology markets affected by the licensing arrangement.



4.2 General Statement of the Rule of Reason



In analyzing a restraint in a licensing arrangement under the rule of reason, the Department first inquires whether
the restraint has an anticompetitive effect. If so, the Department next inquires whether the restraint is reasonably
necessary to achieve procompetitive benefits that outweigh those anticompetitive effects. 

See NCAA 

v. 

Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, 

468 U.S. 85 (1984); 

see also 

7 Phillip A. Areeda, 

Antitrust Law, 

 1502 (1986). In pursuing these inquiries, the Department will be guided by several general principles. These
principles apply to both vertical and horizontal licensing restraints that are analyzed under the rule of reason.



4.3 Analysis of Anticompetitive Effects



The existence of anticompetitive effects resulting from a restraint in a licensing arrangement may be evaluated
on the basis of a variety of factors taken together, including the following.

<TEXT>
 



4.3.1 Market structure, coordination, and foreclosure.

 When a licensor and its licensees compete in technology or goods markets, a restraint in a licensing arrangement may
increase the risk of coordinated pricing, output restrictions, or the acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power.
The potential for competitive harm generally increases with the degree of concentration in, the difficulty of entry
into, and the inelasticities of supply and demand in markets in which the licensor and licensees are in a horizontal
relationship. Cf. 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines,   1.5, 3.
When the licensor and licensees are in a vertical relationship, harm to competition from a restraint may occur if it
forecloses access to, or increases competitors' costs of obtaining, important inputs (other than as a natural consequence
of the licensee acquiring a licensed technology for its own use). An example is a licensing arrangement with most of
the established manufacturers in an industry preventing those manufacturers from using any technology. The risk
of foreclosing access or increasing competitors' costs is related to the fraction of markets affected by the licensing
restraint and to other characteristics of the input and output markets, such as concentration, difficulty of entry,
and elasticities of supply and demand.
Harm to competition from a restraint in a vertical licensing arrangement also may occur if a licensing restraint facilitates
coordination to raise prices or reduce output in markets in which one of the parties participates. For example, if
owners of competing technologies impose similar restraints on their licensees, the licensors may find it easier
to coordinate their pricing. Similarly, licensees that are horizontal competitors may find it easier to coordinate
their pricing if they are subject to common license restraints imposed either by a common licensor or by competing
licensors. The risk of anticompetitive coordination is increased when the relevant markets are concentrated and
difficult to enter.


4.3.2 Licensing arrangements involving exclusivity.

 A licensing arrangement may involve exclusivity in two distinct respects. First, the licensor may grant one or more


exclusive licenses,

 which restrict the right of the licensor to license others and possibly also to practice the technology itself. Generally,
such as grant to exclusivity may raise antitrust concerns only if the licensees themselves, or the licensor and its
licensees, are actual or potential competitors in a relevant technology or goods market in the absence of the licensing
arrangement. Examples of exclusive licenses with possible competitive consequences include cross-leasing by
parties collectively possessing market power (

see

 section 5.5), grantbacks (

see

 section 5.6), and acquisitions of intellectual property rights (

see

 section 5.7).
A second form of exclusivity, 

exclusive dealing,

 arises when a license prevents or restrains the licensee from using competing technologies. Such restraints can
have the effect of denying rivals sufficient outlets for exploiting their technologies and thus be anticompetitive.
Exclusivity may be required by the licensor, as in an explicit exclusive dealing arrangement (

see

 section 5.4), or induced through economic incentives. For example, a royalty arrangement based on total sales of
a licensee's product, regardless of whether it is made using the licensed technology, may increase the cost to a licensee
of substituting alternative technologies, and thus may have effects similar to an exclusive dealing arrangement.


See

 Complaint, 

United States

 v. 

Microsoft, Inc., 

Civ. No. 94-1564 (D.D.C., filed July 15, 1994); Competitive Impact Statement, 

id.

 (filed July 27, 1994). Whether a restraint of this kind has anticompetitive effects depends, inter alia, on the availability
of other outlets for competitively viable exploitation of rival technologies.
Restraints that impose or encourage exclusive dealing may have procompetitive effects. For example, a licensing
arrangements that prevents the licensee from dealing in other technologies may encourage the licensee to develop
and market the licensed technology or specialized application of that technology. 

See, e.g.,

 Example 7. The Department will take into account such precompetitive effects in evaluating the reasonableness of
the arrangement. 

See

 section 4.4.
The Department will focus on the actual practice and its effects, not to the formal terms of the arrangement. A license
denominated as non-exclusive (either in the sense of exclusive licensing or in the sense of exclusive dealing) may
nonetheless give rise to the same concerns posed by formal exclusivity. A non-exclusive license may have the effect
of exclusive licensing if it is structured so that the licensor is unlikely to license others or to practice the technology
itself. A license that does not explicitly require exclusive dealing may have the effect of exclusive dealing if it
is structured to make it costly for licensees to use competing technologies. However, a licensing arrangement will
not automatically raise these concerns merely because a party chooses to deal with a single licensee or licensor,
or confines his activity to a single field of use or location, or because only a single licensee has chosen to take a license.

Example 7




Situation: 

Eta, the inventor of a new flat panel display technology, lacking the capability to bring a flat panel display product
to market, grants Rho an exclusive license to make and sell a product embodying Eta's technology. Rho does not currently
sell a product that would compete with the product embodying the new technology or control rights to another display
technology. Several firms offer competing displays, the relevant markets for manufacturing and distribution of
such displays are unconcentrated, and entry into these markets is relatively easy. Demand for the new technology
is uncertain and successful market penetration will require considerable promotional effort. The license contains
an exclusive dealing restriction preventing Rho from selling products that compete with the product embodying the
licensed technology.


Discussion: 

This example illustrates both types of exclusivity in a licensing arrangement. The license is exclusive in that it
restricts the right of the licensor to grant other licenses. In addition, the license has an exclusive dealing component
in that it restricts the licensee from selling competing products.
The inventor of the display technology and its licensee are in a vertical relationship and do not compete in the manufacture
or sale of display products or in the sale of technology. Hence, the grant of an exclusive license does not affect competition
between the licensor and the licensee. The exclusive license may promote competition by encouraging Rho to develop
and promote the new product in the face of uncertain demand by rewarding Rho for its efforts if they lead to large sales.
Although the license bars the licensee from selling competing products, this exclusive dealing aspect is unlikely
in this example to harm competition by foreclosing access or facilitating anticompetitive pricing because several
firms offer competing products, the relevant manufacturing and distribution markets are unconcentrated, and entry
is easy. On these facts, the Department would be unlikely to challenge the arrangement.


4.3.3 Benefits to the parties from reduction of competition. 

In some cases, the benefits of a restraint in a licensing arrangement to the licensor or its licensees may derive primarily
from reductions in competition that likely would have occurred absent the license rather than from the restraint's
relationship to efficiency-producing objectives of the arrangement. In determining whether to challenge a particular
restraint in a licensing arrangement, the Department will assess evidence indicating which of these possibilities
better describes the purpose and effect of the restraint.


4.3.4 Other factors. 

Factors such as a history of rivalry and a rapid pace of innovation are also relevant to an analysis of the potential
for harm to competition. The presence of these factors may indicate that licensors and licensees are less likely successfully
to engage in coordinated behavior to raise prices or restrict output, and their absence may signal a greater likelihood
of such behavior.


4.4 Efficiencies and Justifications


If the Department finds that a restraint in a licensing arrangement has an anticompetitive effect, the Department
will consider whether the restraint produces offsetting procompetitive effects, such as by facilitating the efficient
development and exploitation of intellectual property. If offsetting benefits are established, the Department
will determine whether the restraint is reasonably necessary to achieve the efficiencies. If the restraint is reasonably
necessary, and if the efficiencies outweigh the anticompetitive effect, the Department will not challenge the licensing
arrangement.
The Department's comparison of anticompetitive harms and procompetitive efficiencies is necessarily a qualitative
one. The risk of anticompetitive effects in a particular case may be insignificant compared to the expected benefits,
or vice versa. As the expected anticompetitive effects in a particular licensing arrangement increase, the Department
will look for evidence establishing with greater certainty that the arrangement achieves net benefits.
The existence of practical and significantly less restrictive alternatives is relevant to a determination of whether
a restraint is reasonably necessary. If it is clear that the parties could have achieved similar efficiencies by means
that are significantly less restrictive, then the Department will not give weight to the parties' efficiency claim.
In making this assessment, however, the Department will not engage in a search for a theoretically least restrictive
alternative that might be easier to construct in hindsight than in the practical prospective business situation
faced by the parties.
When a restraint has an anticompetitive effect, the duration of that restraint can be an important factor in determining
whether it is reasonably necessary to achieve the putative procompetitive effect. The effective duration of a restraint
may be dependent on a number of factors, including the option of the affected party to terminate the arrangement unilaterally
and the presence of contract terms (

e.g., 

unpaid balances on minimum purchase commitments) that encourage the licensee to renew a license arrangements. Consistent
with its approach to less restrictive alternative analysis generally, the Department will not attempt to draw fine
distinctions regarding duration; rather, its focus will be on situations in which the duration clearly exceeds the
period needed to achieve the procompetitive effect.

<TEXT>
 

The evaluation of procompetitive efficiencies, of the reasonable necessity of a restraint to achieve them, and of
the duration of the restraint may depend on the market context. A restraint that may be justified by the needs of a new
entrant, for example, may not have a procompetitive efficiency justification in different market circumstances.

, 365 U.S. 567 (1961).



4.5 Restraints Subject to a Quick-Look Analysis



A rule of reason analysis may require no more than a ``quick look'' at the anticompetitive effects of a particular restraint
and the extent to which the restraint is reasonably necessary to achieve an efficiency-producing integration. When
the restraint is one that ordinarily warrants per se treatment, and a quick look at the claimed efficiencies reveals
that the restraint is not reasonably necessary to achieve procompetitive efficiencies, the Department will likely
challenge the restraint without further analysis.

v.

 Indiana Federation of Dentists

, 476 U.S. 447, 459-60 (1986); 

NCAA 

v.

 Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma

, 468 U.S. 85, 109-10 & n.39 (1984).



5. Application of General Principles



This section illustrates the application of these principles to particular licensing restraints and to arrangements
that involve the cross-licensing, pooling, or acquisition of intellectual property. The restraints and arrangements
identified are typical of those that are likely to encounter antitrust scrutiny; however, they are not intended as
an exhaustive list of practices that could raise competitive concerns.



5.1 Horizontal Restraints



While licensing arrangements among horizontal competitors, like joint ventures, often promote rather than hinder
competition, there are a number of circumstances in which antitrust scrutiny is warranted. Generally speaking,
the licensor and the licensee are deemed to be horizontal competitors only if they own or control technologies that
are economic substitutes for each other or if they are competitors in a goods market other than through the use by the
licensee of the licensed technology. 

See 

section 3.3. Consistent with the principles set forth in section 3.4, the Department will challenge certain types
of horizontal restraints as per se unlawful in appropriate cases. Horizontal restraints in licensing arrangements
that constitute price fixing, allocation of markets or customers, agreements to reduce output, and certain group
boycotts may merit per se treatment. In other cases, the restraints will be evaluated under the rule of reason, following
the general principles set forth in section 4.



Example 8





Situation: 

Two of the leading manufacturers of a consumer electronic product hold patents that cover alternative circuit designs
for the product. None of the patents is blocking; that is, each of the patents can be practiced without infringing a
patent owned by the other firm. The different circuit designs are economic substitutes. Each permits the manufacture
at similar cost of products that consumers consider to be interchangeable. The manufacturers assign their patents
to a separate corporation wholly owned by the two firms. That corporation licenses the right to use the circuit designs
to other consumer product manufacturers and establishes the license royalties.



Discussion: 

In this example, the manufacturers are horizontal competitors in the goods market for the consumer product and in
the related technology markets. The competitive issue with regard to a joint assignment of patent rights is whether
the assignment has an adverse impact on competition in technology and goods markets that is not outweighed by procompetitive
benefits in the use or dissemination of the technology. Each of the patent owners has a right to exclude others from
practicing its patent. That right does not extend, however, to the agreement to assign rights jointly. To the extent
that the patent rights cover technologies that are substitutes, the joint determination of royalties may result
in higher royalties and higher goods prices than the owners would have charged on their own. In the absence of evidence
establishing efficiencies from the joint assignment of patent rights, the Department may conclude that the joint
marketing of competing patent rights constitutes horizontal price fixing and could be challenged as a per se unlawful
horizontal restraint of trade. If there are plausible efficiency justifications for the joint marketing arrangement,
the Department would evaluate the arrangement under the rule of reason. However, the Department may conclude that
the anticompetitive effects are sufficiently apparent, and the proposed integrative efficiencies are sufficiently
weak or unrelated to the restraints, to require only a ``quick look'' rule of reason analysis (

see 

section 4.5).



5.2 Resale Price Maintenance



Resale price maintenance is illegal when ``commodities have passed into the channels of trade and are owned by dealers.''


Dr. Miles Medical Co. 

v.

 John D. Park & Sons Co.

, 220 U.S. 373 (1911). It has been held per se illegal for a licensor of an intellectual property right in a product to
fix a licensee's resale price of that product. 

United States 

v.

 Univis Lens Co.

, 316 U.S. 241, 243-45, 249-51 (1942); 

Ethyl Gasoline Corp. 

v.

 United States

, 309 U.S. 436, 446-48, 452, 457 (1940).
 Consistent with the principles set forth in section 3.4, the Department will enforce the per se rule against resale
price maintenance in the intellectual property context.





5.3 Tying Arrangements



A transaction is said to involve tying if: (1) There are two separate products, and (2) the sale of one product is conditioned
on the purchase of the other. Thus, conditioning the ability of a customer to license one or more items of intellectual
property on the customer's purchase of another item of intellectual property or a good or service has been held to constitute
illegal tying. 

See, e.g., United States 

v.

 Paramount Pictures, Inc.

, 334 U.S. 131, 156-58 (1948) (copyrights); 

International Salt Co. 

v.

 United States

, 332 U.S. 392 (1947) (patents). Tying can, however, be efficiency-enhancing under some circumstances. 

See, e.g., Jerrold Electronics Corp. 

v.

 Westcoast Broadcasting Co.

, 341 F.2d 653 (9th Cir.), 

cert. denied

, 382 U.S. 817 (1965). The Department would be likely to challenge a tying arrangement if: (1) The seller has sufficient
economic power in the market for the tying product to enable it to restrain trade in the market for the tied product,
(2) the arrangement has an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market for the tied product, and (3) efficiency
justifications for the arrangement do not outweigh the anticompetitive effect.
 The Department will not presume market power solely from the existence of a patent or other intellectual property
right.







Package licensing_the licensing of multiple items of intellectual property in a single license or in a group of related
licenses_may be a form of tying arrangement, but only if the items licensed constitute ``separate products'' and
the licensing of one product is used to force the acceptance of a license of another. Such practices can be efficiency
enhancing under some circumstances. When multiple licenses are needed to practice any single item of intellectual
property, for example, a package license may present such efficiencies. If a package license constitutes a tying
arrangement, the Department will evaluate its competitive effects under the same principles it applies to other
tying arrangements.

5.4 Exclusive dealing


In the intellectual property context, exclusive dealing occurs when a license prevents the licensee from licensing,
selling, distributing, or using a competing technology. Although such restraints can be procompetitive in some
circumstances, in other situations they can deny rivals sufficient outlets for competitively viable exploitation
of their technologies and thus can be anticompetitive. See section 4.3.2.


5.5 Cross-Licensing and Pooling Arrangements


Cross-licensing and pooling arrangements are agreements of two or more owners of different items of intellectual
property to license one another or third parties. These arrangements may promote economic welfare by integrating
complementary technologies, reducing transactions costs, clearing blocking positions, and avoiding costly infringement
litigation. By promoting the dissemination of technology, cross-licensing and pooling arrangements are often
procompetitive.
Cross-licensing and pooling arrangements can have anticompetitive effects in certain circumstances. When these
arrangements are a mechanism to accomplish price fixing, or market or customer allocation, they can lead to a significant
lessening of competition. 

See United States 

v. 

New Wrinkle, Inc., 

342 U.S. 371 (1952) (price fixing); 

United States 

v. 

United States Gypsum Co., 

333 U.S. 364 (1948) (customer allocation). The joint marketing of pooled intellectual property rights, with collective
price setting or coordinated output restrictions, may violate section 1 of the Sherman Act. 

Compare NCAA

 v. 

Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma,

 468 U.S. 85 (1984) (output restriction on college football broadcasting held unlawful because it was not reasonably
related to any purported justification) 

with Broadcast Music, Inc. 

v. 

CBS,

 441 U.S. 1 (1979) (blanket license for music copyrights upheld because the cooperative price was found necessary
to the creation of a new product).
Settlements involving the cross-licensing of intellectual property rights can be an efficient means to avoid litigation
over infringement and interference proceedings, and, in general, courts favor such settlements. When such cross-licensing
involves horizontal competitors, however, the Department will consider whether the effect of the settlement is
to diminish rivalry that would otherwise have occurred. In the absence of offsetting efficiencies, such settlements
may be challenged as unlawful restraints of trade. 

Cf. United States 

v. 

Singer Manufacturing Co.,

 374 U.S. 174 (1963) (cross-license agreement was part of broader combination to exclude competitors).
Pooling arrangements and the like generally need not be open to all who would like to join. Cross-licensing and pooling
arrangements among parties that collectively possess market power may, under some circumstances, harm competitions
by significantly disadvantaging competitors. 

Cf Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc 

v. 

Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 

472 U.S. 284 (1985) (exclusion of a competitor from a purchasing cooperative not unlawful absent a showing of market
power).
Another possible anticompetitive effect of pooling arrangements may occur when participation in the arrangement
deters or discourages participants from engaging in research and developing, thus retarding innovation. A pooling
arrangement in which members grant licenses to each other for current and future technology at minimal cost may encourage
free-riding and reduce the incentives of its members to compete in their research and development efforts. 

See generally United States 

v. Automobile Manufacturers Association, 307 F. Supp. 617 (C.D. Cal 1969), 

modified sub nom. United States 

v. 

Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, 

1982-83 Trade Cas. (CCH)   65,088 (C.D. Cal 1982); 

United States 

v. 

Manufacturers Aircraft Association

, 1976-1 

Trade Cas

. (CCH)   60,810 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). Such an arrangement is more likely to cause competitive problems where the
arrangement includes a large fraction of the potential participants in research and development.


Example 9


Situation: As in Example 8, two of the leading manufacturers of a consumer electronic product hold patents that cover
alternative circuit designs for the product. The manufactures assign several of their patents to a separate corporation
wholly owned by the two firms. That corporation licenses the right to use the circuit designs to other consumer product
manufacturers and establishes the license royalties. In this example, however, the manufacturers assign to the
separate corporation only patents that are blocking. None of the patents assigned to the corporation can be practiced
without infringing a patent owned by the other firm.


Discussion: 

Unlike the previous example, the joint assignment of patent rights to the wholly owned corporation in this example
can have procompetitive benefits in the use of dissemination of the technology. Because the manufacturer's patents
are blocking, the manufacturers are not in a horizontal relationship with respect to those patents. Neither patent
can be practiced without the right to a patent owned by the other firm, so the patents are not economic substitutes.
(The pooling of patents also would not raise competitive problems in the relevant technology market if the pool involved
complementary patents and enabled licensing of a package whose value exceeded the sum of its component patents.)
As in Example 8, the firms are horizontal competitors in the relevant goods market. In the absence of evidence suggesting
that the joint assignment of patent rights is also contributing to coordinated pricing of the firms' final products,
the Department would be unlikely to challenge this arrangement.


5.6 Grantbacks


A grantback is an arrangement under which a licensee agrees to extend to the licenser of intellectual property the
right to use the licensee's improvements to the licensed technology. Grantbacks can have procompetitive effects,
such as providing a means for the licensee and the licensor to share risks and rewarding the licensor for making possible
further innovation based on or informed by the licensed technology. Such arrangements can both promote innovation
in the first place and promote the subsequent licensing of the results of the innovation.
Grantbacks may adversely affect competition, however, if they substantially reduce the licensee's incentives
to engage in research and development and limit rivalry in innovation markets. In deciding whether to challenge a
grantback, the Department will consider the extent to which, as compared with no license at all, the license with the
grantback provision may diminish total research and development investment or lessen competition in innovation
or technology markets.

5.7 Acquisition of Intellectual Property Rights



The legality of transactions resulting in an actual or effective acquisition of intellectual property rights is
analyzed under section 7 of the Clayton Act and sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. 

SCM Corp.

 v. 

Xerox Corp., 

645 F.2d 1195, 1210 (2d Cir. 1981) (patents); 

United States

 v. 

Columbia Pictures Corp., 

189 F. Supp. 153, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 1960) (copyrights). The Department will analyze such transactions as acquisitions
of assets just as it does other asset acquisitions. When a license is non-exclusive, the exclusivity is temporary,
or the acquisition is otherwise structured to allow the parties freedom to compete independently in related products,
the Department will take these aspects of the arrangement into account, as it does in the case of other asset acquisitions
and joint ventures.

With respect to horizontal acquisitions, the Department will apply the analysis contained in the 1992 Horizontal
Merger Guidelines. The Department will evaluate the effects of an acquisition of intellectual property in affected
technology, innovation, and goods markets. As described in section 4 of the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines, the
Department takes into account integrative efficiencies that could not reasonably be achieved without the acquisition
as well as any anticompetitive effects of the acquisition from the lessening of competition among existing technologies
or goods or from the lessening of competition to develop new technologies.



Example 10





Situation: 

Omega develops a new, patented pharmaceutical for the treatment of a particular disease. The only drug on the market
approved for the treatment of this disease is sold by Zeta, which has invested large sums in advertising to achieve
brand name recognition. Omega's patented drug has almost completed regulatory approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
Omega has invested considerable sums in testing market acceptance for its new drug. However, rather than enter the
market as a direct competitor of Zeta, Omega licenses to Zeta the exclusive right to manufacture and sell Omega's patented
drug.



Discussion: 

Assuming that Zeta would manufacture and sell Omega's patented drug, the relationship of Omega and Zeta is in part
vertical, because Zeta would be a customer of Omega in the technology market. However, their relationship is also
horizontal in part, because Omega is a likely potential competitor of Zeta in the relevant goods market as well as in
the relevant technology market. Although the vertical aspects of this arrangement pose no threat to competition
in this example, the horizontal aspects would require further analysis. The Department would evaluate Zeta's acquisition
of Omega's patent rights as an acquisition of the assets of a likely potential competitor, using the methodology described
in the Department's merger guidelines. The Department would consider the impact of the acquisition on market concentration,
other factors that affect the likelihood that competition would be affected by the acquisition, and possible efficiency
defenses. In this example, Zeta's market position prior to the acquisition as the only seller of a drug treatment of
this disease makes it more likely that the acquisition would have anticompetitive effects.



6. Enforcement of Invalid Intellectual Property Rights



The Department may challenge the enforcement of invalid intellectual property rights as antitrust violations.
The Supreme Court has held that enforcement of a patent obtained by fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office can violate
section 2 of the Sherman Act if all the elements otherwise necessary to establish a section 2 monopolization charge
are proved. 

Walker Process Equipment, Inc. 

v. 

Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 

382 U.S. 172 (1965). Enforcement of a patent obtained by mere inequitable conduct before the Patent and Trademark
Office, however, cannot be the basis of a section 2 claim, because inequitable conduct does not involve knowing and
willful patent fraud. 

Argus Chemical Corp. 

v. 

Fibre Glass-Evercoat Co., 

812 F.2d 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1987). An objectively baseless infringement action, brought in bad faith, when the complainant
knows the intellectual property right to be invalid, may violate section 2 of the Sherman Act. 

See Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. 

v. 

Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 

113 S. Ct. 1920, 1928 (1993); 

Handgards, Inc. 

v. 

Ethicon, Inc., 

743 F.2d 1282, 1288-89 (9th Cir. 1984).

<USDEPT>RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Proposed Changes to Systems of Records</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Railroad Retirement Board.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed change to systems of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of this document is to give notice of a proposed routine use in one system of records and a modification of
an existing routine use in another.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The modification of an existing routine use (``n'' in RRB-20) would authorize the RRB to disclose to an insurance
company administering a health and welfare plan for railroad workers information regarding Medicare eligibility.
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 made substantial changes to the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) provisions.
One change made Medicare the primary payer of benefits for disabled Medicare beneficiaries who do not have a current
employment status with an employer. Previously, the private employer plan was the primary payer. Employers are required
to notify the Medicare contractor of the name, date of birth, sex, social security number, and health insurance claim
number of each Medicare beneficiary covered under the private plan who does not have a current employment status so
that the carrier's records are annotated to show Medicare is the primary payer. To comply with the law an employer needs
to know whether disabled employees are eligible under Medicare. For railroad employees, the Railroad Retirement
Board is the best source for this information. The existing routine use permits disclosure of Medicare status to an
employer, but only for the purpose of determining entitlement to benefits under the private plan. The modification
would authorize the RRB to furnish Medicare status to the insurance company acting as agent of the employer for the
purpose of enabling the employer to comply with the new provisions of the law.





The Railroad Retirement Board has determined that this proposed routine use meets the compatibility requirement
because it is a necessary and proper use.

The proposed routine use (``ee'' for RRB-21) would authorize the RRB to disclose to an insurance company administering
a medical insurance program for railroad workers non-medical information relating to determinations of sickness
benefits by the RRB for purposes of determining entitlement to payment or reimbursement of medical expenses under
the program. Presently, under certain circumstances, the insurance company cannot determine from the medical bills
submitted for reimbursement or current data available to it whether a railroad worker remains disabled. In these
cases, the insurance company requires the employee to furnish proof of disability. This usually requires the employee
to have a form completed by the treating physician, which causes a delay in reimbursement and often additional cost
to the employee. When the plan calls for direct payment by the insurance company, the inability of the insurance company
or its agent to determine entitlement in such cases results in a delay and an inconvenience to the railroad worker.
Disclosure of the information as proposed in this routine use would eliminate these problems for the affected railroad
workers.

The Railroad Retirement Board has determined that this proposed routine use meets the compatibility requirement
because it is a necessary and proper use.




By authority of the Board.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Real
Estate Investment Trusts (``REITs'') Portfolio Market Index Target-Term Securities.</DOCTITLE>



August 5, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on July 15, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to list for trading Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS''),
 the return on which is based upon a portfolio (``REIT Portfolio'') of securities of U.S. Real estate investment trusts
(``REITs''). Initially, the REIT Portfolio will contain the securities of 20 REITs that are traded in the United States
on the NYSE or on the American Stock Exchange (``Amex'').
 






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NYSE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Pursuant to the listing criteria set forth in Section 703.19 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''),
the Exchange proposes to list for trading MITTS on the REIT Portfolio (``REIT Portfolio MITTS'') issued by Merrill
Lynch. MITTS are securities that entitle the holder to receive from the issuer upon maturity an amount based upon the
change in the market value of a stock index or portfolio, provided that a minimum amount (90% of the principal amount)
will be repaid.

REIT Portfolio MITTS will allow investors to combine protection of a substantial portion of the principal amount
of the MITTS with potential additional payments based on a portfolio of securities of selected REITs and the dividend
stream related to the components of that portfolio. The REIT Portfolio MITTS will provide that at least 90% of the principal
amount thereof will be repaid at maturity.



The Security



REIT Portfolio MITTS will entitle the owner at maturity to receive an amount in cash based upon the ``Total Return Portfolio
Value;'' provided, however, that the amount payable at maturity will not be less than $9 for each $10 principal amount
of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. The ``Total Return Portfolio Value'' will be an amount based upon the change in the ``Original
Portfolio Value'' and the value of the REIT Portfolio at maturity, plus the aggregate dollar amount of dividends paid
on the components of the REIT Portfolio after the issuance of the REIT Portfolio MITTS and prior to maturity. The Original
Portfolio Value will equal $10, 

i.e.

, the value of the REIT Portfolio on the date the REIT Portfolio MITTS are priced by the issuer for initial offering to
the public. The value of the REIT Portfolio at maturity will be based on the average of the closing prices for the components
of the REIT Portfolio for a specified number of days immediately prior to maturity date of the REIT Portfolio MITTS.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940811-2-00121 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940811-2-00075 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If the market value of the REIT Portfolio plus the cumulative value of the dividends paid on the component REITs has
declined below the Original Portfolio Value, the holder will receive not less than a specified percentage of the principal
amount of the security. For example, if the Total Return Portfolio Value has declined more than 10% below the Original
Portfolio Value, the owners of the REIT Portfolio MITTS will receive 90% of the principal amount of the securities.
The payment at maturity is based on changes in the value of the REIT Portfolio and the payment of dividends on the securities
that comprise the REIT Portfolio.

As with other MITTS, REIT Portfolio MITTS may not be redeemed prior to maturity and are not callable by the issuer.
 Owners may sell the security on the Exchange. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security in the
secondary market will depend in large part on the value of the REIT Portfolio and also on other factors, including dividend
rates, the levels of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the REIT Portfolio, the time remaining to maturity,
and the creditworthiness of the issuer, Merrill Lynch.




The Exchange will only list for trading this issue of REIT Portfolio MITTS if there are at least one million outstanding
securities, at least 400 holders, a minimum life of one year, a market value of at least $4 million, and the issue is in
compliance with the Exchange's initial listing criteria. In addition, the Exchange will monitor the issue to verify
that it complies with the Exchange's continued listing criteria.






Merrill Lynch will deposit registered securities representing REIT Portfolio MITTS with a depository, The Depository
Trust Company (``DTC''), so as to permit book-entry settlement of transactions by participants in DTC.


The Portfolio



The REIT Portfolio consists of the common stock of 20 highly capitalized REITs. As of June 6, 1994, the market capitalizations
(

i.e.,

 the market price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding) of the 20 companies range from a high of $2.3 billion
to a low of $216 million. Also on that date, the market prices of their common stocks ranged from a high of $40.25 to a low
of $11.25.

The common stocks of 19 of the 20 component REITs are listed on the Exchange. The common stock of the other component
REIT is traded on the Amex. The initial weighings of the components of the REIT Portfolio will be based upon that stock's
relative liquidity (

i.e., 

relative trading volume in dollars) in the United States.

To determine relative liquidity, Merrill Lynch will compare the average daily consolidated dollar volume of the
stock over the 90 day period immediately preceding the date on which the REIT Portfolio MITTS are priced for issuance
to the average daily consolidated dollar volume for all of the stocks in the REIT Portfolio for that 90 day period. As
of June 6, 1994, the highest weighting for any stock in the REIT Portfolio was 10.22% and the weighting for the five components
with the highest relative liquidity was 42.64%. Also as of that date, the lowest weighting for any stock in the REIT
Portfolio was 1.58% and the weighting for the five components with the lowest relative liquidity was 9.88%.


Except for certain multiplier adjustments discussed below, once the initial weighings have been determined, the
multipliers will remain constant throughout the term of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. The value of the REIT Portfolio
MITTS at any point in time will equal the aggregate for the components of the price of each component times the multiplier
for that component plus the cumulative dividends paid on that component since issue date for the REIT Portfolio MITTS.
The multipliers assigned to the component REITs will be adjusted for certain events such as stock splits, reverse
stock splits, or stock dividends, and the value of the common stock of the component REITs will also be adjusted for
certain events including a liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, merger, or consolidation involving the issuer
of the underlying shares. For example, if the issuer of the shares underlying a component REIT has been subject to a
merger or a consolidation and is not the surviving entity, then a value for such common stock will be determined at the
time such issuer is merged or consolidated and will equal the last available market price for such common stock and
that value will be constant for the remaining term of the REIT Portfolio MITTS.





Based upon the reported prices of the common stock of the component REITs, an independent third party will calculate
and disseminate the value of the REIT Portfolio no less frequently than once every minute through the trading day.


The Issuer



The Exchange has determined that the issuer of the REIT Portfolio MITTS, Merrill Lynch, meets the listing criteria
set forth in Section 703.19 of the Manual. The Exchange states that Merrill Lynch is an Exchange-listed company in
good standing and has sufficient assets to justify the issuance of MITTS offerings of the size contemplated by the
proposed rule change.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with Section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market
and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

<DOCTITLE>The Bank of New York; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



August 5, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







Applicant: 

The Bank of New York.




Relevant Act Sections: 

Conditional order requested under section 6(c) for an exemption from the provisions of section 26(a)(2)(D).




Summary of Application: 

Applicant seeks a conditional order that would permit applicant to deposit foreign securities, held by unit investment
trusts for which it serves as trustee, with the securities clearance and depository facilities operated by Morgan
Guaranty Trust Company of New York (``Morgan Guaranty'') in Brussels, Belgium in its capacity as operator of the Euroclear
System (``Euroclear''), or with Central de Livraison de Valeurs Mobilieres, S.A. (``CEDEL''). Euroclear and CEDEL
are sometimes referred to as the ``Transnational Agencies.''




Filing Dates: 

The application was filed on June 15, 1994.




Hearing or Notification of Hearing: 

An order granting the application will be issued unless the SEC orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a
hearing by writing to the SEC's Secretary and serving applicant with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing
requests should be received by the SEC by 5:30 p.m. on August 30, 1994, and should be accompanied by proof of service
on the applicant, in the form of an affidavit or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Hearing requests should state
the nature of the writer's interest, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified
of a hearing may request notification by writing to the SEC's Secretary.



</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant is a trust company incorporated and doing business under the laws of the State of New York. 
Applicant meets the qualifications of section 26(a)(1) of the Act for a trustee or custodian of a unit investment trust.
Applicant currently serves as trustee of various unit investment trusts sponsored or co-sponsored by, among others,
Van Kampen Merritt; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated; Nike Securities L.P.; Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.; Quest For Value; Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.; and Unison Investment Trusts Ltd. and may in the future act as trustee
of trusts sponsored by these and other sponsors. Under each trust indenture, and as required by the Act, applicant
has responsibility for the custody of the securities held in the trust.

2. Various sponsors of trusts for which applicant acts as trustee have created, or have expressed an interest in creating,
trusts whose investment objectives contemplate investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies and
in foreign securities. Foreign securities, especially securities issued in the European market, are issued generally
in bearer form. With the growth of the European securities markets, the problems with bearer instruments entailed
by the necessity for presentment of certificates or coupons for payment of principal of or interest on the securities
have led to the increased importance of a book-entry system to speed clearance of trades and collection of principal
and interest payments.

3. Euroclear and CEDEL are the largest clearance and custody systems of internationally traded securities in the
world. They were organized principally to provide a simple, economic and automated means of settling secondary market
transactions in internationally traded securities regardless of the geographical location of the parties to the
transaction. The branch of Morgan Guaranty in Brussels, Belgium operates Euroclear, and is subject to regulation
by the New York and federal banking authorities and the Belgian Banking Commission. Belgian law governs Morgan Guaranty's
liability as custodian and operator of Euroclear under the contract between Euroclear and each participating entity.
CEDEL was founded as a limited company under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. CEDEL is headquartered in Luxembourg
and has representative offices in London, Tokyo, New York, and Hong Kong. CEDEL operates under the supervision of
the Institute Monetaire Luxembourgeois, the Luxembourg Monetary Authority, which is also the banking control authority.

4. Applicant believes that securities deposited in Euroclear or CEDEL are at least as effectively protected as the
same securities would be if directly deposited with a foreign branch of a United States bank, or shipped to the United
States for custody, for several reasons, including:

(a) the insurance coverage for Euroclear and CEDEL depositaries and their outstanding loss records;

(b) the expertise and experience of the banks holding securities for Euroclear or CEDEL;

(c) the efficiencies resulting from handling large quantities of the same issue;

(d) the excellent track records of Euroclear and CEDEL;

(e) the close scrutiny of Euroclear and CEDEL services resulting from the market's dependence upon (and hence concern
for) these services and the oversight of the depositaries; and

(f) the depositary agreements pursuant to which securities are held by Euroclear and CEDEL depositaries, which impose
high standards of care on the depositaries.

<PARENT> FR940811-2-00076 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

5. Applicant believes that the exposure to certain custodial risks is reduced when securities are held through Euroclear
or CEDEL, rather than directly by a United States bank branch, since securities held in Euroclear or CEDEL do not have
to be transported for deposit outside these systems to effect sale. Furthermore, holding foreign securities outside
of Euroclear and CEDEL would give rise to substantially higher costs and probably would involve other significant
problems.


Applicant's Legal Analysis


1. Section 26(a)(1) provides that a unit investment trust must be governed by a trust indenture that designates one
or more trustees or custodians, each of which is a bank, and section 26(a)(2)(D) requires that the trust indenture
provide that the trustee or custodian have possession of all securities and other property in which the funds of the
trust are invested.
2. Euroclear and CEDEL do not qualify under the Act as custodians for unit investment trust assets. The term ``bank''
is defined in section 2(a)(5) as a banking institution organized under the laws of the United States, a member bank
of the Federal Reserve System, and any other banking institution or trust company doing business under the laws of
any state or the United States that receives deposits or exercises fiduciary powers. The SEC has stated that an overseas
branch of a domestic bank is the only facility located outside the United States that qualifies as a custodian under
section 26. 

See

 Exemption for Custody of Investment Company Assets Outside the United States, Investment Company Act Release No.
13724 (Jan. 17, 1984). The SEC also has indicated that a foreign-incorporated subsidiary does not meet this definition.


See

 International Resources Funds, Inc., Investment Company Act Release No. 2874 (May 4, 1959). Accordingly, neither
Euroclear nor CEDEL meets the definition of a bank under the Act, and, as a result, neither qualifies as a custodian.
3. Section 6(c) provides in relevant part that the SEC, by order upon application, may exempt any transactions from
any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicant believes
that the requested relief satisfies the section 6(c) standard.
4. Rule 17f-5 permits a registered management investment company to hold foreign securities in foreign security
depositories or clearing agencies such as Euroclear or CEDEL, subject to certain provisions. Rule 17f-5 permits
investment companies to place and maintain foreign securities, as defined in the rule, with certain foreign custodians,
provided that a majority of the board of directors, (a) determines that maintaining the company's assets in a particular
country is consistent with the best interests of the company and its shareholders, (b) determines that maintaining
the company's assets with a particular foreign custodian is consistent with the best interests of the company and
its shareholders, and (c) approves, as consistent with the best interests of the company and its shareholders, a written
contract that will govern the manner in which such custodian will maintain the company's assets. The directors also
must establish a system to monitor these arrangements and annually review and approve the continuance of these arrangements.
Both Euroclear and CEDEL qualify as foreign custodians under rule 17f-5. There, however, is no rule analogous
to rule 17f-5 applicable to the safekeeping of the assets of a unit investment trust when those assets are held
outside of the United States.
5. Applicant proposes to provide to a trust custody services that would permit the foreign securities of the trust
to be held abroad in the custody of Euroclear or CEDEL. These arrangements will be in total agreement with those applicable
to registered management investment companies as contemplated by rule 17f-5, except that (a) certain duties
and responsibilities of the directors of such companies will be performed by applicant as trustee, (b) applicant
will provide indemnification to the unit holders, and (c) only Euroclear and CEDEL will qualify as foreign custodians
for the trusts.
6. Applicant views the deposit of trust assets with Euroclear and CEDEL to be consistent with the purposes of section
26. Euroclear and CEDEL are the largest clearance and custody systems of internationally traded securities. Their
insurance coverage, governing terms and conditions, and the high calibre of their depositories provide trust and
unit holders with a great degree of security.


Applicant's Conditions


Applicant agrees that the exemptive order requested herein will be subject to the following conditions:
1. Applicant will comply with the provisions of Rule 17f-5 under the Act as if each trust was a registered investment
company and applicant was its board of directors; except that Euroclear and CEDEL shall be the only qualified ``eligible
foreign custodians'' for the trusts.
2. Applicant will indemnify and hold each of the trusts harmless from and against any loss that shall occur as the result
of the failure of a Transnational Agency holding the foreign securities of a trust to exercise reasonable care with
respect to the safekeeping of such foreign securities to the same extent that applicant would be required to indemnify
and hold a trust harmless if applicant were holding such foreign securities in the jurisdiction of the United States
whose laws govern the relevant trust indenture; provided, however, that applicant shall not be liable for loss except
by reason of the gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct of applicant or a Transnational Agency.
3. Applicant will assure that the sponsors of each of the trusts agree that the potential exposure of loss to unit holders
resulting from the use of a Transnational Agency will be disclosed, if material, in the prospectus relating to the
relevant trust.
4. Applicant will maintain and keep current written records regarding the basis for choice or continued use of a particular
Transnational Agency, and such records will be available for inspection at applicant's offices at all reasonable
times during its usual business hours by unit holders and the SEC.

Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company that was organized as a corporation under the laws of Maryland.
On November 3, 1980, applicant registered under the Act as an investment company, and filed a registration statement
to register shares of its Money Market Portfolio under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was
declared effective on February 12, 1981, and the initial public offering commenced on or about that date. On February
22, 1982, post-effective amendment No. 3 to applicant's registration statement became effective and public offering
of applicant's Government Securities Portfolio began on or about that date. On April 30, 1991, applicant issued to
the holders of shares of its Money Market Portfolio shares of its Government Securities Portfolio with an equivalent
net asset value. At such time, all assets and liabilities of the Money Market Portfolio became assets and liabilities
of the Government Securities Portfolio. Since that time the Government Securities Portfolio has been applicant's
only portfolio.

2. On December 14, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved an agreement and plan of reorganization (the ``Plan'')
between applicant and Zweig Cash Fund, a series of Zweig Series Trust (the ``Trust''), a registered open-end management
investment company.






3. On March 11, 1994, applicant distributed proxy materials to its shareholders. At a meeting on April 28, 1994, applicant's
shareholders approved the reorganization. 

4. Pursuant to the Plan, on April 29, 1994, applicant transferred all of its assets to the Trust in exchange for Class
M shares of Zweig Cash Fund. Applicant then distributed the shares of Zweig Cash Fund to its shareholders. After completion
of the reorganization, each shareholder of applicant owned Class M shares of Zweig Cash Fund with the same aggregate
net asset value as the shares of applicant owned by the shareholder immediately prior to the reorganization. On April
29, 1994, applicant had 92,292,699.36 shares outstanding, having an aggregate net asset value of $92,292,699.36
and a per share net asset value of $1.00.

5. Applicant's adviser, Zweig/Glaser Advisers, assumed all expenses in connection with the reorganization. Expenses
totalled approximately $88,000. 

6. There are no securityholders to whom distributions in complete liquidation of their interests have not been made.
Applicant has no debts or other liabilities that remain outstanding. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or
administrative proceeding.

7. Applicant will file certificates of dissolution with Maryland authorities after the requested order is obtained.

8. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding up of its affairs.

U.S.-Argentina All-Cargo Frequencies 



Summary 


By this notice, we invite interested U.S. carriers to apply for allocation of the available frequencies for scheduled
all-cargo operations in the U.S.-Argentina market during the period July 1, 1994 through December 1, 1996. 


Background 


Under the existing air services agreement between the United States and Argentina, U.S. carriers may operate a total
of eight weekly frequencies for U.S.-Argentina all-cargo services. (Annex II of the 1985 U.S.-Argentina Air Transport
Services Agreement (Agreement).) These frequencies are currently allocated to Federal Express (five weekly flights);
Arrow Air (two weekly flights); and Florida West Airlines (one weekly flight). 
On July 19, 1994, delegations of the United States and Argentina signed a Memorandum of Consultations (MOC) which,
in part, amends Annex II of the Agreement to expand the number of all-cargo frequencies available for scheduled U.S.
air carrier services. Specifically, the MOC provides that designated carriers of the U.S. may operate round trip
all-cargo frequencies with narrow-body equipment or their wide-body equivalents as follows: From July 1, 1994 until
September 30, 1995, a total of 10 weekly frequencies; from October 1, 1995 until November 30, 1996, a total of 11 weekly
frequencies; and beginning December 1, 1996, a total of 12 weekly frequencies.

1

 Thus, in a progressive fashion, the total number of narrow-body frequencies that U.S. carriers may operate from July
1, 1994-December 1, 1996, will increase from eight to twelve weekly flights.

2

 





Applications 


Given the provisions of the July MOC, we invite all U.S. carriers interested in using the available frequencies to
file their applications with the Department in Docket 49707.

3

 




Applications should include, at a minimum, the following information: (a) The number of weekly frequencies requested;
(b) markets to be served (as well as the overall single-plane routing for the proposed operations); (c) frequencies
per market and period of service in each market; (d) existing authority held to conduct the operations, if applicable;

4

 (e) the aircraft to be used in each market and a statement of the number of frequencies required per aircraft type; and
(f) proposed startup date. 




Applicant carriers that have previously been allocated frequencies and operated flights during the past two years
should also provide the following information with respect to those operations: (a) The number of flights previously
allocated per year; (b) markets served and periods for each; (c) frequencies operated per market and period of service
for each market; (d) aircraft type per market; and (e) manner of operation (nonstop, one-stop, two-stop, etc.) and
routing of operations.

5

 




Applicants are also free to submit any additional information that they believe will help us in making our decision.

An original and 12 copies of each application should be filed with the Department's Docket Section, Room 4107, 400
Seventh Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590, in Docket 49707 and should be served on all parties on the attached list.



Procedural Schedule 


Two of the additional frequencies are available now. In these circumstances, it is important that we complete the
allocation process as quickly as possible. Therefore, we will require that applications and responsive pleadings
be filed in accordance with the following schedule: 
Applications and Motions to Consolidate: August 15, 1994. 
Answers: August 22, 1994. 
Replies: August 29, 1994. 
We will serve this notice upon all U.S. air carriers licensed to conduct scheduled foreign all-cargo services with
large aircraft. We will also publish the Notice in the 

Federal Register

Criteria for Use of Blue ``Star of Life'' for Emergency Medical Services 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice amends NHTSA's guidelines for the authorized use of the blue ``Star of Life'' symbol for emergency medical
services. Comments received in response to an earlier notice suggested uses for this symbol that were not considered
when these guidelines were first developed. These amendments are intended to provide additional flexibility to
the States within the purposes for which the blue Star of Life was originally registered as a certification mark. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

NHTSA's Authority 


The Secretary of Transportation approved the use of the blue ``Star of Life'' as a symbol for the Department's Emergency
Medical Services program in a memorandum dated November 18, 1976. On February 1, 1977, the Commissioner of Patents
and Trademarks issued to NHTSA a certificate of registration for the blue ``Star of Life'' symbol as a certification
mark. 
This registration gives NHTSA exclusive legal authority to control the use of the mark throughout the United States,
and remains in effect for 20 years. It may be renewed for an additional 10 years in accordance with 15 U.S.C. section
1059. 


Current Guidelines 


In accordance with its registration as a certification mark, the blue ``Star of Life'' may be used on emergency medical
care vehicles to certify that they meet DOT standards, by emergency medical care personnel to certify that they are
trained to meet DOT standards, and on road maps and highway signs to indicate the location of or access to qualified
emergency medical care services. 
In a memorandum dated September 14, 1977, NHTSA authorized States and Federal agencies that are involved with emergency
medical services to permit use of the blue ``Star of Life'' certification mark in accordance with criteria and specifications
outlined in the memorandum.



Request for Modification of Guidelines 


In July 1992, a State requested an advisory opinion from NHTSA on the use of the blue ``Star of Life'' symbol in the State's
Emergency Medical Services-Do Not Resuscitate (EMS-DNR) program. The State proposed to use the mark to alert
State certified prehospital emergency medical care providers that a person wearing a bracelet which displays the
``Star of Life'' and the letters ``EMS-DNR'' does not wish to be resuscitated. NHTSA determined that this use
does not meet the criteria outlined in the memorandum dated September 14, 1977. Accordingly, NHTSA denied the State's
request to use the ``Star of Life'' in connection with the EMS-DNR program. 
In response to NHTSA's decision to deny the State's request, the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP),
the National Association of State Emergency Medical Services Directors (NASEMSD), and the American College of Emergency
Physicians (ACEP) contacted NHTSA to express their support for use of the blue ``Star of Life'' by the State's EMS-DNR
program. These organizations made four primary arguments in support of the proposed use of the ``Star of Life'' for
EMS-DNR purposes. 
First, they contended that the proposed use would provide EMS personnel with a consistent location where they could
look for EMS orders on terminally ill persons who desire not to undergo resuscitation. The organizations indicated
that they consider the proposed use appropriate because the DNR bracelet would alert EMS personnel of a medical condition
or appropriate medical treatment. 
Second, the organizations asserted that the ``Star of Life'' is a unique symbol widely recognized by EMS personnel,
which has come to symbolize the entire EMS system rather than the limited criteria in the September 1977 NHTSA memorandum.

Third, the organizations contended that since NHTSA has ``historically'' granted State EMS offices some discretionary
authority regarding use of the ``Star of Life,'' NHTSA should allow State EMS offices to determine the use of the ``Star
of Life'' on EMS-DNR bracelets within their respective States. 
Finally, at the time the guidelines were developed, the possibilities for the use of the ``Star of Life'' on a DNR bracelet
were not considered. The organizations urged NHTSA to reexamine the appropriate use of the symbol and either rescind
or reissue the guidelines to permit such use. 


Federal Register Notice Requesting Comments 


NHTSA continued to have concerns about expanding the authorized uses of the blue ``Star of Life.'' However, it also
recognized that the current guidelines for the authorized use of the blue ``Star of Life'' certification mark had
not been revised since their publication in September 1977. 
Accordingly, the agency decided that it was appropriate to reevaluate the guidelines in view of the current trends
and possible uses for the symbol and to examinate the symbol's purpose and whether it should be expanded at this time.

On August 3, 1993, NHTSA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 41316) announcing that it was considering whether to expand the purposes for which the blue ``Star of Life''
could be used and whether other changes to the guidelines for the authorized use of the symbol would be appropriate.

The notice requested comments from the public on whether the agency should authorize the use of the ``Star of Life''
symbol in EMS-DNR programs, including its use on personal items, such as bracelets or necklaces, to identify
individuals who are DNR candidates. The notice also requested comments on whether the agency should make other revisions
to its guidelines for the authorized use of the blue ``Star of Life.'' 


Comments Received 


Eighteen comments were received by the agency in response to the August 3 notice. Commenters included one Federal
agency (the U.S. Fire Administration), two national organizations (the American College of Emergency Physicians
and the National Association of State EMS Directors), one medical school, eight State EMS Directors, four regional
or local EMS officials and an interested individual. 
Each of the comments addressed the central issue concerning whether to permit the use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol
for DNR purposes. In addition, some comments made suggestions regarding other aspects of the criteria and specifications
that were outlined in 1977.



Use of ``Star of Life'' for Do Not Resuscitate Programs 


Of the eighteen comments received, only two States, two regional or local EMS officials and an interested individual
opposed the use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol for a DNR program. The Federal agency, the medical school, both national
organizations, six States and two regional or local EMS officials either supported or stated that they did not oppose
the use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol for DNR purposes. Many of these comments expressed strong support for the symbol's
use for these purposes. 
To assist the agency in deciding whether to permit the use of the ``Star of Life'' for this purpose, NHTSA requested
in its August 3, 1993 notice comments addressing a number of specific questions. These questions, and the comments
we received responding to them, are discussed below. 


1. State EMS-DNR Programs 


NHTSA requested that comments provide examples of State EMS programs that have developed or are developing EMS-DNR
identification programs and the identification symbols used in those programs. 
The comments reported that the States of California and Virginia have developed statewide DNR programs. Genesee
County, MI also reported that it has a DNR program. Virginia employs the ``Star of Life'' symbol; California employs
the Medic-Alert symbol; Genesee County uses a purple wrist identification bracelet. The States of Washington, Maine
and Maryland are all in the process of developing DNR programs. Each of these States indicated that it is interested
in or would strongly consider using the ``Star of Life'' for its DNR program. 


2. Confuse the Public 


NHTSA sought comments on whether the proposed use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol would confuse the general public.
In particular, the agency asked whether the use would likely confuse the public as to the identification and location
of qualified EMS personnel and equipment. 
Comments from California, San Diego, the Northern Mariana Islands and the Genesee County Medical Control authority
in Genesee County, MI predicted that use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR purposes would confuse the public. More specifically,
California stated, ``use of the `Star of Life' on DNR bracelets would likely confuse individuals as to the identification
of qualified EMS personnel.'' However, no evidence was cited for this prediction. 
Virginia (which uses the ``Star of Life'' symbol for its DNR program) reported that there have been no instances of
confusion. In addition, the State asserted its belief that it ``would be very unlikely that anyone would mistake the
patient with such a bracelet * * * for a qualified EMT,'' since patients who are eligible to wear such
bracelets have been diagnosed with a terminally ill condition. The U.S. Fire Administration, the National Association
of State EMS Directors and the State of New Jersey agreed with Virginia that use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol for DNR
programs is extremely unlikely to confuse the public. 


3. Difficulty with Identification. 


NHTSA requested that States with established EMS-DNR programs explain the difficulties, if any, that EMS personnel
are encountering with the identification symbols used for EMS-DNR candidates.

<TEXT>
 

Virginia (which uses the ``Star of Life'' symbol) and California and San Diego (which use the Medic-Alert symbol)
all reported that they were aware of no problems of identification or verification with the system they use. 



4. Benefits and Disadvantages 



NHTSA requested that comments discuss the benefits and disadvantages that are likely to result from using the ``Star
of Life'' to identify persons requesting a particular treatment or withholding of treatment by qualified EMS personnel.


California and San Diego commented that they saw no benefit to expanding the use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol regarding
the identification of patients who elect to execute DNR directives. In fact, California saw it simply as a training
issue. The State said EMTs could as easily be trained to identify DNR candidates using other symbols. 

California also asserted that use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR services would be contrary to NHTSA training programs,
which focus on the search for a Medic Alert bracelet to determine vital patient information. Comments from Virginia,
on the other hand, point out that the DOT National Standard 
Curricula provide for EMTs and others ``to check a patient's `Medic Alert' bracelet as part of the patient assessment


after

 initial resuscitative measures have been carried out.'' 

California is correct that the DOT National Standard Curricula advise EMTs and others to seek patient information
from medical identification items, such as ``Medic Alert'' bracelets. However, NHTSA disagrees that use of the ``Star
of Life'' for DNR purposes is contrary to this training. As explained in Virginia's comments, EMTs and others are trained
to seek patient information (as part of patient assessment) only after advanced directives (such as initial resuscitative
measures and other treatment and transportation protocols) are followed. The 1994 edition of the DOT National Standard

Curriculum for EMT-Basic makes clear the distinction between patient identification information and advanced
directives. The Curriculum also indicates that the use of advanced directives (such as DNR) is a State issue and informs
instructors to modify the curriculum to accommodate those 
advanced directives used in the State where the instruction is taking place. 

A few commenters expressed the concern that use of the symbol for a DNR program would either dilute or be entirely incompatible
with the original meaning of the ``Star of Life.'' Leo R. Schwartz, who was Chief of NHTSA's Emergency Medical Services
Division at the time the symbol was developed and 
registered as a certification mark with the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, argued that the mark was envisioned
as and should remain ``a symbol of life,'' not a ``barrier'' to care. He strongly objected to the use of the ``Star of
Life'' with an ``act of omission, with death as an end result.'' 

Others disagreed with these comments, and strongly supported expansion of the use of the symbol. A number of comments,
for example, recognized that the role of EMS has expanded since 1977, when the ``Star of Life'' was first 
registered as a certification mark, and asserted that the proposed expanded use of the symbol is not incompatible
(indeed it is appropriate) with current broader EMS missions. 

Other comments went further. The Department of Fire/Rescue Services, Frederick County, MD stated: 




The current request for an EMS-DNR program use is consistent with the direction of modern, managed health care,
where the patient may give advance directives for their level of treatment. This is going to be more apparent in the
health care reform recommendations that will be published in the near future.

 


Similar sentiments were expressed in comments from Dr. Nicholas Benson, East Carolina University School of Medicine:





As our nation becomes more involved with health care reform, one of the key issues to be resolved is which patients with
sudden cardiac death should be resuscitated and which should not * * * Physicians, including myself,
do 
not wish to make this determination alone; this is a decision that must include the express wishes of the patient, or
his/her legal guardian. The Prehospital Do Not Resuscitate programs across the nation seek to respond to this need
by predetermining which patients wish to be resuscitated and under what conditions. NHTSA's cornerstone contribution
to this should be the 
use of the Star of Life, because of its long-standing use as a symbol denoting professionalism and compassion in prehospital
care. 

As the profession of EMS has grown in the past 20 years, the implications of the use of the Star of Life have grown, as well.
It has become a universally recognized symbol of professionalism and expertise in emergency 
medical care. The use of the Star of Life in Prehospital Do Not Resuscitate programs is 100% consistent with this growth.





The benefit most often cited in support of using the ``Star of Life'' symbol for DNR purposes is the level of recognition
enjoyed by the symbol. The comments were uniform in their acknowledgement of how highly visible and widely recognized
the symbol has become. The U.S. Fire Administration commented that, ``EMS personnel are already trained to look for
these bracelets, and as such save valuable time in situations where time is a critical factor.'' Maine EMS stated,
``The decision to begin resuscitation must be rapidly made by EMS personnel if it is to [be] implemented successfully
* * * The Star of Life, alone or as part of a logo, is instantly recognized by EMS personnel * * *
The availability of this universal symbol will greatly assist in this purpose.'' 

The States of Washington and New Jersey could think of no disadvantages to using the ``Star of Life'' for a DNR program.




5. Competitive Effect 



NHTSA requested comments on the competitive effect of the proposed ``EMS-DNR'' bracelet/``Star of Life''
symbol on private organizations that offer services which alert EMS personnel to a patient's condition. We received
no comments alleging any adverse competitive effects. One State commented that, if there are any such adverse effects,
they will have to yield to the more important public interest in the use of symbols that are universally recognized.




6. Use of Symbol for Other Medical Conditions 



Comments were sought regarding whether the agency should authorize the use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol for services
or programs that would alert EMS personnel to other medical conditions of a patient, 

i.e.

, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure. 

Comments on this issue generally tracked the commenter's position on the use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR. Commenters
(such as Maryland) that favored use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR purposes, supported the symbol's use for diabetes,
heart disease, high blood pressure or other medical conditions. Commenters (such as San Diego) that did not favor
use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR purposes, opposed the symbol's use for these other purposes. 

The State of California, however, expressed a different view. While it opposed use of the ``Star of Life'' for DNR purposes,
it stated that 

if

 the symbol is approved for use in DNR programs, its use should also be approved for services and programs that will alert
EMS personnel to other medical 
conditions of the patient.

Change to Specifications for Use of Symbol 


Based on the weight of the comments received, NHTSA has 
decided to amend the specifications. As amended, States and 
Federal agencies with emergency medical services involvement 
are authorized to permit use of the ``Star of Life'' symbol to 
alert emergency care providers to medical conditions or to 
identify appropriate treatment. 
The States and Federal agencies then will have the 
authority to determine within their respective jurisdictions 
the medical conditions (

i.e., 

diabetes, heart disease, high 
blood pressure) and the treatments (

i.e.,

 DNR) they wish to 
include. The ``Star of Life'' would be used for these purposes, 
in accordance with programs established by the State or 
Federal agency. This decision is consistent with many of the 
comments that favored giving States some discretionary 
authority to determine the appropriate uses for the ``Star of 
Life'' within their borders. 


Other Issues Raised 


Many of the comments pointed out that the ``Star of Life'' 
is currently being used in ways that are not restricted to 
``certified'' vehicles and personnel. For example, they stated 
that the symbol is being used on patient care products, on 
personal items used by EMS personnel, and in logos of 
national, state and local EMS organizations. In addition, 
they alleged that many of the logos use formats that do not 
comply with the 1977 specifications. Some of the comments 
went so far as to question whether, as a result of such varied 
uses and formats, the ``Star of Life'' has become generic and 
lost its validity as a certification mark. 
The commenters who noted that the ``Star of Life'' symbol 
is being used in ways, other than on ``certified'' vehicles and 
personnel, are correct. These uses are appropriate, provided 
they fall within the scope of the Criteria for the Use of the 
``Star of Life'' Symbol. The criteria that were established in 
1977 provided for the symbol to be used not only on ambulances 
and to indicate the location of EMS personnel, but also ``to 
identify medical equipment and supplies for installation and 
use in . . . ambulances;'' ``on EMS personal items such as badges, 
lapel pins, plaques, buckles, names plates, etc.;'' ``on printed 
material having direct EMS application such as books, 
pamphlets, letterheads . . .'' and ``[by] entrepreneurs engaged in 
the production of goods or publication of printed material 
[having direct EMS application].'' As explained below, NHTSA 
has made some changes to these criteria in today's notice, but 
in general continues to support these related uses of the 
``Star of Life.'' 
There have been attempts to use the symbol for purposes 
that are not EMS-related (such as in connection with furniture 
or automobile repair businesses). When these inappropriate 
and unauthorized uses have come to NHTSA's attention, we have 
taken immediate steps to ensure that they do not continue. We 
strongly disagree that the symbol has become generic or lost 
its validity. 
The agency recognizes that the ``Star of Life'' is 
currently being used or has been incorporated into the logos 
of some EMS organizations using formats that do not comply 
strictly with the 1977 specifications. We have decided some 
additional flexibility in this area is warranted and have, 
therefore, changed this aspect of the 1977 specifications, as 
explained below. 
Some comments suggested that NHTSA, as well as State EMS 
Directors, should support additional programs aimed at 
educating the public about the meaning of the ``Star of Life'' 
symbol and when and how the symbol is to be used. The 
comments recommended also that efforts to supervise its proper 
use should be increased. 
NHTSA will continue to take steps against the 
inappropriate and unauthorized use of the ``Star of Life'' 
symbol of which it becomes aware. We encourage State EMS 
Directors, or others in the EMS field, to bring such uses to 
the agency's attention. We also encourage State EMS Directors 
to educate EMS personnel on the proper use of the symbol, and 
to educate the public in their respective States on matters 
such as how to recognize and when to look for the ``Star of 
Life.'' 
One commenter seemed to believe that, since NHTSA owns 
the certification mark to the ``Star of Life,'' the symbol may 
be used by NHTSA alone. We believe this comment reflects a 
misunderstanding of the nature of certification marks. 
Unlike a trade or service mark, which creates for the 
owner exclusive rights to use the registered symbol, a 
certification mark is owned by one person and used by others. 
Such a mark is to be used, for example, to certify quality or 
other origin. 
The ``Star of Life'' symbol was registered and is owned by 
NHTSA. NHTSA has authorized its use to certify compliance 
with certain standards (such as compliance by an ambulance 
with Federal Specifications or completion by EMS personnel of 
appropriate training courses). NHTSA has also authorized its 
use on goods employed or in connection with services performed 
as part of EMS systems, at the national, State or local level. 


Other Changes to Criteria and Specifications


NHTSA requested comments on whether the agency should 
make other revisions to the criteria and specifications t
