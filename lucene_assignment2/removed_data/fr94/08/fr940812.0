DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 


Agricultural Marketing Service










Processed Fruits and Vegetables, Processed Products Thereof, and Certain Other Processed Food Products Regulations
Governing Inspection and Certification 

 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final Rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises the Regulations Governing Inspection and Certification of Processed Fruits and Vegetables
and Certain Other Products

 by increasing the fees charged for inspection and by adding a section concerning cancellation of contracts. The revision
is necessary in order to recover, as nearly as practicable, the costs of performing inspection services under the
Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule has been determined significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has been reviewed
by OMB. 




This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 


The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has certified that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, P.L. 96-354
(5 U.S.C. 601). 


The final rule reflects fee increases needed to recover the costs of services rendered in accordance with the Agricultural
Marketing Act (AMA) of 1946. The inspection, grading and certification program for processed fruits and vegetables
and related products is voluntary. 


The AMA authorizes official inspection, grading, and certification on a user-fee basis, of processed food products
including processed fruits, vegetables, and processed products made from them. The AMA provides that reasonable
fees be collected from the user of the program services to cover as nearly as practicable the costs of services rendered.
This final rule amends the schedule of fees and charges for inspection, grading, and certification services to more
nearly reflect the costs currently associated with the program. The amendment includes the addition of the new Section
52.47 pertaining to charges when service is canceled or changed in order to manage the program in the most cost effective
manner. Former Section 52.47, which was removed, pertained to microbiological and other types of testing functions
which were transferred to the AMS Science Division.

AMS regularly reviews its programs to determine if fees are adequate. Employee salary and fringe benefits are major
program costs that account for approximately 85 percent of the total operating budget. Two salary increases for Federal
employees, a 3.7 percent pay increase effective January 10, 1993, and a locality pay increase, ranging from 3.09 to
6.52 percent depending upon locality, effective January 8, 1994, have materially affected program costs. Unemployment
insurance, FTS 2000 telecommunications, General Services Administration rent, and other administrative, supervisory,
and program costs have also increased. 


In addition, the Agricultural Appropriation Bill for fiscal year 1994 directed AMS to establish a user fee program
to recover the costs associated with agricultural commodities quality standards. In response, the service has implemented
cost-cutting actions (reorganization and/or downsizing of field offices and technical support services) which
reduced obligations by $569,175 from FY-92 to FY-93. Nonetheless, despite these measures, the Agency
has determined that due to the increases in program operating costs, an increase in fees is necessary to meet rising
costs and prevent financial losses. 


A notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 26762) on May 24, 1994 with a thirty day comment period. The comment period closed on June 24, 1994. Interested
persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal
to the Agricultural Marketing Service. No comments were received regarding this proposed rule. 


Pursuant to 5 USC 553, it is found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date until
thirty days after the publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) these programs have incurred a loss in fiscal year 1994; (2) this action should be made effective upon
publication in the 

Federal Register

 so that fees will reflect the costs of services rendered as soon as possible and; (3) interested persons were afforded
a thirty day comment period and no comments were received.

Oranges, Grapefruit, Tangerines, and Tangelos Grown in Florida; Expenses and Assessment Rate for 1994-95
Fiscal Year 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenses and establishes an assessment rate for the 1994-95 fiscal year
under Marketing Order No. 905. Authorization of this budget enables the Citrus Administrative Committee (Committee)
to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are
derived from assessments on handlers. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905, as amended [7 CFR Part 905],
regulating the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred
to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C.
601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida are subject to assessments.
It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable citrus fruit during the
1994-95 fiscal year, beginning August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This rule will not preempt any state or
local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 100 citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh oranges,
grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and approximately 10,200 producers of these fruits in Florida.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $5,000,000. A minority of these handlers and a majority of these producers may be classified as small
entities. 
This marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal
period shall apply to all assessable citrus fruit handled from the beginning of such period. An annual budget of expenses
and assessment rate is prepared by the Committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The Committee members
are handlers and producers of Florida citrus. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods,
services, and personnel in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budget
is formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate
and provide input. 
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing anticipated expenses by the expected cartons
(4/5 bushels) of fruit shipped. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which
will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The annual budget and assessment rate are
usually recommended by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis.
Therefore, budget and assessment rate approvals must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its
expenses. 
The Committee met June 21, 1994, and unanimously recommended expenses of $210,000 for the 1994-95 fiscal year,
with an assessment rate of $0.003 per 4/5 bushel carton of fresh fruit shipped. 
In comparison, 1993-94 budget expenses were $200,000 
with an approved assessment of $0.00285. This represents increases of $10,000 in expenses and of $0.00015 in the assessment
rate from the amounts recommended for the current fiscal year. 
The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 66,000,000 cartons of assessable fruit, will yield
a total of $198,000 in assessment income. Interest income for 1994-95 is estimated at $2,000. This, along with
$10,000 from the Committee's authorized reserve fund, will be adequate to cover additional expenses. Funds in the
reserve at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year, estimated at $125,000, will be within the maximum permitted by
the order of approximately one-half of one fiscal year's expenses.

Major expense categories for the current fiscal year include $98,300 for salaries, $36,000 for the Manifest department,
and $12,600 for insurance and bonds. 
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs would be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary
to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists
for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) this fiscal year begins on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
year apply to all assessable oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers
are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other
budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments
timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

Expenses and Assessment Rate for the 1994-95 Fiscal Year for the Marketing Order Covering Kiwifruit Grown in
California



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim final rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim final authorizes expenses and establishes an assessment rate for the Kiwifruit Administrative Committee
(Committee) under Marketing Order (M.O.) No. 920 for the 1994-95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget
enables the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer
this program are derived from assessments on handlers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 920 [7 CFR Part 920], as amended, regulating the handling
of kiwifruit grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the ``order''. The order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act''.




The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, California kiwifruit are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable California kiwifruit during the 1994-95 fiscal year
beginning August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 65 handlers of kiwifruit grown in California who are subject to regulation under the kiwifruit
marketing order and approximately 600 producers of kiwifruit in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers
have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than
$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000.
The majority of kiwifruit producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.
The kiwifruit marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular
fiscal year apply to all assessable kiwifruit handled from the beginning of such year. The budget of expenses for the
1994-95 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this
marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers of California
kiwifruit. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their
local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in
public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of kiwifruit. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce
sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The recommended budget and rate of assessment are usually
acted upon by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore,
the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its expenses.

The Committee met on June 15, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994-95 marketing order expenditures of $167,862
and an assessment rate of $0.01 per tray or tray equivalent of kiwifruit. In comparison, 1993-94 marketing year
budgeted expenditures were $156,150, which is $11,712 less than the $167,862 recommended for this fiscal year. The
assessment rate of $0.01 per tray or tray equivalent is the same as last year's assessment rate. The major budget category
for 1994-95 is $98,360 for administrative, staff and field salaries.

Assessment income for 1994-95 is estimated to total $110,000 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments
of 11 million trays or tray equivalents of kiwifruit. The assessment income will have to be augmented by $57,862 from
the Committee's reserves to provide adequate funds to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the end of the
1993-94 fiscal year are estimated to be $87,138. The reserve fund will be within the maximum permitted by the
order of one fiscal year's expenses.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available
information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the 1994-95 fiscal year begins August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable kiwifruit handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers are aware of this
action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting; and (4) this interim final rule provides
a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

Irish Potatoes Grown in Certain Designated Counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon; Expenses and Assessment
Rate 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 945
for the 1994-95 fiscal period. Authorization of this budget enables the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Potato Committee
(Committee) to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this
program are derived from assessments on handlers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 98 and Order No. 945, both as amended (7 CFR part 945), regulating
the handling of Irish potatoes grown in designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon. The marketing agreement
and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674),
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions
of the marketing order now in effect, Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes are subject to assessments. Funds to administer
the Idaho-Eastern Oregon potato marketing order are derived from such assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable potatoes handled during the 1994-95 fiscal period,
which begins August 1, 1994, and ends July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Acct (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 2,100 producers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes under this marketing order, and approximately
60 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potato producers and handlers may
be classified as small entities. 

The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 fiscal period was prepared by the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Potato Committee,
the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes. They are familiar with
the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate
an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons
have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. 

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of fresh Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established
at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 

The Committee met June 7, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $99,879, $937 more than the previous
year. Increases of $2,737 for salaries, $300 for telephone, $200 for postage, $500 for meetings and miscellaneous,
and $200 for Federal payroll taxes will be partially offset by a decrease of $3,000 for reserve/auto purchase. 

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.0026 per hundredweight, the same as each year
for the past decade. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 32,000,000 hundredweight, will yield $83,200
in assessment income. This, along with $16,679 from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover
budgeted expenses. Funds in the Committee's authorized reserve at the beginning of the 1994-95 fiscal period,
estimated at about $60,000, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal period's expenses. 

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal period begins on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the
fiscal period apply to all assessable Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers
are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other
budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments
timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

Onions Grown in South Texas; Expenses 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures under Marketing Order No. 959 for the 1994-95 fiscal period.
Authorization of this budget enables the South Texas Onion Committee (Committee) to incur expenses that are reasonable
and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 143 and Order No. 959, both as amended (7 CFR part 959), regulating
the handling of onions grown in South Texas. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action authorizes
expenditures for the 1994-95 fiscal period, which begins August 1, 1994, and ends July 31, 1995. This interim
final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 47 producers of South Texas onions under this marketing order, and approximately 34 handlers.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $5,000,000. The majority of South Texas onion producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.

The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 fiscal period was prepared by the South Texas Onion Committee, the agency
responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members
of the Committee are producers and handlers of South Texas onions. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and
with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget.

The Committee, in a mail vote, unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $80,000 for personnel, office, and
compliance expenses, the same as last year. 
The assessment rate and funding for the research and promotion projects will be recommended at the Committee's organizational
meeting this fall. These funds, along with the administrative expenses for personnel, office, and compliance, will
comprise the total budget. Funds in the reserve as of May 31, 1994, estimated at $346,415, were within the maximum permitted
by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses. These funds will be adequate to cover any expenses incurred by the Committee
prior to the approval of the assessment rate. 
Since no assessment rate is being recommended at this time, no additional costs will be imposed on handlers. Therefore,
the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The fiscal period begins on August 1, 1994, and the Committee needs to have approval to pay its expenses
which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) this action is similar to that taken at the beginning of the 1993-94
fiscal period; and (3) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received
will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

Domestic Dates Produced or Packed in Riverside County, CA; Expenses and Assessment Rate 


<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 987
for the 1994-95 crop year. Authorization of this budget enables the California Date Administrative Committee
(Committee) to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this
program are derived from assessments on handlers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 987, both as amended (7 CFR part 987), regulating the handling
of dates produced or packed in Riverside County, California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as
the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order now in effect, California dates are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the California date marketing
order are derived from such assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable
to all assessable dates during the 1994-95 crop year which begins October 1, 1994, and ends September 30, 1995.
This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 135 producers of California dates under the marketing order and approximately 25 handlers.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $5,000,000. The majority of California date producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.

The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 crop year was prepared by the California Date Administrative Committee,
the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of California dates. They are familiar with the Committee's
needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate
budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had
an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of California dates. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will
provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 
The Committee met on March 17, 1994, and by a vote of 6 to 2 with one abstention recommended a 1994-95 budget and
assessment rate. The Committee again met on July 7, 1994, and unanimously recommended the line item operating expenses
and by a vote of 6 to 2 recommended the line item promotional expenses in the budget. The 1994-95 budget of $571,000
is $101,440 less than the previous year. Included in the budgeted expenditures is an operating budget of $135,135,
$13,335 more than last year, with a 26 percent surplus account allocation, for a net operating budget of $100,000,
or $2,560 more than last year. Budget items for 1994-95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993-94
(in parentheses) are: Executive Director's salary, $57,500 ($55,000), Administrative Assistant's salary, $18,500
($15,000), health and related benefits, $8,500 ($7,500), utilities, $1,500 ($1,200), telephone, $5,000 ($3,000),
office supplies, $3,600 ($1,500), furniture and equipment, $7,400 ($1,000), printing, $1,600 ($1,000), and insurance,
$2,500 ($2,300). Items which have decreased compared to the amount budgeted for 1993-94 (in parentheses) are:
payroll taxes, $5,814 ($6,000), postage and meter rental, $1,700 ($2,000), repair and maintenance $500 ($600),
travel and mileage, $1,500 ($2,000), contingency, $221 ($4,000), and market promotion, $450,000 ($575,000). The
Committee also eliminated funding for a clerk, unemployment reserve, and USDA compliance audits for which $6,000,
$1,000, and $1,900 were recommended last year, respectively. All other items are budgeted at last year's amounts.

The assessment rate of $1.50 per hundredweight is $0.25 more than last season. This rate, when applied to anticipated
date shipments of 38,000,000 pounds, will yield $570,000 in assessable income. This, along with $1,000 in interest
income, will result in $21,000 in excess income which the Committee recommended be allocated to its reserve. These
reserve funds, which the Committee estimates would be $121,000 as of September 30, 1995, would be within the maximum
amount permitted by the order of not to exceed 50 percent of the average of expenses incurred during the most recent
five preceding crop years, except that an established reserve need not be reduced to conform to any recomputed average.
Funds held by the Committee at the end of the crop year, including the reserve, which are in excess of the crop year's
expenses may be used to defray expenses for four months and thereafter the Committee shall refund or credit the excess
funds to the handlers. 
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect because: (1) The
Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the crop
year begins on October 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the crop year apply
to all assessable dates handled during the crop year; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended
by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim
final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization
of this action.

Interim final rule with request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 993

to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 993, both as amended (7 CFR part 993), regulating the handling
of dried prunes produced in California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions
of the marketing order now in effect, California prunes are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable prunes handled during the 1994-95 crop year, which
begins August 1, 1994, and ends July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 1,360 producers of California prunes under this marketing order, and approximately 20 handlers.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $5,000,000. The majority of California prune producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.


The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 crop year was prepared by the Prune Marketing Committee, the agency responsible
for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department of Agriculture for approval. The
members of the Committee are producers and handlers of California prunes. They are familiar with the Committee's
needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate
budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had
an opportunity to participate and provide input. 

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of dried California prunes. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate
that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.

The Committee met June 28, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $270,200, $21,395 more than
the previous year. Budget items for 1994-95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993-94
(in parentheses) are: Executive salaries, $83,850 ($81,500), clerical salaries, $18,650 ($17,600), employee
benefits, $15,800 ($14,500), audit fees, $3,650 ($3,500), office rent, $21,500 ($19,000), postage and messenger,
$5,000 ($4,500), telephone, $2,500 ($2,000), fieldman travel, $4,000 ($3,500), purchase of equipment, $4,500
(3,000), acreage survey $10,000 ($5,000), and reserve for contingencies, $19,250 ($6,705). Items which have decreased
compared to the amount budgeted for 1993-94 (in parentheses) are: Temporary help, $5,000 ($8,000), and data
processing, $3,500 ($7,000). All other items are budgeted at last year's amounts.

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $1.60 per salable ton, $0.30 less than the previous
year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 168,875 salable tons, will yield $270,200 in assessment
income, which will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Any funds not expended by the Committee during a crop year
may be used, pursuant to  993.81(c), for a period of five months subsequent to that crop year. At the end of such
period, the excess funds are returned or credited to handlers.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis,
(2) the crop year begins on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
period apply to all assessable California prunes handled during the crop year; (3) handlers are aware of this action
which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued
in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will
be considered prior to finalization of this action.

The purpose of this rule is to implement section 2347 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990
(Pub. L. 101-624) which amends Sec. 310B (f) through (h) 
(7U.S.C. 1932) of the CONACT. This 
statutory amendment created a new program for Rural Technology Grants. In FY 1993, $1 million was appropriated to
this program as part of the Extension Service (ES) budget. Three proposals were selected for funding under ES administration.
The program was transferred to RDA under a Memorandum of Understanding. ES received another appropriation in their
budget in FY 1994 for $1.5 million. This amount has been transferred to RDA through an apportionment of funds. RDA is
responsible for implementing this program for FY 1994. 

It has been determined that failure to implement the program will result in a substantial negative impact in the rural
areas if grants from this program are not awarded from the appropriation for FY 1994. Because the appropriated funds
for this program are not available past the end of FY 1994, it is essential that this authorization be implemented this
year. RDA anticipates receiving a wide range of grant proposals as compared to the funding availability and expects
the level of competition to be high. These regulations have a sunset provision of July 13, 1995. 

The economies of many rural areas have experienced significant stress as a result of relying primarily on the agricultural
or natural resource-based industries to provide employment. As the result of improvements in efficiency and productivity
or the decline in importance of those industries in certain areas, employment opportunities and the general economy
of those areas have declined significantly. Therefore, immediate implementation of this program will provide $1.5
million for these needy areas. 

Since this is a new program, there is no historical data available to quantify benefits. However, the benefit to be
derived from the program is 
the opportunity to create new investment and employment opportunities in rural areas based on new uses for agricultural
or natural resources, thereby assisting in the diversification of rural economies, creating new employment opportunities,
and simultaneously developing new markets for agricultural products and natural resources. 

The Interim Final Rule describes the procedures and practices for applying for and obtaining this grant assistance.
The Agency, however, is providing for public comment in order for members of the public who wish to suggest alternative
rule provisions or courses of action in implementing this program to have an opportunity to give RDA the benefit of
their views. In the event that public comments are received, the Department will consider them, as appropriate, before
further publishing of this rule. 



Program Description 



Grants awarded under the Rural Technology Development Grant (RTDG) program will be to nonprofit institutions and
public bodies to establish and operate centers for rural technology or cooperative development. The term ``nonprofit
institution'' is defined by the CONACT, Sec. 310B(f)(4)(A) to mean ``* * * any organization or institution,
including an accredited institution of higher education, no part of the net earnings of which inures, or may lawfully
inure, to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.'' While this definition does not include public bodies,
the reference to public bodies in Sec. 310B(f) of the CONACT does indicate congressional intent to make rural technology
development grants available to public bodies. The term ``public body'' has been defined to mean any State, county,
city, township, incorporated towns and villages, boroughs, authorities, districts, locally-based areawide economic
development organizations, Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations, and other federally recognized Indian
tribes in rural areas. Furthermore, the Agency believes public bodies should be eligible because they are eligible
for other RDA programs and could reasonably be expected to operate such centers. 

The statute requires that these centers satisfy certain conditions in order to be eligible for grant funds. The primary
objective of the program, established by CONACT Sec. 310B(f)(2)(B), is to improve the economic condition of rural
areas by promoting the development (through technological innovation, cooperative development, and adaptation
of existing technology) and commercialization of: (1) new services and products that can be produced or provided
in rural areas, (2) new processes that can be utilized in the production of products in rural areas, and (3) new enterprises
that can add value to on-farm production through processing or marketing. The intent of this law is to provide incentives
to establish new businesses, implement advanced technologies for businesses presently in place, and create alternative
agricultural enterprises to stimulate the farm economy in the rural areas. 

Definitions referenced in the interim rule generally are based on working definitions used by the Agency or other
Federal agencies in similar grant programs and common usage of the terms. ``Cooperative development,'' 
however, was taken from the CONACT, Sec. 310B(f)(2)(B), and ``technology development'' was taken from the CONACT,
Sec. 310B(f)(2)(C)(vi). ``Rural and rural area,'' ``urbanized area,'' and ``urbanizing area'' were taken from
related RDA program regulations also under the authority of the CONACT, Sec. 310B. The term ``United States'' is defined
in accordance with Sec. 310B(f)(4)(B) to mean the several States, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the other territories and possessions
of the United States. 



Eligibility 



RTDGs may be made to nonprofit institutions and public bodies serving rural areas. Rural area determinations will
be made to ascertain the eligibility of the applicant's proposed serving area. The procedure 
established in this rule to determine eligible grant areas is based on density requirements used by RDA in other grant
programs. 

In accordance with the CONACT, Sec. 310B(h), grants may be used to pay only up to 75 percent of the administrative costs.
The Agency has further determined that to better utilize limited funds available under the program and to leverage
those funds to bring in other sources of funding for the projects, the maximum grant amount for each proposed project
will not be more than 75 percent of the project costs. This requirement is considered necessary to stimulate other
funding participation in economic development activities and allow program grant funds to reach a broader range
of rural economic development efforts. The applicant must contribute at least 25 percent to the cost of the project
and administrative costs. The applicant's contribution may be in cash or third-party in-kind contributions in accordance
with 7 CFR 3015, ``Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations,'' and 3016, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements
for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments.'' Under 7 CFR 3015 and 3016, matching funds
generally cannot come from another Federal grant program.

No Federal funds for this program shall be granted to an applicant who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt until
the delinquent account has been paid in full, nor shall funds be granted to an applicant for which an outstanding judgment
obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than in the United States Tax Court), which has been recorded,
unless it has been paid in full or otherwise satisfied, as required by the Federal Debt Collection Act of 1990. 
Section 310B(d)(2) further prohibits financial assistance over $1 million, or where direct employment is increased
by more than 50 employees, if: (1) it is likely to result in the transfer from one area to another any employment or business
activity, unless it expands existing businesses or establishes a new location or; (2) it will increase the production
or the availability of services or facilities in an area which will increase employment and have an adverse effect
on existing competitors. 


Application Process 


Applications to be submitted must include a clear statement of the goal(s) and objective(s) of the project and a plan
which describes the proposed project as required by the CONACT, Sec. 310B (f)(2). Such plan must contain specific
elements to be addressed which have been deemed necessary to carry out the intent of the program and will also serve
as the basis for the selection criteria that will be used to evaluate the project. 
The program objectives and eligible grant purposes based on the statute are set forth in the interim rule. The Agency
has expanded these eligible purposes to include equipment and materials necessary to carry out the objectives of
the plan. This purpose is incidental and required to carry out the program's statutory objectives. 
Ineligible grant purposes identified in the interim rule are in accordance with 7 CFR 3015 and 3016 and are consistent
with other RDA grant programs. In addition, RTDG funds may not be provided to support greater than 75 percent of eligible
project costs or to pay for building construction, the purchase of real estate or vehicles, improving and/or renovation
of office space, or repair or maintenance of privately-owned property. Due to the limited funding available, these
limitations are necessary to benefit as many eligible projects as possible. 
Application requirements include submission of an SF-424, ``Application for Federal Assistance,'' and other
supporting documentation. The information required is consistent with RDA's other grant programs. The application
process for RTDG funds is a two-stage process. Preapplications are submitted to determine applicant eligibility.
Upon an eligibility determination, applications are submitted to process for competitive project selection. All
supporting documentation required in connection with the preapplication/application are necessary for RDA to
determine if the applicant is eligible, if the proposed grant purposes are eligible, and to help the Agency select
the best grant applications for funding. RDA is simultaneously publishing in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 a Notice (inviting applications) that contains more specific guidance on submission of applications for FY 1994.



Project Selection 


Section 310B(f)(3) of the CONACT limits the Agency's discretion in selecting eligible projects for funding. Grants
shall be made on a competitive basis. Preferences will be given to support projects that most effectively improve
business, industry, and employment in rural areas. Emphasis for project selection will be given to those projects
that ``* * * contribute the most to the improvement of economic conditions of rural areas. * * *''
The Agency has interpreted this statutory phrase to establish preferences for projects that will create industries
or agribusinesses, increase employment, stem the flow of outmigration, and increase the tax base in the areas to be
served. The applicant must provide data to support these criteria for the most current full calendar year for which
data is available and the 3 prior calendar years. This range of information should provide an accurate picture of the
economic conditions of the rural areas to be served. The Agency is placing an emphasis on these criteria based on the
purposes and objectives set forth in the statute. The actual number of proposals to receive funding will depend on
the total number of applications received and the amount of grant funds requested. Projects will be selected based
on a priority point system set out in the regulation. The point system emphasizes those factors given preference by
statute. Points will be totalled and ranked with other applications. This selection method has been successful in
other grant programs administered by the Agency and is considered the best method to use for this program. 
RDA monitors and evaluates each project it approves in accordance with 7 CFR 3015 and 3016. Monitoring typically involves
site visits by RDA staff and designated evaluators, telephone conversations, and evaluation of the grantee's written
activity reports. Activity reports are used to evaluate projects and must be in a measurable form. Termination of
grant provisions are in accordance with 7 CFR 3015 and 3016. These provisions are consistent with other RDA grant programs.



Miscellaneous 


Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all applicable Federal laws, Federal and USDA policies, regulations,
and procedures applicable to Federal financial assistance. Requirements concerning civil rights, the environment,
debarment and suspension, etc., have been listed in this rule. These restrictions are consistent with other RDA grant
programs.

procedures to provide grants for technology and cooperative development in rural areas. Grants will not be awarded
under this subpart after July 13, 1995.

(b) Grants for establishing and operating centers for rural technology or cooperative development will be for the
primary purpose of improving the economic condition of rural areas by promoting the development (through technological
innovation, cooperative development, and adaptation of existing technology) and commercialization of new services
and products that can be produced or provided in rural areas; new processes that can be utilized in the production of
products in rural areas; and new enterprises that can add value to on-farm production through processing or marketing.

(c) Copies of all forms and Instructions referenced in this subpart are available in any Farmers Home Administration
(FmHA) State Office.



 4284.502

 Policy.



(a) The grant program will be used to assist in the economic development of rural areas.

(b) Funds allocated for use in accordance with this subpart are also to be considered for use by Native American tribes
within the State regardless of whether State development strategies include Indian reservations within the State's
boundaries. Native American tribes residing on such reservations must have equal opportunity along with other rural
residents to participate in the benefits of these programs. This includes equal application of outreach activities
of RDA servicing offices.

urbanized areas. 



 4284.505

 Applicant eligibility.



(a) Grants may be made to public bodies or nonprofit institutions.

(1) The approval official will proceed as follows in rural area determinations: When the approval official determines
an area to be urbanized or urbanizing, he/she must then determine the population density per square mile. If the project
otherwise appears to be eligible, the approval official will request the National Office to provide the correct density
figure.

(2) All such density determinations will be made on the basis of minor civil division or census county division as used
by the Bureau of the Census. In making the density calculations, large nonresidential tracts devoted to urban land
uses such as railroad yards, airports, industrial sites, parks, golf courses, and cemeteries or land set aside for
such purposes will be excluded.

(b) An outstanding judgement obtained against an applicant by the United States in a Federal Court (other than in the
United States Tax Court), which has been recorded, shall cause the applicant to be ineligible to receive any grant
or loan until the judgement is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. RDA grant funds may not be used to satisfy the judgement.
Questions about whether or not a judgement is still outstanding should be directed to the Office of the General Counsel
(OGC).

Other considerations.



(a) 

Civil rights compliance requirements. 

All grants made under this subpart are subject to the requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibits
discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin as outlined in subpart E of part 1901 of this title.
In addition, the grants made under this subpart are subject to the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap; the requirements of the Age Discrimination Act
of 1975 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age; and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Pub.
L. 101-336, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by private entities in places of public
accommodations.

(b) 

Environmental requirements. 

(1) 

General applicability. 

Unless specifically modified by this section, the requirements of subpart G of part 1940 of this title apply to this
subpart. RDA will give particular emphasis to ensuring compliance with the environmental policies contained in
  1940.303 and 1940.304 of subpart G of part 1940 of this title. Although the purpose of the grant program
established by this subpart is to improve business, industry, and employment in rural areas, this purpose is to be
achieved, to the extent practicable, without adversely affecting important environmental resources of rural areas
such as important farmland and forest lands, prime rangelands, wetlands, and floodplains. Prospective recipients
of grants, therefore, must consider the potential environmental impacts of their applications at the earliest planning
stages and develop plans and projects that minimize the potential to adversely impact on the environment.

(2) 

Technical assistance. 

An application for a technical assistance project is generally excluded from the environmental review process by
 1940.333 of subpart G of part 1940 of this title. However, as further specified in that section, the grantee
of a technical assistance grant, in the process of providing technical assistance, must consider the potential environmental
impacts of the recommendations provided to the recipient of the technical assistance.

(3) 

Applications for grants to provide financial assistance to third-party recipients. 

As part of the preapplication, the applicant must provide a complete Form FmHA 1940-20, ``Request for Environmental
Information,'' for each project specifically identified in its plan to provide financial assistance to third parties
who will undertake eligible projects with such assistance. RDA will review the preapplication, supporting materials,
and any required Forms FmHA 1940-20 and initiate a Class II assessment for the preapplication in accordance
with  1940.318 of subpart G of part 1940 of this title. This assessment will focus on the potential cumulative
impacts of the projects as well as any environmental concerns or problems that are associated with individual projects
and that can be identified at this time from the information submitted. Because RDA's approval of this type of grant
application does not constitute RDA's commitment to the use of grant funds for any identified third-party projects
(see  4284.541 of this subpart), no public notification requirements for a Class II assessment will apply to
the preapplication. After the grant is approved, each third-party project to be assisted under the grant will undergo
the applicable environmental review and public notification requirements in subpart G of part 1940 of this title
prior to RDA providing its consent to the grantee to assist the third-party project. If the preapplication reflects
only one specific project which is specifically identified as the third-party recipient for financial assistance,
RDA may perform the appropriate environmental assessment in accordance with the requirements of subpart G of part
1940 of this title and forego initiating a Class II assessment with no public notification. However, the applicant
must be advised that if the recipient or project changes after the grant is approved, the project to be assisted under
the grant will undergo the applicable environmental review and public notification requirements in subpart G of
part 1940 of this title.

(c) 

Governmentwide debarment and suspension (nonprocurement) and requirements for drug-free workplace. 

All projects must comply with the requirements set forth in part 3017 of this title and FmHA Instruction 1940-M
(available in any FmHA State Office).

(d) 

Restrictions on lobbying. 

All grants must comply with the lobbying restrictions set forth in part 3018 of this title.

(e) 

Excess capacity or transfer of employment.

(1) If a proposed grant is for more than $1 million and will increase direct employment by more than 50 employees, the
applicant will be requested to provide written support for an RDA determination that the proposal will not result
in a project which is calculated to, or likely to, result in:

(i) The transfer of any employment or business activity from one area to another (this limitation shall not prohibit
assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate,
or subsidiary of such entity if the expansion will not result in an increase in the unemployment in the area of original
location or in any other area where such entity conducts business operations unless there is reason to believe that
such expansion is being established with the intention of closing down the operations of the existing business entity
in the area of its original location or in any other area where it conducts such operations), or

(ii) An increase in the production of goods, materials, or commodities or the availability of services or facilities
in the area when there is not sufficient demand for such goods, materials, commodities, services, or facilities to
employ the efficient capacity of existing competitive commercial or industrial enterprises, unless such financial
or other assistance will not have an adverse effect upon existing competitive enterprises in the area. The applicant's
written support will consist of a resolution from the applicant and Form FmHA 449-22, ``Certification of Non-Relocation
and Market and Capacity Information Report,'' from each existing and future occupant of the site. The applicant may
use Guide 2 of subpart G of part 1942 (available in any FmHA State Office) as an example in preparing the resolution.
Future occupants of the site must be certified by the Department of Labor (DOL) for a period of 3 years after the initial
certification by DOL.

(2) RDA will check each document for completeness and accuracy and submit nine copies of each to the National Office
for forwarding to DOL.

(3) Grants shall not be made if the Secretary of Labor certifies within 30 days after the matter has been submitted by
the Secretary of Agriculture that the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section have not been met. Information
for obtaining this certification will be submitted, in writing, by the applicant to RDA. The information will be submitted
to DOL by the RDA National Office. Grant approval may be given and funds may be obligated, subject to the DOL certification
being received, provided RDA has made its own separate determinations of (e)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section when applicable.

(f) Management assistance. 

Grant recipients will be supervised, as necessary, to ensure that projects are completed in accordance with approved
plans and specifications and that funds are expended for approved purposes. Grants made under this subpart will be
administered under, and are subject to, parts 3015, 3016, and 3017 of this title, as appropriate, and established
RDA guidelines.

(g) 

National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. 

All projects will be in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 in accordance with subpart
F of part 1901 of this title.

(h) 

Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act

. All projects must comply with the requirements set forth in part 21 of this title. 

(i) 

Floodplains and wetlands

. All projects must comply with Executive Order 11988, ``Floodplain Management,'' and Executive Order 11990, ``Protection
of Wetlands.'' 

(j) 

Flood or mudslide hazard area precautions

. If the grantee financed project is in a flood or mudslide area, flood or mudslide insurance must be provided. 

(k) 

Termination of Federal requirements

. Once the grantee has provided assistance to projects from a revolving fund, in an amount equal to the grant provided
by RDA, the requirements imposed on the grantee shall not be applicable to any new projects thereafter financed from
the revolving funds. Such new projects shall not be considered as being derived from Federal funds. 

(l) 

Intergovernmental review

. Grant projects are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. A revolving fund established in whole, or in part, with grant funds will also be considered
a project for the purpose of intergovernmental review as well as the specific projects funded with grant funds from
the revolving loan project. For each project to be assisted with a grant under this subpart and for which the State has
elected to review the project under their intergovernmental review process, the State Point of Contact must be notified.
Notification, in the form of a project description, can be initiated by the grantee. Any comments from the State must
be included with the grantee's request to use RDA grant funds for the specific project. Prior to RDA's decision on the
request, compliance with requirements of intergovernmental consultation must be demonstrated for each project.
These requirements should be carried out in accordance with subpart V, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department
of Agriculture Programs and Activities,'' of part 3015 of this title (see subpart J of part 1940 of this title, available
in any FmHA State Office).

(1) 

Economic conditions. 

Preference will be given to proposed projects which will serve a rural area(s) that has few rural industries and agribusinesses;
high levels of unemployment or underemployment; high rates of outmigration of people, businesses, and industries;
and low levels of per capita income. RDA will consider data supporting these demographics from the United States Bureau
of the Census or other reliable data from recognized local, regional, State or Federal sources or from surveys conducted
by reliable, impartial sources. Outmigration of businesses and industries, for example, may be supported by county

current full calendar year for which the data is available and the 3 calendar years prior to that year. The competitive
range for proposed projects is as follows: 
(i) Number of rural industries and agribusinesses in comparison with the population of the area(s) to be served: 1
or less per 5,000 residents_25 points; 1 or less per 3,000 residents_15 points; or 1 or less per 1,000 residents_5 points.

(ii) Unemployment rate in the area(s) to be served: Exceeds the State rate by 25 percent or more_15 points; or exceeds
the State rate by less than 25 percent but more than 5 percent_10 points. 
(iii) Underemployment in the area(s) to be served exceeds the State rate of underemployment by 25 percent or more_20
points; exceeds the State rate by less than 25 percent_10 points; or is equal to or less than State rate_0 points.

points. 
(2) 

Project proposal. 

The project proposal will contribute the most to the improvement of economic conditions of the rural area(s) by: 
(i) Creation of industries or agribusinesses in the area(s): 1 or more per 5,000 residents_20 points; 1 or more per
10,000 residents_10 points; or 1 or more per 20,000 residents_5 points.

points. 
(b) 

Review of decision. 

Each application for assistance will be carefully reviewed in accordance with the priorities established in this
section. A priority rating will be assigned to each application. Applications selected for funding will be based
on the priority rating assigned each application and the total funds available. All applications submitted for funding
should contain sufficient information to permit RDA to complete a thorough priority rating. When a determination
is made that favorable action will not be taken on a preapplication or application, the applicant will be notified
in writing of the reasons why the request was not favorably considered. The notification to the applicant will state
that a review of this decision by RDA may be requested by the applicant in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this
title.

Exhibit A of Subpart F_Agreement of Administrative Requirements for 
Rural Technology Development Grants 



This exhibit contains information regarding the responsibilities of the grantee for receipt of grant funds under
the Rural Technology Development Grant (RTDG) program. These requirements do not supersede the requirements for
receipt of Federal funds as stated in 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016; however, specific areas related to the program are cited
below. 

In consideration for the RTDG grant by RDA, grantee agrees to: 

1. Cause the RTDG program to be completed within the total sums available to it, including grant funds, in accordance
with the scope of work and any necessary modifications thereof prepared by grantee and approved by grantor. 

2. Permit periodic inspection of the program operations by a representative of grantor. 

3. Make the program available to all persons in grantee's service area without regard to race, color, national origin,
religion, sex, marital status, age, physical or mental handicap. 

4. Not use grant funds to replace any financial support previously provided or assured from any other source. The grantee
agrees that the general level of expenditure by the grantee for the benefit of program area and/or program covered
by this agreement shall be maintained and not reduced as a result of the Federal share funds received under this grant.


5. Provide financial management systems which will include: 

(a) Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial result of each grant. 

(b) Records which identify adequately the source and application of funds for grant-supporting activities. Those
records shall contain information pertaining to grant awards and authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, liabilities, outlays, and income. 

(c) Effective control over and accountability for all funds. Grantee shall adequately safeguard all such assets
and shall ensure that they are used solely for authorized purposes. 

(d) Accounting records supported by source documentation. 

6. Retain financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to the
grant for a period of at least 3 years after grant closing except that the records shall be retained beyond the 3-year
period if audit findings have not been resolved. Microfilm copies may be substituted in lieu of original records.
The grantor and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall
have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the grantee which are pertinent to the specific grant program
for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts. 

7. Provide an audit report prepared in accordance with generally accepted Government auditing standards using the
publication, ``Standards for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities and Functions.'' 

8. Provide grantor with such periodic reports as it may require and permit periodic inspection of its operations by
a designated representative of the grantor. 

9. Execute Form FmHA 400-4, ``Assurance Agreement,'' and any other agreements required by grantor to implement
the civil rights requirements. If any such form has been executed by grantee as a result of a grant being made to grantee
by grantor contemporaneously with the making of this grant, another form of the same type need not be executed in connection
with this grant. 

10. That upon any default under its representations or agreements set forth in this instrument, grantee, at the option
and the demand of grantor, will, to the extent legally permissible, repay to grantor forthwith the original principal
amount of the grant stated herein above, with interest equal to the rate of interest paid on U.S. 26-week Treasury Bills
adjusted quarterly from the date of the default. The provisions of this exhibit may be enforced by grantor at its option
and without regard to prior waivers by it of previous defaults of grantee, by judicial proceedings to require specific
performance of the terms of this exhibit, or by such other proceedings in the law or equity in either Federal or State
courts as may be deemed necessary by grantor to assure compliance with the provisions of this exhibit and the laws and
regulations under which this grant is made.

11. That no member of Congress shall be admitted to any share or part of this grant or any benefit that may arise therefrom;
but this provision shall not be construed to bar, as a contractor under the grant, a publicly held corporation whose
ownership might include a member of Congress. 
12. That all non-confidential information resulting from its activities shall be made available to the general public
on an equal basis. 
13. That the purpose and scope of work for which this grant is made shall not duplicate programs for which monies have
been received, are committed, or are applied to from other sources (public or private). 
14. That grantee shall relinquish any and all copyrights and/or privileges to the materials developed under this
grant as published in whole or in part. The material shall contain a notice and be identified by language to the following
effect: ``The material is the result of tax-supported research and as such is not copyrightable. It may be freely reprinted
with the customary crediting of the source.'' 
15. That the grantee shall abide by the policies promulgated in the USDA Uniform Assistance Regulations, 7 CFR Parts
3015 and 3016, which provides standards for use by grantee in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies,
equipment, and other services with Federal grant funds. 
16. Obtain prior approval from grantor for use of grant funds for uses or amounts not consistent with the approved scope
of work and budget. 
17. That the grantee, except for States, will remit interest earned on grant funds deposited in an interest bearing
account in accordance with the USDA Uniform Assistance Regulation, 7 CFR Parts 3015 and 3016. 
18. Grantee will comply with property management standards established by 7 CFR Parts 3015 and 3016 for personal property.
``Personal property'' means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible_having physical existence_or
intangible_having no physical existence; such as patents, inventions, and copyrights. ``Nonexpendable personal
property'' means tangible personal property having a useful life of more than 1 year and an acquisition cost of $300
or more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of nonexpendable personal property provided that such definition
would at least include all tangible personal property as defined above. ``Expendable personal property'' refers
to all tangible personal property other than nonexpendable property. When nonexpendable property is acquired by
a grantee with project funds, title shall not be taken by the Federal Government but shall be vested in the grantee subject
to the following conditions. 
(a) Right to transfer title. For items of real or nonexpendable personal property having a unit acquisition cost of
$1,000 or more, RDA may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by
the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such reservation shall
be subject to the following standards: 
(i) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing.

(ii) RDA shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the
project for which it was acquired. If RDA fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period,
the grantee shall apply the standards of paragraph 18. (b) of this exhibit. 
(iii) When RDA exercises its right to take title, the personal property shall be subject to the provisions for federally
owned nonexpendable property discussed in paragraphs 18. (b) and (c) of this exhibit. 
(iv) When title is transferred either to the Federal Government or to a third party and the grantee is instructed to
ship the property elsewhere, the grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefiting Federal agency with an amount which
is computed by applying the percentage of the grantee's participation in the cost of the original grant project or
program to the current fair market value of the property, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.

(b) Use of other nonexpendable personal property for which the grantee has title. 
(i) The grantee shall use the property in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When it is no longer needed for the original
project or program, the grantee shall use the property in connection with its other federally sponsored activities,
in the following order of priority:

(

1

) Activities sponsored by RDA. 
(

2

) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies. 
(ii) Shared use. During the time that nonexpendable personal property is held for use on the project or program for
which it was acquired, the grantee shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will
not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the property was originally acquired. First preference
for such other use shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by RDA; second preference shall be given to projects
or programs sponsored by other Federal agencies. If the property is owned by the Federal Government, use for other
activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by RDA. User charges should
be considered, if appropriate. 
(c) Disposition of nonexpendable personal property. When the grantee no longer needs the property as provided in
paragraph 18(b) of this exhibit, the property may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards:

(i) Personal property with a unit acquisition cost of less than $1,000. The grantee may use the property for other activities
without reimbursement to the Federal Government or sell the property and retain the proceeds. 
(ii) Nonexpendable personal property with a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more. The grantee may retain the property
for other use provided that compensation is made to RDA or its successor. The amounts of compensation shall be computed
by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to current fair
market value of the property. If the grantee has no need for the property and the property has further use value, the
grantee shall request disposition instructions from the original grantor agency. 
(iii) RDA shall determine whether the property can be used to meet the Agency's requirements. If no need exists within
RDA, the General Services Administration Federal Property Management Regulations will be used by RDA to determine
whether a need for the property exists in other Federal *agencies. RDA shall issue instructions to the grantee no later
than 120 days after the grantee request and the following procedures shall govern: 
(

1

) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the grantee's request,
the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse RDA an amount computed by applying the percentage of the grantor
participation in the grant program to the sales proceeds. However, the grantee shall be permitted to deduct and retain
from the Federal share $100 or 10 percent of the proceeds, whichever is greater, for the grantee's selling and handling
expenses. 
(

2

) If the grantee is instructed to dispose of the property other than as described in paragraphs 18. (b) and (c) of this
exhibit, the grantee shall be reimbursed by RDA for such costs incurred in its disposition. 
(

3

) Property management standards for nonexpendable personal property. The grantee's property management standards
for nonexpendable personal property shall include the following procedural requirements: 
(

a

) Property records shall be maintained accurately and shall include: 
(

i

) A description of the property. 
(

ii

) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, National stock number, or other identification
number. 
(

iii

) Sources of the property including grant or other agreement number. 
(

iv

) Whether title vests in the grantee or the Federal Government. 
(

v

) Acquisition date (or date received, if the property was furnished by the Federal Government) and costs. 
(

vi

) Percentage (at the end of the budget year) of Federal participation in the cost of the project or program for which
the property was acquired. (Not applicable to property furnished by the Federal Government). 
(

vii

) Location, use, and condition of the property and the date the information was reported. 
(

viii

) Unit acquisition cost. 
(

ix

) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair
market value where a grantee compensates the Federal agency for its share.

(

b

) Property owned by the Federal Government must be marked to indicate Federal ownership. 
(

c

) A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once
every 2 years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting
records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The grantee shall, in connection with the
inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the property. 
(

d

) A control system shall be in effect to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property.
Any loss, damage, or the theft of nonexpendable property shall be investigated and fully documented; if the property
was owned by the Federal Government, the grantee shall promptly notify RDA. 
(

e

) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the property in good condition. 
(

f

) Where the grantee is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established which
would provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
(

g

) Expendable personal property shall vest in the grantee upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of such
property exceeding $1,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination or completion of the grant and if
the property is not needed for any other federally sponsored project or program, the grantee shall retain the property
for use on nonfederally sponsored activities or sell it, but must in either case compensate the Federal Government
for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as nonexpendable personal property.

This exhibit covers the following described personal property and any additional property acquired wholly or in
part with grant funds (use continuation sheets as necessary): 
19. To the following termination provisions: 
(a) Termination for cause: The grantor agency may terminate any grant in whole, or in part, at any time before the date
of completion, whenever it is determined that the grantee has failed to comply with the conditions of the grant. The
grantor agency shall promptly notify the grantee in writing of the determination and the reasons for the termination,
together with the effective date. 
(b) Termination for convenience: The grantor agency or grantee may terminate grants in whole, or in part, when both
parties agree that the continuation of the program would not produce beneficial results commensurate with the further
expenditure of funds. The two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date
and, in the case of partial terminations, the portion to be terminated. The grantee shall not incur new obligations
for the terminated portion after the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible.
The grantor agency shall allow full credit to the grantee for the Federal share of the noncancelable obligations properly
incurred by the grantee prior to termination. 
RDA agrees that it will: 
1. Assist grantee, within available appropriations, with such technical assistance as grantor deems appropriate
in planning the program and coordinating the plan with local official comprehensive plans and with any State or area
plans for the area in which the program is located. 
2. At its sole discretion, RDA may at any time give any consent, deferment, subordination, release, satisfaction,
or termination of any or all of grantee's grant obligations, with or without valuable consideration, upon such terms
and conditions as RDA may determine to be: 
(a) Advisable to further the purposes of the grant or to protect the Government's financial interest therein; and

(b) Consistent with both the statutory purposes of the grant and the limitations of the statutory authority under
which it is made.

Revocation of Class E Airspace; Bozrah, CT



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action revokes Class E airspace at Bozrah, CT. This action is a result of the cancellation of the Special Instrument
Approach Procedures for Runway 2 and Runway 20 at Gager Field. The intended effect of this action is to remove the controlled
airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Bozrah, CT. This airspace is no longer needed for instrument
flight rules operation at Bozrah, CT.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

History




On March 11, 1994, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revoke Class E airspace at Bozrah, CT (59 FR 11561). The proposal was prompted by the
cancellation of the Special Instrument Approach Procedures for Runway 2 and Runway 20 at Gager Field.




Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal of the FAA. No comments on the proposal were received. 


Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993).


The Class E airspace revocation listed in this document will be removed subsequently from the Order.




The Rule




This amendment of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revokes the Class E airspace at Bozrah, CT. This action
is a result of the cancellation of the Special Instrument Approach Procedures for Runway 2 and Runway 20 at Gager Field.





The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves only an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep these regulations operationally current. It, therefore_(1)
is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 





List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71




Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).




Adoption of the Amendment




In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows:







PART 71_[AMENDED]

Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled; Eligibility for Children of Armed Forces Personnel
Residing Outside the United States Other Than in Foreign Countries



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Social Security Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule reflects the provisions of section 13734 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public
Law (Pub. L.) 103-66, which amended section 1614(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Social Security Act (the Act). Effective
November 1, 1993, these provisions remove the restriction that children of armed forces personnel stationed in Puerto
Rico or the territories or possessions of the United States may not continue to be eligible for supplemental security
income (SSI) benefits while living outside the United States.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This regulation reflects the provisions of section 13734 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L.
103-66, which amended section 1614(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act. Effective November 1, 1993, section 1614(a)(1)(B)(ii)
provides that SSI benefits may continue to be paid to blind or disabled children who are United States citizens and
accompany their military parent(s) to assignments in Puerto Rico or the territories or possessions of the United
States, if the children were eligible for SSI benefits for the month before the parent reported for duty overseas.
Section 13734 expands coverage to blind or disabled children whose military parents are assigned to permanent duty
ashore anywhere outside the United States. Prior legislation (sec. 8009 of Pub. L. 101-239) and implementing
regulations allowed the continuation of SSI payments to children whose parents were stationed in foreign countries
as of April 1990, but did not permit the continuation of SSI payments to the children of military parents who were based
in Puerto Rico or the United States territories or possessions.




We are amending  416.215 to reflect that eligibility for SSI benefits may continue for a child living outside
the United States when the child:

 Is a citizen of the United States;

 Is living with a parent who is a member of the armed forces of the United States assigned to permanent duty ashore
outside the United States; and

 Was eligible for an SSI benefit (including any federally administered State supplementary payment) for the
month before the parent reported for such duty.

Regulatory Procedures



The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy generally follows the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA) notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and public comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553 in the development
of its regulations. The APA provides exceptions to its notice and public comment procedures when an agency finds there
is good cause for dispensing with such procedures on the basis that they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary
to the public interest. We have determined that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists for dispensing with the
NPRM and public comment procedures in this case. Good cause exists because this regulation is of a technical nature
and involves no discretionary policy. Therefore, opportunity for prior comment is unnecessary, and we are issuing
these changes to our regulations as a final rule.



Executive Order 12866



This final rule does not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order
(E.O.) 12866 and, thus, is not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under E.O. 12866.



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980



This regulation imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to OMB clearance.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



We certify that this regulation, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities because it affects only individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided
in Pub. L. 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These regulations reflect changes in the law made by the Employment Opportunities for Disabled Americans Act and
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. These statutes made permanent, simplified, and liberalized the incentives
in the Social Security Act (the Act) for disabled and blind supplemental security income (SSI) recipients who attempt
to work. They also liberalized the provision that provides an impairment-related work expense exclusion from the
regular SSI income counting rules. In addition, we are making related administrative policy changes necessary to
carry out these provisions.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




General



SSI payments are designed to provide a basic level of support for certain aged, blind, or disabled individuals. Work
incentive provisions in the SSI program generally enable blind and disabled individuals to return to work or increase
their level of work activity without losing SSI disability or blindness status. Certain work incentives provide
them some protection from having their SSI benefits reduced based on their increased earnings. In most States, some
provisions also permit continued Medicaid coverage for qualified individuals even if their earnings preclude any
SSI cash payments.



Under the law in effect before July 1, 1987, regular SSI benefits (section 1611 benefits) were payable to a disabled
SSI recipient who worked at the substantial gainful activity (SGA) level after a 9-month trial work period. Work at
the SGA level resulted in the cessation of disability status and, thus, an inability to requalify for regular SSI benefits
without filing a new application if the work continued after a 15-month extended period of eligibility (EPE). Section
1619, in effect from January 1, 1981, through June 30, 1987, permitted payment of special SSI cash benefits (section
1619(a) benefits) to disabled recipients who lost eligibility for section 1611 benefits because of SGA. Section
1619(b) provided special SSI eligibility status for Medicaid purposes to working disabled or blind individuals
whose earnings made them ineligible for SSI cash payments. Transitions between the various statuses, particularly
after the EPE, were complicated. Many felt that the complexity deterred people from participating in the section
1619 program.

Amendments to section 1619 addressed these concerns. Sections 2 and 4 of the Employment Opportunities for Disabled
Americans Act, Public Law (Pub. L.) 99-643, effective November 10, 1986 and July 1, 1987, respectively, made
permanent and provided several improvements to sections 1619 (a) and (b). Section 5032 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-508, effective May 1, 1991, further amended section 1619(b) by eliminating the 65-year
age limit for special SSI eligibility status for Medicaid purposes. Section 5033 of Pub. L. 101-508, effective
December 1, 1990, liberalized the impairment-related work expense exclusion of section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii) of the
Act.

These regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 52458) as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on October 8, 1993. Interested parties were given 60 days to
submit comments. The comment period closed on December 7, 1993. We received two letters containing comments. One
commenter supported the proposed changes without modification. The other generally supported the proposed changes,
but suggested that we add one clarifying statement. We explain below in the Public Comments section of this preamble
the nature of those comments and how we accommodated the suggested revision. This commenter also discussed matters
that were not relevant to the proposed regulations. We referred those matters to the appropriate component of the
Social Security Administration and do not address them in this preamble. In addition, on December 3, 1993 (58 FR 63888)
we published final rules which added a new paragraph (c)(1) to  416.1112 governing the exclusion from earned
income of the earned income tax credit refund an individual receives, and redesignated existing paragraphs of  416.1112.
Therefore, we have revised the references to paragraphs of  416.1112 in these final rules to be consistent with
the new paragraph numbering. Further, we inadvertently did not provide a complete reference to all the relevant income
exclusions in  416.1112 as we apply them in determining the State threshold amount for purposes of determining
section 1619(b) eligibility. We have made this technical correction to  416.269 of these final rules. Therefore,
except for adding the requested clarifying statement, updating regulatory references, and correcting typographical
and technical errors in the NPRM, we adopted the rules as proposed.

Regulatory Changes



1. Expiration Date of Section 1619



We revised   416.260 and 416.261 to remove the expiration date to reflect the change made by section of
Pub. L. 99-643 that made section 1619 permanent.



2. Section 1619(a)_Special SSI Cash Benefits



Section 4 of Pub. L. 99-643 amended section 1619(a) of the Act to provide special SSI cash benefits to an individual
whose earnings exceed the amount designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to represent
SGA despite a disabling impairment, provided that individual meets certain eligibility requirements. We discuss
below the changes we made to reflect the changes in the law, as well as related policy changes.

We revised  416.262(a) to reflect that an individual must have been eligible to receive a regular SSI benefit
or federally administered State supplementary payment based on disability in ``a,'' rather than ``the,'' month
before the month for which section 1619(a) eligibility is being determined. The statutory change removed the former
requirement that the individual must have been eligible for regular SSI benefits, special SSI cash benefits, or State
supplementary payments in the month immediately prior to the month of eligibility under section 1619(a). The month
the individual was eligible for a regular SSI benefit or federally administered State supplementary payment may
not be in a prior period of eligibility which has terminated according to   416.1331-416.1335.

We revised  416.262(d) to reflect the statutory change that an individual must ``meet,'' rather than ``continue
to meet,'' all nondisability requirements for SSI eligibility in the month for which the determination is being made.

These two changes permit eligibility for special SSI cash benefits following one or more months of suspension.

We revised   416.260, 416.261, and 416.262(b) to reflect that an individual is eligible for benefits
under section 1619(a) when his or her ``gross earned income,'' rather than ``earnings'' as described in  416.1110,
exceeds the designated SGA amount (currently $500 per month). Because actual monthly determinations of SGA are not
required before an individual moves from section 1611 to 1619(a) status, we will use gross earned income rather than
earnings. This is consistent with Congress' intent, as shown in the legislative history of section 1619, to simplify
transitions between benefit statuses, limit actual determinations of eligibility, and ease administration of
the section 1619 program. In response to a public comment, we added a new sentence to  416.260 clarifying that
the calculation of this gross earned income amount is not to be considered an actual SGA determination. We discuss
this clarification below. For disabled individuals otherwise eligible for a cash benefit, the only distinction
between regular benefit status under section 1611 and section 1619(a) status will be whether or not their gross earned
income exceeds the SGA level. Section 1619(a) does not apply to the blind because earnings of blind individuals are
not subject to an SGA test under the SSI program.

3. Section 1619(b)_Special SSI Eligibility Status


Section 4 of Pub. L. 99-643 and section 5032 of Pub. L. 101-508 amended section 1619(b) of the Act to provide
changes in the eligibility requirements for special SSI eligibility status. We discuss below the changes we made
to reflect the changes in the law, as well as related policy changes.
We revised  416.264 to provide that special SSI eligibility status applies for purposes of reacquiring status
as eligible for regular or special SSI cash benefits, as well as establishing or maintaining eligibility for Medicaid.
We revised  416.265 to remove the 65-year age limit for section 1619(b) eligibility status effective May 1,
1991.
We also revised  416.265 to reflect that an individual must have been eligible for a regular SSI benefit or a federally
administered State supplementary payment in ``a month before the month,'' rather than ``the month before the first
month,'' for which eligibility for special SSI eligibility status is being determined. The month the individual
was eligible for a regular SSI benefit or federally administered State supplementary payment may not be in a prior
period of eligibility which has terminated according to   416.1331-416.1335.
We revised  416.265(b) to reflect that an individual, except for earnings, must ``meet,'' rather than ``continue
to meet,'' all nondisability requirements for SSI eligibility in the month for which the determination is being made.
These two changes permit special SSI eligibility status for Medicaid purposes following one or more months of suspension.
We revised  416.265(d) to add that we will consider publicly funded attendant care services, in addition to
SSI benefits, federally administered State supplementary payments, and Medicaid, when determining whether an
individual's earnings are sufficient to allow the individual to provide a reasonable equivalent of the benefits
which would be available if the individual did not have those earnings.
We revised  416.268 to add that an individual may establish the need for Medicaid eligibility to continue working
(see  416.265(c)) by showing that Medicaid benefits would be needed to pay for unexpected medical expenses
in the next 12 months. Previously, we considered only past or expected Medicaid use. This policy change adds consideration
of the individual's ability to pay for unexpected medical expenses to the factors that can meet the statutory provision
that termination of Medicaid would seriously inhibit the individual's ability to continue working. We believe the
proposed change is consistent with the intent of Pub. L. 99-643 because such individuals, if not accorded section
1619(b) status, might be forced to stop working in order to get Medicaid to pay for unexpected medical expenses. This
change enables individuals without recurring medical expenses or expectation of expenses to meet the requirement
if they cannot provide for their own medical care.
We also deleted former paragraphs (b) and (c) of  416.268, which required an individual's signed statement
about use or expected use of Medicaid and verification, as necessary, of past services with the service providers
or the State agency administering the Medicaid program. This change permits us to determine the need for Medicaid
in order to continue working based on information provided by the individual. Our operational experience shows that
the individual's knowledge about use or expected use of Medicaid is almost always valid and, therefore, verification
results in unnecessary administrative burdens and costs.

<TEXT>
 

We revised  416.269 to reflect the statutory expansion of the factors considered in determining the sufficiency
of a person's earnings to provide a reasonable equivalent of the benefits which would be available absent those earnings
(see  416.265(d)). We determine insufficiency of earnings by comparing actual and/or anticipated gross earnings
for the 12-month period, beginning with the month for which special SSI eligibility status is being determined, with
a threshold amount for the individual's State of residence. We determine the threshold amount using the amount of
gross earnings that it would take to reduce to zero the Federal SSI benefit and State supplementary payment for an individual
with no other income living in his or her own household and the average Medicaid expenditures for disabled SSI cash
recipients for the State of residence. If an individual's gross earnings exceed the State threshold amount, we do
a second comparison to compare the earnings with an individualized threshold. In making this determination, we will
consider any amounts excluded as impairment-related work expenses or work expenses of the blind, amounts used or
set aside for use under an approved plan for achieving self-support, and the value of any publicly funded attendant
care services.

We also added  416.269(d), which explains that we will consider the value of attendant care services for purposes
of sufficiency of earnings determinations if the services are provided by a paid attendant, needed to assist with
work-related and/or individual functions, and paid from Federal, State, or local funds.

We also added  416.269(e) to reflect that we will base determinations of sufficiency of earnings on information
and data updated no less frequently than annually.

Also, because  416.269 predated retrospective monthly accounting, we further revised it. For sufficiency
of earnings determinations, we will use the calendar month, rather than quarter, for which we are determining eligibility
for special SSI eligibility status as the beginning of the 12-month period.



4. Impairment-Related Work Expense Change



In enacting Pub. L. 99-643, Congress recognized that disabled individuals who make work attempts may not be
able to follow a steady progression from regular SSI status under section 1611 to special SSI cash benefit status under
section 1619(a), to special SSI eligibility status under section 1619(b), and then to a status of complete independence.
In reality, such individuals tend to have setbacks which may cause a drop in earnings and, therefore, a change in eligibility
status. According to the legislative history of Pub. L. 99-643, it was Congress' intent to provide for easy transition,
in either direction, between the various categories of benefits. Therefore, we revised  416.1112(c)(6) to
facilitate easier movement between different benefit statuses. For periods prior to December 1, 1990, an individual
who remained continuously eligible for a benefit under section 1611, 1616 (if supplementation is federally administered),
1619(a), or 1619(b), continued to qualify for the impairment-related work expense exclusion in determining financial
eligibility for SSI. Also, to reflect section 5033 of Pub. L. 101-508, for periods after November 30, 1990, we
removed the requirement that an individual must establish eligibility without benefit of the impairment related
work expense exclusion.



5. Administrative Actions Under Section 1619(a)



In addition to the changes already discussed, these regulations contain changes which we believe are consistent
with the legislative intent of Pub. L. 99-643 to simplify administration of section 1619 and facilitate transition
among the various categories of benefits. We revised   416.1402 and 416.1403 with regard to initial determinations
in order to state our policy on determinations involving transitions between sections 1611, 1619(a), and 1619(b).

We revised  416.1402(a) to clarify that initial determinations regarding SSI benefits include, but are not
limited to, determinations about eligibility for or the amount of SSI benefits or special SSI cash benefits, except
actions solely involving transitions to eligibility between these types of benefits. We revised  416.1402(b)
to clarify that the administrative actions of ``suspension'' and ``termination'' pertain to special SSI eligibility
status under section 1619(b) as well as SSI cash benefits under section 1611 or section 1619(a).

We deleted former  416.1402(h), which provided that a determination about whether an individual is eligible
for special SSI cash benefits under  416.262 (section 1619(a) status) is an initial determination, and redesignated
the subsequent paragraphs. The change recognizes that transition alone from eligibility for regular SSI benefits
under section 1611 to eligibility for special SSI cash benefits under section 1619(a) and vice versa generally has
little practical effect on an individual. The change allows movement between the statuses to be made with fewer steps,
saving time and administrative expense. We believe this change is consistent with Congress' intent to simplify transitions
between benefit statuses.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940812-0-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940812-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, we revised  416.1403(a) to include in the list of administrative actions that are not initial determinations,
transitions from section 1611 to 1619(a) eligibility or section 1619(a) to 1611 eligibility. If a recipient's section
1611 or 1619(a) benefits are adversely affected (i.e., reduced, suspended, or terminated) for a reason unrelated
to his or her medical condition at the time of the shift, such planned action(s) will continue to be subject to advance
notice of benefit reduction, suspension, or termination and be covered as initial determinations under  416.1402(b).
If an individual's benefit amount increases, an initial determination is made under  416.1402(a). Determinations
about an individual's disability are also initial determinations under  416.1402.
Redesignated  416.1402(h) (former  416.1402(i)) provides that a determination about whether an individual
is eligible for special SSI eligibility status under  416.265 is an initial determination. Section 416.265
describes the eligibility requirements for special SSI eligibility status under section 1619(b).
Because we must make a threshold calculation and a finding that an individual needs Medicaid to continue working in
order to determine eligibility under section 1619(b), we will continue to provide an initial determination. Movement
from special SSI eligibility status under section 1619(b) back to regular SSI benefit status under section 1611 or
special SSI cash benefit status under section 1619(a) is defined to be an initial determination under  416.1402(a).


Public Comments


The following is a summary of the substantive comments we received on the proposed rules and our response to them.


Comment:

 The commenter was concerned about using gross earned income, rather than actual countable earnings, in transitions
between benefit statuses as described in   416.260, 416.261, and 416.262(b). The commenter was not so
much concerned with using the gross earned income amount at the time of the transition between benefit statuses, but
rather how that amount might be interpreted in other determinations in the SSI program. The commenter suggested adding
a clarifying statement indicating that the gross income amount used in the transition process is not to be considered
an SGA determination.


Response:

 Although in the preamble to the proposed rules (58 FR 52458, 52459) we stated that we would not make actual SGA determinations
on whether an individual is eligible for section 1619 status, we agree with the suggestion to add the clarifying statement
to these final rules. We have added the statement to  416.260, which deals specifically with transitions between
benefit statuses under sections 1611 and 1619.


Regulatory Procedures


Executive Order (E.O.) 12866


We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria
for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review.
All program changes reflected in these regulations related to Pub. L. 99-643 and Pub. L. 101-508 were implemented
on their respective effective dates. As of December 1993, there were 20,028 section 1619(a) participants and 35,299
section 1619(b) participants.


Paperwork Reduction Act


These regulations contain information collection requirements in  416.268. As required by the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), we submitted a copy to OMB for its review and we received clearance to collect
this information under OMB No. 0960-0267.
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 3 minutes per response. This includes
the time it will take to read the instructions, gather the necessary facts, and provide the information. Since we estimate
that 25,000 SSI recipients will provide this information, the total annual burden is estimated to be 1,250 hours.
Organizations or individuals desiring to submit comments on these information collection requirements should
direct them to the Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21235, Attention:
Reports Clearance Officer, 1-A-21 Operations Building, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, OMB, New Executive Office Building, Room 3208, Washington, D.C. 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for HHS.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


We certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they affect only individuals and States. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub.
L. 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.

2. The undesignated center heading immediately above  416.260 is revised to read as follows:



Special Provisions for People Who Work Despite a Disabling Impairment



3. Section 416.260 is revised to read as follows:



 416.260

General.



The regulations in   416.260 through 416.269 describe the rules for determining eligibility for special
SSI cash benefits and for special SSI eligibility status for an individual who works despite a disabling impairment.
Under these rules an individual who works despite a disabling impairment may qualify for special SSI cash benefits
and in most cases for Medicaid benefits when his or her gross earned income exceeds the applicable dollar amount which
ordinarily represents SGA described in  416.974(b)(2). The calculation of this gross earned income amount,
however, is not to be considered an actual SGA determination. Also, for purposes of determining eligibility or continuing
eligibility for Medicaid benefits, a blind or disabled individual (no longer eligible for regular SSI benefits or
for special SSI cash benefits) who, except for earnings, would otherwise be eligible for SSI cash benefits may be eligible
for a special SSI eligibility status under which he or she is considered to be a blind or disabled individual receiving
SSI benefits. We explain the rules for eligibility for special SSI cash benefits in   416.261 and 416.262.
We explain the rules for the special SSI eligibility status in   416.264 through 416.269.

4. The undesignated center heading immediately above  416.261 is removed.

5. Section 416.261 is amended by revising the first sentence to read as follows:



 416.261

What are special SSI cash benefits and when are they payable.



Special SSI cash benefits are benefits that we may pay you in lieu of regular SSI benefits because your gross earned
income in a month of initial eligibility for regular SSI benefits exceeds the amount ordinarily considered to represent
SGA under  416.974(b)(2). * * *


6. Section 416.262 is amended by revising the introductory text and paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) to read as follows:



 416.262

Eligibility requirements for special SSI cash benefits.



You are eligible for special SSI cash benefits if you meet the following requirements_

(a) You were eligible for a regular SSI benefit or a federally administered State supplementary payment (see  416.2001)
in a month before the month for which we are determining your eligibility for special SSI cash benefits as long as that
month was not in a prior period of eligibility which has terminated according to   416.1331 through 416.1335;

(b) In the month for which we are making the determination, your gross earned income exceeds the amount ordinarily
considered to represent SGA under  416.974(b)(2);

(c) * * *

(d) You meet all the nondisability requirements for eligibility for SSI benefits (see  416.202).


7. Section 416.264 is revised to read as follows:



 416.264



When does the special SSI eligibility status apply.



The special SSI eligibility status applies for the purposes of establishing or maintaining your eligibility for
Medicaid. For these purposes we continue to consider you to be a blind or disabled individual receiving benefits even
though you are in fact no longer receiving regular SSI benefits or special SSI cash benefits. You must meet the eligibility
requirements in  416.265 in order to qualify for the special SSI eligibility status. Special SSI eligibility
status also applies for purposes of reacquiring status as eligible for regular SSI benefits or special SSI cash benefits.

8. Section 416.265 is amended by revising the heading to the section, introductory paragraph and paragraphs (b) and
(d) to read as follows:



 416.265



Requirements for the special SSI eligibility status.



In order to be eligible for the special SSI eligibility status, you must have been eligible to receive a regular SSI
benefit or a federally administered State supplementary payment (see  416.2001) in a month before the month
for which we are making the special SSI eligibility status determination. The month you were eligible for a regular
SSI benefit or a federally administered State supplementary payment may not be in a prior period of eligibility which
has been terminated according to   416.1331 through 416.1335. For periods prior to May 1, 1991, you must
be under age 65. Also, we must establish that:


(a) * * *

(b) Except for your earnings, you meet all the nondisability requirements for eligibility for SSI benefits (see  416.202);


(c) * * *

(d) Your earnings after the exclusions in  416.1112(c) (6), (8), and (9) are not sufficient to allow you to provide
yourself with a reasonable equivalent of the benefits (SSI benefits, federally administered State supplementary
payments, Medicaid, and publicly-funded attendant care services, including personal care assistance under  416.269(d)
which would be available to you if you did not have those earnings (see  416.269).

9. The undesignated center heading immediately above  416.267 is removed.

10. Section 416.268 is revised to read as follows:

 416.268 

What is done to determine if you must have Medicaid in order to work.



For us to determine that you need Medicaid benefits in order to continue to work, you must establish:

(a) That you are currently using or have received services which were paid for by Medicaid during the period which began
12 months before our first contact with you to discuss this use; or

(b) That you expect to use these services within the next 12 months; or

(c) That you would need Medicaid to pay for unexpected medical expenses in the next 12 months.

11. Section 416.269 is revised to read as follows:



 416.269 

What is done to determine whether your earnings are too low to provide comparable benefits and services you would receive
in the absence of those earnings.



(a) 

What we determine. 

We must determine whether your earnings are too low to provide you with benefits and services comparable to the benefits
and services you would receive if you did not have those earnings (see  416.265(d)).

(b) 

How the determination is made. 

In determining whether your earnings are too low to provide you with benefits and services comparable to the benefits
and services you would receive if you did not have those earnings, we compare your anticipated gross earnings (or a
combination of anticipated and actual gross earnings, as appropriate) for the 12-month period beginning with the
month for which your special SSI eligibility status is being determined to a threshold amount for your State of residence.
This threshold amount consists of the sum for a 12-month period of two items, as follows:

(1) The amount of gross earnings including amounts excluded under  416.1112(c) (4), (5) and (7) that would reduce
to zero the Federal SSI benefit and the optional State supplementary payment for an individual with no other income
living in his or her own household in the State where you reside. This amount will varry from State to State depending
on the amount of the State supplementary payment; and

(2) The average expenditures for Medicaid benefits for disabled and blind SSI cash recipients, including recipients
of federally administered State supplementary payments only, in your State of residence.

(c) 

How the eligibility requirements are met.

(1) You meet the requirements in  416.265(d) if the comparison shows that your gross earnings are equal to or
less than the applicable threshold amount for your State, as determined under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section.
However, if the comparison shows that these earnings exceed the applicable threshold amount for your State, we will
establish (and use in a second comparison) an individualized threshold taking into account the total amount of:

(i) the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section that would reduce to zero the Federal SSI benefit
and State supplementary payment for your actual living arrangement;

(ii) the average Medicaid expenditures for your State of residence under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or, if higher,
your actual medical expenditures in the appropriate 12-month period;

(iii) any amounts excluded from your income as impairment-related work expenses (see  416.1112(c)(6)), work
expenses of the blind (see  416.1112(c)(8)), and income used or set aside for use under an approved plan for achieving
self support (see  416.1112(c)(9)); and

(iv) the value of any publicly-funded attendant care services as described in paragraph (d) of this section (including
personal care assistance).

(2) If you have already completed the 12-month period for which we are determining your eligibility, we will consider
only the expenditures made in that period.

(d) Attendant care services. 

Expenditures for attendant care services (including personal care assistance) which would be available to you in
the absence of earnings that make you ineligible for SSI cash benefits will be considered in the individualized threshold
(as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) if we establish that they are:

(1) Provided by a paid attendant;

(2) Needed to assist with work-related and/or personal functions; and

(3) Paid from Federal, State, or local funds.

Safety Zone; Mount Hope Bay, RI 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing temporary safety zones in Mount Hope Bay, in the vicinity of Fall River, MA for activities
associated with Fall River Celebrates America 1994, to take place August 11-14, 1994. Safety zones are being
established for two events during the weekend: for the tall ships parade on Friday, August 12, 1994, and for the fireworks
display the evening of August 13, 1994. These safety zones are needed to promote the safe navigation of vessels in Mount
Hope Bay in anticipation of an increased volume of vessel traffic due to spectator craft attending the events.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Drafting Information 


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LT J.C. Wong, Project Manager, Captain of the Port Providence,
and LCDR S.R. Watkins, Project Counsel, First Coast Guard District Legal Office. 



Regulatory History 



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists
for making it effective in less than 30 days after 

Federal Register

 publication. Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and delaying the events would be contrary to the public interest
since the tall ships parade and the fireworks display are important public events which coincide with the Fall River
Celebrates America festival. Immediate action is necessary to respond to any potential hazards associated with
the conduct of these events. 



Background and Purpose 



Fall River Celebrates America is a festival held annually in Fall River, MA, which entails several events throughout
the entire weekend. This year's celebration will be held August 11-14, 1994. The regulated events include a
parade of tall ships through Mount Hope Bay to the Fall River State Pier and a fireworks display in Mount Hope Bay. The
celebration is an important event for the town of Fall River as it draws numerous people to the area for the weekend,
increasing tourism and economically benefiting the town. 

The Coast Guard is establishing temporary safety zone regulations in Mount Hope Bay for the period August 12-13,
1994. These safety zones are necessary to control vessel movements during the various events in order to ensure the
safety of event participants, spectator craft, and other vessels transiting the waterway. They are necessary in
light of the limited size of the affected waterway and the expected number of spectator craft (more that 200 for each
event), which will greatly increase the congestion in the waterway and create a larger potential for marine accidents.


Chronologically, the events planned for this period relevant to this rule are as follows: 

(1) Tall ships parade, August 12, 1994. The parade of tall ships provides the kickoff for the Fall River Celebrates
America festival. The parade is significant because it allows the public to view the tall ships under sail before they
moor in Fall River for the weekend, and is intended to heighten the public interest in the upcoming weekend of events.
Approximately six tall ships are expected to participate in the parade. These ships will muster just north of the Mount
Hope Bridge and will transit the Mount Hope Bay Channel, from the Mount Hope Bay Junction Lighted Gong Buoy ``MH'' to
the Fall River State Pier. The parade is scheduled to take place between 4:45 p.m. and 6:15 p.m. The Coast Guard is establishing
a moving safety zone, from 200 yards ahead of the lead vessel in the parade, to 100 yards astern of the last vessel in the
parade, and 200 yards abeam of each parading vessel. This safety zone will be in effect for the duration of the parade
until each vessel is safely moored. This zone is needed to protect the tall ships, recreational boaters, spectators,
and other vessel traffic from the hazards posed by tall ships maneuvering among other vessels in constricted waters.


Implementation of this zone will close the affected portions of Mount Hope Bay to navigation by deep draft vessels
while the zone is in effect. Entry into the moving safety zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the
Port (COTP) Providence. 

(2) Fireworks, August 13, 1994. On the evening of August 13, 1994, Fall River Celebrates America will be sponsoring
a fireworks display that will take place in Mount Hope Bay, in the vicinity of Mount Hope Bay Channel Buoy 17. Two fireworks
barges will be anchored in approximate positions (41
 -42
'-42
'
'N, 071
 -09
'-52
'
'W) and (41
 -42
'-38
'
'N, 071
 -09
'-55
'
'W), from which the fireworks will be initiated. The fireworks are scheduled to take place between 9:30 p.m.
and 10 p.m. The Coast Guard is establishing safety zones in Mount Hope Bay to encompass the area of water within a three
hundred (300) yard radius around each fireworks barge. These safety zones will be in effect between 9:30 p.m. and 10
p.m. for the duration of the fireworks display. These safety zones are needed to protect the fireworks barges and attending
tugs, spectator craft, and other vessels or personnel in the area, from the hazards associated with explosive laden
barges and the display itself. Implementation of these zones will close the affected portion of the Mount Hope Bay
Channel to navigation by deep draft vessels while the zones are in effect. 



Regulatory Evaluation 


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940812-0-00049 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940812-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be minimal because these regulations will be in effect
only for small segments of a two day period, specifically for 1.5 hours on Friday, August 12, 1994, and for one half hour
on Saturday, August 13, 1994. The fact that the time periods for the safety zone are limited, as well as the advance notice
that will be given to potentially affected entities concerning the events and proposed safety zones, allow the impacted
vessel traffic to schedule transits and operations around the planned activities with minimal hardship. The entities
most likely to be affected are large commercial ships and barges in or outbound from Fall River terminals, fishing
vessels, and recreational vessels. Only a limited number of commercial vessel, approximately four or five, transit
the impacted water per week. Because of their limited number and the advance notice given, these vessels will not be
heavily impacted. Fishing and recreational vessels have shallow drafts such that they are able to transit the waters
around the regulated areas. These vessels have alternate routes available outside the main shipping channel and
outside the safety zones in which they may transit or conduct operations. Furthermore, in the case of the tall ships
parade safety zone, vessels will be able to transit the area as soon as the moving zone passes.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).

For the reasons outlined in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard expects the impact to be minimal on all
entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this final rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.)



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule and has concluded that under Section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to protect public
safety, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion
Determination will be made available in the docket.

Transportation Conformity; Approval of Petition for Exemption From Nitrogen Oxides Provisions, Victoria County,
TX 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is approving a petition from the State of Texas requesting that Victoria County, an incomplete data ozone nonattainment
area, be exempted from the requirement to perform the oxides of nitrogen (NO

x

) portion of the build/no-build test required by the new Federal transportation conformity rule. This petition for
exemption was submitted on May 4, 1994.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The transportation conformity final rule, entitled ``Criteria and Procedures for Determining Conformity to State
or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Funded or Approved Under Title
23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act,'' was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188). This action was required under Section 176(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended
in 1990. 
The transportation conformity rule requires each ozone nonattainment area and maintenance area to perform a regional
analysis of motor vehicle volatile organic compound and NO

X

 emissions from any planned transportation project. This analysis must demonstrate that the emissions which would
result from the proposed transportation system if the transportation plan were implemented are within the total
allowable level of emissions described in the motor vehicle emissions budget. 
Until an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan is approved by the EPA, this emissions analysis must pass the
build/no-build test. This analysis must demonstrate that the emissions from the planned transportation project,
if implemented, would be less than the emissions without the planned transportation project. Thus, the build/no-build
test is intended to ensure that the transportation plan contributes to annual emissions reductions consistent with
the CAA until such time as the attainment demonstration or maintenance plan is approved. 


Transportation Conformity and 182(f) Exemptions 


On June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31238) the EPA published a national interpretation of transportation conformity and 182(f)
exemptions entitled ``Transportation Conformity; General Preamble for Exemption From Nitrogen Oxides Provisions''
(General Preamble). This General Preamble clarifies and interprets how ozone nonattainment areas classified as
less than marginal, which have air quality monitoring data demonstrating attainment of the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, may be exempted from certain NO

X

 requirements. 
As discussed in the General Preamble, both the transportation conformity rule and CAA Section 182(f)(1)(A) state
that NO

X

 requirements shall not apply in nonattainment areas if the Administrator determines that additional reductions
of NO

X

 would not contribute to attainment of the NAAQS for ozone in the area. The EPA also issued two guidance documents on
182(f) exemptions. These two documents, ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Requirements for Areas Submitting Requests
for Redesignation to Attainment of the Ozone and Carbon Monoxide (CO) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)
on or after November 15, 1992'' dated September 17, 1993, and ``Guideline for Determining the Applicability of Nitrogen
Oxide Requirements under Section 182(f)'' dated December, 1993, state that if an area has attained the ozone standard,
additional NO

X

 reductions would not contribute to attainment. 
As explained in the General Preamble, the EPA believes that a demonstration of attainment made through adequate air
quality monitoring data, consistent with 40 CFR part 58 and recorded in EPA's Aerometric Information Retrieval System
(AIRS), can qualify an area as a ``clean data area''. Further, the EPA believes these ``clean data areas'' can request
an exemption from the NO

X

 provisions of transportation conformity. The 182(f) exemption will be conditioned upon the area's monitoring data
continuing to demonstrate attainment after an exemption is granted. If the EPA determines that an exempted area has
violated the ozone standard, the 182(f) exemption will be rescinded. Any decision to rescind the NO

X

 exemption would be based on an evaluation of the air quality data recorded in AIRS. Past conformity determinations
and transportation plans would not be affected, but new conformity determinations would be subject to the NO

X

 provisions of the conformity rule. 


Analysis of State Submittal 


Victoria County, Texas, retained its ozone nonattainment designation and was classified as an incomplete data area
for ozone on November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694). The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has operated an ozone
monitor in Victoria County continuously since May of 1991. No violations of the .12 parts per million ozone standard
have been recorded since that time. 
On May 4, 1994, the State of Texas submitted a petition to the EPA requesting that the Victoria County incomplete data
ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the requirement to perform the NO

X

 portion of the build/no-build test required by the new transportation conformity rule. This exemption request is
pursuant to the recently published General Preamble for transportation conformity NO

X

 exemptions.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940812-0-00052 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940812-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The exemption request was based on monitoring data which 
demonstrated that the NAAQS for ozone was attained in this area for the 35 months prior to the petition, with the understanding
that approval of the State's request would be contingent upon the collection and verification of one additional month
of data. The required additional month of verified data was submitted later and, together with the data submitted
with the State's petition, demonstrated attainment of the NAAQS for 36 consecutive months. Texas submitted its exemption
request prior to the publication of the national interpretation in order to expedite Victoria County's 1994 highway
project funding schedule. 



Final Action 



The EPA has evaluated the State's exemption request for consistency with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy.
The EPA believes that the exemption request and monitoring data qualifies Victoria County, Texas, as a ``clean data
area''. In addition, the EPA has determined that the exemption request meets the requirements and policy set forth
in the General Preamble for NO

X

 exemptions from the build/no-build test for transportation conformity, and today is approving Texas' request for
exemption from the NO

X

 build/no-build test of transportation conformity for Victoria County. The 182(f) exemption will be conditioned
upon the area's monitoring data continuing to demonstrate attainment after the exemption has been granted. If the
EPA later determines that Victoria County has violated the ozone standard, the 182(f) exemption will be rescinded.
Past conformity determinations and transportation plans would not be affected, but new conformity determinations
would then be subject to the NO

X

 provisions of the conformity rule. 

The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this FR publication, the EPA is proposing
to approve this exemption petition should adverse comments be received. This action will become effective on October
11, 1994, unless notice is received by September 12, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments.


If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent documents.
One document will withdraw the final action, and another final action will be published addressing any adverse comments.
If no such adverse comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on October 11, 1994.


The EPA has reviewed this request for exemption from the NO

X

 provisions of the Federal transportation conformity rule for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air
Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements.




Regulatory Process 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
et seq., the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule
on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the EPA may certify that the rule will
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities (see 46 FR 8709). Small entities include small
businesses, small 
not-for-profit enterprises, and governmental entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.


Because an exemption from the Federal transportation conformity rule does not impose any new requirements, I certify
that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State
relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry
into the economic reasonableness of State action.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 11, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration of this final
rule by the Administrator does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review; nor does it extend
the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such
rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. [See section 307(b)(2).]

 Area-wide nitrogen oxides exemptions. 



The Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission submitted to the EPA on May 4, 1994, a petition requesting that
the Victoria County incomplete data ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the requirement to meet the NO

X

 provisions of the Federal transportation conformity rule (40 CFR part 51, subpart T, and part 93, subpart A). The exemption
request was based on monitoring data which demonstrated that the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone
had been attained in this area for the 35 months prior to the petition, with the understanding that approval of the State's
request would be contingent upon the collection of one additional month of data. The required additional month of
verified data was submitted later and, together with the data submitted with the State's petition, demonstrated
attainment of the NAAQS for 36 consecutive months. The EPA approved this exemption request on October 11, 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This regulation adds the license plate code EC for the United States Enrichment Corporation, implements the Standard
Form (SF) 149A, U.S. Government Fleet Credit Card, and removes illustrations of forms. The new license plate code
was requested by the U.S. Enrichment Corporation and approved by the General Services Administration. The SF 149A
was developed to take advantage of electronic technology at vehicle fleet service activities. Illustrations of
forms in this regulation have been deemed unnecessary by the General Services Administration in most circumstances.
These actions will allow the U.S. Enrichment Corporation to procure motor vehicle license plates showing the code
designation EC, allow for the use of SF 149A, and remove unnecessary material from the regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this rule is not a significant rule for the purposes
of Executive Order 12866.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


This final rule is not required to be published in the 

Federal Register

 for notice and comment. Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.
The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 as a wholly-owned
Government corporation with the mission of managing the Government's Uranium Enrichment Enterprise (formerly
a part of the Department of Energy). On September 14, 1993, the USEC requested that license plate code EC be approved
for use on all license plates assigned to their motor vehicle fleet. This request was approved by the General Services
Administration on October 1, 1993.
The SF 149A is a magnetic stripe credit card issued by GSA under a single source, requirements contract. The SF 149A
will be accepted at Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) authorized vendor electronic point of sale (EPOS) terminals
throughout the United States (48 contiguous States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico). The SF 149A contains an encoded
magnetic stripe read by electronic point of sale terminals that activate fuel pumping equipment. EPOS vendors will
provide the date and place of purchase, purchase type, fuel and non-fuel type, and service level codes (

i.e.

, full and self service) in addition to the dollar value of each transaction.
Federal agencies with motor vehicles managed by the GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) will be issued
the SF 149A automatically as part of a mass re-issue beginning in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 1994.
GSA will continue to issue the SF 149, U.S. Government National Credit Card, to non-IFMS agencies. Credit card charges
for the SF 149 will continue to be processed manually at vendor facilities. GSA intends to gradually phase out the SF
149, but will maintain the SF 149 and the SF 149A until all non-IFMS fleet managers are participating in the EPOS program
using the SF 149A. Federal Government agency fleet managers that manage their agency-owned fleets may obtain the
electronically accepted SF 149A by notifying the General Services Administration, Attn: FBF, Washington, DC 20406.

Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area

AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for sablefish by operators of vessels using hook-and-line and pot gear in the
Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to
prevent exceeding the share of the sablefish total allowable catch (TAC) assigned to hook-and-line and pot gear in
the BS.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.


In accordance with  675.24(c)(1)(i), the share of the sablefish TAC assigned to hook-and-line and pot gear
in the BS was established by the final groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 229 metric tons.
The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with  675.24(d)(1), that the share of
the sablefish TAC assigned to hook-and-line and pot gear in the BS subarea will be taken before the end of the year. Therefore,
to provide adequate bycatch amounts of sablefish to ensure continued groundfish fishing activity by hook-and-line
and pot gear, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for sablefish by persons using hook-and-line and pot gear in the
BS effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., August 8, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at  675.20(h).

 Final Rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Corporation for National and Community Service (Corporation) is adopting in 
its final rules the following two Federal agency common 
rules: Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and 
Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments; and 
Governmentwide Debarment and Suspension (Nonprocurement) and Drug-Free Workplace 
(Grants). These regulations have been adopted by the 
Corporation because they are applicable to State and Local 
Governments that receive grants from the Corporation. In 
addition, all Corporation grantees must comply with the Governmentwide Debarment and 
Suspension and Drug-Free Workplace rules. By implementing 
these regulations, the Corporation grantees will know some of 
the terms and conditions of their respective grants.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background Information 


Part 2541 contains the Uniform Administrative 
Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments which is a common rule 
developed by OMB and adopted by the Federal agencies to 
ensure consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies in 
the administration of grants and cooperative agreements to 
State, local, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments. A full 
discussion of the issues pertaining to this rule is contained 
in the preamble to the final common rule that was adopted by 
23 Federal agencies and published in the 

Federal Register

 on 
March 11, 1988 (53 FR 8034). 
Part 2542 contains the Governmentwide Debarment and 
Suspension Requirements which were implemented pursuant to 
Executive Order 12549 to prevent waste, fraud and abuse in 
Federal nonprocurement transactions. A discussion of the 
issues pertaining to this rule is contained in the preamble of the final 
common rule that was adopted by 27 Federal agencies and 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 26, 1988 (53 FR 
19161). Part 2542 also contains the Governmentwide Drug-Free 
Workplace rules which were established to implement the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 
1988, 41 U.S.C. 701-722. The Drug Free Workplace Act 
requires that all grantees receiving grants from any Federal 
agency certify to that agency that they will maintain a 
drug-free workplace, or in the case of a grantee who is an individual, certify to the 
agency that his or her conduct of grant activity will be 
drug-free. A full discussion of the issues pertaining to 
this rule is contained in the preamble of the interim final 
rule that was adopted by 33 Federal agencies and published in the 

Federal 
Register

 on May 25, 1990 (55 FR 21679). 
The Corporation finds that publishing a notice of 
proposed rulemaking on these matters would be unnecessary, 
and contrary to the public interest, since the common rulemaking has been subjected to extensive public scrutiny

when OMB proposed and finalized the rules and 27 federal 
agencies issued these proposed rules for notice and comments. 
Consequently, the Corporation for good cause pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 553(b) has decided not to publish a proposed rulemaking on these 
matters and has adopted and published these rules as a final 
rule. This regulation is fully in effect. No further 
regulatory action by the Corporation is essential to the 
legal effectiveness of the rule. 
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is 
hereby certified that this final rule will not have a 
significant impact on small business entities.

 2541.20 

Scope of subpart. 


This subpart contains general rules pertaining to this part and procedures for control of exceptions from this part.



 2541.30 

Definitions. 


The following definitions apply to terms used in this 
part and part 2542 of this chapter. 
Accrued expenditures.

 The term 

accrued expenditures

 
means the charges incurred by the grantee during a given period 
requiring the provision of funds for: 
(1) Goods and other tangible property received; 
(2) Services performed by employees, contractors,

Subpart C_Post-Award Requirements


 2541.200 

Standards for financial management systems.


(a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting
for its own funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as its subgrantees and cost-type
contractors, must be sufficient to_
(1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the statutes authorizing the grant; and
(2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such funds have not been used in
violation of the restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
(b) The financial management systems of other grantees and subgrantees must meet the following standards:
(1) 

Financial reporting. 

Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be
made in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or subgrant.
(2) 

Accounting records. 

Grantees and subgrantees must maintain records which adequately identify the source and application of funds provided
for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards
and authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or expenditures, and income.
(3) 

Internal control. 

Effective control and accountability must be maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property,
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all such property and must assure that it is
used solely for authorized purposes.
(4) 

Budget control. 

Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information
must be related to performance or productivity data, including the development of unit cost information whenever
appropriate or specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost data are required, estimates
based on available documentation will be accepted whenever possible.
(5) 

Allowable cost. 

Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will
be followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and allocability of costs.
(6) 

Source documentation. 

Accounting records must be supported by such source documentation as canceled checks, paid bills, payrolls, time
and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
(7) 

Cash management. 

Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement
by grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment procedures are used. Grantees must establish
reasonable procedures to ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash disbursements in sufficient
time to enable them to prepare complete and accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, the grantee must make drawdowns as close as
possible to the time of making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their subgrantees to assure
that they conform substantially to the same standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
(c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial management system of any applicant for financial assistance
as part of a preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


 2541.210 

Payment.


(a) 

Scope. 

This section prescribes the basic standard and the methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees,
and grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
(b) 

Basic standard. 

Methods and procedures for payment shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement
by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
(c) 

Advances. 

Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability
to maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of the funds and their disbursement by the
grantee or subgrantee.
(d) 

Reimbursement. 

Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation,
Federal agencies shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction grants. The grantee or subgrantee
may use that method to pay its construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments to the grantee
or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
(e) 

Working capital advances. 

If a grantee cannot meet the criteria for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the Federal
agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the grantee lacks sufficient working capital,
the awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure the awarding agency
shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared
to the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall reimburse the grantee for its actual cash
disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or subgrantees if the reason
for using such method is the unwillingness or inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee
to meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
(f) 

Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on payment. 

(1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting
additional cash payments for the same activity.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees and subgrantees shall disburse program income,
rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional
cash payments.
(g) 

Withholding payments. 

(1) Unless otherwise required by Federal statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges
incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless_
(i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award conditions; or
(ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.

(2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, but without suspension of the grant, shall be released
to the grantee upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance
with  2541.410(c).
(3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from
payment to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the Federal agency when
the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established
to assure satisfactory completion of work.
(h) 

Cash depositories. 

(1) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by minority group members).

Washington, DC 20230.
(2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account only when required by Federal-State agreement.

quarterly, remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or subgrantee may keep interest amounts
up to $100 per year for administrative expenses.

(a) 

Limitation on use of funds. 

Grant funds may be used only for_
(1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type contractors, including allowable costs in the
form of payments to fixed-price contractors; and
(2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any fee or profit (or other increment above allowable
costs) to the grantee or subgrantee.
(b) 

Applicable cost principles. 

For each kind of organization, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowable costs
will be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost principles:






 2541.230 

Period of availability of funds.

Liquidation of obligations. 

A grantee must liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the end of the funding
period (or as specified in a program regulation) to coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report

applies.
(b) 

Qualifications and exceptions_

(2) 

General revenue sharing. 

For the purpose of this section, general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not considered
Federal grant funds.
(3) 

Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-sharing requirements. 

Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching
requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching
requirement of another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any other award of Federal funds.
(4) 

Costs financed by program income. 

Costs financed by program income, as defined in  2541.250, shall not count towards satisfying a cost sharing

requirement must be verifiable from the records of grantees 
and subgrantee or cost-type contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party in-kind 
contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the 
organization uses to support the allocability of regular 
personnel costs. 


(7) 

Special standards for third party in-kind contributions

. 
(i) Third party in-kind contributions count towards 
satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only where, 
if the party receiving the contributions were to pay for 
them, the payments would be allowable costs. 


(ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods 
and services that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor 
receiving the contribution had to pay for them, the payments 
would have been an indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions shall be given only if the

grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has established, along 
with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate for 
allocating to individual projects or programs the value of 
the contributions. 


(iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement only if it results in: 


(A) An increase in the services or property provided 
under the contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee); or 


(B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee. 


(iv) The values placed on third party in-kind 
contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes will 
conform to the rules in the succeeding sections of this part. 
If a third party in-kind contribution is a type not treated in those 
sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair and 
reasonable. 


(c) 

Valuation of donated services

_(1) 

Volunteer 
services

. Unpaid services provided to a grantee or subgrantee 
by individuals will be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for 
similar work in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. 
If the grantee or subgrantee does not have employees 
performing similar work, the rates will be consistent with 
those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work in the same labor market. 
In either case, a reasonable amount for fringe benefits may 
be included in the valuation. 


(2) 

Employees of other organizations

. When an employer 
other than a grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge the services of an employee 
in the employee's normal line of work, the services will be 
valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive of the 
employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the 
services are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies. 


(d) 

Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned 
equipment or space

. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the 
contribution will be valued at the market value of the 
supplies at the time of donation. 


(2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or 
space in a building but retains title, the contribution will 
be valued at the fair rental rate of the equipment or space. 


(e) 

Valuation of third party donated equipment, 
buildings, and land

. If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or 
land, and title passes to a grantee or subgrantee, the 
treatment of the donated property will depend upon the 
purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows: 


(1) 

Awards for capital expenditures

. If the purpose of the grant or subgrant is to assist the grantee 
or subgrantee in the acquisition of property, the market 
value of that property at the time of donation may be counted 
as cost sharing or matching. 


(2) 

Other awards

. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not the purpose of the grant or subgrant, 
paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section apply: 


(i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, 
the market value at the time of donation of the donated 
equipment or buildings and the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of 
the grant agreement may require that the approval be obtained 
from the Federal agency as well as the grantee. In all cases, 
the approval may be given only if a purchase of the equipment or 
rental of the land would be approved as an allowable direct 
cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired with 
Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may 
be counted as cost-sharing or matching. 


(ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph 
(e)(2)(i) of this section, no amount may be counted for 
donated land, and only depreciation or use allowances may be 
counted for donated equipment and buildings. The depreciation 
or use allowances for this property are not treated as third party 
in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated as costs 
incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the 
cost principles specified in  2541.220, in the same way as depreciation or 
use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The 
amount of depreciation or use allowances for donated 
equipment and buildings is based on the property's market 
value at the time it was donated. 


(f) 

Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real 
property for construction/acquisition

. If a grantee or 
subgrantee donates real property for a construction or 
facilities acquisition project, the current market value of 
that property may be counted as cost sharing or matching. If any part of the donated 
property was acquired with Federal funds, only the 
non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching. 


(g) 

Appraisal of real property

. In some cases under 
paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to 
establish the market value of land or a building or the fair 
rental rate of land or of space in a building. In these 
cases, the Federal agency may require the market value or 
fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, and that the value or rate be 
certified by the grantee. This requirement will also be 
imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.

 2541.250 

Program income. 




(a) 

General

. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to 
defray program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal 
property acquired with grant funds, from the sale of 
commodities or items fabricated under a grant agreement, and 
from payments of principal and interest on loans made with grant funds. Except as 
otherwise provided in regulations of the Federal agency, 
program income does not include interest on grant funds, 
rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest 
earned on any of them. 


(b) 

Definition of program income

. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a 
grant supported activity, or earned only as a result of the 
grant agreement during the grant period. ``During the grant 
period'' is the time between the effective date of the award and the ending 
date of the award reflected in the final financial report. 


(c) 

Cost of generating program income

. If authorized by 
Federal regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to 
the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine 
program income. 


(d) 

Governmental revenues

. Taxes, special assessments, 
levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or 
subgrantee are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal

agency regulations as program income. 


(e) 

Royalties

. Income from royalties and license fees 
for copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed 
by a grantee or subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically identified in the grant 
agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income. 
(See  2541.340) 


(f) 

Property

. Proceeds from the sale of real property 
or equipment will be handled in accordance with the 
requirements of   2541.310 and 2541.320. 


(g) 

Use of program income

. Program income shall be 
deducted from outlays which may be both Federal and 
non-Federal as described in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, unless the 
Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives).
In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish 
between income earned by the grantee and income earned by 
subgrantees and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of 
income. When Federal agencies authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) 
and (3) of this section, program income in excess of any 
limits stipulated shall also be deducted from outlays. 


(1) 

Deduction

. Ordinarily program income shall be 
deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income 
shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did 
not anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to 
reduce the Federal agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project. 


(2) 

Addition

. When authorized, program income may be 
added to the funds committed to the grant agreement by the 
Federal agency and the grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the 
grant agreement. 


(3) 

Cost sharing or matching

. When authorized, program 
income may be used to meet the cost sharing or matching 
requirement of the grant agreement. The amount of the Federal 
grant award remains the same. 


(h) 

Income after the award period

. There are no Federal 
requirements governing the disposition of program income 
earned after the end of the award period (i.e., until the 
ending date of the final financial report, see paragraph (a) 
of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or the 
Federal agency regulations provide otherwise. 



 2541.260 

Non-Federal audit. 




(a) 

Basic rule

. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible 
for obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act 
of 1984 (31 U.S.C.7501-7) and Federal agency implementing 
regulations. The audits shall be made by an independent 
auditor in accordance with generally accepted government 
auditing standards covering financial and compliance audits.

(b) 

Subgrantees.

 State or local governments, as those terms are defined for purposes 
of the Single Audit Act, that receive Federal financial 
assistance and provide $25,000 or more of it in a fiscal year 
to a subgrantee shall: 

(1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees

covered by OMB Circular A-110, ``Uniform Requirements for 
Grants and Other Agreements with Institutions of Higher 
Education, Hospitals and Other Nonprofit Organizations'' have 
met the audit requirement. Commercial contractors (private for profit and private 
and governmental organizations) providing goods and services 
to State and local governments are not required to have a 
single audit performed. State and local governments should 
use their own procedures to ensure that the contractor has complied with laws 
and regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal funds; 

(2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal 
assistance funds provided in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations. This may be accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee 
made in accordance with the Act, Circular A-110, or through 
other means (e.g., program reviews) if the subgrantee has not 
had such an audit; 

(3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six months after receipt of the audit report in 
instance of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations; 

(4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate 
adjustment of the grantee's own records; and 

(5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have access to the records and 
financial statements. 

(c) 

Auditor selection.

 In arranging for audit services, 
 2541.360 shall be followed. 



Subpart D_Changes, Property and Subawards 



 2541.300 

Changes. 



(a) 

General.

 Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to re budget within the approved 
direct cost budget to meet unanticipated requirements and may 
make limited program changes to the approved project. 
However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types 
of post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior written 
approval of the awarding agency. 

(b) 

Relation to cost principles.

 The applicable cost 
principles (see  2541.220) contain requirements for prior 
approval of certain types of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and subgrants 
even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not. 

(c) 

Budget changes.

_(1) 

Nonconstruction projects.

 Except 
as stated in other regulations or an award document, grantees 
or subgrantees shall obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever 
any of the following changes is anticipated under a 
nonconstruction award: 

(i) Any revision which would result in the need for 
additional funding. 

(ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers among direct cost categories, or, if 
applicable, among separately budgeted programs, projects, 
functions, or activities which exceed or are expected to 
exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000. 

(iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances 
(i.e., from direct payments to trainees to other expense 
categories). 

(2) 

Construction projects.

 Grantees and subgrantees 
shall obtain prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the need for additional 
funds. 

(3) 

Combined construction and nonconstruction projects.

 
When a grant or subgrant provides funding for both 
construction and nonconstruction activities, the grantee or 
subgrantee must obtain prior written approval from the awarding agency before making 
any fund or budget transfer from nonconstruction to 
construction or vice versa. 

(d) 

Programmatic changes.

 Grantees or subgrantees must 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following actions is anticipated: 

(1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the 
project (regardless of whether there is an associated budget 
revision requiring prior approval). 

(2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds. 

(3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change 
in the project director or principal investigator shall 
always require approval unless waived by the awarding 
agency. 

(4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if authorized by 
law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party to 
perform activities which are central to the purposes of the 
award. This approval requirement is in addition to the 
approval requirements of  2541.360 but does not apply to the procurement of 
equipment, supplies, and general support services. 

(e) 

Additional prior approval requirements.

 The awarding 
agency may not require prior approval for any budget revision 
which is not described in paragraph (c) of this section. 

(f) 

Requesting prior approval.

 (1) A request for prior 
approval of any budget revision will be in the same budget 
formal the grantee used in its application and shall be 
accompanied by a narrative justification for the proposed revision. 

(2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable 
Federal cost principles (see  2541.220) may be made by 
letter. 

(3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be 
addressed in writing to the grantee. The grantee will 
promptly review such request and shall approve or disapprove the request 
in writing. A grantee will not approve any budget or project 
revision which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and 
conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. If the 
revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to the 
grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior 
approval, the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's 
approval before approving the subgrantee's request. 



 2541.310 

Real property. 



(a) 

Title.

 Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this 
section, title to real property acquired under a grant or 
subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or 
subgrantee respectively. 

(b) 

Use.

 Except as otherwise provided by Federal 
statutes, real property will be used for the originally authorized 
purposes as long as needed for that purposes, and the grantee 
or subgrantee shall not dispose of or encumber its title or 
other interests. 

(c) 

Disposition.

 When real property is no longer needed 
for the originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee 
will request disposition instructions from the awarding 
agency. The instructions will provide for one of the 
following alternatives:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940812-0-00070 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940812-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) 

Retention of title.

 Retain title after compensating 
the awarding agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will 
be computed by applying the awarding agency's percentage of 
participation in the cost of the original purchase to the 
fair market value of the property. However, in those 
situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing of real property acquired with 
grant funds and acquiring replacement real property under the 
same program, the net proceeds from the disposition may be 
used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property. 

(2) 

Sale of property.

 Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be 
calculated by applying the awarding agency's percentage of 
participation in the cost of the original purchase to the 
proceeds of the sale after deduction of any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up 
expenses. If the grant is still active, the net proceeds from 
sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. 
When a grantee or subgrantee is directed to sell property, 
sales procedures shall be followed that provide for competition to the 
extent practicable and result in the highest possible 
return. 

(3) 

Transfer of title.

 Transfer title to the awarding 
agency or to a third-party designated/approved by the 
awarding agency. The grantee or subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by 
applying the grantee or subgrantee's percentage of 
participation in the purchase of the real property to the 
current fair market value of the property. 



 2541.320 

Equipment. 



(a) 

Title.

 Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to 
equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon 
acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively. 

(b) 

States.

 A State will use, manage, and dispose of 
equipment acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow 
paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section. 

(c) 

Use.

 (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or 
subgrantee in the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the 
project or program continues to be supported by Federal 
funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities 
currently or previously supported by a Federal agency. 

(2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment 
available for use on other projects or programs currently or 
previously supported by the Federal Government, providing 
such use will not interfere with the work on the projects or program for which it was originally acquired. First 
preference for other use shall be given to other programs or 
projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate. 

(3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in  2541.250(a) to earn program income, the grantee or subgrantee must

not use equipment acquired with grant funds to provide 
services for a fee to compete unfairly with private companies 
that provide equivalent services, unless specifically 
permitted or contemplated by Federal statute. 

(4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or 
subgrantee may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in 
or sell the property and use the proceeds to offset the cost 
of the replacement property, subject to the approval of the awarding agency. 

(d) 

Management requirements.

 Procedures for managing 
equipment (including replacement equipment), whether acquired 
in whole or in part with grant funds, until disposition takes 
place will, as a minimum, meet the following requirements: 

(1) Property records must be maintained that include a 
description of the property, a serial number or other 
identification number, the source of property, who holds 
title, the acquisition date, and cost of the property, 
percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the property, the location, use and 
condition of the property, and any ultimate disposition data 
including the date of disposal and sale price of the 
property. 

(2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken 
and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years. 

(3) A control system must be developed to ensure 
adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the 
property. Any loss, damage, or theft shall be investigated. 

(4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the property in 
good condition. 

(5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or 
required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must 
be established to ensure the highest possible return. 

(e) 

Disposition.

 When original or replacement equipment acquired under a 
grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original 
project or program or for other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency, disposition of the 
equipment will be made as follows: 

(1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair 
market value of less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or 
otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the 
awarding agency. 

(2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair 
market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the 
awarding agency shall have a right to an amount calculated by 
multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by 
the awarding agency's share of the equipment. 

(3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate disposition actions, 
the awarding agency may direct the grantee or subgrantee to 
take excess and disposition actions. 

(f) 

Federal equipment.

 In the event a grantee or 
subgrantee is provided federally-owned equipment: 

(1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government. 

(2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in 
accordance with Federal agency rules and procedures, and 
submit an annual inventory listing. 

(3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition 
instructions from the Federal agency. 

(g) 

Right to transfer title.

 The Federal awarding agency 
may reserve the right to transfer title to the Federal 
Government or a third part named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise eligible under 
existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940812-0-00071 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940812-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) The property shall be identified in the grant or 
otherwise made known to the grantee in writing. 

(2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction within 120 
calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding 
agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 
calendar-day period the grantee shall follow paragraph (e) of this section. 

(3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee 
shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage 
of participation in the purchase to the current fair market 
value of the property. 



 2541.330 

Supplies. 



(a) 

Title.

 Title to supplies acquired under a grant or 
subgrant will vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or 
subgrantee respectively. 

(b) 

Disposition.

 If there is a residual inventory of 
unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination or 
completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed 
for any other federally sponsored programs or projects, the 
grantee or subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency 
for its share. 



 2541.340 

Copyrights. 



The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, 
non-exclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish 
or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, for Federal 
Government purposes: 

(a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or contract under a grant or subgrant; 
and 

(b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, 
subgrantee or a contractor purchases ownership with grant 
support. 



 2541.350 

Subawards to debarred and suspended parties. 



Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award (subgrant 
or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for 
participation in Federal assistance programs under Executive 
Order 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' 



 2541.360 

Procurement. 



(a) 

States.

 When procuring property and services under a 
grant, a State will follow the same policies and procedures 
it uses for procurements from its non-Federal funds. The 
State will ensure that every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow 
paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section. 

(b) 

Procurement standards.

 (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use their own procurement 
procedures which reflect applicable State and local laws and 
regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this 
section. 

(2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration system 
which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or 
purchase orders. 

(3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of standards of conduct governing the performance of their

employees engaged in the award and administration of 
contracts. No employee, officer or agent of the grantee or 
subgrantee shall participate in selection, or in the award or 
administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a conflict of 
interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such a 
conflict would arise when_

(i) The employee, officer or agent; 

(ii) Any member of his immediate family; 

(iii) His or her partner; or 

(iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the 
above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected 
for award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees 
or agents will neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors 
or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or 
parties to subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set 
minimum rules where the financial interest is not substantial 
or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic 
value. To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, such 
standards or conduct will provide for penalties, sanctions, 
or other disciplinary actions for violations of such 
standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, 
employees, or agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in regulation 
provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, 
or potential conflicts of interest. 

(4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a 
review of proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration 
should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements 
to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, 
and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical 
approach. 

(5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common 
goods and services. 

(6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use 
Federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new 
equipment and property whenever such use is feasible and 
reduces project costs. 

(7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction 
projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities 
for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and 
creative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure 
that its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost.

<TEXT>
 

(8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to 
responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform 
successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed 
procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with 
public policy, record of past performance, and financial and 
technical resources. 

(9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records 
sufficient to detail the significant history of a 
procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to 
the following: Rationale for the method of procurement, 
selection of contract type, contractor selection or 
rejection, and the basis for the contract price. 

(10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type contracts only_ 

(i) After a determination that no other contract is 
suitable; and 

(ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the 
contractor exceeds at its own risk. 

(11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound

business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and 
administrative issues arising out of procurements. These 
issues include, but are not limited to source evaluation, 
protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the grantee or 
subgrantee of any contractual responsibilities under its 
contracts. Federal agencies will not substitute their 
judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless the 
matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, 
State, or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction. 

(12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest 
procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to their 
procurements and shall in all instances disclose information regarding the protest to the 
awarding agency. A protester must exhaust all administrative 
remedies with the grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a 
protest with the Federal agency. Reviews of protests by the 
Federal agency will be limited to: 

(i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the 
standards of this section (violations of State or local law 
will be under the jurisdiction of State or local authorities); 
and 

(ii) Violations of the grantee's or sub-grantee's 
protest procedures for failure to review a complaint or protest. 
Protests received by the Federal agency other than those 
specified in this paragraph (b)(12)(ii) will be referred 
to the grantee or subgrantee. 

(c) 

Competition.

 (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open 
competition consistent with the standards of this section. 
Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of 
competition include but are not limited to: 

(i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business; 

(ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive 
bonding; 

(iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or 
between affiliated companies; 

(iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on 
retainer contracts;

(v) Organizational conflicts of interest; 
(vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of 
allowing ``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the 
performance of other relevant requirements of the 
procurement; and 
(vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process. 
(2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements 
in a manner that prohibits the use of statutory or 
administratively imposed in-State or local geographical 
preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing 
in this section preempts State licensing laws. When 
contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, 
geographic location may be a selection criteria provided its application leaves 
an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature 
and size of the project, to compete for the contract. 
(3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for 
procurement transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations: 
(i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the 
technical requirements for the material, product, or service 
to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive 
procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may 
include a statement of the qualitative nature of the 
material, product or service to be procured, and when 
necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential 
characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. 
Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all 
possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a 
clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, 
a ``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the 
performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. 
The specific features of the named brand which must be met by 
offerors shall be clearly stated; and 
(ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in 
evaluating bids or proposals. 
(4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all 
prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are 
used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free

competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will not 
preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the 
solicitation period. 
(d) 

Methods of procurement to be followed

_(1) 


Procurement by small purchase procedures. 

Small purchase procedures are those 
relatively simple and informal procurement methods for 
securing services, supplies, or other property that do not 
cost more than $25,000 in the aggregate. If small purchase 
procurements are used, price or rate quotations will be obtained from an adequate 
number of qualified sources. 
(2) 

Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). 


Bids are publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract 
(lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms 
and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in 
price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of 
this section apply. 
(i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present: 
(A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or 
purchase description is available; 
(B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able 
to compete effectively for the business; and 
(C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price 
contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be 
made principally on the basis of price. 
(ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements 
apply: 
(A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known 
suppliers, providing them sufficient time prior to the date 
set for opening the bids; 
(B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, shall define the items

or services in order for the bidder to properly respond; 
(C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and 
place prescribed in the invitation for bids; 
(D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and 
responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, 
factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is 
lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken 
advantage of; and 
(E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound 
documented reason. 
(3) 

Procurement by competitive proposals. 

The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with 
more than one source submitting an offer, and either a 
fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. 
It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for 
the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements 
apply: 
(i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and 
identify all evaluation factors and their relative 
importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals 
shall be honored to the maximum extent practical; 
(ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number 
of qualified sources; 
(iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for 
conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received 
and for selecting awardees; 
(iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is most 
advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and 
(v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive 
proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of 
architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby competitors' 
qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified 
competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and 
reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used 
as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of 
services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform 
the proposed effort. 
(4) 

Procurement by noncompetitive proposals. 

This 
procurement is through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or 
after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.

<TEXT>
 

(i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used 
only when the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals

and one of the following circumstances applies: 
(A) The item is available only from a single source; 
(B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement 
will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation; 
(C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive 
proposals; or 
(D) After solicitation of a number of sources, 
competition is determined inadequate. 
(ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost 
data, the projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profit, is required. 
(iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit 
the proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award 
review in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. 
(e) 

Contracting with small and minority firms, women's 
business enterprise and labor surplus area firms. 

(1) The 
grantee and subgrantee will take all necessary affirmative 
steps to assure that minority firms, women's business 
enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible. 
(2) Affirmative steps shall include: 
(i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and 
women's business enterprises on solicitation lists; 
(ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and 
women's business enterprises are solicited whenever they are 
potential sources; 
(iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically 
feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum 
participation by small and minority business, and women's 
business enterprises; 
(iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the 
requirement permits, which encourage participation by small 
and minority business, and women's business enterprises; 
(v) Using the services and assistance of the Small 
Business Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and 
(vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are 
to be let, to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs 
(e)(2) (i) through (v) of this section. 
(f) 

Contract cost and price. 

(1) Grantees and subgrantees must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and 
degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the 
particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A 
cost analysis must be performed when the offeror is required 
to submit the elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under 
professional, consulting, and architectural engineering services contracts. A 
cost analysis will be necessary when adequate price 
competition is lacking, and for sole source procurements, 
including contract modifications or change orders, unless 
price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog or market price of a 
commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the 
general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to 
determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price. 
(2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a 
separate element of the price for each contract in which 
there is no price competition and in all cases where cost 
analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to the 
complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of 
subcontracting, the quality of its record of past 
performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work. 
(3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for 
contracts under grants will be allowable only to the extent 
that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated 
prices are consistent with Federal cost principles (see  2541.220). Grantees may 
reference their own cost principles that comply with the 
applicable Federal cost principles. 
(4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used. 
(g) 

Awarding agency review. 

(1) Grantees and subgrantees 
must make available, upon request of the awarding agency, 
technical specifications on proposed procurements where the 
awarding agency believes such review is needed to ensure that 
the item and/or service specified is the one being proposed for 
purchase. This review generally will take place prior to the 
time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to 
have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with 
such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the 
proposed purchase. 
(2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make 
available for awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, 
such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, 
independent cost estimates, etc., when_ 
(i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures 
or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or 
(ii) The procurement is expected to exceed $25,000 and 
is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer 
is received in response to a solicitation; or 
(iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed 
$25,000, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or 
(iv) The proposed award over $25,000 is to be awarded to 
other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid 
procurement; or 
(v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope 
of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than $25,000.

<TEXT>
 

(3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the 
pre-award review in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the 
awarding agency determines that its procurement systems 
comply with the standards of this section. 
(i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its 
system meets these standards in order for its system to be 
certified. Generally, these reviews shall occur where there 
is a continuous high-dollar funding, and third-party contracts are awarded 
on a regular basis. 
(ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its 
procurement system. Such self-certification shall not limit 
the awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a 
self-certification procedure, awarding agencies may wish to rely on 
written assurances from the grantee or subgrantee that it is 
complying with these standards. A grantee or subgrantee will 
cite specific procedures, regulations, standards, etc., as 
being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available 
for review. 
(h) 

Bonding requirements. 

For construction or facility 
improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the 
awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency has 
made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been 
made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows: 
(1) 

A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. 

The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument

accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon 
acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required 
within the time specified. 
(2) 

A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 
100 percent of the contract price. 

A ``performance bond'' is 
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such 
contract. 
(3) 

A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 
percent of the contract price. 

A ``payment bond'' is one 
executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as 
required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the 
execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
(i) 

Contract provisions. 

A grantee's and subgrantee's 
contracts must contain provisions in this paragraph of this 
section. Federal agencies are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, 
access and records retention, suspension of work, and other 
clauses approved by the Office of Procurement Policy. 
(1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in 
instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions 
and penalties as may be appropriate (contracts other than 
small purchases). 
(2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the 
grantee or subgrantee including the manner by which it will 
be effected and the basis for settlement (all contracts in excess 
of $10,000).

of Labor regulations (41 CFR chapter 60) (all construction contracts awarded in excess of $10,000 by 
grantees and their contractors or subgrantees). 
(4) Compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 
U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3) (all contracts 
and subgrants for construction or repair). 
(5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a 
to a-7) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations 
(29 CFR part 5) (construction contracts in excess of $2,000 awarded by grantees and subgrantees 
when required by Federal grant program legislation). 
(6) Compliance with sections 103 and 107 of the Contract 
Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as 
supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5) (construction contracts awarded by grantees and
subgrantees in excess of $2,000, and 
in excess of $2,500 for other contracts which involve the 
employment of mechanics or laborers). 
(7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to reporting. 
(8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and 
regulations pertaining to patent rights with respect to any 
discovery or invention which arises or is developed in the 
course of or under such contract.

which are directly pertinent to that specific contract for 
the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions. 
(11) Retention of all required records for three years 
after grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other 
pending matters are closed. 
(12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders,

Subpart E_Reports, Records, Retention and Enforcment 


 2541.400 


Monitoring and reporting program performance. 


(a) 

Monitoring by grantees. 

Grantees are responsible for 
managing the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. Grantees must 
monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that 
performance goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring 
must cover each program, function or activity. 
(b) 

Nonconstruction performance reports. 

The Federal 
agency may, if it decides that performance information 
available from subsequent applications contains sufficient 
information to meet its programmatic needs, require the 
grantee to submit a performance report only upon expiration or 
termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final 
Financial Status Report. 
(1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports 
unless the awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual 
reports. However, performance reports will not be required 
more frequently than quarterly. Annual reports shall be due 
90 days after the grant year, quarterly or semi-annual 
reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The final performance report 
will be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any 
performance report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency. 
(2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, 
brief information on the following: 
(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the 
objectives established for the period. Where the output of the project can 
be quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output 
may be required if that information will be useful. 
(ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives 
were not met. 
(iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit 
costs. 
(3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than 
the original and two copies of performance reports. 
(4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in prescribing performance 
reporting requirements for subgrantees. 
(c) 

Construction performance reports. 

For the most part, 
on-site technical inspections and certified 
percentage-of-completion data are relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under construction
grants 
and subgrants. The Federal agency will require additional 
formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly. 
(d) 

Significant developments. 

Events may occur between the scheduled performance reporting dates 
which have significant impact upon the grant or subgrant 
supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of 
conditions become known: 
(1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will 
materially impair the ability to meet the objective of the 
award. This disclosure must include a statement of the action 
taken, or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve 
the situation.

(2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules 
and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or 
producing more beneficial results than originally planned. 
(e) 

Site visits. 

Federal agencies may make site visits 
as warranted by program needs. 
(f) 

Waivers, extensions. 

(1) Federal agencies may waive 
any performance report required by this part if not needed. 
(2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a 
subgrantee when not needed. The grantee may extend the due 
date for any performance report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still 
be able to meet its performance reporting obligations to the 
Federal agency. 


 2541.410 

Financial reporting. 


(a) 

General._

(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) 
(2) and (5) of this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other 
forms as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for: 
(i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies; 
or 
(ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit are not 
used. 
(2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this 
section in dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees 
shall not impose more burdensome requirements on 
subgrantees. 
(3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extent 
required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in 
connection with forms specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) 
of this section. Federal agencies may issue substantive supplementary 
instructions only with the approval of OMB. Federal agencies 
may shade out or instruct the grantee to disregard any line 
item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for its 
decision making purposes. 
(4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the 
original and two copies of forms required under this part. 
(5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to 
grantees to expedite or contribute to the accuracy of 
reporting. Federal agencies may accept the required information from grantees in machine 
usable format or computer printouts instead of prescribed 
forms. 
(6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by 
this section if not needed. 
(7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report upon receiving a justified request from a 
grantee. 
(b) 

Financial Status Report._

(1)

 Form.

 Grantees will 
use Standard Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to 
report the status of funds for all nonconstruction grants and 
for construction grants when required in accordance with paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii) of this section. 
(2) 

Accounting basis. 

Each grantee will report program 
outlays and program income on a cash or accrual basis as 
prescribed by the awarding agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the grantee's accounting

records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the 
grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting 
system but shall develop such accrual information through an 
analysis of the documentation on hand. 
(3) 

Frequency. 

The Federal agency may prescribe the 
frequency of the report for each project or program. However, 
the report will not be required more frequently than 
quarterly. If the Federal agency does not specify the 
frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A final report will be 
required upon expiration or termination of grant support. 
(4) 

Due date. 

When reports are required on a quarterly 
or semiannual basis, they will be due 30 days after the 
reporting period. When required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the 
grant year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the 
expiration or termination of grant support. 
(c) 

Federal Cash Transactions Report._

(1) 

Form. 

(i) For 
grants paid by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of funds, the 
grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation 
sheet, Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award 
exempt the grantee from this requirement. 
(ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to 
monitor cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement 
or outlay information for each grant from grantees. The 
format of the report may be adapted as appropriate when 
reporting is to be accomplished with the assistance of automatic data 
processing equipment provided that the information to be 
submitted is not changed in substance. 
(2) 

Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. 

Forecasts of 
Federal cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the report.

(3) 

Cash in hands of subgrantees. 

When considered 
necessary and feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be 
required to report the amount of cash advances in excess of 
three days' needs in the hands of their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the 
excess balances. 
(4) 

Frequency and due date. 

Grantees must submit the 
report no later than 15 working days following the end of 
each quarter. However, where an advance either by letter of credit or 
electronic transfer of funds is authorized at an annualized 
rate of one million dollars or more, the Federal agency may 
require the report to be submitted within 15 working days 
following the end of each month. 
(d) 

Request for advance or reimbursement._

(1) 

Advance 
payments. 

Requests for Treasury check advance payments will 
be submitted on Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or 
Reimbursement. (This form will not be used for drawdowns 
under a letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or when Treasury check 
advance payments are made to the grantee automatically on a 
predetermined basis.) 
(2) 

Reimbursements. 

Requests for reimbursement under 
nonconstruction grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement requests under construction

grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this section.)

treated in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 
(e) 

Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction programs._

(1) 

Grants that support construction 
activities paid by reimbursement method. 

(i) Requests for 
reimbursement under construction grants will be submitted on 
Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, prescribe the 
Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section, instead of this form. 
(ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests 
is treated in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 
(2) 

Grants that support construction activities paid by 
letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check 
advance.

credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, 
the grantee will report its outlays to the Federal agency 
using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Federal agency 
will provide any necessary special instruction. However, 
frequency and due date shall be governed by paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section. 
(ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check 
advances based on periodic requests from the grantee, the 
advances will be requested on the form specified in paragraph 
 (d) of this section. 
(iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial 
Status Report specified in paragraph (b) of this section for 
the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for

Programs shall be governed by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.

 2541.420 

Retention and access requirements for records. 


(a) 

Applicability.

 (1) This section applies to all 
financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records of grantees
or subgrantees which are: 
(i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, 
program regulations or the grant agreement; or 
(ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program regulations or the grant agreement. 
(2) This section does not apply to records maintained by 
contractors or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a 
provision concerning records in certain kinds of contracts, 
see  2541.360(i)(10). 
(b) 

Length of retention period.

 (1) Except as otherwise 
provided, records must be retained for three years from the 
starting date specified in paragraph (c) of this section. 
(2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or 
other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be
retained until completion 
of the action and resolution of all issues which arise from 
it, or until the end of the regular 3-year period, whichever 
is later. 
(3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain 
any records which are continuously needed for joint use. The 
awarding agency will request transfer of records to its 
custody when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value. 
When the records are transferred to or maintained by the 
Federal agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not 
applicable to the grantee or subgrantee. 
(c) 

Starting date of retention period

._(1) 

General.

 When grant support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the retention period for the records of each
funding period starts on the day the grantee 
or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single or 
last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is continued or renewed quarterly, the retention
period for each year's 
records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure 
report for the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In 
all other cases, the retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final expenditure report. If an expenditure
report has been 
waived, the retention period starts on the day the report 
would have been due. 
(2) 

Real property and equipment records.

 The retention period for real property and equipment records starts from the date of the disposition or replacement
or transfer at the direction of the awarding agency. 
(3) 

Records for income transactions after grant or 
subgrant support.

 In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant support. Where there is 
such a requirement, the retention period for the records 
pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end 
of the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned. 
(4) 

Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc.

 This paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or 
proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting 
computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage charge back rates
or composite fringe benefit 
rates). 
(i) 

If submitted for negotiation.

 If the proposal, plan, 
or other computation is required to be submitted to the 
Federal Government (or to the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation 
of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its 
supporting records starts from the date of such submission. 
(ii) 

If not submitted for negotiation.

 If the proposal, 
plan, or other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation
purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and 
its supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or 
other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other 
computation. 
(d) 

Substitution of microfilm.

 Copies made by 
microfilming, photocopying, or similar methods may be 
substituted for the original records. 
(e) 

Access to records.

_(1) 

Records of grantees and subgrantees.

 The awarding agency and the Comptroller 
General of the United States, or any of their authorized 
representatives, shall have the right of access to any 
pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of 
grantees and subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.

(2) 

Expiration of right of access.

 The rights of access 
in this section must not be limited to the required retention 
period but shall last as long as the records are retained. 
(f) 

Restrictions on public access.

 The Federal Freedom 
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records. 
Unless required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and 
subgrantees are not required to permit public access to their 
records. 


 2541.430 

Enforcement. 


(a) 

Remedies for noncompliance.

 If a grantee or 
subgrantee materially fails to comply with any term of an 
award, whether stated in a Federal statute or regulation, an 
assurance, in a State plan or application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may take one or more

of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances: 
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending 
correction of the deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or 
more severe enforcement action by the awarding agency; 
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and 
matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity 
or action not in compliance; 
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current 
award for the grantee's or subgrantee's program; 
(4) Withhold further awards for the program; or 
(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available. 
(b) 

Hearings, appeals. 

In taking an enforcement action, 
the awarding agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an 
opportunity for such hearing, appeal, or other administrative 
proceeding to which the grantee or subgrantee is entitled 
under any statute or regulation applicable to the action 
involved. 
(c) 

Effects of suspension and termination. 

Costs of 
grantee or subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or subgrantee during a suspension or after
termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes 
them in the notice of suspension or termination or 
subsequently. Other grantee or subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and
not reasonably avoidable are 
allowable if: 
(1) The costs result from obligations which were 
properly incurred by the grantee or subgrantee before the 
effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a termination, are noncancellable;
and

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940812-0-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940812-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not 
suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding 
period in which the termination takes effect. 
(d) 

Relationship to debarment and suspension.

 The 
enforcement remedies identified in this section, including 
suspension and termination, do not preclude grantee or 
subgrantee from being subject to ``Debarment and Suspension'' 
under E.O. 12549 (see  2541.350). 


 2541.440 

Termination for convenience. 


Except as provided in  2541.430 awards may be 
terminated in whole or in part only as follows: 
(a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the 
grantee or subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including 
the effective date and in the case of partial termination, 
the portion to be terminated; or 
(b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written 
notification to the awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and in the

case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. 
However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the 
award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding agency may terminate the award in
its entirety under either  2541.430 or paragraph (a) of this section. 


Subpart F_After the Grant Requirement 


 2541.500 

Closeout. 


(a) 

General. 

The Federal agency will close out the award when it determines that all 
applicable administrative actions and all required work of 
the grant has been completed. 
(b) 

Reports.

 Within 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other reports required as a 
condition of the grant. Upon request by the grantee, Federal 
agencies may extend this time frame. These may include but 
are not limited to: 
(1) Final performance or progress report; 
(2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as 
applicable); 
(3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable); 
(4) Invention disclosure (if applicable); 
(5) Federally-owned property report. In accordance with  2541.320(f), a grantee must submit an 
inventory of all federally owned property (as distinct from 
property acquired with grant funds) for which it is 
accountable and request disposition instructions from the 
Federal agency of property no longer needed. 
(c) 

Cost adjustment.

 The Federal agency will, within 90 
days after receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this 
section, make upward or downward adjustments to the allowable 
costs. 
(d) 

Cash adjustments.

 (1) The Federal agency will make prompt payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable 
costs. 
(2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal 
agency any balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash 
advanced that is not authorized to be retained for use on 
other grants. 


 2541.510 

Later disallowances and adjustments. 


The closeout of a grant does not affect: 
(a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and 
recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review; 
(b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as 
a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions; 
(c) Records retention as required in  2541.420; 
(d) Property management requirements in   2541.3120 and 
2541.320; and 
(e) Audit requirements in  2541.410. 


 2541.520 

Collection of amounts due. 


(a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount 
to which the grantee is finally determined to be entitled 
under the terms of the award constitute a debt to the Federal 
Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after 
demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt by: 
(1) Making an administrative offset against other 
requests for reimbursements;
(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee; or 
(3) Other action permitted by law. 
(b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue
debt in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date from which 
interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the 
filing of any form of appeal.

Subpart A_General 


 2542.10 

Purpose. 


(a) Executive Order 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) provides that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive departments
and agencies shall participate in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement 
debarment and suspension. A person who is debarred or 
suspended shall be excluded from Federal financial and 
nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs 
and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.

(b) The regulations in this part implement section 3 of 
Executive Order 12549 and the guidelines promulgated by the 
Office of Management and Budget under section 6 of the Executive Order by: 
(1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are 
covered by the governmentwide system; 
(2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and 
governmentwide minimum due process procedures that each 
agency shall use; 
(3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended participants, 
participants declared ineligible (see definition of 
``ineligible'' in  2542.20), and participants who have 
voluntarily excluded themselves from participation in covered 
transactions; 
(4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and 
(5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the 
effective implementation and administration of the 
governmentwide system. 
(c) Although the regulations in this part cover the listing of ineligible 
participants and the effect of such listing, they do not 
prescribe policies and procedures governing declarations of 
ineligibility.

) Benefits to an individual as a personal 
entitlement without regard to the individual's present 
responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted); 
(

Relationship to other sections.

 This section 
describes the types of transactions to which a debarment or 
suspension under this part will apply. Subpart B, ``Effect of 
Action,''  2542.50, ``Debarment or suspension,'' sets forth the 
consequences of a debarment or suspension. Those consequences 
would obtain only with respect to participants and principals 
in the covered transactions and activities described in  
2542.30(a). Sections 2542.200 ``Scope of debarment,'' and 2542.280, ``Scope of 
suspension,'' govern the extent to which a specific 
participant or organizational elements of a participant would 
be automatically included within a debarment or suspension 
action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a 
participant may also be brought within the scope of the 
action. 
(c) 

Relationship to Federal procurement activities.

 
Debarment and suspension of Federal procurement contractors 
and subcontractors under Federal procurement contracts are covered by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR),
48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. 


 2542.40 

Policy. 


(a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the 
policy of the Federal Government to conduct business only 
with responsible persons. Debarment and suspension are discretionary 
actions that, taken in accordance with Executive Order 12549 
and this part, are appropriate means to implement this 
policy. 
(b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which 
shall be used only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's 
protection and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may 
impose debarment or suspension for the causes and in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in this part. 
(c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall
be given to designating one 
agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies 
are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for 
coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.

Subpart B_Effect of Action 



 2542.100 

Debarment or suspension. 



(a) 

Primary covered transactions. 

Except to the extent 
prohibited by law, persons who are debarred or suspended 
shall be excluded from primary covered transactions as either participants or principals throughout the 
executive branch of the Federal Government for the period of 
their debarment or suspension. Accordingly, no agency shall 
enter into primary covered transactions with such debarred or 
suspended persons during such period, except as permitted pursuant to  
2542.130. 

(b) 

Lower tier covered transactions. 

Except to the 
extent prohibited by law, persons who have been debarred or 
suspended shall be excluded from participating as either 
participants or principals in all lower tier covered transactions (see  
2542.30(a)(1)(ii)) for the period of their debarment or 
suspension. 

(c) 

Exceptions. 

Debarment or suspension does not affect 
a person's eligibility for: 

(1) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder which are not themselves 
mandatory), including deposited funds insured by the Federal 
Government; 

(2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public 
international organizations, or transactions with foreign 
governments or foreign governmental entities, public international 
organizations, foreign government owned (in whole or in part) 
or controlled entities, and entities consisting wholly or 
partially of foreign governments or foreign governmental 
entities; 

(3) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility
(but benefits received in 
an individual's business capacity are not excepted); 

(4) Federal employment; 

(5) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized emergencies or disasters; 

(6) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary 
governmental operations; and 

(7) Other transactions where the application of this 
part would be prohibited by law. 



 2542.110 

Ineligible persons. 



Persons who are ineligible, as defined in  2542.20, are excluded in accordance with the 
applicable statutory, executive order, or regulatory 
authority. 



 2542.120 

Voluntary exclusion. 



Persons who accept voluntary exclusions under  2542.270 
are excluded in accordance with the terms of their settlements. Corporation shall, and participants 
may, contact the original action agency to ascertain the 
extent of the exclusion. 



 2542.130 

Exception provision. 



The Corporation may grant an exception permitting a 
debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded person to participate in a particular covered 
transaction upon a written determination by the agency head 
or an authorized designee stating the reason(s) for deviating 
from the Presidential policy established by Executive Order 
12549 and  2542.100. However, in accordance with the President's stated 
intention in the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted 
only infrequently. Exceptions shall be reported in accordance 
with  2542.410(a). 



 2542.140 

Continuation of covered transactions. 



(a) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, determination 
of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion of any person by an 
agency, agencies and participants may continue covered 
transactions in existence at the time the person was 
debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A decision as to the 
type of termination action, if any, to be taken should be 
made only after thorough review to ensure the propriety of 
the proposed action. 

(b) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend 
covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) 
with any person who is debarred, suspended, ineligible, or 
voluntarily excluded, except as provided in  2542.130. 



 2542.150 

Failure to adhere to restrictions. 



Except as permitted under  2542.130 or  2542.140, a participant shall not knowingly do business 
under a covered transaction with a person who is debarred or 
suspended, or with a person who is ineligible for or 
voluntarily excluded from that covered transaction. Violation 
of this restriction may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or 
termination of award, issuance of a stop work order, 
debarment or suspension, or other remedies, as appropriate. A 
participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its principals are not 
debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from 
the covered transaction (see Appendix B of this part), unless 
it knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has 
the burden of proof that such participant did knowingly do business with such 
a person.

causes in  2542.210, using procedures established in 
  2542.220 through 2542.260. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not

seriousness of the person's acts or omissions and any 
mitigating factors shall be considered in making any 
debarment decision. 



 2542.210 

Causes for debarment.

transaction so serious as to affect the integrity of an 
agency program, such as: 

(1) A willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one or more 
public agreements or transactions; 

(2) A history of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory 
performance of one or more public agreements or transactions; 
or 

(3) A willful violation of a statutory or regulatory provision or requirement applicable to a public 
agreement or transaction. 

(c) Any of the following causes: 

(1) A nonprocurement debarment by any Federal agency

48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4;

number of outstanding debts (including disallowed costs and 
overpayments, but not including sums owed the Federal

debtor or, if contested, provided that the debtor's legal and 
administrative remedies have been exhausted; 

(4) Violation of a material provision of a voluntary exclusion agreement entered into under 
 2542.270 or of any settlement of a debarment or suspension 
action; or 

(5) Violation of any requirement of subpart F of this 
part, relating to providing a drug-free workplace, as set 
forth in  2542.530 of this part. 

(d) Any other cause of so serious or compelling a nature 
that it affects the present responsibility of a person. 



 2542.220 

Procedures.

informally as practicable, consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness, using the procedures in 
  2542.230 through 2542.260. 



 2542.230 

Investigation and referral. 



Information concerning the existence of a cause for 
debarment from any source shall be promptly reported, 
investigated, and referred, when appropriate, to the debarring official for 
consideration. After consideration, the debarring official 
may issue a notice of proposed debarment. 



 2542.240 

Notice of proposed debarment. 



A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the respondent advising: 

(a) That debarment is being considered;

 2542.250 

Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.



(a) 

Submission in opposition. 

Within 30 days after receipt of the notice of proposed debarment, the respondent may submit, in person, in writing,
or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment.

(b) 

Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. 

(1) In actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring official finds that the respondent's
submission in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, respondent(s)
shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses,
and confront any witness the agency presents.

(2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made available at cost to the respondent, upon request,
unless the respondent and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a transcript.



 2542.260 

Debarring official's decision.



(a) 

No additional proceedings necessary. 

In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the
debarring official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including
any submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 days after receipt of any information and
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the debarring official extends this period for good cause.

(b) 

Additional proceedings necessary. 

(1) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, written findings
of fact shall be prepared. The debarring official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information
and argument submitted by the respondent and any other information in the administrative record.

(2) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The debarring
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary
and capricious or clearly erroneous.

(3) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed
facts.

(c) (1) 

Standard of proof. 

In any debarment action, the cause for debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Where the
proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the standard shall be deemed to have been met.

(2) 

Burden of proof. 

The burden of proof is on the agency proposing debarment.

(d) 

Notice of debarring official's decision. 

(1) If the debarring official decides to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given prompt notice:

(i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;

(ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;

(iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; and

(iv) Advising that the debarment is effective for covered transactions throughout the executive branch of the Federal
Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee makes the determination referred to in  2542.130.

(2) If the debarring official decides not to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given prompt notice of that
decision. A decision not to impose debarment shall be without prejudice to a subsequent imposition of debarment by
any other agency.



 2542.270 

Settlement and voluntary exclusion.



(a) When in the best interest of the Government, the Corporation may, at any time, settle a debarment or suspension
action.

(b) If a participant and the agency agree to a voluntary exclusion of the participant, such voluntary exclusion shall
be entered on the Nonprocurement List (see subpart E of this part).



 2542.280 

Period of debarment.



(a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment,
the suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment period.

(1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of the requirements of subpart F of this part generally
should not exceed three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of debarment may be imposed.

(2) In the case of a debarment for a violation of the requirements of subpart F of this part (see  2542.210(c)(5)),
the period of debarment shall not exceed five years.

(b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an additional period, if that official determines
that an extension is necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not be extended solely on the
basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an additional
period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of   2542.230 through 2542.260 shall be followed
to extend the debarment.

(c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the debarment decision or to reduce the period or
scope of debarment. Such a request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The debarring official may
grant such a request for reasons including, but not limited to:

(1) Newly discovered material evidence;

(2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the debarment was based;

(3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;

(4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or

(5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.



 2542.290 

Scope of debarment.



(a) 

Scope in general. 

(1) Debarment of a person under this part constitutes debarment of all its divisions and other organizational elements
from all covered transactions, unless the debarment decision is limited by its terms to one or more specifically identified
individuals, divisions or other organizational elements or to specific types of transactions.

(2) The debarment action may include any affiliate of the participant that is specifically named and given notice
of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to respond (see   2542.230 through 2542.260).

(b) 

Imputing conduct. 

For purposes of determining the scope of debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:

(1) 

Conduct imputed to participant. 

The fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee,
or other individual associated with a participant may be imputed to the participant when the conduct occurred in connection
with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the participant, or with the participant's knowledge,
approval, or acquiescence. The participant's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence
of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

(2) 

Conduct imputed to individuals associated with participant. 

The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a participant may be imputed to any officer, director,
shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with the participant who participated in, knew
of, or had reason to know of the participant's conduct.

(3) 

Conduct of one participant imputed to other participants in a joint venture. 

The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of one participant in a joint venture, grant pursuant
to a joint application, or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participants if the conduct occurred for or
on behalf of the joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint application, or similar arrangement or with the knowledge,

(1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set out in  2542.320; and

(2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.

agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.



 2542.310

 2542.320 

Procedures.



(a)

and referred, when appropriate, to the suspending official for consideration. After consideration, the suspending
official may issue a notice of suspension.

a representative, information and argument in opposition to the 
suspension. 
(b) 

Additional proceedings as to disputed material 
facts.

documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any witness the agency presents, unless: 
(i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or 
civil judgment; or 
(ii) A determination is made, on the basis of Department 
of Justice advice, that the substantial interests of the Federal Government in pending or contemplated legal 
proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would 
be prejudiced. 
(2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings 
shall be prepared and made available at cost to the 
respondent, upon request, unless the respondent and the agency, by mutual

suspension shall be without prejudice to the subsequent 
imposition of suspension by any agency. The decision shall 
be rendered in accordance with the following provisions. 
(a) 

No additional proceedings necessary.

 In actions: 
Based on an indictment, conviction, or civil judgment; in 
which there is no genuine dispute over material facts; or in 
which additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official shall 
make a decision on the basis of all the information in the 
administrative record, including any submission made by the

information and argument submitted by the respondent, unless 
the suspending official extends this period for good cause.

terminated sooner by the suspending official or as provided 
in paragraph (b) of this section.

initiated within 12 months after the date of the suspension 
notice, the suspension shall be terminated unless an 
Assistant Attorney General or United States Attorney requests 
its extension in writing, in which case it may be extended for an additional 
six months. In no event may a suspension extend beyond 18 
months, unless such proceedings have been initiated within 
that period. 
(c) The suspending official shall notify the Department 
of Justice of an impending termination of a suspension, at least 30 
days before the 12-month period expires, to give that 
Department an opportunity to request an extension.

The scope of a suspension is the same as the scope of a 
debarment (see  2542.290) except that the procedures of

Subpart E_Responsibilities of GSA, Agency and Participants 


 2542.400 

GSA responsibilities. 


(a) In accordance with the OMB guidelines, GSA shall 
compile, maintain, and distribute a list of all persons who 
have been debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded by 
agencies under Executive Order 12549 and this part, and those 
who have been determined to be ineligible. 
(b) At a minimum, this list shall indicate: 
(1) The names and addresses of all debarred, suspended, 
ineligible, and voluntarily excluded persons, in alphabetical 
order, with cross-references when more than one name is 
involved in a single action; 
(2) The type of action; 
(3) The cause for the action; 
(4) The scope of the action; 
(5) Any termination date for each listing; and 
(6) The agency and name and telephone number of the 
agency point of contact for the action. 


 2542.410 

Corporation responsibilities. 


(a) The agency shall provide GSA with current information 
concerning debarments, suspension, determinations of 
ineligibility, and voluntary exclusions it has taken. Until 
February 18, 1989, the agency shall also provide GSA and OMB with information concerning all transactions in which
the 
Corporation has granted exceptions under  2542.130 
permitting participation by debarred, suspended, or 
voluntarily excluded persons. 
(b) Unless an alternative schedule is agreed to by GSA, 
the agency shall advise GSA of the information set forth in 
 2542.400(b) and of the exceptions granted under  2542.130 
within five working days after taking such actions. 
(c) The agency shall direct inquiries concerning listed 
persons to the agency that took the action. 
(d) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List 
before entering covered transactions to determine whether a 
participant in a primary transaction is debarred, suspended, 
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. 
(e) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before approving principals or lower tier participants
where agency approval of the 
principal or lower tier participant is required under the 
terms of the transaction, to determine whether such 
principals or participants are debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. 


 2542.420 

Participants' responsibilities. 


(a) 

Certification by participants in primary covered 
transactions.

 Each participant shall submit the 
certification in Appendix A of this part for it and its principals at the time the participant submits its 
proposal in connection with a primary covered transaction, 
except that States need only complete such certification as 
to their principals. Participants may decide the method and 
frequency by which they determine the eligibility of their principals. In 
addition, each participant may, but is not required to, check 
the Nonprocurement List for its principals. Adverse 
information on the certification will not necessarily result 
in denial of participation. However, the certification, and any additional 
information pertaining to the certification submitted by the 
participant, shall be considered in the administration of 
covered transactions. 
(b) 

Certification by participants in lower tier covered 
transactions.

 (1) Each participant shall require participants in

1990. The State agency shall retain the original of this State agency-wide certification in its central office and,
prior to grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect to each grant, unless the Federal

the grant shall be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those located in other State agencies.
(e) (1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, grantees shall have this policy statement and program
in place as soon as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which performance is expected to be completed.

Regarding Debarment, Suspension, And Other Responsibility 
Matters_Primarily Covered Transactions 



Instructions for Certification 



1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the 
prospective primary participant is providing the certification set out below. 

2. The inability of a person to provide the 
certification required below will not necessarily result in 
denial of participation in this covered transaction. The 
prospective participant shall submit an explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set 
out below. The certification or explanation will be 
considered in connection with the department or agency's 
determination whether to enter into this transaction. 
However, failure of the prospective primary participant to furnish a certification or an 
explanation shall disqualify such person from participation 
in this transaction. 

3. The certification in this clause is a material 
representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when 
the department or agency determined to enter into this transaction. 
If it is later determined that the prospective primary 
participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in 
addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or 
default. 

4. The prospective primary participant shall provide 
immediate written notice to the department or agency to whom 
this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective 
primary participant learns that its certification was erroneous when

``suspended,'' ``ineligible,'' ``lower tier covered transaction,'' 
``participant,'' ``person,'' ``primary covered transaction,'' ``principal,'' ``proposal,'' and

determines the eligibility of its principals. Each 
participant may, but is not required to, check the 
Nonprocurement List. 

9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be 
construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and 
information of a participant is not required to exceed that 
which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the 
ordinary course of business dealings. 

10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6

1. By signing and/or submitting this application or 
grant agreement, the grantee is providing the certification 
set out below. 

2. The certification set out below is a material 
representation of fact upon which reliance is placed when the 
agency awards the grant. If it is later determined that the grantee 
knowingly rendered a false certification, or otherwise 
violates the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act, the

individuals, need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be 
identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not 
identify the workplaces at the time of application, or upon 
award, if there is no application, the grantee must keep the 
identity of the workplace(s) on file in its office and make the information 
available for Federal inspection. Failure to identify all 
known workplaces constitutes a violation of the grantee's 
drug-free workplace requirements. 

6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or 
other sites where work under the grant takes place. 
Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a 
mass transit authority or State highway department while in 
operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert 
halls or radio studios). 

7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes 
during the performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform 
the agency of the change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see paragraph five). 

8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension 
and Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule 
apply to this certification. Grantees' attention is called, 
in particular, to the following definitions from these rules: 

Controlled substance means a controlled substance in 
Schedules I through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 
U.S.C.  812) and as further defined by regulation (21 CFR 
1308.11 through 1308.15); 

Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo contendere) or 
imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body charged 
with the responsibility to determine violations of the 
Federal or State criminal drug statutes; 

Criminal drug statute means a Federal or non-Federal criminal statute involving the manufacture, 
distribution, dispensing, use, or possession of any 
controlled substance; 

Employee means the employee of a grantee directly 
engaged in the performance of work under a grant, including:

unless their impact or involvement is insignificant to the 
performance of the grant; and, (iii) Temporary personnel and 
consultants who are directly engaged in the performance of 
work under the grant and who are on the grantee's payroll. This definition does 
not include workers not on the payroll of the grantee (e.g., 
volunteers, even if used to meet a matching requirement; 
consultants or independent contractors not on the grantee's 
payroll; or employees of sub recipients or subcontractors in covered 
workplaces).

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises the EPA's ambient air quality surveillance regulations to take into account recent changes
and developments in the overall management of ambient air quality data and to reflect current operating practices
of State and local agencies. The revisions to the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Regulations change the data reporting
requirements for State and Local Air Monitoring Stations (SLAMS) and National Air Monitoring Stations (NAMS). The
changes affect the number of monitoring sites required to submit air quality data to the Aerometric Information Retrieval
System (AIRS) and the timing for such data submittals. The data from both the current SLAMS and NAMS monitors will be
submitted on a quarterly basis within 90 days after the end of the calendar quarter. In addition, the revisions replace
technical references to the former Storage and Retrieval of Aerometric Data (SAROAD) data base with references to
the AIRS. Various technical revisions update the regulations to reflect organizational changes. These revisions
reflect current practices of most State and local agencies and should expedite data access with the AIRS data base
for air quality planning and decision making.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (Act), requires that States establish an air quality monitoring system as part
of their State implementation plan (SIP), and that EPA establish a supplemental monitoring system throughout the
United States (sections 110(a)(2) and 319 of the Act). These State and national air quality monitoring systems provide
the critical information for purposes of defining ``nonattainment'' with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS), evaluating progress towards achievement of the NAAQS pursuant to SIP's, and reporting air quality data
to EPA to document the status and trends of the Nation's air quality. In the discharge of these and other responsibilities,
EPA needs to have timely access to valid and complete ambient air quality data as obtained by State and local air pollution
control agencies. The current regulations require that State and local agencies submit air quality data from certain
designated sites (NAMS) to EPA within 120 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The data from other SLAMS (about
70 percent of the sites are SLAMS) were exempted from the quarterly reporting requirement and were required to be submitted
in an annual report to the Administrator through the appropriate EPA Regional Office. Therefore, Part 58 includes
two separate data processing and reporting requirements, a situation which States have found to be both inefficient
and undesirable from a quality assurance standpoint. Consequently, most States have developed operational practices
to process and report all ambient air quality data to EPA using one system. The EPA's revisions to part 58 are consistent
with this general practice. 

The EPA has now completed the development of a new comprehensive air quality data system. The Air Quality Subsystem
(AQS) of the AIRS has replaced the former SAROAD data bank. The AIRS is a significant enhancement to the national monitoring
program and results in improved efficiency at the State and local levels by allowing those agencies to directly input
air quality data to AQS, thereby eliminating the need for additional data processing by the EPA Regional Offices.
Most State and local personnel have already been trained in the use of the AIRS system and can now directly input their
air quality data. This major enhancement, along with the development of electronic transfer and processing of air
quality data, reduces the amount of time needed by State and local agencies to submit air quality data to the AIRS. Consequently,
these revisions to part 58 change the data reporting requirements for two reasons: (1) To provide uniform quarterly
reporting requirements for both NAMS and SLAMS, and (2) to shorten the data reporting time requirements from 120 days
after the end of the calendar quarter to 90 days. 

These regulations deal with changes to the ambient air quality monitoring, data reporting, and surveillance requirements
of 40 CFR part 58. These changes are needed based on the developments outlined above and are required to reflect the
implementation of AIRS. This will assure that high quality ambient air data are available to EPA on a more timely basis.
The EPA's need for timely air data is due to various requirements of the Act, such as timely designations of attainment
status and timely preparation and publication of annual reports, along with EPA's general need for consistent and
timely access to ambient air quality data in AIRS within a reasonable timeframe after its collection. For example,
under the old regulations, EPA may not have received SLAMS air quality data collected on January 1 of a given year until
July 1 of the following year. Clearly the need exists to shorten this timeframe. 

Shorter reporting times are now feasible using readily available data processing equipment and standard operating
procedures for data processing. Most State agencies already meet the 90-day data reporting timeframe required in
these revisions. Earlier access to air quality data will allow EPA to be more responsive to the requirements of the
amended Act and to the Nation's overall air quality program. 

Also, the EPA estimates the additional burden associated with this rule in reporting the data on a quarterly basis
versus summary statistics on a yearly basis is 11,000 hours. This represents an average of 50 hours per respondent
(55 States and/or Territories) per quarter. Further discussion of the estimate of this burden is included in a following
section on the Paperwork Reduction Act.

These regulations also include several minor technical modifications to reflect changes in organizations, contacts,
and references that have occurred since the last revisions to part 58 in 1986. 



II. Revisions to Part 58_Ambient Air Quality Surveillance 



A. Section 58.1 Definitions 



These regulations amend the definitions section by adding a definition for the new AIRS. The Agency has completed
major enhancements to the new AIRS data base, which replaces the former SAROAD data base for ambient air quality data.
These regulations will reflect this important program change by defining AIRS and replacing the technical references
to SAROAD with references to AIRS. The definition of the SAROAD system would be maintained within this section because
several organizations will continue to use certain parts of the SAROAD system as an interim interface with the new
AIRS data base. No responder objected to adding the definition of AIRS to this section. 



B. Section 58.26 Annual SLAMS Summary Report 



No regulatory changes were proposed for this existing requirement. However, comments and suggestions were solicited
on whether this annual report would be necessary or whether any changes would be needed to this section to eliminate
any redundancy in reporting requirements. The consensus of the comments received on this issue support deletion
of the requirement for the hard copy form of the report but retention of the annual certification. Therefore, the current
rule continues to require the annual summary report, but future revisions to these regulations may modify the format
of this certification. 



C. Section 58.28 SLAMS Data Submittal 



The EPA had solicited comments on the need to require submission of the SLAMS raw air quality data on a quarterly basis.
Four responders concurred with the proposal and there were no negative comments to the proposal. 

These regulations require that all data from the SLAMS be submitted to AIRS under the same data reporting requirements
as those for the NAMS. These regulatory changes reflect the actual operational practices of the majority of State
and local agencies. For data processing purposes, EPA believes it is both inefficient and technically undesirable
to maintain different reporting requirements for NAMS and SLAMS monitoring data. 



D. Section 58.35 NAMS Data Submittal 



The previous monitoring regulations specify that all NAMS data be submitted in quarterly reports to the EPA Administrator
(through the appropriate Regional Office) within 120 days of the end of each reporting period. The proposed regulations
would have changed the data submittal requirement for NAMS to 60 days after the e
