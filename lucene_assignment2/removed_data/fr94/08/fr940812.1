Milk in the Middle Atlantic Marketing Area; Proposed Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed suspension of rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend certain provisions of the Middle Atlantic Federal
milk marketing order for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. The proposed suspension would reduce
the percent of receipts that must be disposed of as Class I disposition by pool distributing plants, provide automatic
pool plant status for supply plants and reserve processing plants that were pool plants during the months of September
through February, and suspend the limit on the amount of milk that may be diverted to nonpool plants by cooperative
associations and by pool plant operators. The suspension was requested by several Middle Atlantic cooperatives
and handlers who contend that the suspension is necessary to assure that producer milk which has been historically
associated with the market will continue to be pooled and priced under the order without incurring unnecessary and
uneconomic movements solely for the purpose of maintaining pool status. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
rule would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers
would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.





The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 



The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 


Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the suspension
of the following provisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Middle Atlantic marketing area is being
considered for the months of September 1, 1994, through February 28, 1995: 


1. In  1004.7(a), the words ``40 percent in the months of September through February, and'' and ``in the months
of March through August,''.

2. In  1004.7(e), the word ``immediately'' and the words ``for each of the following months of March through
August,''. 


3. In the introductory text of  1004.12(d), the words ``in accordance with the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1)
and (d)(2) of this section.'' 

4. In  1004.12, paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2). 


All persons who want to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies
of their views to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456,
Washington, DC 20090-6456, by the 15th day after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. 


The period for filing comments is limited to 15 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete
the required procedures before the requested suspension is to be effective. 


All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division
during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). 


Statement of Consideration 




The proposed suspension would reduce the total Class I disposition standard for pool distributing plants, provide
automatic pool plant status for supply plants and reserve processing plants that were pool plants during each of the
preceding months of September through February, and suspend the limit on the amount of milk that may be diverted to
nonpool plants by cooperative associations and pool plant operators. 


The first provision proposed to be suspended would reduce the percentage of a distributing plant's receipts that
would have to be disposed of as Class I milk to meet the order's pooling standards. As proposed, a pool distributing
plant would have to use at least 30 percent, rather than 40 percent, of its monthly milk receipts as Class I milk during
September 1994 through February 1995. 


The second provision proposed to be suspended would permit supply plants and reserve processing plants that have
met the order's pooling standards during the months of September 1993 through February 1994 to retain pool status
for the months of September 1994 through August 1995. The shipping requirements that normally would have applied
to such plants during the months of September 1994 through February 1995 would be eliminated under the proposed suspension.



The third provision included in the proposed suspension would eliminate the limit on the percentage of milk that may
be diverted to nonpool plants by a cooperative association or a pool plant operator for the period of September 1994
through February 1995. 


The proposed suspension was requested by Pennmarva Dairymen's Federation, Atlantic Dairy Processing, Inc., Dairylea,
Eastern Milk Producers Cooperative, and Lehigh Valley Dairies. Together these organizations market over 90 percent
of the market's producer milk. 


The proponents state that between 1991 and 1993 producer receipts on Order 4 increased while the percentage of the
market's producer milk used for Class I purposes decreased. Proponents cited the consistently declining monthly
Class I percentages for the months of September through February of 1991, 1992, and 1993 to support their request.
They pointed out, for example, that the Class I use percentage for September 1991 was 56.2, while in September 1993
it was 51.4 percent. The proponents claim that the reduction in Class I use results in an increase in diversions to nonpool
plants, which makes it increasingly difficult for cooperatives and pool plant operators to maintain the pool status
of the milk of producers who have historically been associated with the market. 


In further support of their suspension request, the proponents indicate that two large Order 4 distributing plants
with which large volumes of Order 4 diverted milk had been associated became regulated under the New York-New Jersey
order, another Order 4 distributing plant closed, and two additional Order 4 distributing plants have changed their
product mix, causing a reduction of pool plant deliveries for the cooperative supplying milk to these plants. The
proponents claim that they are experiencing difficulty associating all of their diverted producer milk with the
remaining distributing plants now regulated under the Middle Atlantic order because the additional diverted milk
is reducing the Class I use percentage of the plants from which it is diverted, thereby jeopardizing their status as
pool plants. 


Thus the proponents state that the proposed suspension would have the effect of reducing uneconomic movements of
milk solely for the purpose of meeting pool qualifications, and would reflect current marketing conditions without
causing the milk of producers long associated with the market to become depooled. 

Accordingly, it may be appropriate to suspend the aforesaid provisions from September 1, 1994, through February
28, 1995.

Definition of Club

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public 
hearing.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains proposed regulations relating to 
the definition of a ``club organized for business, pleasure, 
recreation, or other social purpose'' for purposes of the 
disallowance of a deduction for club dues under section 274(a)(3) 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The proposed regulations 
reflect changes to the law made by the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993 and affect persons who pay or incur 
club dues.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax 
Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 274 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) as amended by section 13210 of the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993) (107 Stat. 
469). These rules relate to the definition of club for purposes 
of the disallowance of a deduction for club dues under section 
274(a)(3) of the Code. 



Explanation of Provisions 



OBRA 1993 amended section 274 of the Code by adding section 
274(a)(3), which disallows a deduction for amounts paid or 
incurred for membership in any club organized for business, 
pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose. 

Prior to the enactment of section 274(a)(3), membership dues 
or fees paid to three types of organizations were specifically 
excepted from the dues disallowance provisions of section 274 
because these organizations were not considered to be social, 
athletic, or sporting clubs within the meaning of section 
274(a)(2)(A). The excepted organizations were: (1) professional 
organizations such as bar associations and medical associations, 
(2) civic or public service organizations such as Kiwanis, Lions, 
Rotary, Civitan, and similar organizations, and (3) business 
luncheon clubs described in  1.274-2(e)(3)(ii) of the 
regulations. See Q & A 56 and Q & A 57 of Rev. Rul. 63-144, 
1963-2 C.B. 129, 138, 139; H.R. Rep. No. 1447, 87th Cong., 2d 
Sess. 22 (1962), 1962-3 C.B. 426; S. Rep. No. 1881, 87th Cong., 
2d Sess. 33 (1962), 1962-3 C.B. 739; and H.R. Rep. No. 1278, 96th 
Cong., 2d Sess. 32 (1980). 

The legislative history of section 274(a)(3) indicates that 
the enactment of that section eliminated the third exception 
listed above for membership dues or fees paid to business 
luncheon clubs. The legislative history further indicates that 
airline and hotel clubs are subject to dues disallowance under 
section 274(a)(3). H.R. Rep. No. 103-213, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 
583. However, the legislative history does not indicate that the 
enactment of section 274(a)(3) had any effect on the first and 
second exceptions listed above for professional organizations and 
civic or public service organizations. Accordingly, the proposed 
regulations provide that the dues disallowance provisions of 
section 274(a)(3) of the Code apply to business luncheon clubs 
and airline and hotel clubs, but generally not to professional 
organizations (such as bar associations and medical associations) 
or civic or public service organizations (such as Kiwanis, Lions, 
Rotary, Civitan, and similar organizations). The proposed 
regulations further provide that certain organizations similar to 
professional organizations are also generally excepted from dues 
disallowance, specifically, business leagues, trade associations, 
chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and real estate boards. 

Although the proposed regulations generally provide 
exceptions from dues disallowance for civic and public service 
organizations, professional organizations, and certain 
organizations similar to professional organizations, the 
exceptions are not available if a principal purpose of the 
organization is to conduct entertainment activities for members 
or their guests or to provide members or their guests with access 
to entertainment facilities. Also, as under prior law, the 
allowance of a deduction for dues paid to these organizations may 
be precluded or limited by provisions of the Code other than 
section 274. For example, the dues would not be deductible 
unless the ordinary and necessary business expense requirements 
of section 162 are satisfied. 

The regulations are proposed to be effective with respect to 
amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 1993. 



Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking 
is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. 
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also 
been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, 
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this 
notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for 
comment on its impact on small business. 


Comments and Public Hearing 



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
(preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are 
submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for 
public inspection and copying. 

A public hearing has been scheduled for November 29, 1994, 
at 10 a.m. in the IRS Auditorium, Internal Revenue Service 
Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Because 
of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the 
Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the 
hearing starts. 

The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 

Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing 
must submit written comments by October 11, 1994 and 
submit an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to 
be devoted to each topic by November 8, 1994. 

A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for 
making comments.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



The Refugee Act of 1980 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to create a domestic refugee resettlement
program to provide assistance and services to refugees resettling in the United States. With the enactment of this
legislation, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) issued a series of regulations, at 45 CFR part 400, to establish
comprehensive requirements for a State-administered Refugee Resettlement Program (RRP), beginning with the publication
on September 9, 1980 (45 FR 59318) of a regulation governing State plan and reporting requirements. Subsequent regulations
covered cash and medical assistance and Federal funding, published March 12, 1982 (47 FR 10841); grants to States,
child welfare services (including services to unaccompanied minors), and Federal funding for State expenditures,
published January 30, 1986 (51 FR 3904); and cash and medical assistance, requirements for employability services,
job search, and employment, and refugee social services published February 3, 1989 (54 FR 5463).



Description of the Regulation



This proposed regulation clarifies some current policies, amends others, and sets forth regulatory requirements
for the targeted assistance program (TAP).

In recent years, annual refugee admissions have been high, resulting in an expanding pool of refugees in need of services.
As of September 30, 1993, 1.6 million refugees have been resettled in the U.S. since 1975. All of these refugees, with
the exception of those who have become U.S. citizens, are eligible to receive refugee program services. At the same
time, the level of funds appropriated for services has remained essentially unchanged, making it difficult to serve
all refugees in need of services with available resources. It is not uncommon, for example, for English language training
classes, funded by the refugee program, to have waiting lists so that refugees who arrive in the country are not able
to access English language training without a delay. Nine major States have indicated that there are currently waiting
lists for refugee services, especially for English language training, in their States.

We believe the increased demand for services makes it necessary to sharpen the program's priorities. Resources in
the refugee program are no longer sufficient to provide the level of services needed to assist refugees for an open-ended
period of time to become self-sufficient. We have learned from experience in the refugee program that the greatest
impact that services can have on a refugee's social adjustment and economic well-being occurs during a refugee's
initial years in the United States. These initial services often define a refugee's future experience.

Findings from several studies indicate that comprehensive services, provided soon after a refugee's arrival in
the U.S., increase the likelihood of early employment. Under commission from ORR in 1992, Dr. Robert L. Bach, in an
examination of data from the Oregon Refugee Early Employment Project (REEP), found that refugees who received job
services or pre-employment training in the first 90 days reduced the time to their initial job by almost two months.
Dr. Bach's analysis indicated that each job service provided in the first 90 days increased the probability of employment
by three percent. A study of the Oregon REEP, conducted by the Refugee Policy Group (RPG) and published in 1989, found
that REEP set up client/caseworker ratios that permitted a staff-intensive approach early in the resettlement experience,
an element which in large part, according to RPG, was crucial to REEP's achievement of earlier employment. Similarly,
performance reported for the first year of the United States Catholic Conference (USCC) Wilson/Fish project in San
Diego indicated that the project was able to reduce the average length of time on cash assistance by over two months
through the provision of early comprehensive services aimed at employment.

After the initial years, we believe the effect of services on the achievement of economic self-support diminishes
significantly. A report, entitled ``Progress Toward Economic Self-Sufficiency Among Southeast Asian Refugees'',
prepared for ORR in July 1989 by Dr. Robert L. Bach and Rita Argiros, presented findings, based on an analysis of data
from the ORR Annual Survey of Southeast Asian Refugees, which underlined the importance of service interventions
in the first few years. Bach and Argiros found that the longer a refugee remains out of the labor force, the less likely
he or she is to begin to search for a job or find a job in a subsequent year. The most significant move into the labor force
occurs in the first and second years, followed by a steady decline in the probability of entering the labor force for
those who delayed their initial job search.

We believe it is important, therefore, to target refugee program resources on the provision of comprehensive refugee-specific
services to refugees during their first few years of resettlement in order to provide new refugees with the best foundation
for economic independence in the future. We believe that after this initial period of special assistance, refugees
should be treated like other U.S. residents and have access to the same assistance and service programs that are available
to other eligible populations. Thus we propose to limit service eligibility for refugee social services to refugees
who have been in the U.S. 36 months (3 years) or less, effective October 1, 1995.

Similarly, we propose to limit service eligibility for the targeted assistance program to refugees who have been
in the U.S. 60 months (5 years) or less, effective on the same date. The relatively longer eligibility period for targeted
assistance clients would provide States more time to assist longer-term cash assistance recipients towards economic
self-support and would help to mitigate the impact of large numbers of refugees on localities, while placing a time-limitation
on refugee program participation that is consistent with the 5-year U.S. residency requirement for U.S. citizenship.
Once refugees become U.S. citizens, they are no longer eligible for services under the refugee program.

In regard to the provision of refugee social services and targeted assistance, we believe that States and local entities
should be given greater flexibility to design appropriate service to fit local refugee needs. The program's emphasis
on the provision of employment services to achieve economic self-support, however, will remain. We are proposing,
however, to eliminate the job search requirements currently contained in  400.80 and the requirement contained
in  400.146 that requires a State to use at least 85 percent of its social service grants to provide employability
services if the State's welfare dependency rate is 55 percent or more.

To ensure that refugees receive maximum benefit and maximum results from services provided during the proposed time-limited
period, it is essential that services be provided in the most efficacious and appropriate manner possible. To accomplish
this, program experience dictates that certain principles require greater emphasis in the provision of services
to refugees: (1) Services should be provided in a manner that is linguistically and culturally compatible with a refugee's
background; (2) refugee-specific services should be provided through a separate service system during the initial
years of resettlement, rather than through a mainstream system in which refugees are only one of many client groups
served; (3) English language instruction should be provided in a concurrent, rather than sequential, time period
with employment or with other employment-related services; and (4) as required by the Refugee Act, refugee women
should have the same opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction.

Under current policy, if a refugee who is receiving refugee medical assistance becomes ineligible solely because
of increased earnings from employment, the refugee's medical assistance is extended for a period of 4 months or until
the refugee reaches the end of the RMA time-eligibility period (currently the first 8 months after a refugee's arrival
in the U.S.), whichever occurs first. The distinction between RMA and extended RMA has caused confusion in some States,
with the effect of extended RMA being inappropriately denied to some eligible refugees. In addition, current policy
generates administrative costs because eligibility workers need to make separate determinations of refugee eligibility
for extended RMA once a refugee becomes ineligible due to increased earnings from employment.

In order to alleviate this confusion and to reduce State administrative burden, we propose to drop the distinction
between RMA and extended RMA by eliminating the extended RMA provision and by making RMA available to eligible refugees
for the full period of time-eligibility determined by the Director in accordance with  400.204 beginning with
the first month the refugee entered the U.S., regardless of whether a refugee received increased earnings from employment,
unless the refugee obtains private medical coverage during the RMA eligibility period.

Thus, under the 8-month eligibility period currently in effect, once a refugee a refugee is determined to be eligible
for RMA at time of application, the refugee would be able to continue to receive RMA for a refugee's first 8 months in
the U.S. regardless of whether a refugee receives increased earnings from employment during that period of time,
unless the refugee obtains private medical coverage through his/her employer or any other source. This provision
would replace the current 4-month extended RMA coverage for employed refugees. We believe this change will make the
administration of RMA less confusing to States and, therefore, less subject to error than the current extended RMA
provision. At the same time, the proposed change will better ensure continued medical coverage to refugees for a clearly
specified period of time.

To summarize, the proposed policy changes are intended to: (1) Ensure that comprehensive refugee-specific services
are provided to both refugee men and women within the first few years after arrival in the United States for the purpose
of accelerating family economic independence and acculturation; (2) establish a time-eligibility limitation
for the receipt of refugee social services and targeted assistance services so that funds will be concentrated on
recently arrived refugees to help ensure that employable refugees are placed in jobs as soon as possible after their
arrival in the U.S.; (3) increase State and local flexibility in the provision of services; and (4) replace the current
4-month extended RMA provision for employed refugees with a provision that would make RMA available for the full period
(currently 8 months) of time-eligibility to RMA recipients, regardless of whether a refugee becomes employed.

In addition, the proposed regulation limits the administrative costs a State may claim to those costs that are determined
to be reasonable and allowable as defined by the Administration for Children and Families. This rule also establishes
procedures to be used when a State withdraws from the refugee program. Finally, this rule proposes to set forth basic
requirements for the administration of the targeted assistance program which has been in operation since FY 1983.

Consistent with the preceding actions, 45 CFR 400.1, 400.2, 400.4, 400.5, 400.9, 400.11, 400.13, 400.62, 400.70,
400.71, 400.75, 400.76, 400.79, 400.80, 400.82, 400.83, 400.94, 400.100, 400.104, 400.106, 400.107, 400.140,
400.141, 400.145, 400.146, 400.147, 400.152, 400.153, 400.154, 400.155, 400.156, 400.203, 400.204, 400.206,
400.207, 400.210, and subpart K are being amended or removed and a new 400.212 and subpart L are being added.



Subpart A_Introduction



Section 400.1(a) is amended to provide that 45 CFR Part 400 prescribes requirements concerning grants to States and
other public and private non-profit agencies, wherever applicable, under title IV of the Immigration and Nationality
Act.

Section 400.2 is amended by limiting the definition of case management services for purposes of 45 CFR part 400 to the
referral to and tracking of refugee participation in employability services.



Subpart B_Grants to States for Refugee Resettlement



Section 400.4(b) is amended to require that a State must certify no later than 30 days after the beginning of each fiscal
year that the approved State plan is current and continues in effect. If a State wishes to change its plan, a State is
required to submit a proposed amendment to the plan for ORR review and approval in accordance with  400.8.

Section 400.5(h) is revised to expand the types of agencies that a State must meet with on a quarterly basis to plan and
coordinate the placement of refugees in advance of their arrival. This revision requires the inclusion of local community
service agencies and other agencies that serve refugees in these quarterly meetings. Section 400.5(h), as revised,
also advises States that currently have an approved exemption to this requirement that existing exemptions will
expire 90 days after the effective date of this rule. Any State wishing an exemption may apply to ORR. An approved exemption
will remain in effect for three years, at which time a State may reapply. A number of States were granted exemptions
to this requirement in the early years of the program on the basis of the absence of problems associated with the planning
and coordination of refugee placement or the small number of refugees in those States. We believe it is time to review
these exemptions, given the passage of time, changing refugee flows, and changing circumstances in the States. A
State wishing to request an exemption to the provisions regarding the holding or frequency of meetings under  400.5(h)
must set forth the reasons why the State considers these meetings unnecessary because of the absence of problems associated
with the planning and coordination of refugee placement. These requests should be submitted in writing to the Director
of ORR.

Section 400.11(b) is amended to clarify that States would be required to submit yearly estimates for reimbursable
costs for cash and medical assistance, costs for unaccompanied minors, and related administrative costs for the
fiscal year in accordance with guidelines prescribed by the Director of ORR.

Section 400.11(b)(2) is amended by requiring that the annual social services plan that a State must submit to ORR must
be developed on the basis of a local consultative process. Section 400.11(b)(2) is also amended by changing the submission
date for the plan from a date that is no later than 45 days prior to the beginning of the State's planning cycle for social
services to a date that is to be prescribed by the Director of ORR.

Section 400.11(c) is amended by requiring that final financial reports must be submitted in accordance with the requirements
specified under  400.210. The language regarding the submission of quarterly financial reports remains unchanged;
quarterly reports will continue to be due 30 days after the end of each quarter. Thus States must submit fourth-quarter
reports by October 30 of each year, instead of the current deadline of December 30 of each year. ORR needs to receive
end-of-year financial data from States soon after the end of the fiscal year to enable more timely forecasting for
the next fiscal year. Adjustment may continue to be made, under  400.210, until one year after the end of the fiscal
year in the case of grants for cash assistance, medical assistance, and related administrative costs, and 2 years
in the case of grants for social services and targeted assistance.

Section 400.13(d) is revised to prohibit the charging of case management costs against the cash assistance, medical
assistance, and administrative costs (CMA) grant. This revision conforms to priorities established by ORR in FY
1991.



Subparts E_Refugee Cash Assistance



Section 400.62 is amended to require that refugee cash assistance (RCA) begin on the same date, in relation to the date
of application, as assistance under the program of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) would begin under
the State's plan for AFDC. For example, if a State has opted under its AFDC plan to provide assistance no later than the
date of authorization or 30 days after the receipt of an application, whichever is earlier, then that same rule will
apply regarding RCA. This provision prohibits a State from adopting this rule for AFDC but paying assistance retroactive
to the date of application for RCA. This provision thus assures that RCA and AFDC applications and assistance in a given
State are treated equitably.



Subpart F_Requirements for Employability Services, Job Search, and Employment



Section 400.70 is revised by removing references to refugees who are applicants or recipients of AFDC or GA.

Section 400.71 is amended by adding a definition of the term ``Family self-sufficiency plan''.

Section 400.75(a)(1) is amended by requiring, as a condition for receipt of refugee cash assistance, that a refugee
who is not exempt under  400.76 must participate in employment services within 30 days of receipt of aid.

Section 400.76(a)(7) is amended by exempting from participation in employment services and acceptance of appropriate
employment, a parent or other caretaker relative of child under age 3, rather than age 6, who provides full-time care
of the child.

Section 400.76(a)(9) is amended by exempting a pregnant woman from registration and participation in employment
services if the child is expected to be born within the next 6 months, instead of the next 3 months.

The proposed changes in   400.76 (a)(7) and (a)(9) would make ORR policy consistent with the requirements
of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program contained in the Family Support Act of 1988, Public
Law 100-485 (42 U.S.C. 602(a)(19)).

Section 400.79(a) is amended to emphasize that an employability plan must be developed as part of a family self-sufficiency
plan where applicable for each non-exempted recipient of refugee cash assistance in a filing unit.

Section 400.80, which contains job search requirements, is removed. Other references in the regulation to job search
at   400.75(a)(2), 400.76(b), 400.79(c)(3), 400.82, and 400.156(a) are also removed.

Section 400.82(b)(3) is amended by removing the paragraph on conciliation.

Section 400.83 is amended by inserting the paragraph on conciliation from  400.82 and changing the heading
to ``Conciliation and fair hearings''.



Subpart G_Refugee Medical Assistance



Section 400.94(a) is amended by clarifying that a State must determine Medicaid eligibility under its Medicaid State
plan for each individual member of a family unit that applies for medical assistance. This is to clarify that if any
individual in a family unit is eligible for medical assistance under a State's title XIX plan, then the State must provide
that assistance under Medicaid and not RMA. For example, under section 1902(a)(10) and 1902(1) of the Social Security
Act, certain children under age 19 who were born after September 30, 1983, may be eligible for Medicaid even though
their parents are eligible for refugee medical assistance. Assistance may not be provided to such children under
RMA if they are eligible under Medicaid.

Section 400.100(d) is amended to clarify that only those recipients of refugee cash assistance who are not eligible
for Medicaid are eligible for refugee medical assistance.

Section 400.104 is revised by removing the existing provision for extended RMA for recipients who receive increased
earnings from employment and replacing it with a provision that would enable RMA recipients who receive earnings
from employment to continue to receive RMA until they reach the end of their time-eligibility period, in accordance
with  400.100(b), or until the refugee obtains private medical coverage, whichever occurs first.

Section 400.106 is amended to clarify that a State may provide additional medical services to refugees who are determined
eligible under  400.94 only to the extent that sufficient appropriated funds are available to enable ORR to
reimburse costs for refugee Medicaid recipients. Beginning in FY 1991, ORR had to cease reimbursements to States
for the costs of assistance to refugee recipients of AFDC, SSI, and Medicaid due to insufficient appropriated funds.
We want to make clear that additional services under  400.106 may not be provided to refugee Medicaid recipients
with refugee funding as long as appropriated funds continue to be insufficient to enable ORR reimbursements to States
for these costs.

Section 400.107 is amended by replacing the words ``health assessments'' with the words ``medical screening'',
the term used in the INA.



Subpart I_Refugee Social Services



Section 400.140 is amended to clarify that the requirements in subpart I apply only to formula allocation grants to
States.

Section 400.141 is amended by removing references to title XX social services. We have removed references to title
XX services in this section and in   400.152, 400.153, and 400.155 in order to limit the scope of services
allowable under refugee social services to those services that are most in keeping with the goals and priorities of
the refugee program.

Section 400.145 is amended by adding the requirement that a State must insure that women have the same opportunities
as men to participate in training and instruction.

Section 400.146 is revised by removing the current requirement that a State must use at least 85 percent of its social
service grants to provide employability services if a State's dependency rate is 55 percent or more and by replacing
it with a general requirement that a State must use its social service grants primarily for employability services
designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs with less than one year's participation in services in order to achieve
economic self-sufficiency as soon as possible. The proposed revision is intended to provide States greater flexibility
in determining how to best allocate refugee resources to keeping with refugee service needs. Social services may
continue to be provided after a refugee has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job.
Social service funds may not be used for long-term training programs such as vocational training that last for more
than a year or educational programs that are not intended to lead to employment within a year.

Section 400.147 is revised by establishing client priorities for services in the following order of priority: (1)
All newly arriving refugees during their first year in the U.S., who apply for services; (2) refugees who are receiving
cash assistance; (3) unemployed refugees who are not receiving cash assistance; and (4) employed refugees in need
of services to retain employment or to attain economic independence.

Section 400.152 is amended by removing references to title XX services and by revising paragraph (b) to limit the provision
of social services to refugees who have been in the U.S. for 36 months or less, except that refugees who are receiving
employability services, as defined in  400.154(a), as of September 30, 1995, as part of an employability plan,
may continue to receive those services through September 30, 1996, or until the services are completed, whichever
occurs first, regardless of their length of residence in the U.S. As of the effective date of this requirement, the
time-limitation on services will apply regardless of which fiscal year of funding is used to provide the services.

Section 400.153 regarding the provision of title XX social services is removed and reserved.

Section 400.154 is amended to clarify under  400.154(g) that day care as an allowable service means day care
for children. Section 400.154 is further amended by removing the note after paragraph (j) which allows case management
costs to be charged against the CMA grant; because of funding limitations, such costs may not currently be charged
against the CMA grant.

Section 400.155(b) is amended to clarify that outreach services may include activities designed to explain the purpose
of available services and to facilitate access to these services.

Section 400.155(c)(1) is amended to clarify that assessment and short-term counseling may be provided to families
as well as individual persons.

Section 400.155(d) is amended to clarify that day care as an allowable service means day care for children.
Section 400.155(f) is amended by stipulating that translation and interpreter services are allowable when necessary
for participation in a service and when such translation and interpreter services are not available from any other
source.
Section 400.155(g) which permitted the provision of case management services as an allowable nonemployment-related
service is removed. We believe that the use of refugee program funds should be limited only to the provision of case
management services that are related to the obtainment of employment.
Section 400.155(h) is redesignated as  400.155(g) and revised by removing title XX social services from the
list of allowable services under refugee social services and by adding, as an allowable service subject to the approval
of the Director of ORR, any additional service aimed at strengthening the ability of refugee individuals, families,
and refugee communities to achieve and maintain economic self-sufficiency, family stability, and community integration.
An example of an allowable service under this provision would be the provision of technical assistance and organizational
development training to strengthen the capability of refugee mutual assistance associations to provide employment-related
and other services to refugees.
Section 400.156 is amended by revising the heading to read ``Service requirements'' and by amending  400.156(b)
to clarify that, in planning services, States must take into account the reception and placement (R & P) services
provided by resettlement agencies in order to ensure the provision of seamless, coordinated services to refugees
that are not duplicative. Section 400.156 is also amended by adding new requirements that States must implement to
the maximum extent feasible: (1) English language instruction must be provided in a concurrent, rather than sequential,
time period with employment or with other employment-related services; (2) services must be provided through a separate
refugee-specific service system rather than a system in which refugees are only one of many client groups served;
(3) services must be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with a refugee's language
and cultural background; and (4) services must be provided in a manner that includes the use of bilingual/bicultural
women on service agency staffs to ensure adequate service access by refugee women. Providing services in a manner
that is culturally and linguistically compatible means that an agency providing services funded under this part
must employ or contract with staff who: (1) Speak the native language of and (2) are either from the same ethnic background
as, or are culturally knowledgeable of, the refugee populations the agency serves.


Subpart J_Federal Funding


Sections 400.203 and 400.204 are amended by clarifying that Federal funding is available for the cash and medical
assistance programs described in these sections only to the extent that sufficient funds are appropriated. We have
added this clarification in light of the steady decline in Federal refugee funding for the State share of aid to families
with dependent children (AFDC), supplemental security income (SSI), Medicaid, and general assistance (GA) which
began in FY 1986 and has resulted since FY 1991 in no ORR reimbursement to States for the State share of these programs
due to insufficient appropriated funds.
Section 400.206 is amended by changing the heading to ``Federal funding for social services and targeted assistance
services'' and by adding a paragraph on Federal funding for targeted assistance services.
Section 400.207 is revised to clarify that Federal funding is available for reasonable and identifiable administrative
costs of providing only those assistance and service programs for which Federal funding is currently made available
under the refugee program. Thus Federal funding under 45 CFR part 400 is not available at this time for administrative
costs related to the provision of AFDC, Medicaid, GA, or SSI to refugees. This section is further revised to limit the
administrative costs that a State may claim to those costs that are determined to be reasonable and allowable as defined
by the Administration for Children and Families.
Section 400.210 is revised to clarify time limits for obligating and expending funds as well as for submitting final
financial reports on expenditures of CMA grants and social service and targeted assistance grants.
Subpart J is amended to prohibit the use of funds under this part for travel outside the United States, without the written
approval of the Director.


Subpart K_Waivers


Subpart K is amended by revising the heading to read ``Waivers and Withdrawals'' and by revising  400.300 to
allow for a more flexible waiver policy in keeping with Executive Order No. 12875, issued on October 26, 1993, which
calls for increased flexibility for State and local waivers. In addition, a new  400.301 is added which requires
that if a State decides to cease participation in the refugee program, the State must provide 120 days advance notice
to the Director before withdrawing from the program. Section 400.301 clarifies that in order to participate in the
refugee program, a State is expected to operate all components of the refugee program. In the event that a State wishes
to retain responsibility for only part of the refugee program, it must obtain prior approval from the Director of ORR.
Such approval will be granted only under extraordinary circumstances and if it is in the best interest of the Government.
Section 400.301 also provides that when a State withdraws from all or part of the refugee program, the Director may
authorize a replacement designee or designees to administer the provision of assistance and/or services, as appropriate,
to refugees in that State. Pursuant to the statutory authority in 412(c)(1)(A) and 412(e)(1) of the INA to provide
grants to, and contracts with, public or private nonprofit agencies for services, cash assistance, and medical assistance
to refugees, the Director may authorize a designee to administer the refugee program in place of a State when the State
chooses not to participate in the refugee program. This authority is different from the statutory authority in 412(e)(7)
of the INA which permits the Director to authorize the development and implementation of alternative projects under
the Fish/Wilson program.

Subpart L_Targeted Assistance



Section 400.310 establishes that the basis and scope of this subpart is to set forth requirements concerning grants
to States under 12(c)(2) of the INA for targeted assistance.

Section 400.311 establishes a definition for ``targeted assistance grants''.

Section 400.312 requires that a State must provide any individual wishing to do so an opportunity to apply for targeted
assistance services and determine the eligibility of each applicant.

Section 400.313 requires that a State must use its targeted assistance grant primarily for employability services
designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs with less than one year's participation in the targeted assistance program
in order to achieve economic self-sufficiency as soon as possible. Targeted assistance services may continue to
be provided after a refugee has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job. Targeted
assistance funds may not be used for long-term training programs such as vocational training that last for more than
a year or educational programs that are not intended to lead to employment within a year.

Section 400.314 establishes client priorities for targeted assistance services in the following order of priority:
(1) Cash assistance recipients, particularly long-term recipients; (2) unemployed refugees who are not receiving
cash assistance; and (3) employed refugees in need of services to retain employment or to attain economic independence.

Section 400.315 establishes that the same standards and criteria that are applied in the determination of eligibility
for refugee social services under   400.150 and 400.152(a) shall be applied in the determination of eligibility
for targeted assistance services. Section 400.315 limits the provision of targeted assistance services to refugees
who have been in the U.S. for 60 months or less, except that refugees who are receiving employability services, as defined
in  400.316, as of September 30, 1995, as part of an employability plan, may continue to receive those services
through September 30, 1996, or until the services are completed, whichever occurs first, regardless of their length
of residence in the U.S. As of the effective date of this requirement, the time-limitation on services will apply regardless
of which fiscal year of funding is used to provide the services.

Section 400.316 establishes that a State may provide the same scope of services under targeted assistance as may be
provided under refugee social services under   400.154 and 400.155, with the exception of  40 .155(g).
Since the purpose of the targeted assistance program is to direct resources to localities that have large refugee
populations and high use of public assistance by refugees, our intent is to focus the use of targeted assistance funds
on employability services aimed at economic self-sufficiency, while providing States and counties some flexibility
to use the funds for nonemployment-related services. Thus, we have included the nonemployment-related services
that are allowable under  400.155, but have not included the new category of services that has been added under
 400.155(g), which includes services to strengthen family and community.

Section 400.317 establishes that a State must adhere to the same limitations and restrictions in the provision of
targeted assistance services as are applied to the provision of refugee social services under  400.156.

Section 400.318 establishes that eligible grantees under the targeted assistance program are those agencies of
State governments which are responsible for the refugee program under  400.5 in States containing counties
which qualify for targeted assistance awards. Section 400.318 also establishes that the use of targeted assistance
funds for services to Cuban and Haitian entrants is limited to States which have an approved State plan under the Cuban/Haitian
Entrant Program (CHEP).

Section 400.319 establishes that a State with more than one qualifying targeted assistance county may allocate its
targeted assistance funds differently from the formula allocations for counties presented in the ORR targeted assistance
notice in a fiscal year, only on the basis of its population of refugees who arrived in the U.S. during the most recent
5-year period. Section 400.319 also establishes that a State must assure that not less than 95 percent of the total
award to the State is made available to the qualified county or counties, except in those cases where the qualified
county or counties have agreed to let the State administer the targeted assistance program in the county's stead.



Proposed Effective Dates



The anticipated effective date for   400.152(b), 400.315(b), and 400.319(a) is October 1, 1995, while
the anticipated effective date for all other sections is October 1, 1994.



Regulatory Procedures



Executive Order 12866



Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these
priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including
not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome
while still achieving the regulatory objectives.

Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain collection-of-information requirements.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. No. 96-354) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce
the impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small entities. The primary impact of these rules is on State
governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that these rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities because they affect benefits to individuals and payments to States. Thus, a regulatory flexibility
analysis is not required.



Statutory Authority



Section 412(a)(9) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(9), authorizes the Secretary of HHS to
issue regulations needed to carry out the program.

Subpart L_Targeted Assistance



 400.310

Basis and scope.



This subpart sets forth requirements concerning grants to States under section 412(c)(2) of the Act for targeted
assistance.



 400.311

Definitions.



For purposes of this subpart_



Targeted assistance grants

 means formula allocation funding to States for assistance to counties and similar areas in the States where, because
of factors such as unusually large refugee populations (including secondary migration), high refugee concentrations,
and high use of public assistance by refugees, there exists and can be demonstrated a specific need for supplementation
of available resources for services to refugees.



 400.312

Opportunity to apply for services.



A State must provide any individual wishing to do so an opportunity to apply for targeted assistance services and determine
the eligibility of each applicant.



Funding and Service Priorities



 400.313

Use of funds.



A State must use its targeted assistance funds primarily for employability services designed to enable refugees
to obtain jobs with less than one year's participation in the targeted assistance program in order to achieve economic
self-sufficiency as soon as possible. Targeted assistance services may continue to be provided after a refugee has
entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job. Targeted assistance funds may not be used
for long-term training programs such as vocational training that last for more than a year or educational programs
that are not intended to lead to employment within a year.



 400.314

Priority in provision of services.



A State must plan its targeted assistance program and allocate its targeted assistance funds in such a manner that
services are provided to refugees in the following order of priority:

(a) Cash assistance recipients, particularly long-term recipients;

(b) Unemployed refugees who are not receiving cash assistance; and

(c) Employed refugees in need of services to retain employment or to attain economic independence.



 400.315

General eligibility requirements.



(a) For purposes of determining eligibility of refugees for services under this subpart, the same standards and criteria
shall be applied as are applied in the determination of eligibility for refugee social services under   400.150
400.152(a).

(b) A State may not provide services under this subpart to refugees who have been in the United States for more than 60
months, except that refugees who are receiving employability services, as defined in  400.316, as of September
30, 1995, as part of an employability plan, may continue to receive those services through September 30, 1996, or until
the services are completed, whichever occurs first, regardless of their length of residence in the U.S.



 400.316

Scope of targeted assistance services.



A State may provide the same scope of services under this subpart as may be provided to refugees under   400.154
and 400.155, with the exception of  400.155(g).



 400.317

Service requirements.



In providing targeted assistance services to refugees, a State must adhere to the same requirements as are applied
to the provision of refugee social services under  400.156.



 400.318

Eligible grantees.



Eligible grantees are those agencies of State governments which are responsible for the refugee program under 45
CFR 400.5 in States containing counties which qualify for targeted assistance awards. The use of targeted assistance
funds for services to Cuban and Haitian entrants is limited to States which have an approved State plan under the Cuban/Haitian
Entrant Program (CHEP).



 400.319

Allocation of funds.



(a) A State with more than one qualifying targeted assistance county may allocate its targeted assistance funds differently
from the formula allocations for counties presented in the ORR targeted assistance notice in a fiscal year only on
the basis of its population of refugees who arrived in the U.S. during the most recent 5-year period.

(b) a State must assure that not less than 95 percent of the total award to the State is made available to the qualified
county or counties, except in those cases where the qualified county or counties have agreed to let the State administer
the targeted assistance program in the county's stead.

SUMMARY: 

In this 

Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making

, the Commission seeks comment by September 12, 1994 on whether businesses owned by minorities and/or women should
be permitted to hold licenses in the broadband personal communications services (``broadband PCS'') that are geographically
partitioned from established PCS service areas. A similar plan, allowing geographic partitioning by rural telephone
companies, has been adopted to expedite the provision of broadband PCS in rural area. The Commission seeks comment
from interested parties on the following issues: whether allowing businesses owned by minorities and/or women to
hold partitioned PCS licenses would serve the public interest; if so, what parameters the Commission should provide
for these entities to obtain partitioned licenses (

i.e., 

through what mechanisms should partitioned licenses be granted and what, if any, limitations should apply); and
whether any such partitioning should be prohibited for a period of time after initial PCS licensing, and if so, for
what period. Commenters should focus on the public interest impact that allowing such partitioning would likely
have. The Commission is particularly interested in whether such partitioning could be expected to give rise to benefits
corresponding to those that are expected from rural telephone company partitioning. The Commission also seeks comment
on whether the potential benefits that may be derived by partitioning in this context outweigh any practical or administrative
difficulties that might arise, and whether more rapid and better service will be provided to any areas as a result of
the partitioning.



The Commission also seeks comment on whether it should restrict the transfer or assignment of partitioned licenses
(held by rural telephone companies or by businesses owned by minorities and/or women) for some period of time, and
if so, for how long any such transfer restriction period should last.

I. Background



1. In the 

Memorandum Opinion and Order

 in GEN Docket No. 90-314, 59 FR 32830 (June 24, 1994), the Commission set forth rules for licensing Personal Communications
Services in the 2 GHz band (``broadband PCS''), including specification of geographic service areas. We declined
to allow general partitioning of those service areas, stating that such partitioning could be used to circumvent
construction requirements, but we also recognized that the public interest may favor a different result ``for particular
groups of service providers, such as rural telephone companies, or to create PCS ownership opportunities for companies
owned by minorities or women.''

2. In the 

Fifth Report and Order

 in this proceeding, PP Docket No. 93-253, 59 FR 37566 (July 22, 1994) (``

Fifth Report and Order

''), the Commission determined that, to expedite the provision of broadband PCS in rural areas, which have historically
suffered from delayed introduction of new services and fewer choices in service providers, rural telephone companies
should be permitted to obtain PCS licenses by partitioning certain geographic areas from the licensed PCS service
area (MTA or BTA). These companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses in either of two
ways: (1) they may form bidding consortia to participate in auctions, and then partition the licenses won among themselves,
or (2) they may acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses from other licensees through private negotiation. We
required that partitioned areas conform to established geopolitical boundaries (such as county lines) and that
each area include that portion of the rural telephone company's wireline service area that lies within the PCS license
area. In addition, where a rural telephone company acquires a partitioned license from another PCS licensee, the
partitioned area must be reasonably related to rural telephone company's wireline service area. 

See Fifth Report and Order

 at   148-153.

3. Our rationale in allowing partitioning for rural telephone companies is that these companies are uniquely positioned
to use their existing infrastructure to provide broadband PCS in rural areas. Many rural telephone companies argued
that if they were required to bid on entire Basic Trading Area or Major Trading Area licenses to obtain licenses covering
their wireline service areas, they would be effectively barred from entering the broadband PCS industry. They contend
that under a partitioning plan, they would be able to serve areas in which they already provide service, while the remainder
of the PCS service area could be served by other more efficient providers.



II. Discussion



4. We wish to consider whether a similar post-auction broadband PCS partitioning plan should be adopted for the benefit
of businesses owned by minorities and/or women. We note that some parties commenting on petitions for reconsideration
that we received in GEN Docket No. 90-314 supported various forms of geographic partitioning.
 Others, however, were opposed to partitioning.
 The record has not been sufficiently developed on the issue of whether the public interest would be served by permitting
businesses owned by minorities and/or women to hold partitioned licenses to enable the Commission to make a determination
on this issue. We therefore seek further comment from interested parties.
 Commenters should address the following issues: (1) whether allowing businesses owned by minorities and/or women
to hold partitioned PCS licenses would serve the public interest; (2) if so, what parameters the Commission should
provide for these entities to obtain partitioned licenses (

i.e.

, through what mechanisms should partitioned licenses be granted and what, if any, limitations should apply); and
(3) whether any such partitioning should be prohibited for a period of time after initial PCS licensing, and if so,
for what period.







Commenters should focus on the public interest impact that allowing such partitioning would likely have. We are particularly
interested in hearing from interested parties whether such partitioning could be expected to give rise to benefits
corresponding to those we expect to derive from rural telephone company partitioning. We also seek comment on whether
the potential benefits that may be derived by partitioni
