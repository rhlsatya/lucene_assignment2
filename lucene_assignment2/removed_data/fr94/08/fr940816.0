DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 


Customs Service







Realignment of Tampa and Miami Districts 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Customs Regulations governing the Customs field organization by changing the boundaries
of the Tampa District and the Miami District, which lie in the Southeast Region. The boundaries of these two districts
are being altered to reflect the established judicial districts within the state. This is being accomplished by transferring
the counties of Collier and Hendry to the Tampa Customs District from the Miami Customs District. The realignment
will allow a more efficient use of Customs employees and facilitate operations for many of the users of Customs services.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 


As part of its continuing effort to utilize its personnel, facilities and resources more efficiently, and to provide
better service to the public, importers and carriers, Customs is 
realigning the boundaries of its Tampa and Miami Districts. The realignment gives jurisdiction over all cities and
counties along the west coast of Florida to the Tampa District. This is being accomplished by removing the counties
of Collier and Hendry from the Miami District and adding them to the Tampa District. 
The realignment will permit personnel from the Tampa District to serve the areas of Collier and Hendry Counties which
are currently under the jurisdiction of the Miami District. Currently, aircraft inspection clearances from Naples,
which is in Collier County, must be coordinated by personnel from the Miami District which is headquartered approximately
120 miles away while personnel from the Tampa District are stationed at the Southwest Regional Airport in Fort Myers,
only 20 miles distant. 
An additional reason supporting the change is that the new District boundaries will also conform to the current jurisdictional
boundaries of the Customs Office of Enforcement. The enforcement boundaries were realigned in 1989 so that they would
coincide with the jurisdictional boundaries of the 0U.S. Attorney's office and provide for a uniformity of treatment
for all liquidated damage, penalty and seizure cases instituted in the state. After this change, all Customs transactions
can be handled within the same District offices. 
Support for this realignment has been voiced by several elements of the regional importing community who anticipate
improved service from a local headquarters. 
It is not anticipated that this amendment will have any impact on the staffing level in either District. 


Boundaries of Tampa 


The new boundaries of the Tampa, Florida, District are as follows: 
The North shore of the St. Marys River and the city of St. Marys, Ga., and all the State of Florida except the counties
of Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin, Okeechobee, Palm Beach, Broward, Monroe, Dade. 


Boundaries of Miami 


The new boundaries of the Miami, Florida, District are as follows: 
The counties of Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin, Okeechobee, Palm Beach, Broward, Monroe, and Dade. 


Comments 


Customs published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 


Federal Register

 on March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12879) which invited the public to comment on the above described realignment of the Tampa and
Miami District boundaries. No comments were received in response to this invitation. Accordingly, the amendment
is being published in final as it was proposed. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 


Customs establishes the boundaries of the various districts throughout the United States to enable it to best perform
its mission and to serve the public as efficiently as possible. Although this document is being issued after notice
for public comment, it is not subject to the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 because it relates
to agency 
management and organization. Accordingly, this document is not subject to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). Because this document relates to agency organization and management, it is not subject to E.O. 12866. 


Drafting Information 


The principal author of this document was Peter T. Lynch, Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings,
U.S. Customs Service. However, personnel from other offices participated in its development.

Federal Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance; Determining Disability and Blindness; Extension of Expiration
Date for Adult Mental Disorders Listings



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Social Security Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Social Security Administration issues listings of impairments to evaluate disability and blindness under the
Social Security and supplemental-security income (SSI) programs. This rule extends the expiration date for the
adult mental disorders listings. We have made no revisions to the medical criteria in the listings; they remain the
same as they now appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. This extension will ensure that we continue to have medical
evaluation criteria in the listings to adjudicate claims for disability based on mental impairments at step three
of our sequential evaluation process.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 28, 1985, we published revised adult mental disorders listings (50 FR 35038) in part A of appendix 1 (Listing
of Impairments) to subpart P of part 404. We use the listings to evaluate disability and blindness at the third step
of the sequential evaluation process for adults and children under the Social Security and SSI programs. The listings
describe impairments considered severe enough to prevent a person from doing any gainful activity, or, for a child
under age 18 applying for SSI benefits based on disability, from functioning independently, appropriately, and
effectively in an age-appropriate manner. We use the criteria in part A mainly to evaluate impairments of adults.
We use the criteria in part B first to evaluate impairments of children under age 18. If those criteria do not apply,
we may use the criteria in part A.




When we published the revised adult mental disorders listings in August 1985, we indicated that medical advances
in disability evaluation and treatment and program experience would require that the listings be periodically reviewed
and updated. Accordingly, we established a date of August 28, 1988, on which the listings would no longer be effective
unless extended by the Secretary or revised and promulgated again. Subsequently, we issued a number of final rules
extending the expiration date of the adult mental disorders listings. The last was published on August 23, 1993 (58
FR 44444) and provided that the listings for adult mental disorders would no longer be effective on August 28, 1994.
Also, on July 18, 1991, we published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (56 FR 33130) that included proposed revisions
to those listings. We will publish any changes to the listings based on that NPRM in a subsequent final rule.

In this final regulation, we are extending for one year, to August 28, 1995, the date on which the adult mental disorders
listings will no longer be effective. We believe that the requirements in these listings are still valid for our program
purposes. As noted above, we use the listings at the third step of the sequential evaluation process. Specifically,
if we find that an individual has an impairment that meets the statutory duration requirement and also meets or is equivalent
in severity to an impairment in the listings, we will find that the individual is disabled without completing the remaining
steps of the sequential evaluation process. We do not use the listings to find that an individual is not disabled. Individuals
whose impairments do not meet or equal the criteria of the listings receive individualized assessments at the subsequent
steps of the sequential evaluation process.



Regulatory Procedures



The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy generally follows the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA) NPRM and public comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553 in the development of its regulations. The APA
provides exceptions to its notice and public comment procedures when an agency finds there is good cause for dispensing
with such procedures on the basis that they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. We
have determined that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists for dispensing with the NPRM and public comment
procedures in this case. Good cause exists because this regulation only extends the date on which the adult mental
disorders listings will no longer be effective and makes no substantive changes to those listings. The current regulations
expressly provide that the listings may be extended by the Secretary, as well as revised and promulgated again. Therefore,
opportunity for prior comment is unnecessary, and we are issuing these changes to our regulations as a final rule.

New Animal Drugs For Use In Animal Feeds; Tiamulin 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect the approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Fermenta Animal Health Co. The supplemental NADA provides for the use
of tiamulin (Denagard

 

) Type A medicated article to make a Type C medicated feed used for the treatment of swine dysentery.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Fermenta Animal Health Co., 10150 North Executive Hills Blvd., Kansas City, MO 64153, is the sponsor of NADA 139-472,
which was approved on July 17, 1987 (52 FR 26955), for the use of tiamulin Type A medicated articles in the preparation
of Type C medicated swine feeds. As first approved, the Type C medicated feed containing 35 grams per ton (g/t) of tiamulin
could be used to control swine dysentery. The Type C medicated feed containing 10 g of tiamulin per ton could be used
for increased rate of weight gain from weaning to 56.70 kilograms (kg) (125 pounds (lb)), which was later approved
to 113.40 kg (250 lb) on October 6, 1988 (53 FR 39257). The sponsor has submitted a supplemental application providing
for the use of tiamulin Type A medicated article containing 5, 10, or 113.4 g/lb of tiamulin hydrogen fumarate to make
a Type C medicated swine feed containing 200 g/t of tiamulin for the treatment of swine dysentery. 



The supplemental NADA is approved as of July 7, 1994, and the regulations are amended by modifying  558.600 (21
CFR 558.600) to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. In
addition, the regulation is amended by modifying the genera ``

Treponema

'' to include the currently scientifically accepted genera name ``

Serpulina

.'' 

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this
approval qualifies for 3 years exclusivity beginning July 7, 1994, because the supplemental application contains
reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the
approval of the application and conducted by the applicant. The 3 years of marketing exclusivity applies only to the
new claim ``for treatment of swine dysentery'' for which the supplemental application was approved. 
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Pfizer, Inc. The supplement provides for revised tolerances for residues
of dihydrostreptomycin in edible animal tissues.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pfizer, Inc., 235 East 42d St., New York, NY 10017, filed supplemental NADA 65-483 that provides for revising
tolerances for residues of dihydrostreptomycin in uncooked, edible tissues of cattle and swine, in milk from dairy
animals, and in any food in which such milk is used. A zero tolerance level was established when the drug was originally
approved on February 18, 1954. A zero tolerance affirmed that no detectable residues of the new animal drug were permissible
in edible tissues of treated animals when the tissues were assayed using available analytical methods.


As analytical technology improved, advanced methods were developed that were more sensitive and capable of measuring
progressively smaller amounts of residues in tissues. FDA adopted the concept of maximum negligible residues to
reflect the lower level of quantitative sensitivity of the official regulatory analytical method. This concept
was later modified to consider the consumption levels of various edible tissues.
In addition, dihydrostreptomycin has been approved for use in several injectable and intramammary products used
for treating bovine, porcine, equine, and canine species. Where tolerances for use in food animals would have been
appropriate, those tolerances were not established because of the existing zero level. At this time, tolerances
for residues in those species are established.
FDA has determined that a revision of the tolerance from zero to 0.125 parts per million (ppm) in milk, and 2.0 ppm in
kidney and 0.5 ppm in all other tissues of cattle and swine is appropriate. The new tolerance reflects the levels that
would have been established when the drug was originally approved if the analytical methods had been more sensitive.
No new toxicity data were submitted. Levels of 2.0 ppm in kidney, 0.5 ppm in all other edible tissues, and 0.125 ppm in
milk reflect the levels that FDA considers to be safe and the residue levels that the U.S. Department of Agriculture
has been monitoring for a number of years.
The supplement is approved as of July 20, 1994, and the regulations in 21 CFR 556.200 are amended to reflect the new tolerance
levels.
The approval of this supplement did not require the submission of new data and information. Therefore, a freedom of
information summary under 21 CFR part 20 and 21 CFR 514.11(e)(2) was not required. Approval of the supplement is based
on the information submitted with the original NADA.
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(9) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.



List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 556


Animal drugs, Foods.
Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food

2. Section 556.200 is revised to read as follows:


 556.200 

Dihydrostreptomycin.


Tolerances are established for residues of dihydrostreptomycin in uncooked, edible tissues of cattle and swine
of 2.0 parts per million (ppm) in kidney and 0.5 ppm in other tissues, and 0.125 ppm in milk.

and officially opened a new BEP facility in Fort Worth, Texas, which is hereinafter known as the Western Currency Facility.
This final rule modifies the existing regulations to include the BEP Western Currency Facility Buildings and Grounds
located in Fort Worth, Texas.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing's Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth, Texas is included in 31 CFR part 605
along with the BEP properties located in Washington, DC. Title 5 of the United States Code, Section 301; delegation
of authority from the Administrator of the General Services Administration, dated December 3, 1992; and Treasury
delegation of authority from the Assistant Secretary (Management), dated February 4, 1993, give the Director, BEP,
overall authority to appoint special policemen and to make all needful rules and regulations for the protection of
BEP's Buildings and grounds in Washington, DC, and Fort Worth, Texas. The language in 31 CFR part 605 now recognizes
special police and not guards as specified in the former language of the regulations. Additionally, closed circuit
television is used instead of video surveillance in the language of the regulations, and the language of the regulations
related to access to BEP has been expanded to be more descriptive. Moreover, the provisions related to penalties and
other law has been expanded to be more descriptive.


Executive Order 12866


Because this rule relates to agency organization and management, it is not subject to Executive Order 12866, section
3(d)(3).


Administrative Procedure Act


Because this Treasury decision relates to agency organization and management and is procedural in nature, notice
and public procedure and a delayed effective date are inapplicable pursuant to 5 United States Code, Section 553(a)(2).


Regulatory Flexibility Act


Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this final rule, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act do not apply.


Paperwork Reduction Act


The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96-511, 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, and its implementing
regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, do not apply to this rule because no requirement to collect information is contemplated.

Florida; Final Authorization of Revisions to State Hazardous Waste Management Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Florida has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA). Florida's revisions consist of the provisions contained in the rules promulgated between
July 1, 1990, and June 30, 1992, otherwise known as RCRA Cluster I & II. These requirements are listed in section
B of this document. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Florida's application and has made a decision,
subject to public review and comment, that the Florida hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements
necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Florida's hazardous waste program revisions.
Florida's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 
U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a 
hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous
waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98-616,
November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent
instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option
receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and
later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. 

Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270.

B. Florida 



Florida initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on February 12, 1985, (50 FR 3908,
January 29, 1985). Florida received authorization for revisions to its program on April 6, 1992, for Non-HSWA III,
IV, and V, and on January 10, 1994 for HSWA I without Corrective Action. Today, Florida is seeking approval of its program
revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 

EPA has reviewed Florida's application and has made an immediate final decision that Florida's hazardous waste program
revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends
to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Florida. The public may submit written
comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until October 17, 1994. Copies of Florida's application for these program
revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 

Addresses

 section of this notice. 

Approval of Florida's program revisions shall become effective October 17, 1994. Unless an adverse comment pertaining
to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. 

If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2)
a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or
reverses the decision. 

EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits that contain conditions based upon
the Federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization and which were issued by EPA prior
to the effective date of this authorization. EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions
for which the State is being authorized on the effective date of this authorization. 

Florida is today seeking authority to administer the following Federal requirements.

C. Decision 



I conclude that Florida's application for these program revisions meet all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Florida is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised, except where otherwise noted. 

Florida now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application, its
previously approved authorities and where otherwise noted in this document. Florida also has primary enforcement
responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement
actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.




Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Florida's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. 

This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Hazardous waste, Indian lands, Intergovernmental relations, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,

Changes in List of Species in Appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
and Flora



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES or the Convention) regulates
international trade in certain animals and plants. Species for which such trade is controlled are listed in Appendices
I, II, and III to the Convention. The countries participating in this treaty, including the United States, have adopted
species amendments to Appendices I and II. The United States did not enter a reservation on any of these listing amendments
approved at the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties. This document incorporates these amendments into
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's regulations implementing the Convention.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



The Convention regulates import, export, re-export, and introduction from the sea of certain animal and plant species.
Species for which trade is controlled are included in three appendices. Their inclusion in Appendix I or II is by agreement
of CITES Party countries. Appendix I include species threatened with extinction that are or may be affected by trade.
Appendix II includes species that although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade
in them is strictly controlled. It also lists species that must be subject to regulation in order that trade in other
currently or potentially threatened species may be brought under effective control (

e.g

., because of difficulty in distinguishing specimens of the currently or potentially threatened species from the
specimens of other species). Appendix III includes species that any Party country unilaterally designates as being
subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for purposes of restricting or preventing exploitation, and for which
cooperation of other Parties is needed to control trade. 



Any CITES Party may propose amendments to Appendices I and II for consideration at meetings of the Conference of the
Parties. The text of proposals must be communicated to the CITES Secretariat at least 150 days before a meeting. The
Secretariat must then consult the other Parties and appropriate intergovernmental agencies, and communicate responses
to all Parties no later than 30 days before the meeting. Amendments are adopted by consensus or a two-thirds majority
of the Parties present and voting. 



Actions of the Parties 



The eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES was held on March 2-13, 1992, in Kyoto, Japan. At the
meeting (COP8), the Parties considered 81 different proposals to amend the appendices for animals and 27 different
proposals for plants. The 108 proposals were described in earlier 

Federal Register

 notice; and addressed
