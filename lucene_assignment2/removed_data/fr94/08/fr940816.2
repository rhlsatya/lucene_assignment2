Cancellation of an environmental impact statement.








</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On August 7, 1990, a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Chenuis Creek/Cayada
Mountain Timber Sale on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest was published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 32105). A notice of availability for the draft EIS was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 11, 1991 (56 FR 1184), with a comment period on the draft EIS ending February 25, 1991.


The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was amended on April 13, 1994 with additional
land allocations and standards and guidelines (Record of Decision for Amendments to Forest Service and Bureau of
Land Management Planning Documents within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl, as amplified in attached Standards
and Guidelines for Management of Habitat for Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Related Species Within the
Range of the Northern Spotted Owl).
Because of this amendment, the analysis process has been terminated; there will be no final EIS for the Chenuis Creek/Cayada
Mountain Timber Sale.

<DOCTITLE>Hoodoo Ski Bowl Master Plan, Willamette National Forest, Linn County, OR</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agency:

 Forest Service, USDA.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the proposed Master Plan for Hoodoo Ski
Bowl to be submitted by Hoodoo Ski Bowl, Inc. The need for a new Master Plan for Hoodoo Ski Bowl ski area is to replace the
current Master Plan which was approved April 23, 1980. The current plan expires in December 1995. The Willamette National
Forest invites written comments on the scope of the analysis and decision making process for the proposal so interested
and affected people may participate and contribute to the final decision. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The USDA, Forest Service, proposal is to prepare an environmental impact statement in order to review, modify, and
approve a Master Plan for Hoodoo Ski Area located on the McKenzie Ranger District of the Willamette National Forest
in Linn County, Oregon. The preparation of the Master Plan and EIS will take place concurrently.



Governmental agencies and the public who may be interested in or affected by the proposal are invited to participate
in the scoping process. The Forest Service will hold five formal public scoping meetings: Tuesday, Aug. 16, 1994,
at the Shilo Inn, Bend, Oregon at 7 PM; Wednesday, Aug. 17, 1994, at the Sisters Firehall, Sisters, Oregon at 7 PM; Thursday,
Aug. 18, 1994, at the Springfield Red Lion Inn, Springfield, Oregon at 7 PM; Tuesday, Aug. 23, 1994, at the Bureau of
Land Management Office, Salem, Oregon at 7 PM; and Wednesday, Aug. 24 at Linn-Benton Community College, Albany, Oregon
at 7 PM. Preliminary ideas prepared by the proponents will be available for public review. Further meetings may be
planned at a later date. Due to budgetary and organizational uncertainties the Forest Service anticipates two possibilities
for the preparation of the EIS; preparation by the Forest Service or by a third party company. This decision is expected
by October 1, 1994.

The EIS will consider a range of alternatives based on the issues and concerns associated with the project. Only one
alternative can be specified at present, the No Action alternative. Other alternatives may consist of modifications
or changes in the various elements comprising the proposal. 

The draft EIS will tier to the 1990 Final EIS for the Willamette National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan as
amended by the Record of Decision for Amendment to Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management Planning Documents
Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl. The Forest Service is the lead agency.

The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in March of 1995. At that time, copies of the draft EIS will be distributed to interested and affected agencies, organizations,
and members of the public for their review and comment. EPA will publish a notice of availability of the draft EIS in
the 

Federal Register

. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of availability in the


Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

 Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v.

 NRDC,

 435 U.S. 519. 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement
stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts.

 City of Angoon

 v.

 Hodel,

 803 f. 2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and

 Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v.

 Harris,

 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.).

The final EIS is scheduled to be completed in July 1995. In the final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond to
comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed
in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making the decision regarding the Hoodoo
Ski Bowl Master Plan. Darrel L. Kenops, Forest Supervisor, is the Responsible Official. As the Responsible Official,
he will decide whether to implement the Master Plan. The Responsible Official will document the decision and reasons
for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to Forest Service Appeal Regulations (36
CFR Part 215).

 Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Panel Decision, Revocation of Countervailing Duty Order and Termination of Suspension of Liquidation.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On February 23, 1994, the Binational Panel convened under the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement issued a
decision affirming the Department of Commerce's (the Department) determination issued pursuant to remand that
the Canadian provincial governments were not providing countervailable subsidies to producers or exporters of
certain softwood lumber products. The United States requested that an Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC)
be convened to review the Binational Panel's decision. On August 3, 1994, the ECC affirmed the Binational Panel's
February 23, 1994, order affirming the Department's redetermination. Therefore, we are revoking the countervailing
duty order on certain softwood lumber products from Canada and ordering the termination of suspension of liquidation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On May 28, 1992, the Department determined that the Canadian provincial governments were providing countervailable
subsidies to producers and exporters of certain softwood lumber products (57 FR 22570). On July 6, 1992, the International
Trade Commission notified the Department of its determination that a U.S. industry was being materially injured
by reason of imports of certain softwood lumber products from Canada. On 
July 13, 1992, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 30955) the countervailing duty order on certain softwood lumber products from Canada. 
The Department's determination was reviewed by a Binational Panel under the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
The Binational Panel remanded the determination to the Department and ordered it to find that no countervailable
subsidies were being provided to softwood lumber producers or exporters by the Canadian provincial governments.
The Department filed its amended redetermination, which the Binational Panel affirmed. The Binational Panel's
decision became final on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12584). The United States requested that an ECC be convened to review
the Binational Panel's decision. On 
August 3, 1994, the ECC affirmed the Binational Panel's Order Affirming the Determination on Remand. Therefore,
we are revoking the countervailing duty order on certain softwood lumber products from Canada, effective March 17,
1994, and ordering the U.S. Customs Service to terminate the suspension of liquidation on all entries made on or after
that date. Cash deposits made prior to March 17, 1994 are not addressed in this notice. 


Termination of Suspension of Liquidation 


The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to terminate the suspension of liquidation of certain softwood
lumber products from Canada, effective March 17, 1994, to cease collection of cash deposits on certain softwood lumber
products from Canada, and to proceed with liquidation of the subject merchandise which entered the United States
on or after 
March 17, 1994, without regard to countervailing duties.

ACTION:

 Issuance of Modification 3 to Permit 825 held by the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (P513).





On September 15, 1993 notice was published (58 FR 48354) that an application had been filed by the Columbia River Inter-Tribal
Fish Commission for a modification to Permit 825 to take listed Snake River chinook salmon as authorized by the Endangered
Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits
(50 CFR parts 217-222).
Notice is hereby given that on August 9, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification
3 to Permit Number 825 (P513) to take listed Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon subject to certain conditions
set forth therein. The modification increases the take numbers for a cryopreservation study, but restricts the take
to post-spawned adult male fish.
Issuance of this permit, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such permit: (1) Was applied for in good faith;
(2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of this permit; (3) is consistent
with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance with and is
subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits.
The application, permit, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following
offices, by appointment:
Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910-3226 (301-713-2322);

<DOCTITLE>Request for Public Comments on Bilateral Textile Consultations with the Government of Nepal on Certain Cotton and
Man-Made Fiber Textile Products </DOCTITLE>

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:






Authority: 

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




On July 29, 1994, under the terms of Section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended, the Government of the United
States requested consultations with the Government of Nepal with respect to cotton and man-made fiber dresses in
Categories 336/636, produced or manufactured in Nepal.

The purpose of this notice is to advise the public that, if no solution is agreed upon in consultations with the Government
of Nepal, the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements may later establish a limit for the entry and
withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton and man-made fiber textile products in Categories 336/636,
produced or manufactured in Nepal and exported during the twelve-month period which began on July 29, 1994 and extends
through July 28, 1995, at a level of not less than 146,656 dozen.

A summary market statement concerning Categories 336/636 follows this notice.

Anyone wishing to comment or provide data or information regarding the treatment of Categories 336/636, or to comment
on domestic production or availability of products included in Categories 336/636, is invited to submit 10 copies
of such comments or information to Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements,
U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; ATTN: Helen L. LeGrande. The comments received will be considered
in the context of the consultations with the Government of Nepal.

Because the exact timing of the consultations is not yet certain, comments should be submitted promptly. Comments
or information submitted in response to this notice will be available for public inspection in the Office of Textiles
and Apparel, room H3100, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.

Further comments may be invited regarding particular comments or information received from the public which the
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements considers appropriate for further consideration.

The solicitation of comments regarding any aspect of the agreement or the implementation thereof is not a waiver in
any respect of the exemption contained in 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1) relating to matters which constitute ``a foreign affairs
function of the United States.''

The United States remains committed to finding a solution concerning Categories 336/636. Should such a solution
be reached in consultations with the Government of Nepal, further notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

.

A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile
and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see 

Federal Register

 notice 58 FR 62645, published on November 29, 1993).

Import Situation and Conclusion



U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber dresses, Category 336/636, from Nepal reached 174,621 dozen during the year
ending May 1994, three times the 58,596 dozen shipped during the year ending May 1993. During the first five months
of 1994, imports of Category 336/636 from Nepal surged to 138,555 dozen, more than triple the 42,801 dozen imported
during the same period in 1993 and nearly double Nepal's total calendar year 1993 level.
 
The sharp and substantial increase of Category 336/636 imports from Nepal is disrupting the U.S. market for cotton
and manmade fiber dresses.


</SIGNJOB>
<SIGNJOB>
U.S. Production, Import Penetration and Market Share



U.S. production of cotton and manmade fiber dresses, Category 336/636, fell from 15,290,000 dozen in 1989 to 12,710,000
dozen in 1993, a decrease of 17 percent. In contrast, U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber dresses, Category 336/636,
increased from 5,891,000 dozen in 1989 to 6,312,000 dozen in 1993, a 7 percent increase. U.S. imports in Category 336/636
are surging in 1994, increasing 33 percent in the first five months of 1994 over the January-May 1993 level.

The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 39 percent in 1989 to 50 percent in 1993. The domestic manufacturers'
share of the cotton and manmade fiber dress market declined from 72 percent in 1989 to 67 percent in 1993, a decline of
5 percentage points.

<SIGNJOB>
Duty-Paid Value and U.S. Producers' Price


Approximately 84 percent of Category 336/636 imports from Nepal during the year ending May 1994 entered the U.S. under
HTSUSA 6204.42.3050_Women's woven cotton dresses, other than corduroy; and HTSUSA 6204.44.4010_Women's woven
dresses of artificial fibers, containing less than 36 percent wool or fine animal hair by weight. These dresses entered
the U.S. at landed duty-paid values below U.S. producers' prices for comparable dresses.

Settlement Agreement and Order



1. This Settlement Agreement and Order, entered into between The Toro Company, a corporation (hereinafter ``Toro''),
and the staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (hereinafter ``the staff'') is a compromise resolution of
the matter described herein, without a hearing or determination of issues of law or fact.



I. The Parties



2. The Toro Company is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Delaware, with its principal
corporate offices located at 8111 Lyndale Avenue South, Bloomington, Minnesota 55420-1196.

3. The staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (hereinafter ``the Commission'') are those members of the
Commission's staff responsible for enforcing the laws administered by the Commission. The Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency established by Congress pursuant to section 4 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (hereinafter,
``the CPSA'' or ``the Act''), 15 U.S.C.  2053.



II. Jurisdiction



4. On November 7, 1989, Toro acquired Lawn-Boy. Inc, (hereinafter ``Lawn-Boy''), a manufacturer and distributor
of various models of lawn mowers. Lawn-Boy manufactured the lawn mowers at issue in this proceeding for sale to consumers
for use around permanent or temporary households or residences. These lawn mowers are ``consumer products'' within
the meaning of section 3(a)(1) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C.  2051(a)(1).

5. Between approximately October 1, 1987 and August 29, 1989, Lawn-Boy manufactured and distributed over 160,000
lawn mowers, identified as ``L'' series lawn mowers, for sale to consumers throughout the United States. During 1989
and 1990, Lawn-Boy also manufactured lawn mowers under the ``M'' series and ``Model 8157'' designations, respectively,
for sale to consumers throughout the United States. Lawn-Boy, therefore, is a ``manufacturer'' of consumer products
which are ``distributed in Commerce'', as those terms are defined in sections 3(a)(4) and (11) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C.
 2052(a)(4) and (11).

6. After its acquisition by Toro, Lawn-Boy operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toro until July 31, 1992, when
its assets and liabilities were transferred to Toro. Since its acquisition of Lawn-Boy, Toro has been responsible
for controlling the acts and practices of Lawn-Boy, including assuring that Lawn-Boy complied with the requirements
of section 15(b) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C.  2064(b), and the regulations issued thereunder, 16 C.F.R.  1115,


et seq.





III. The Products



7. The products at issue in this matter are walk-behind lawn mowers.



IV. Staff Allegations Concerning the ``L'' Series, ``M'' Series and ``Model 8157'' Lawn Mowers and the Failure of
Toro To Assure That its Subsidiary, Lawn-Boy Complied With the Reporting Requirements of Section 15(b) of the CPSA



8. Section 15(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C.  2064(b), requires a manufacturer of a consumer
product who, 

inter alia

, obtains information that reasonably supports the conclusion that the product contains a defect which could create
a substantial product hazard or that the product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death to inform
the Commission immediately of the defect or risk.



The ``L'' Series Lawn Mowers



9. Between October, 1987 and August, 1989, Lawn-Boy's ``L'' series lawn mowers were equipped with gas tanks that were
susceptible to leakage because of improper bonding of the tank halves during a hot-plate welding process. Lawn-Boy
learned of the leakage problem in 1988 and replaced leaking gas tanks on lawn mowers brought in for service through
1990. In early 1989, Lawn-Boy's fuel tank supplier modified the tank design to improve bonding of the gas tank halves.
In August 1989, Lawn-Boy authorized its tank supplier to build new machinery to improve the hot-welding process to
correct the leakage problem.

10. After Toro's acquisition of Lawn-Boy in 1989, Lawn-Boy continued to receive complaints about seam leakage on
``L'' series mower gas tanks, and Lawn-Boy dealers continued to replace leaking tanks on mowers brought in for service.
In its capacity as corporate parent of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lawn-Boy, Toro knew or, with the exercise of due
diligence, should have known that the tanks were defective and that the defect could expose consumers to a substantial
risk of injury from fire.

11. Despite the pattern of tank seam failures that continued after Toro's acquisition of Lawn-Boy, Toro failed to
provide any information concerning the failures to the Commission until a Commission investigator inspected Lawn-Boy
in November, 1990. Toro did not file an initial report under section 15(b) until March, 1991.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940816-2-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940816-2-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

12. Toro failed to report information concerning gas tank seam failures on ``L'' series mowers to the Commission in
a timely manner as required by section 15(b) of the CPSA, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  2064(b).



The ``M'' Series Lawn Mowers



13. During 1989 and 1990, Lawn-Boy manufactured and distributed ``M'' series lawn mowers that experienced gas tank
leakage. The method of mounting and attaching the tanks to the mower engines resulted in wear on the tanks that caused
the tanks to fail and leak. Lawn-Boy received complaints of leakage after its acquisition by Toro, redesigned the
mounting system, and, in 1990, included redesigned brackets and tanks in an ``upgrade kit'' to be installed by Lawn-Boy
distributors and dealers on ``M'' series mowers brought in for service.

14. In its capacity as the corporate parent of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lawn-Boy, Toro knew, or with the exercise
of due diligence, should have known that the method of mounting the tanks caused wear on the tanks and could expose consumers
to a substantial risk of injury from fire. Despite the pattern of tank failures, Toro failed to provide any information
concerning the failures to the Commission until a Commission investigator inspected Lawn-Boy in November, 1990.

15. Toro failed to report information relating to gas tank failures on the ``M'' series lawn mowers to the Commission
in a timely manner as required by section 15(b) of the CPSA, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  2064(b).



The ``Model 8157'' Series Lawn Mowers



16. In 1987 and 1988, Lawn-Boy manufactured and distributed Model 8157 series lawn mowers. In 1989, Lawn-Boy received
complaints that the gas tanks on these lawn mowers were experiencing gas leakage as a result of fractures in the fuel
tank nipples. In 1990, a revised fuel tank nipple was incorporated in replacement tanks for the Model 8157 series.

17. In its capacity as the corporate parent of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lawn-Boy, Toro knew, or, with the exercise
of due diligence, should have known that gas tank fuel nipples were fracturing and could expose consumers to a substantial
risk of injury from fire. Despite the pattern of tank failures, Toro failed to provide any information concerning
the failures to the Commission until a Commission investigator inspected Lawn-Boy in November, 1990.

18. Toro failed to report information relating to gas tank failures on the Model 8157 series lawn mowers to the Commission
in a timely manner as required by section 15(b) of the CPSA, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  2064(b).



V. Response of Toro



19. Toro denies each and all of the staff allegations with respect to the mowers identified in this agreement. Further,
Toro denies the allegations that the Lawn-Boy ``L'' series lawn mowers identified in paragraph 9 of this agreement,
the ``M'' series lawn mowers identified in paragraph 13, and the ``Model 8157'' series lawn mowers identified in paragraph
16 contained defects which created or could have created a substantial product hazard within the meaning of section
15(a) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2064(a). Toro further denies that any of these lawn mowers created an unreasonable risk
of death or serious injury. Accordingly, Toro contends that it had no obligation to report to the Commission under
section 15(b).

20. Toro contends further that the complaints relating to the Model 8157 mowers were as a result of a local manufacturer-distributor
dispute and that no unusual reports of problems were received when the same mowers were redistributed to other parts
of the country.

21. Toro further asserts that it has received no reports of injuries from the use of any of the products enumerated in
this agreement. Toro makes no admission whatsoever of any fault, liability, or statutory violation in the event any
person should claim injuries resulting from the use of these products.

22. Toro further contends that, to the extent there were any leakage problems with any of these lawn mowers, those problems
arose prior to Toro's acquisition of Lawn-Boy. Lawn-Boy's prior corporate parent, Outboard Marine Corporation,
failed to disclose any such problem to Toro, despite representing in the agreement with Toro to purchase the stock
of Lawn-Boy that (1) Lawn-Boy had no liabilities or obligations which would be required to be disclosed on a Financial
Statement prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, (2) Lawn-Boy was not in violation
of any applicable law, statute, order, rule or regulation, which, if violated, would be reasonably likely to have
a material adverse effect, and (3) since September 30, 1988, no material adverse change or event that was reasonably
likely to result in a material adverse change in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, or business of Lawn-Boy
had occurred. Toro acted reasonably and with due diligence in relying on these representations to conclude that its
newly acquired subsidiary, Lawn-Boy, was in full compliance with the requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA.



VI. Agreement of the Parties



23. The parties enter this agreement solely for the purposes of settlement. Toro and the staff agree that the Commission
has jurisdiction in this matter for purposes of entry and enforcement of this Settlement Agreement and Order.

24. Toro agrees to pay the Commission a civil penalty in the amount of one hundred and seventy thousand dollars ($170,000)
payable within twenty (20) days after service of the Final Order. This payment is made in settlement of the staff allegations
that Toro violated the reporting requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA with regard to the lawn mowers described
above. In agreeing to this settlement, Toro affirms that it does not accept the Commission staff allegations as factual,
nor does Toro admit to any liability in this matter.

25. Toro further agrees to assist the Commission staff in any further investigation of this matter by providing, upon
specific request and without the issuance of a 

subpoena duces tecum

, such testimony and evidence as Toro would otherwise be required to produce if such a subpoena issued. Toro reserves
the right to contest any specific request for information that it believes it would not be required to be produced in
response to such a subpoena, and further reserves the right to assert any claims of confidentiality or privilege that
would be available in the course of a proceeding by the staff to enforce such a subpoena.

26. The agreement to settle this matter is based on the information provided to the Commission staff by Toro as of May
20, 1994. The Commission reserves the right to seek an additional penalty if it acquires information that establishes
that, between November 7, 1989 and November 28, 1990, Toro or its authorized representatives received information
from its subsidiary, Lawn-Boy, that reasonably supported the conclusion that gas tank seam separation and leakage
in the ``L'' series mowers (a) constituted a defect which could create a substantial product hazard, as that term is
defined in section 15(a)(2) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C.  2064(a)(2), or (b) created an unreasonable risk of serious
injury or death.

27. Payment of the full amount of the penalty shall settle fully the staff's allegations set forth in paragraphs 9 through
18 above, subject to the reservation contained in paragraph 26.

28. For the purposes of section 6(b) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C.  2055(b), this matter shall be treated as if a complaint
had issued.

29. Upon provisional acceptance of this Settlement Agreement and Order, the agreement and order shall be placed on
the public record and shall be published in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with the procedure set forth in 16 CFR 1118.20(e). If, within 15 days of publication, the Commission
has not received any written request not to accept the Settlement Agreement and Order, The Settlement Agreement and
Order will be deemed to be finally accepted on the 16th day after the date it is published in the 

Federal Register

 (16 CFR 1118.20(f)).

30. Upon final acceptance of this Settlement Agreement and Order by the Commission, Toro knowingly, voluntarily,
and completely waives any rights it might have: (1) to an administrative or judicial hearing with respect to the Commission's
claim for a civil penalty, (2) to judicial review or other challenge to or contest of the validity of the Commission's
action with regard to its claim for a civil penalty, (3) to a determination by the Commission as to whether a violation
of section 15(b) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C.  2064(b), has occurred, and (4) to a statement of findings of fact and conclusions
of law with regard to the Commission's claim for a civil penalty.

31. The parties further agree that the Commission shall issue the incorporated Order under the CPSA, 15 U.S.C.  2051


et seq,

, and that a violation of the Order will subject Toro to appropriate legal action.

32. No agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation not contained in this Settlement Agreement
may be used to vary or contradict its terms.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to award a grant based upon an unsolicited application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office, through the Chicago Support Office, announces, pursuant to
DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.14 (f), its intent to award a grant to the University of Illinois at Chicago,
Energy Resources Center. The purpose of the grant is to provide partial funding to underwrite the cost of organizing
a ``Chicago Energy Consortium of Cultural Arts Institutions.''



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The University of Illinois at Chicago, Energy Resources Center has proposed organizing a consortium involving many
of Chicago's best known and most frequently visited cultural arts institutions. The purpose of this consortium is
to provide these institutions with a forum to increase the awareness and facilitate the use of energy efficiency technologies

<DOCTITLE>Golden Field Office; Federal Assistance Award to Utility Biomass Energy Commercialization Association (UBECA)</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Financial Assistance Award in Response to an Unsolicited Financial Assistance Application; 36-94GO10025.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.14, is announcing
its intention to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Utility Biomass Energy Commercialization Association
(UBECA) for the development of a Biomass Energy Development Plan for the development of sustainable biomass resources
and competitive biomass energy conversion technologies.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

DOE has evaluated, in accordance with the DOE Federal Assistance Regulations, 10 CFR  600.14, the unsolicited
proposal entitled ``Biomass Energy Development Plan'' and recommends that the unsolicited proposal be accepted
for support without further competition in accordance with  600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations.



This proposal is in support of the DOE Biomass Power Program and the President's Climate Change Action Plan. The Climate
Change challenge addresses (1) meeting the energy needs of the Nation, (2) promoting energy efficiency and renewable
energy, and (3) promoting energy policy that protects the environment, as well as supporting the development of energy
efficient measures and low-emission and non-emitting power generation technologies.

This project involves cost sharing with the Utility Biomass Energy Commercialization Association (UBECA) for the
development of a multi-year industry supported ``Biomass Energy Development Plan'' that encourages the development
of economically sustainable biomass resources and economically competitive biomass energy conversion technologies.

The proposed award will provide funding to UBECA for the formation of the association, development of the Biomass
Energy Development Plan, and initial execution of the program. The objectives of UBECA include: (1) creating an industry
supported Biomass Energy Development Plan, (2) providing a voice for developing biomass power technologies and
biomass energy crops in the United States, (3) coordinating consideration of technology requirements, analyzing
the costs and benefits of biomass power, developing new applications and disseminating information, (4) expanding
utility interest and project involvement, (5) developing a market/user interface for biomass technology developers,
and (6) coordinating market interests with other organizations.

The use of biomass fuels and technologies offers the opportunity for decreased emissions both through modification
of fossil-fired boilers for co-firing wood resources and by creating closed cycled biomass systems whereby the resources
are grown specifically for biomass power production. These ``energy crops'' offer a CO

2

 sink during growth and a fuel source to displace carbonaceous fuels. The proposed association offers a forum for utilities
to develop a market-driven program for technology development and commercialization of those technologies.

The steering committee formed for the incorporation of UBECA is composed of a group of utilities that are representative
of the market. The initial plans are well conceived for the recruitment of members, development of the multi-year
biomass energy development plan and the successful creation of an industry supported program. The Utility Biomass
Energy Association would have the capability to drive market introduction, increase technology development and
biomass resource production, and increase the probability for commercial success.

The planning, management, and initial utility group support should provide a high probability of meeting associations
objectives. UBECA's goals are consistent and supportive of the DOE Collaborative Strategy for Commercialization
of Solar Electric Technologies and provides a unique opportunity for the acceleration of biomass electric technologies
by utilities. The total program cost is estimated to be $249,200, with the DOE share being $56,000 or 22.5%. This award
will not be made for at least 14 days after publication of this notice to allow for public comment.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission





Request Under Blanket Authorization; Colorado Interstate Gas Company 



August 10, 1994.



Take notice that on July 29, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), P.O. Box 1087, Colorado Springs, Colorado
80944, filed in Docket No. CP94-691-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to construct a new delivery facility
under CIG's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83-21-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural
Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

CIG proposes to construct facilities to provide fuel gas to Amoco Energy Trading Corporation (Amoco) for the start-up
of a compressor station. The delivery facility will consist of a 2-inch meter run and appurtenant facilities at an
estimated cost of $2,500 to be financed from funds on hand. The new facility will be located in Section 35, Township
33 South, Range 66 West, Las Animas County, Colorado. Amoco will need approximately 200 Mcf per day of start-up fuel
gas which is within certificated entitlements. The proposed facility will not have an impact on CIG's peak day and

Application; Centra Pipelines Minnesota Inc. 



August 10, 1994.



Take notice that on August 8, 1994, Centra Pipelines Minnesota Inc. (Centra Minnesota), 200 Yorkland Boulevard,
North York, Ontario, Canada M2J 5C6, filed on Docket No. CP94-705-000 an application pursuant to Section
3 of the Natural Gas Act requesting authority to construct a new delivery tap and appurtenant facilities in order to
directly supply an existing customer of Northern Minnesota Utilities (NMU), as more fully set forth in the application
which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Centra Minnesota states NMU, an existing customer of Centra Minnesota, has requested Centra Minnesota to provide
such service because it would be uneconomical for NMU to serve the customer from its distribution system. Centra Minnesota
requests that the Commission issue an order granting such authority by August 21, 1994, so that the construction can
take place over Labor Day weekend, September 3-5, 1994, at which time a major customer of NMU and/or Centra Minnesota
Ontario, both of which are Centra Minnesota's customers, will shutdown for maintenance, and throughput on the Central
Minnesota system will be at the low point for the year. 

Specifically, Centra Minnesota proposes to construct a high pressure service tap, 30 feet on 2-in pipeline, a two-inch
valve and meter downstream from the pressure regulator station that will be install by NMU. Centra Minnesota advises
that the proposed facilities will cost approximately $9,000 to construct and Centra Minnesota will be responsible
for all costs involved. Centra Minnesota states that such facilities will be constructed within an existing right
of way and will not result in an increase in the quality of gas that Centra Minnesota is authorized to transport on behalf
of NMU. Centra Minnesota further states that no additional revenue will be generated by this service. 

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before August
25, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. 

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal
Energy Regulation Commission by Sections 3 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and
Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given. 

Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Centra Minnesota to
appear or be represented at the hearing.

<DOCTITLE>Lead Hazard Information Pamphlet; Notice of Public Meeting </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 9, 1994, EPA issued a notice announcing the availability of its draft lead hazard information pamphlet, entitled


Lead-Based Paint: Protect Your Children

, for public review and comment. The pamphlet, required under section 406(a) of the Residential Lead-Based Paint
Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, will be distributed to owners and occupants of pre-1978 housing before the commencement
of renovations by paid renovators, and will be distributed to purchasers and lessees of pre-1978 housing before sale
or lease. The comment period for the pamphlet closed on May 9, 1994. Based on the comments received, and on information
obtained during focus group tests in several cities, EPA has revised the pamphlet. In the spirit of maximizing responsiveness
to the general public and regulated community, EPA is scheduling a public meeting to augment the publics' opportunity
to provide input on the pamphlet. Because of the time constraints imposed by the statutory deadline, however, no additional
comment period will be allowed beyond the public meeting date. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Meeting Participation 


Each person or organization desiring to participate in the public meeting must file a written request to TSCA Docket
Receipt at the address listed above. The request must be received by the Agency no later than August 30, 1994. 
An impartial moderator shall preside at the meeting, on behalf of a panel of EPA representatives, and solicit feedback
on a revised draft pamphlet. Individuals will also receive an opportunity to leave informal written comments on specific
issue areas. 
Following the public meeting, EPA will consider the feedback provided and develop the final version of the pamphlet.
Attendees of the meeting will receive notification of the final pamphlet's availability. Individuals and organizations
who are unable to attend the meeting may request inclusion on the final mailing list by mailing a request, including
name, organization, and mailing information, to Charles Franklin at the address listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION
CONTACT.


II. Background


Under the Congressional mandate in section 406(a) of TSCA, EPA has developed a lead hazard information pamphlet,
for use in association with several regulations mandated by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act
[Pub. L. 105-550]. As required by the statute, EPA is developing the pamphlet in consultation with the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
Section 406(a) of TSCA also requires that EPA issue the pamphlet for notice and comment. EPA issued a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11119), announcing the draft pamphlet's availability for public comment. EPA made the draft
pamphlet available through the National Lead Information Clearinghouse, as well as the TSCA Docket. During the 60-day
public comment period, 69 parties submitted comments. EPA also conducted a series of focus group tests in five different
cities, Atlanta, GA, Birmingham, AL, Chicago, IL, Hayward, CA, and Washington, DC. EPA has used these focus tests
to solicit general feedback on the presentation of the material from individuals with a high school education or lower.
The results of the focus tests, combined with the technical and stylistic comments provided by the public commenters,
will help EPA develop a final pamphlet that meets the informational needs of a broad range of readers. 


III. Role of Pamphlet


This pamphlet will be disseminated as a result of several Congressional directives that will be implemented in separate
rulemaking initiatives. Section 406(b) of TSCA requires that EPA promulgate regulations requiring each person
who performs for compensation a renovation of target housing to provide a lead hazard information pamphlet to the
owner(s) and occupant(s) of such housing prior to commencing the renovation. In addition, this pamphlet may be used
by other Federal Programs to support their educational and outreach goals and obligations. EPA issued proposed regulations
under section 406(b) on March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11108), for a 60-day public comment period that closed on May 9, 1994.
EPA is currently reviewing public comments and preparing the final rulemaking. 
Section 1012 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act (also known as ``Title X'') requires that the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provide the pamphlet to purchasers and tenants of housing receiving
Federal assistance. These regulations are under development by HUD. Section 1018 of Title X requires that EPA and
HUD promulgate regulations requiring sellers or lessors of target housing to provide purchasers and lessees with
the lead hazard information pamphlet. EPA and HUD expect to issue the proposed regulations for this rulemaking in
late summer or early fall of 1994. Commenters should be aware, however, that comments received on the pamphlet during
the comment period for the proposed section 1018 regulation will not be used in developing the final draft of the pamphlet,
due by October 28, 1994. Where appropriate, EPA may consider those comments when developing subsequent revisions
to the pamphlet, as authorized by section 406 of TSCA.

(2) Marsh Management Subcommittee Meeting_September 7-8, 1994 



Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92-463, notice is hereby given that the Marsh Management
Subcommittee of the Ecological Processes and Effects Committee (EPEC) will meet on September 7-8, 1994, at
the Gangplank Restaurant, 600 Water Street, Washington, DC 20024, telephone (202) 554-5000. On September
7, the meeting will begin at 8:30 a.m. and end no later than 5 p.m. On September 8, the meeting will begin at 8 a.m. and end
no later than 4 p.m. Both days of the meeting will be open to the public. Due to limited space, seating will be on a first-come
basis. 

On July 21, the Marsh Management Subcommittee met to begin a review of the science underlying marsh management, defined
as the use of water control structures, berms, dikes etc. to modify the hydrology of marsh systems. At the request of
the Agency's Office of Water, the Subcommittee has been established to evaluate the ecological implications of marsh
management practices in various types of marsh ecosystems. EPA has formed a Marsh Management Steering Committee,
consisting of federal agencies with responsibilities for marsh management, to refine a set of technical questions
to be addressed by the Subcommittee. On July 21, the Subcommittee heard presentations from various federal and state
agencies regarding relevant federal and state policies and technical issues of concern and received public comments
on marsh management issues. 

At the September 7-8 meeting, the Subcommittee will begin developing written recommendations in response
to the six questions posed in the Charge to the Subcommittee: (1) Does structural marsh management protect or create
emergent vegetated wetlands? (2) To what extent does structural marsh management impact the physical, biological
and/or chemical aspects of natural marsh-sustaining processes? (3) What are the impacts of marsh management, if
any, to estuarine fisheries, waterfowl, and other fish and wildlife? (4) What are the cumulative effects of numerous
large-scale marsh management projects with respect to emergent vegetation, accretion, fish and wildlife, and other
resources? (5) What are the gaps and the highest priorities for research studies related to the effects of structural
marsh management projects, and for routine monitoring of such projects? (6) What scientific or technical criteria
should EPA use as part of the basis for case-specific decision-making; or, as an alternative, what approach should
EPA take to develop such criteria? 



Additional Information



Single copies of the briefing materials provided to the Marsh Management Subcommittee may be obtained by calling
the EPA Wetlands Hot Line at 1-800-832-7828. Copies of these documents are NOT available from the
Science Advisory Board. Members of the public desiring additional information about the meeting, including an agenda,
should contact Ms. Dorothy Clark, Staff Secretary, Science Advisory Board (1400F), US EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington
DC 20460, by telephone at (202) 260-6552, fax at (202) 260-7118, or via the INTERNET at: Clark.Dorothy@EPAMAIL.EPA.GOV.


Anyone wishing to submit written comments must forward at least 35 copies to Ms. Stephanie Sanzone, Designated Federal
Officer, no later than August 24 for distribution to the Subcommittee and the interested public.

<DOCTITLE>Oklahoma; Amended Final Determination of Adequacy of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Final Determination on Application of Oklahoma for Full Program Adequacy Determination.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) that may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR Part 258). On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria
for MSWLFs (40 CFR Part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA),
requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that facilities comply with the Federal Criteria under
40 CFR Part 258. Subtitle D also requires in Section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste
landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. 



On August 10, 1993, Oklahoma applied for a determination of adequacy under Section 4005 of RCRA. After review, publication
and consideration of all public comments, EPA temporarily approved Oklahoma's Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Permitting
program on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68643, 68644) good through June 30, 1994 allowing Oklahoma time to promulgate permanent
rules. On June 20, 1994, the State of Oklahoma submitted permanent rules which were approved by the Governor on May
3, 1994 and became effective July 1, 1994. Today, EPA is issuing an amended final determination that the State's rules
are permanent and Oklahoma's Municipal Solid Waste program is adequate to meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 258.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 



On August 10, 1993, Oklahoma submitted an application for adequacy determination for Oklahoma's municipal solid
waste landfill permit program. This application included temporary solid waste rules which expired on June 30, 1994.
On September 16, 1993, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Oklahoma's program
at 58 FR 48516, 48518. On December 28, 1993, after review and consideration of all public comments, EPA published a
final determination for full program adequacy at 58 FR 68643, 68644 which expired June 30, 1994. On March 23, 1994,
the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality board adopted revised solid waste regulations. These new regulations
were signed on May 3, 1994 by the Governor of Oklahoma. Since the Legislature of the State of Oklahoma did not act to change
these regulations on or before May 17, 1994, the permanent regulations are effective automatically on July 1, 1994.




B. Decision 



EPA has reviewed the minor changes made to the Oklahoma Solid Waste Regulations by the Department of Environmental
Quality Board on March 23, 1994. EPA has found no substantial changes from the rules approved on December 28, 1994 that
affect Oklahoma's ability to adequately conduct the permitting and enforcement of Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA) on Municipal Solid Waste Landfills in the State of Oklahoma, therefore, EPA concludes that
Oklahoma's application for adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established
by RCRA. Accordingly, Oklahoma is granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste
permit program. 

Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR Part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991).
Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under Section 553(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's/Tribe's program are already in effect as a matter of State/Tribal
law. EPA's action today does not impose any new compliance requirements on the regulated community. Nor do these requirements
become enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to give notice prior to making
its approval effective. 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order
12866. 



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice,
therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 



Authority: 



This notice is issued under the authority of Section 2002, 4005, 4006, and 4010(c) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act,
as amended.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed Consent Agreement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, a New
Jersey manufacturer of the diet product, Fibre Trim, from making any representation about the weight loss benefits,
nutrient content, or nutrient related health benefits of any food, food supplement, or drug without competent and
reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the claim.

Rules of Practice (16 CFR 3.25(f)), notice is hereby given that the following consent agreement containing a consent
order to cease and desist, having been filed with and accepted, subject to final approval, by the Commission, has been
placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days. Public comment is invited. Such comments or views will be
considered by the Commission and will be available for inspection and copying at its principal office in accordance
with Section 4.9(b)(6)(ii) of the Commission's Rules of Practice (16 CFR 4.9(b)(6)(ii)). 



Agreement Containing Consent Order to Cease and Desist



In the Matter of Schering Corporation, a corporation. Docket No. 9232.

sometimes referred to as respondent, and its attorney, and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission, is entered into
in accordance with the Commission's Rule governing consent order procedures. In accordance therewith the parties
hereby agree that: 

1. Respondent Schering Corporation is a corporation organized, existing and doing business under and by virtue of
the laws of the State of New Jersey, with its office and principal place of business at 2000 Galloping Hill Road, Kenilworth,
New Jersey, 07033. 

2. Respondent has been served with a copy of the complaint issued by the Federal Trade Commission charging it with violations
of Sections 5(a) and 12 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and has filed answers to said complaint denying said charges.

3. Respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the Commission's complaint in this proceeding.

4. Respondent waives:

(a) Any further procedural steps;

(b) The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;


(c) All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and

(d) Any claims under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

5. This agreement shall not become a part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission, it will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty
(60) days and information in respect thereto publicly released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its
acceptance of this agreement and so notify the respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider
appropriate, or issue and serve its decision, in disposition of the proceeding.

6. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by respondent that the law has
been violated as alleged in the compliant issued by the Commission, or that the facts as alleged in said compliant,
other than jurisdictional facts, are true.

7. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.25(f) of the Commission's Rules, the Commission
may without further notice to respondent, (1) issue its decision containing the following order to cease and desist
in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public in respect thereto. When so entered, the order to
cease and desist shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified or set aside in the same manner and
within the same time provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the
U.s. Postal Service of the decision containing the agreed-to order to respondent's address as stated in this agreement
shall constitute service. Respondent waives any right it might have to any other manner of service. The complaint
may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation
not contained in the order or in the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.

8. Respondent has read the compliant and the order contemplated hereby. It understands that once the order has been
issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully complied with the order.
Respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided by law for each violation
of the order after it becomes final.

persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action or make final the agreement's proposed order.
This matter concerns advertising and promotional practices related to the sale of Fibre Trim, a fiber containing
tablet, that were disseminated between 1985 and 1991. These advertisements and promotional materials were disseminated
in magazines, newspapers, television, radio, direct mail correspondence and in-store displays.
The Commission's complaint, issued on September 22, 1989, alleged that Schering's advertisements and promotional
materials represented that: (1) Fibre Trim is an effective appetite suppressant, weight loss, weight control or
weight maintenance product; (2) Fibre Trim provides the health benefits associated with a fiber-rich diet or a high
intake of dietary fiber from food; (3) Fibre Trim is a high fiber supplement; (4) the recommended daily dosage of Fibre
Trim provides most of a person's daily requirements of dietary fiber; and (5) the recommended dosage of Fibre Trim
provides about 2.35 grams of dietary fiber per serving or about seven grams of dietary fiber per day. The complaint
alleged that Schering did not have a reasonable basis for these representations, and that the latter three representations
were false.
The complaint allegations were tried before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) between January 22 and March 29, 1991.
In an opinion dated September 16, 1991, the ALJ upheld the first, second and fifth allegations described above. With
respect to the third allegation, the ALJ ruled that Schering's claim that Fibre Trim is a high fiber supplement was
false as to the product's weight maintenance dosage, but true as to its weight loss dosage. The ALJ rejected the fourth
allegation described above. The ALJ's decision was appealed to the Commission. Subsequently, the parties agreed
to the proposed consent order and the appeal was withdrawn from adjudication.
The proposed consent order contains provisions which are designed to remedy the advertising violations charged
and to prevent Schering from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order prohibits
Schering from misrepresenting the amount of fiber or any other nutrient or dietary constituent in Fibre Trim or any
other food, food supplement or drug product. Part I also prohibits the misrepresentation of such products as being
high, rich, excellent or superior sources of fiber or any other nutrient or dietary constituent. Part I also contains
a safe harbor stating that it does not prohibit any representation as to the amount of fiber or any other nutrient or
dietary constituent in any product if that representation is specifically permitted in labeling, for the serving
size being advertised, by regulations promulgated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pursuant
to the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA). The Commission's recently adopted Enforcement Policy
Statement on Food Advertising (May 1994) (Food Policy Statement) provides additional guidance on what may constitute
a misrepresentation of nutrient content.
Part II of the proposed consent order requires Schering to rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence if
it makes claims for any food, food supplement or drug product regarding the product's (1) Fiber content or type or the
amount or content of any other nutrient or dietary constituent; (2) provision of any health benefit associated with
the intake of fiber or any other nutrient or dietary constituent; or (3) provision of any appetite suppressant, weight
loss, weight control or weight maintenance benefit. Part II requires that Schering possess and rely on tests, analyses,
research, studies, or other evidence conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so,
using procedures generally accepted by others in the profession or science to yield accurate and reliable results
in making the first two categories of claims. For the third (weight loss-related) category of claims, Schering is
required to rely upon at least two adequate and well-controlled, double-blinded clinical studies that conform to
acceptable designs and protocols and are conducted independently by different persons qualified by training and
experience to conduct such studies.
Part II also contains two safe harbor provisions. First, the proposed order does not prohibit any claims for drugs
that are permitted in labeling under an FDA tentative final or final standard, or under an approved new drug application.
Second, the proposed order does not prohibit any nutrient content or health benefit claims covered by Part II that
are specifically permitted in labeling by FDA regulations under the NLEA.
Part III requires Schering, when making a fiber content claim for any food, food supplement or drug product, to disclose,
clearly, prominently and in close proximity to that claim, the number of grams of dietary fiber contained per serving
of the product. If the description of the fiber content of such a product is a term defined by FDA regulations issued
pursuant to the NLEA (

e.g., 

``high fiber''), then compliance with those regulations constitutes compliance with Part III and no additional
disclosure of the amount of dietary fiber is required under Part III.
The litigation and the negotiation of the settlement of this case occurred prior to the Commission's issuance of its
Food Policy Statement. Depending on the nature of the fiber content claim, the disclosure requirement in Part III
may not be identical to the provisions of the Commission's Food Policy Statement. For example, Part III covers comparative
fiber claims (

e.g., 

``25% more fiber'') for which the Food Policy Statement likely would require additional disclosures, such as the
basis for comparison. Part III of the proposed consent order does not explicitly require those additional disclosures.
However, the prohibition on misrepresentations of fiber content in Part I of the proposed order and Part II's requirement
that such claims be substantiated would require such disclosures as are necessary to prevent a claim from being misleading.
Thus, unless such claims adequately adhere to the guidance of the Food Policy Statement, they likely would violate
Parts I and II of the proposed order.
Parts IV, V, VI and VII of the proposed order relate to Schering's obligation to maintain records, distribute the order
to its operating divisions responsible for advertising activities, notify the Commission of changes in business
or corporate structure and file compliance reports with the Commission.
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way its terms.

Trauma Associates of North Broward, Inc., et al. Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
Trauma Associates of North Broward, Inc. (``Trauma Associates''), and ten surgeons in Broward County, Florida (``surgeon
respondents''). The agreement would settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that Trauma Associates and the
surgeon respondents violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by, among other things, combining or conspiring
to (1) Fix or increase the fees received by the surgeon respondents for the provision of trauma services and (2) threaten
and carry out a concerted refusal to deal.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the agreement. The analysis is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of either the proposed complaint or the proposed consent order to modify their terms in
any way.



The Complaint



Under the terms of the agreement, a proposed complaint would be issued by the Commission along with the proposed consent
order. The proposed complaint alleges that the North Broward Hospital District (``the District''), a hospital authority
in Broward County, Florida, resolved in March, 1992, to seek a state license to operate trauma centers at two District
hospitals. According to the complaint, the surgeon respondents, who compete among themselves and with other general
surgeons in Broward County, signed individual statements committing themselves to participate in the District's
trauma program.

The complaint further alleges that the surgeon respondents, who have not integrated their practices, refused to
contract with the District individually, and agreed on price proposals prior to submitting them to the District.
On May 1, 1992, the surgeon respondents began providing trauma services to the District, and several days later Dr.
Richard A. Johnson, the surgeon respondents' leader, signed a letter of intent with the District outlining the terms
under which the surgeon respondents would provide services at the District's trauma centers. Dr. Johnson also reached
an understanding with the District on the prices to be paid for the surgeon respondents' services.

The complaint alleges that Dr. Johnson incorporated Trauma Associates on May 7, 1992, and is its sole owner. Trauma
Associates served as the vehicle for the surgeon respondents to engage in collective negotiations on fees and other
contract terms to be sought from the District.

The complaint alleges that in July 1992, the District decided not to contract with the surgeon respondents as a group,
and that in response the surgeon respondents: (1) refused to deal with the District individually; (2) sent the District
a letter with a list of demands, including price terms; (3) threatened to cease providing services at the District's
trauma centers if their demands were not met; and (4) walked out of the District's trauma centers. As a direct result
of the walkout, one of the two trauma centers had to be shut down, and the other was adversely affected.

The complaint alleges that the above actions of the proposed respondents have had the purpose or effect in Broward
County, Florida, of:

(1) Restraining competition among general surgeons;

(2) Fixing or increasing the prices that are paid to general surgeons who provide trauma services;

(3) Raising the cost, lowering the quality, and reducing access to and the quality-adjusted output of the District's
trauma services; and

(4) Depriving the District and its patients of the benefits of competition among general surgeons.

Finally, the complaint alleges that the above actions of the proposed respondents constitute unfair methods of competition
in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45.



The Proposed Consent Order



The proposed consent order would prohibit the surgeon respondents from entering into, organizing, or implementing,
any agreement to:

(1) Refuse to provide surgical services in connection with any effort to fix the level of fees for such services;

(2) Prevent the offering or delivery of surgical services;

(3) Deal on collectively determined terms with anyone who pays for health services; and

(4) Encourage any person to engage in any action prohibited by the order.

The order provides that it does not prevent the following:

(1) Surgeon respondents who practice together as partners or employees in the same professional corporation or partnership
dealing with any third party on collectively determined terms; or

(2) Surgeon respondents who participate in the same integrated joint venture dealing with others on collectively
determined terms through the joint venture, so long as they remain free to deal individually with others that decline
to deal with the joint venture. (The consent order defines ``integrated joint venture'' as a joint arrangement to
provide health care services in which surgeons participating in the venture who would otherwise be competitors pool
their capital to finance the venture, by themselves or together with others, and share a substantial risk of loss from
their participation in the venture.)

The proposed order would require respondent surgeon Richard A. Johnson, M.D., to dissolve Trauma Associates within
180 days after the order becomes final. Furthermore, before such dissolution takes place, the order would require
Trauma Associates to distribute copies of the complaint and order to each person with whom it has entered into contract
negotiations concerning the provision of trauma surgical services.

The order also requires the proposed surgeon respondents to file compliance reports with the Commission, notify
the Commission if they form or participate in the formation of an integrated joint venture, and maintain certain files
relating to their compliance with the order.

The proposed respondents agreed to the order for settlement purposes only, and their agreement to the order does not
constitute an admission by them that the law has been violated as alleged in the complaint.

<USBUREAU>Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry</USBUREAU>





Health Activities Recommendation Panel 
Site-Specific Health Activities; Availability of Funds for Fiscal Year 1995 


Introduction 


The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announces the anticipated availability of fiscal year
(FY) 1995 funds for a cooperative agreement/grant program for Health Activities Recommendation Panel Site-Specific
Health Activities. This program will conduct site-specific health activities related to human exposure to hazardous
substances at waste sites or releases. The activities will be conducted in communities near hazardous waste sites
for which ATSDR (or a State under cooperative agreement) has prepared a preliminary public health assessment, public
health assessment, public health advisory, health consultation, or other site-related report and the Health Activities
Recommendation Panel (HARP) has determined that specific public health actions are warranted. Emphasis will be
given to the sites rated as ``Urgent Public Health Hazard'' and ``Public Health Hazard.'' 





Note: 

This announcement is a continuation of a previously announced initiative, Program Announcement No. 407_Health
Activities Recommendation Panel Site-Specific Health Activities, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 9, 1993 [58 FR 42327]. 




The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy
People 2000,'' see the Section ``Where to Obtain Additional Information.'') 



Authority 



This program is authorized under Sections 104(i)(1)(E),(7),(9), and (15) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
(SARA) of 1986 [42 U.S.C. 9604 (i)(1)(E) (7), (9), and (15)]. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people.

Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants are the official public health agencies of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities.
This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the
Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of Marshall Islands, the Republic
of Palau, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments. State organizations, including State universities,
must establish that they meet their respective State's legislature definition of a State entity or political subdivision
to be considered an eligible applicant. 



Availability of Funds 



Approximately $2,000,000 is expected to be available in FY 1995 to fund an estimated 10 competing new awards and 10
noncompeting continuation awards. It is expected that the awards will range from $75,000 to $125,000. Awards are
funded for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 2 years. 
Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds. 



Purpose 



The purpose of the program is to assist public health agencies in conducting site-specific health activities recommended
by HARP to assess the public health impact of human exposure to hazardous substances in communities located near hazardous
waste sites or releases. A current list of sites in the applicant's State rated as Urgent Public Health Hazard, Public
Health Hazard, and Indeterminate Public Health Hazard may be obtained from Wendell Webb, Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry, Public Health Practice Coordination Group, telephone (404) 639-0566. 



Program Requirements 



Applicants 

must

 specify the type of award for which they are applying, either grant or cooperative agreement. These two types of Federal
assistance are explained below. 



A. Grants 



In a grant, the applicant will be required to conduct the proposed study without substantial programmatic involvement
from the funding agency. Therefore, the grantee's application should be presented in a manner that demonstrates
the applicant's ability to conduct the study. Applications should include a protocol which will undergo scientific
peer review as required by ATSDR. The applicant's protocol should contain consent forms and questionnaires, baseline
morbidity and mortality information, procedures for collecting biologic and environmental specimens and for conducting
laboratory analysis of the test specimens, statistical and epidemiologic analysis of the study information, and
a description of the safeguards for protecting the confidentiality of individuals on whom data are collected. The
applicant must include in the application a methodology for ongoing community interaction/involvement. By comparison,
the activities of the recipient and the ATSDR relating to a cooperative agreement are different and are described
in paragraph B. 



B. Cooperative Agreements 



In a cooperative agreement, the funding agency will assist the collaborator in conducting the study. The application
should be presented in a manner that demonstrates the applicant's ability to address the health study in a collaborative
manner with the funding agency. 
The cooperative activities of the recipient agency and the funding agency are: 


1. Recipient Activities 



a. The recipient will develop a protocol and conduct the recommended study. This protocol will undergo scientific
peer review as required by ATSDR. 

b. The recipient is required to provide proof by citing a State code or regulation or other State pronouncement under
authority of law, that medical information obtained pursuant to the agreement will be protected from disclosure
when the consent of the individual to release identifying 
information is not obtained. 

c. The recipient will develop a mechanism for ongoing interaction with the affected community. 



2. ATSDR Activities 



a. ATSDR will provide assistance in both the planning and implementation phases of the field work called for under
the study protocol. 

b. ATSDR will provide consultation and assist in 
monitoring the data and specimen collection. 

c. ATSDR will participate in the study analysis. 

d. ATSDR will collaborate in interpreting the study findings. 
e. ATSDR will conduct technical and peer review. 



Evaluation Criteria 



Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria:

Executive Order 12372 Review 



Applications are subject to the Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs as governed by Executive Order (E.O.)
12372. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of proposed Federal assistance applications.
Applicants (other than federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State Single Point
of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions
on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC
for each affected State. A current list of SPOCs is included in the application kit. If SPOCs have any State process
recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they should send them to Henry S. Cassell, III, Grants Management
Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
255 East Paces Ferry Road, Room 300, Mailstop E13, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30305, no later than 60 days after the application
deadline date. The Program Announcement Number and Program Title should be referenced on the document. The granting
agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' State process recommendations it receives after that date.


Indian tribes are strongly encouraged to request tribal government review of the proposed application. If tribal
governments have any tribal process recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they should forward them
to Henry S. Cassell, III, Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, Room 300, Mailstop E13, NE., Atlanta, Georgia
30305, no later than 60 days after the application deadline date. The Program Announcement Number and Program Title
should be referenced on the document. The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' State
process recommendations it receives after that date. 



Public Health System Reporting Requirements 



This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements. 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number 



The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number is 93.203, Health Programs for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.




Other Requirements 



A. Human Subjects: 



If the proposed project involves research on human subjects, the applicant must comply with the Department of Health
and Human Services Regulations, 45 CFR Part 46, regarding the protection of human subjects. Assurance must be provided
to demonstrate that the project will be subject to initial and continuing review by an appropriate institutional
review committee. In addition to other applicable committees, Indian Health Service (IHS) institutional review
committees also must review the project if any component of IHS will be involved or will support the research. If any
Native American community is involved, its tribal government must also approve that portion of the project applicable
to it. The applicant will be responsible for providing assurance in accordance with the appropriate guidelines and
form provided in the application kit. 



B. Cost Recovery: 



CERCLA as amended by the SARA provides for the recovery of costs incurred for health assessments and health effects
studies at each Superfund site from potentially responsible parties. The recipient will agree to maintain an accounting
system that will keep an accurate, complete, and current accounting of all financial transactions on a site-specific
basis, i.e., individual time, travel, and associated cost including indirect cost, as appropriate for the site.
The recipient will retain the documents and records to support these financial transactions, for possible use in
a cost recovery case, for a minimum of ten years after submission of a final Financial Status Report, unless there is
a litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the specific site, then the records will be maintained
until resolution of all issues on the specific site. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act: 



Projects that involve the collection of information from 10 or more individuals and funded by the cooperative agreement
will be subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

D. Third Party Agreements: 



Project activities which are approved for contracting pursuant to the prior approval provisions shall be formalized
in a written agreement that clearly establishes the relationship between the grantee and the third party. The written
agreement shall at a minimum: 

1. State or incorporate by reference all applicable requirements imposed on the contractors under the grant by the
terms of the grant, including requirements concerning peer review and technical review as required by ATSDR, release
of data, ownership of data and the arrangement for copyright when publications, data or other copyrightable works
are developed under or in the course of work under a PHS grant supported project or activity. 

2. State that any copyrighted or copyrightable works shall be subject to a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable
license to the government to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use them, and to authorize others to do so for Federal
government purposes. 

3. State that whenever any work subject to this copyright policy may be developed in the course of a grant by a contractor
under a grant, the written agreement (contract) must require the contractor to comply with these requirements and
can in no way diminish the government's right in that work. 

4. State the activities to be performed, the time schedule for those activities, the policies and procedures to be
followed in carrying out the agreement, and the maximum amount of money for which the grantee may become liable to the
third party under the agreement. 

5. State that the contractor must comply with all peer review and technical review requirements. The written agreement
required shall not relieve the grantee of any part of its responsibility or accountability to PHS under the grant.
The agreement shall, therefore, retain sufficient rights and control to the grantee to enable it to fulfill this responsibility.

The original and two copies of the application Form PHS 5161-1 must be submitted to Henry S. Cassell, III, Grants
Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

four separable portions: (1) An open public hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation
of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation. Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing
portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved.
The dates and times reserved for the separate portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI-35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A-16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

<DOCTITLE>Meeting; Forum on Cooperative Research and Development Agreements </DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that a second Forum on Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), convened
as an 

ad hoc

 group of consumer consultants to the Advisory Committee to the Director, NIH, will meet in public session on September
8, 1994, from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm, at the Bethesda Marriott, 5151 Pooks Hill Road, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814. This Forum
is convened in follow-up to a previous Forum on this topic July 21, 1994. 

The purpose of the second Forum is to elicit consumer and other public interest perspectives which will be used in NIH's
development of policy on the ``reasonable pricing'' clause, which is currently required in its Cooperative Research
and Development Agreements (CRADAs) under the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and exclusive commercialization
licenses. The Forum Panel members will discuss how best to ensure that the public investment in products developed
through licensing NIH technologies is adequately reflected. Discussion will include an analysis of the clause and
the Panel will advise on whether the clause has been useful to ensure that the public investment in collaborative research
is adequately considered in the subsequent commercial development of technology arising under such research. 

At the conclusion of the Forum, the Panel will develop and transmit its report to the Advisory Committee to the Director,
NIH, for review. 

Concerned organizations and individuals are invited to present their views at the Forum or submit written views of
any length to the Panel. Please submit requests for a 5 minute presentation time, or written views to: Ms. Elyssa Tran,
Office of Science Policy and Technology Transfer, National Institutes of Health, Building 1, Room 218, 9000 Rockville
Pike, Rockville, MD 20892, (301) 402-0280 (fax). 

Written views submitted by September 1 will be distributed to the Panel. Comments and questions related to the proposed
Forum may also be addressed to Ms. Tran at (301) 496-1454.

<DOCTITLE>National Cancer Institute; Opportunity for a Cooperative Research Agreement (CRADA) for the Scientific and Commercial
Development of Monoclonal Antibodies to a Tumor-Specific Growth Factor for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Premalignant
Lesions and Cancer</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Institutes of Health, PHS, DHHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Cancer Institute (NCI) seeks a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company that can effectively pursue
the scientific and commercial generation and development of a panel of monoclonal antibodies against an epidermal
growth factor (EGF)-related peptide, cripto-1 (CR-1). The project is of scientific importance because CR-1
is a protein that exhibits structural homology to the EGF/transforming growth factor 




 (TGF




) gene family peptides. As such, CR-1 might function as a growth factor or growth inhibitor. Therefore, CR-1
may be important as an autocrine or paracrine modulator in such processes as tumor cell growth, wound repair, neovascularization,
and inflammation.



NCI has successfully isolated and cloned the gene that encodes CR-1, an EGF-related peptide growth factor that
does not function through the EGF receptor. The NCI has also obtained a rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal antibody that
can detect the expression of CR-1 in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue sections. CR-1
has been shown to be preferentially and differentially expressed in several different human premalignant lesions
and cancers. The selected sponsor will purify a recombinant CR-1 protein and use this material as an immunogen
to generate anti-CR-1 monoclonal antibodies for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NCI is seeking a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company which, after obtaining a license in accordance with
the requirements of the regulations governing the transfer of Government-developed agents (37 CFR part 404), can
purify a recombinant CR-1 protein for which patents are pending or have been issued and to utilize this purified
recombinant CR-1 protein as an immunogen to generate a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies. The immunoreactive
CR-1 protein has been detected by immunoperoxidase staining using a rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal CR-1
antibody in a majority of human colon cancers, breast cancers, gastric cancers and pancreatic cancers. Little or
no staining was detected in surrounding, noninvolved colon, breast or gastric epithelial cells. In addition, a majority
of premalignant colonic adenomas, breast ductal carcinomas 

in situ

 and gastric intestinal metaplasia express immunoreactive CR-1.



A recombinant CR-1 protein has been generated using a yeast expression vector in 

Pichia pastoris

 and a partially purified protein obtained. This protein as well as synthetic, refolded peptides that correspond
to the EGF-like domain in CR-1 are mitogenic for human breast cancer cells yet fail to bind to the EGF receptor
or other type I receptor tyrosine kinases. Expression of CR-1 antisense mRNA using a recombinant, replication
defective retroviral expression vector in colon cancer cells that expresses CR-1 inhibits the growth of these
cells 

in vivo

 in nude mice. In order to utilize the diagnostic and therapeutic potentials of CR-1, it will be necessary to purify
a significant amount of the recombinant CR-1 protein to more fully define its biological properties and to identify
the receptor through which it functions. In addition, mouse monoclonal antibodies against the purified CR-1
recombinant protein will expedite screening studies for CR-1 expression in other human premalignant lesions
and cancers and should exhibit more specificity and sensitivity for the detection of CR-1 in tissues by immunocytochemistry
(ICC) or in tissue extracts or serum samples by ELISA.

The role of the National Cancer Institute, the Division of Cancer Biology, Diagnosis and Centers includes:

1. NCI will provide expression vectors that encode CR-1 and can be used to produce CR-1 in 

E. coli.

2. NCI will provide expression vectors that encode CR-1 in yeast Pichia pastoris 

containing several milligrams of recombinant CR-1 protein.

3. NCI will provide a rabbit polyclonal anti-CR-1 antibody for monitoring CR-1 recovery during the purification
from the yeast conditioned medium.

4. NCI will assay the purified recombinant CR-1 protein for bioactivity.

5. NCI will screen anti-CR-1 monoclonal antibodies for reactivity by Western blot analysis against native
CR-1 protein from CR-1 positive human embryonal carcinoma or colon carcinoma cells.

The role of the successful corporate partner will include:

1. Obtain background license in appropriate fields of use to the relevant Government patent rights.

2. Purify to homogeneity 30-50 milligrams of CR-1 from 

Pichia pastoris 

conditioned medium.

3. Provide the purified recombinant CR-1 protein.

4. Utilize the purified recombinant CR-1 protein to generate mouse anti-CR-1 monoclonal antibodies.

5. Screen anti-CR-1 monoclonal antibodies for specificity, reactivity, and sensitivity towards recombinant
CR-1 protein.

6. Ascertain whether monoclonal anti-CR-1 antibodies can detect native CR-1 protein in CR-1 positive
human colorectal or embryonal carcinoma cells by radioimmunoprecipitation analysis and by ELISA.

7. Determine whether anti-CR-1 antibodies can be used for ICC on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues
known for CR-1 expression.

8. Provide funds to support a postdoctoral fellow and associated expenses.

Criteria for choosing the collaborating company will include:

1. Ability to obtain background license to relevant patent rights.

2. Experience in producing and purifying recombinant proteins, particularly growth factors or cytokines.

3. Experience in generating and screening monoclonal antibodies.

4. Willingness to cooperate with the NCI in the collection and evaluation of data.

5. Willingness to cost share in laboratory studies.

6. An agreement to be bound by the DHHS rules involving the use of human and animal subjects, and human tissue.

7. Provisions for equitable distribution of patent rights to any inventions. Generally the rights of ownership are
retained by the organization which is the employer of the free license to the Government (when a company employee is
the sole inventor) or (2) an exclusive or nonexclusive license to the company on terms that are appropriate (when the
Government employee is the sole inventor).

SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive world-wide licenses to
practice the inventions embodied in U.S. Patent 5,171,750, entitled ``Substituted Phenserines as Specific Inhibitors
of Acetylcholinesterase'' and U.S. Patent Applications SN 07/861,329 and 08/096,207, both entitled ``Phenylcarbamates
of (-)-Eseroline, (-)-N1-Noreseroline and (-)-N1-Benzylnoreseroline: Selective Inhibitors of Acetyl and/or
Butyrylcholinesterase,'' 07/765,766, entitled ``Thiapysovenine and Carbamate Analogs, Pharmaceutical Compositions
and Method for Inhibiting Cholinesterases,'' 07/845,081 and 08/182,301, both entitled ``Carbamate Analogs of
Thiaphysovenine, Pharmaceutical Compositions, and Method for Inhibiting Cholinesterases,'' and 07/980,399,
entitled ``Method for Treating Cognitive Disorders With Phenserine'' to CURE, Inc. of Baltimore, Maryland. The
patent rights in these inventions have been assigned to the United States of America.



The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive licenses may be granted unless within 60 days from the date of this published
notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent
with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.

The patent and patent applications disclose several novel, potent and long-acting anti-cholinesterase agents
that enhance cognition and are highly promising drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other
neurological disorders as well as methods for treating these conditions. The two series of drugs are based loosely
on the first-generation cholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine. Physostigmine has produced demonstrable but
small clinical improvements in patient's with Alzheimer's disease, but these are severely limited by (i) its short
half-life (approximately 30 minutes) and (ii) its high incidence of toxic side-effects at doses that produce only
modest enzyme inhibition. It is widely accepted that the narrow therapeutic index of physostigmine and some other
first generation acetylcholinesterase inhibitors limits the administration of these at adequate doses to affect
cognition. The present drug candidates are long-acting and highly selective for acetyl- (AChE) as opposed to butyrylcholinesterase
(BChE). Whereas AChE is involved in the metabolism of ACh, and inhibiting AChE augments the action of ACh and thereby
cholinergic function and memory in Alzheimer's disease, BChE has been proposed to be involved in lipid and phospholipid
metabolism, in permeability control and transport of ions across membranes, and in slow nerve conduction. Co-inhibition
of BChE in Alzheimer's patients, as a consequence of anticholinesterase therapy, probably is not of clinical value,
and may be deleterious.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Institutes of Health is seeking licensees and/or CRADA partners for the further development and commercialization
of its patent portfolio for antiflammins. The inventions claimed in the following patent applications are available
for either exclusive or non-exclusive licensing (in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 and 37 CFR Part 404) and/or further
development under one or more CRADAs in several clinically important applications as described below in the Supplementary
Information:

issued 30 Nov 1993


Method of Treating Ocular Inflammatory Diseases Using Antiflammins, Chan, C. C. (NEI), Filed 7 Jun 1993, Serial No.
08/073,380





To speed the research, development and commercialization of this new class of drugs, the National Institutes of Health
is seeking one or more license agreements and/or CRADAs with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies in accordance
with the regulations governing the transfer of Government-developed agents. Any proposal to use antiflammins in
the treatment of inflammatory disease processes will be considered. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Antiflammins are biologically active synthetic oligopeptides, derived from the sequence similarity between lipo-cortin-1
and uteroglobin, an anti-inflammatory protein. These peptides have antiphospholipase A

2

 and immunomodulatory properties. Because of the great therapeutic potential of specific and potent antiflammin
drugs that may be developed, scientists in several Institutes at the National Institutes of Health are examining
the use of antiflammins in the treatment of a variety of inflammatory processes, including acute anterior ocular
inflammation (uveitis), psoriasis, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(BPD). 



Dr. Chi-Cho Chan and Dr. Scott Whitcup, clinical investigators at the National Eye Institute (NEI), have an IND for
the use of antiflammin 2 in acute anterior uveitis, and seven patients have already been enrolled in a clinical trial.
To date, no toxicity has been observed in patients treated with this drug. The NEI is interested in developing new topical
formulations of antiflammins and the initiation of multi-center randomized clinical trials of antiflammins for
the treatment of anterior uveitis, post-operative ocular inflammation, and allergic conjunctivitis. 

Dr. John diGiovanna, an investigator in the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
(NIAMS), is studying the use of antiflammins to treat psoriasis, a hyperproliferative inflammatory skin disease.
Dr. diGiovanna would like to continue and expand these studies to include other inflammatory skin diseases such as
atopic and contact dermatitis, as well as develop animal and 

in vitro

 models to study the effects of antiflammins on skin.

Dr. Anil Mukherjee, an investigator in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), is interested
in determining whether endotracheal administration of aerosolized recombinant human uteroglobin (UG) or antiflammins
derived from the sequence of this protein in combination with surfactant prevents the development of the inflammatory
lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in (a) non-human primate models of neonatal respiratory distress
syndrome (RDS) and (b) human neonatal RDS in a multi-center study, provided the non-human primate study results show
no toxicity and considerable improvement as a result of combination therapy with surfactant plus human uteroglobin.



CRADA aims include the rapid publication of research results and the timely exploitation of commercial opportunities.
The CRADA partner(s) will enjoy rights of first negotiation for licensing Government rights to any inventions arising
under the agreement and will be expected to advance funds payable upon signing the CRADA to help defray Government
expenses for patenting such inventions and other CRADA-related costs. 


The role of the NEI, NIAMS, and NICHD in these CRADAs will be as follows: 


1. Provide the Collaborator(s) with samples of the subject compounds for pharmaceutical evaluation. 


2. Continue the detailed physicochemical characterization of the test compounds as well as research on their mechanism
of biological action, and publish these results and provide all data to the Collaborator as soon as they become available.



3. Conduct controlled clinical trials of antiflammin formulations that have been determined to have therapeutic
potential in ocular, skin and respiratory inflammatory diseases.


The role of the Collaborator(s) will be to: 


1. Perform an exhaustive evaluation of these compounds with respect to their biological activities and to develop
appropriate vehicles for drug delivery for disease processes covered under the CRADA. The Collaborator(s) will
supply data to the NEI, NIAMS, and/or NICHD in a timely fashion. 


2. Synthesize and formulate structural variants of these subject compounds to optimize desired effects. 


3. Expand the basic toxicological data as needed in preparation for additional clinical studies. 


4. Conduct basic studies designed to better understand the potential for antiflammins in the treatment of inflammatory
diseases, bioavailability and how to best administer these agents.

The patent applications disclose a novel strategy that uses antisense oligonucleotides to prevent the renarrowing
of heart valves or peripheral vessels (i.e., restenosis) following coronary balloon angioplasty. The antisense
oligonucleotides employed inhibit the proliferation of the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that cause restenosis by
targeting specific mRNAs that encode certain cell cycle regulatory proteins. The oligonucleotides are delivered
locally via the slow biodegradation of polymers that have been saturated with the antiproliferative compounds.

EDI is intended to complement and enhance the Section 108 Loan Guarantee program (see 24 CFR   570.700-710
for regulations governing the Section 108 program). This provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
program provides communities with a source of financing for economic development, housing rehabilitation, and
large scale physical development projects. HUD is authorized pursuant to Section 108 to guarantee notes issued by
CDBG entitlement communities and nonentitlement units of general local government eligible to receive funds under
the State CDBG program. Regulations governing the Section 108 program are found at 24 CFR part 570, subpart M. 



Additionally, assistance provided under this NOFA is subject to the requirements of section 3 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968, and the implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 135, as amended by an interim rule published
on June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33866). Section 3 requires that to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with Federal,
State, and local laws and regulations, job training, employment and other contracting opportunities generated
from certain HUD financial assistance be directed to low- and very-low income persons. The eligible activities for
which funding is provided under this NOFA are consistent with the objectives of section 3. Public entities awarded
funds under this NOFA and that intend to use the funds for housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other
public construction should consult the regulations published on June 30, 1994, to determine applicable requirements.




The Section 108 program is authorized at $2.054 billion in loan guarantee authority in Fiscal Year 1994. Under this
program communities and (States, if applicable) pledge future years' CDBG allocations as security for loans guaranteed
by HUD. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under Section
108. The Section 108 program, however, does not require CDBG funds to be escrowed for loan repayment, which means that
the community can continue to spend its existing allocation for other CDBG purposes, unless needed for loan repayment.
Further, EDI minimizes the potential loss of future CDBG allocations by lowering the cost of borrowing under Section
108, reducing the risk that the pledged annual CDBG allocation would be required to fund repayment shortfall, and
enhancing the ability of communities to leverage federal resources and private funds. 



An EDI grant can reduce the risk to future CDBG funds: 



(1) By strengthening the economic feasibility of the projects financed with Section 108 funds (and thereby increasing
the probability that the project will generate enough cash to repay the guaranteed loan), 



(2) By directly enhancing the security of the guaranteed loan, or 



(3) Through a combination of these risk mitigation techniques. 







HUD envisions that the following project structures could be typical. 





Provision of financing to for-profit businesses at a below market rate

_While the rates on loans guaranteed under Section 108 are only slightly above the rates on comparable U.S. Treasury
obligations, they may nonetheless be higher than can be afforded by many businesses. The EDI grant can be used to make
Section 108 financing affordable, as illustrated in the following example: 


A public entity wishes to make financing available for businesses located in a distressed neighborhood. The public
entity applies for Section 108/EDI assistance to carry out a $5.75 million economic development (ED) program. The
ED loans will be funded from a financing package that includes a $5,000,000 Section 108 loan and a $750,000 EDI grant.
If the rate on the Section 108 loan is 7.25 percent and the term is 15 years, the rate on the ED loans can be reduced to 5.1
percent (a level which is approximately 30% lower than the Section 108 rate). Thus, the EDI grant serves to ``buy down''
the interest rate on the ED loans, thus reducing the income the business needs to generate to provide program income
to the public entity to repay the Section 108 loan. (Note that the extent to which rates on ED loans can be reduced depends
on the maturity of the Section 108 loan and the amount of the EDI grant.) 





Direct enhancement of the security of the Section 108 loan

_The EDI grant can be used to cover the cost of providing enhanced security. An example of how the EDI grant can be used
for this purpose is by using the grant funds to cover the cost of a standby letter of credit, issued in favor of HUD. This
letter of credit will be available to fund amounts due on the Section 108 loan if other sources fail to materialize and
will, thus, serve to protect the public entity's future CDBG funds. 





Funding reserves

_The cash flow generated by an economic development project may be expected to be relatively thin in the early stages
of the project. The EDI grant can make it possible for debt service or operating reserves to be established in a way that
does not jeopardize the economic feasibility of the project. 



An example is a supermarket or neighborhood shopping area that is designed to provide basic services to and jobs in
a distressed neighborhood. The public entity must be prepared for a period after completion during which space in
that shopping center is not fully leased. It may therefore require the developer to establish with a trustee a reserve
account (or accounts) that would be available to cover operating expenses and/or debt service during the lease-up
period. While such reserves are commonplace, their cost may be so high as to make an already risky neighborhood shopping
center project economically infeasible. The increased cost resulting from establishing such reserves may be defrayed
by the EDI grant. As with the letter of credit example above, the reserves protect the CDBG program against the risk
that CDBG funds will have to be used to cover shortfalls in the intended source for repayment of the Section 108 loan.






Over-collateralizing the Section 108 loan

_The use of EDI grant funds may be structured in appropriate cases so as to improve the chances that cash flow will be
sufficient to cover debt service on the Section 108 loan and directly enhance the guaranteed loan. One technique for
accomplishing this approach is over-collateralization of the Section 108 loan. 



An example is the project which involves the joint use of a Section 108 loan and EDI grant to fund a loan pool project.
For instance, a community might borrow $5 million under Section 108 and obtain an EDI grant of $500,000. It can then
make $5.5 million in loans to various businesses at a rate equal to or greater than the rate on the Section 108 loan. The
total loan pool of $5.5 million would be pledged to the repayment of the $5 million Section 108 loan. Since the program
income from the $5.5 million will be greater than the debt service on the Section 108 loan, the community can accumulate
a loss reserve that will further mitigate the risk to future CDBG funds. This kind of loan pool project has the added
benefit of reducing the risk to future CDBG funds through diversification of the community's loan portfolio.

(D) Timing of Grant Awards





EDI applications will be evaluated concurrently with requests for Section 108 guarantee commitments or for the approval
of amendments to previously approved Section 108 applications that will be enhanced by the EDI assistance. (See II.B.
of this NOFA.) 




(E) Limitations on Grant Amounts





HUD expects to approve EDI grant amounts with respect to any application generally in the range of 7 to 15 percent of
the related Section 108 guaranteed loan. In certain instances HUD may award more than 15 percent of the related Section
108 loan. Applicants, however, cannot request grants exceeding 15 percent. In the case of requested amendments,
the EDI assistance will be determined on the increased amount of Section 108 loan guarantee assistance. HUD reserves
the right to determine a maximum amount of any EDI award per project and to modify requests, accordingly. 




(F) Eligibility to Apply for Grant Assistance





Any public entity eligible to apply for loan guarantee assistance pursuant to  570.702 may apply for grant assistance
under Section 108(q). Eligible applicants are entitlement units of general local government and nonentitlement
units of general local government eligible to receive loan guarantees under  570.702. 




(G) Eligible Activities




EDI grant funds may be used for: 



(1) Activities listed at  570.703, provided such activities are carried out as part of an economic development
project. 



(2) Payment of costs of private financial guaranty insurance policies, letters of credit, or other credit enhancements
for the notes or other obligations guaranteed by HUD pursuant to Section 108, provided such notes or obligations are
used to finance an economic development project. Such enhancements shall be specified in the contract required by
 570.705(b)(1), and shall be satisfactory in form and substance to HUD for security purposes. 




II. The Application Process





Public entities seeking EDI assistance must make a specific request for that assistance, in accordance with this
NOFA. The EDI application shall be accompanied by a request for a Section 108 loan guarantee commitment, as further
described in Section II.B. of this NOFA below. Application guidelines for the Section 108 program are found at  570.704.





(A) Timing of Submission





Applications for EDI assistance shall be received at HUD Headquarters at the address listed above at ``Addresses''
by September 16, 1994 by 4:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight time. HUD will not accept applications which are submitted to HUD
via facsimile (FAX) transmission. 



(B) Submission Requirements





The EDI application shall be accompanied by a request for loan guarantee assistance under Section 108. The request
for Section 108 loan guarantee can be either: 



(1) A formal application for Section 108 loan guarantee, including the documents listed at  570.704(b); 



(2) A description, not to exceed three (3) pages, of a Section 108 loan guarantee application to be submitted within
one month of a notice of EDI selection (EDI awards will be conditioned on approval of actual Section 108 loan commitments).
This description must be sufficient to support the basic eligibility of the proposed project or activities for Section
108 assistance; 



(3) A copy of a Section 108 loan guarantee application which was approved after the date of this NOFA; or 



(4) A request for a Section 108 loan guarantee amendment (analogous to subparagraph (1) or (2) above) which proposes
to increase the amount of a previously approved application. However, a Section 108 loan guarantee application approved
before the date of this NOFA is not eligible for EDI awards. 



In addition, the public entity shall submit for EDI grant assistance the following: 



(i) SF 424, Application for Federal Assistance. 



(ii) The certification regarding lobbying required under 24 CFR part 87 (Appendix A). 



(iii) A narrative statement describing the activities that will be carried out with the EDI grant funds and explaining
how the use of EDI grant funds meets the criteria in paragraph II.(C) below. The narrative statement shall not exceed
one 8.5
'
' by 11
'
' page for the description of the activities to be carried out with the EDI grant funds and one page for each of
the listed selection criteria. 




(C) Selection Criteria





All applications will be considered for selection based on the following criteria that demonstrate the quality of
the proposed project, and the applicant's creativity, capacity and commitment to maximize the use of the EDI funds,
in accordance with the purposes of the Act. 



(1) Distress_(up to 20 points). The level of distress in the immediate community to be served and/or the jurisdiction
applying for assistance. This may include factors indicative of distress such as poverty, income, unemployment,
drug use, homelessness and other indicators of distress. 



(2) Extent of need for assistance_(up to 15 points). This may include factors such as: 



(i) Projects costs and financial requirements. 



(ii) The amount of any debt service or operating reserve accounts to be established in connection with the economic
development project. 



(iii) The reasonableness of the costs of any credit enhancement paid with EDI grant funds. 



(iv) The amount of program income (if any) to be received each year during the repayment period for the guaranteed loan.



(v) Interest rates on those loans to third parties (other than subrecipients) (either as an absolute rate or as a plus/minus

(vi) Underwriting guidelines used (or expected to be used) in determining project feasibility 



(vii) Other relevant information 



(3) The extent to which the proposed activities effectively support important National interests_(up to 15 points).
These activities include: 



(i) The provision of jobs for low- and moderate-income individuals with special consideration for participants

(x) The provision of employment opportunities that are an integral component of a community's strategy to promote
spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income and minority families; 
(xi) The provision of assistance to business(es) that operate(s) within a census tract (or block numbering area)
that has at least 20 percent of its residents who are in poverty; or 
(xii) Other innovative approaches that provide substantial benefit to low-and moderate-income persons. 
(4) Quality of the plan_(up to 45 points). HUD will consider the quality of the plan, including but not limited to the
extent to which the applicant's proposed plan for the EDI grant/Section 108 loan guarantee will address its described
need in the applicant's immediate community and/or its jurisdiction, and the extent to which the plan is logically,
feasibly, and substantially likely to achieve its stated purpose. 
(5) The capacity or potential of the public entity to successfully carry out the plan_(up to 15 points). This may include
factors such as the public entity's performance in the administration of its CDBG program; its previous experience,
if any, in administering a section 108 loan guarantee; its performance and capacity in carrying out economic development
projects; its ability to conduct prudent underwriting; and its capacity to manage and service loans made with the
guaranteed loan funds or EDI grant funds. 
(6) The extent to which the proposed plan follows a comprehensive and coordinated approach in addressing the community
and economic development needs of the public entity and furthers neighborhood revitalization_(up to 20 points).

(7) Innovation and creativity_(up to 20 points). The extent to which the applicant incorporated innovation and/or
creativity in the design and proposed implementation of the proposed activities carried out with Section 108/EDI
funds. 
HUD, in its discretion, may choose to award EDI assistance to a lower rated approvable application over a higher rated
application in order to increase the level of geographic diversity of grants approved under this part. 
Timing of grant awards_In most cases, EDI grants will be obligated contemporaneously with HUD approval of the related
Section 108 loan guarantee commitment. However, the EDI grant may be awarded prior to HUD approval of the Section 108
commitment if HUD determines that such award will further the purposes of the Act. EDI funds shall not be disbursed
to the public entity before the issuance of the related Section 108 guaranteed obligations. 


III. Technical Assistance 


To the extent permitted by law, HUD may advise applicants of technical deficiencies in the EDI applications and permit
them to be corrected. Due to the requirements of the HUD Reform Act, HUD staff is limited in the assistance it is permitted
to provide regarding applications for EDI grants. The assistance and advice that can be provide includes such activities
as explaining and responding to questions about program regulations, identification of those parts of an application
that need substantive improvement, the dates by which decisions will be made and procedures that are required to be
performed to process an application. This term, however, does not include advising the applicant how to make those
improvements. 
In addition, any information published in the 

Federal Register

 and in this NOFA and any information that has been made public through a means other than the 

Federal Register

 or NOFA, may be discussed. 
HUD staff will be available throughout the EDI application period to provide extensive advice and assistance, as
is currently provided, to develop 108 loan applications since the 108 program is not subject to the HUD Reform Act.
Staff providing such assistance may provide technical advice to the EDI selection panel but in no case will such staff
participate in the panel's voting process for EDI awards under this NOFA. 


IV. Other Matters 




Environmental Impact. 

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410. 


Federalism. 

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this NOFA will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship
with the Federal Government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of
government. While the NOFA offers financial assistance to units of general local government, none of its provisions
will have an effect on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or the States' political subdivisions.



Family. 

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the policies
announced in this NOFA would not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general
well-being within the meaning of the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies and programs will result
from issuance of this NOFA, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. 


Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities. 

The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants,
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. 


Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel. 

Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. HUD's regulation implementing section 13 is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any
efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples
contained in Appendix A of the rule. Appendix A of this rule contains examples of activities covered by this rule. 
Any questions concerning the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington DC 20410-3000. Telephone: (202) 708-3815 (voice/TDD).
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD Office.

<DOCTITLE>Emergency Closure of Public Lands; California</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Emergency closure of certain public lands in the Juniper Flats Area of San Bernardino County, California for a period
of up to five years or until rehabilitation of fire damage, whichever occurs first.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with title 43, Code of Federal Regulations, 8341.2, 8364.1 and 4110.3-3, notice is hereby given
that lands and roads administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that were affected by the Devil Fire in the
Juniper Flats/Grapevine and Arrastre Canyon area have been closed to all access and use until posting of signs and
clearing of potentially dangerous hazards. When posting the area and marking and clearing of hazards has occurred,
pedestrian use only will be permitted in the affected area until rehabilitation occurs to specified criteria. This
closure applies to all motorized vehicle and nonmotorized use, including permitted uses, unless specifically excepted
by the authorized officer; except for BLM operation and maintenance vehicles, law enforcement vehicles and other
vehicles specifically authorized by an authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management.



This closure affects ALL of the public lands and roads located within the following lands of the Arrastre Canyon and
Grapevine Canyon area of San Bernardino County, located to the north of the San Bernardino National Forest, including
and to the east of Coxey Truck Trail, including and to the west of Grapevine Canyon Road, and including and to the south
of the powerline road:



San Bernardino Meridian



T. 3 N., R. 2 W.



Secs. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.



T. 4 N., R. 2 W.



Secs. 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35.




A total of approximately 4,800 acres.




This closure affects only public lands. Private lands are unaffected. The closed routes include the following:

(1) Grapevine Canyon Road (4N16), through public lands in Sections 26 and 35 of T. 4 N., R. 2 W. and Section 2 of T. 3 N.,
R. 2 W.

(2) ``Coxey'' Truck Road east of Arrastre Canyon, southeast off of Bowen Ranch Road, through public lands in Section
31 of T. 4 N., R. 2 W. and Section 5 of T. 3 N., R. 2 W.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This emergency closure is required to facilitate the rehabilitation of the area affected by the Devil Fire which burned
out of control from July 3 through July 8, 1994, as specified in the fire rehabilitation plan. The affected area includes
burned over potentially dangerous snags, shallow, highly erodible soils, and valuable riparian areas downstream
of the fire area. Most of the transmountain vegetative regime normally present in the area has been eliminated by the
fire and will need time to reestablish itself undisturbed by the activities of man. Criteria established to evaluate
the rehabilitation effort specified in the fire rehabilitation plan will be used to determine the continuing need
for the closure.




PENALTIES: 

Failure to comply with this closure is punishable by a fine not to exceed $100,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed
12 months.

MP has certified with respect to the trackage rights involved here that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line
for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic on the line has been rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint
filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding

<DOCTITLE>Unity Railways Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Allegheny County, PA </DOCTITLE>


Unity Railways Company (Unity) has filed a notice of exemption, under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_Exempt Abandonments,
to abandon its entire line between survey station 3+50 at Unity Junction and the end of its line at survey station 205+82
at Renton Road, a distance of approximately 3.9 miles, located in Plum Borough, Allegheny County, PA.

1






Unity has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic
on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a state or local government entity
acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or
with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of a complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements
at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic reports), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter),
49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government agencies) have been met.

Where as here, the carrier is abandoning its entire line, the Commission does not normally impose labor protection
under 49 U.S.C. 10505(g) unless the evidence indicates the existence of a corporate affiliate that will: (1) continue
rail operations; or (2) realize significant benefits in addition to being relieved of the burden of deficit operations
by its affiliated railroad. See T and P Rwy._Aband._in Shawnee, Jefferson, and Atchison Counties, KS, Docket No.
AB-381, et al. (ICC served Apr. 27, 1993). Because these conditions do not appear to exist here, employee protective
conditions will not be imposed. 
Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on September 15, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

2

 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

3

 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29

4

 must be filed by August 26, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must
be filed by September 6, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423. 






A copy of any pleading filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Richard R. Wilson,
Vuono, Lavelle & Gray, 2310 Grant Building, Pittsburgh, PA 15219. 
If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void

<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


Revocation of Registration; Franz A. Arakaky, M.D.



On May 16, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Franz A. Arakaky, M.D., of Arlington, Virginia. The Order to Show Cause proposed
to revoke Dr. Arakaky's DEA Certificate of Registration, BA1999727, under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), and deny any pending
applications for renewal of such registration under 21 U.S.C. 823(f).

On May 17, 1994, the Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Arakaky by registered mail and was returned to DEA unclaimed,
with no forwarding address. The Order to Show Cause was then mailed to Dr. Arakaky's last known home address on July
25, 1994, and was also returned unclaimed. Subsequent repeated attempts by DEA to contact Dr. Arakaky have been unsuccessful.

Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Arakaky has waived his opportunity for a hearing.
Accordingly, under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57, the Deputy Administrator enters his final order
in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative file.

The Deputy Administrator finds that on April 19, 1993, Dr. Arakaky was indicted by the Grand Jury for the Arlington
County Circuit Court on four counts of sexual battery. The indictment arose from allegations by three female patients
who alleged that Dr. Arakaky performed inappropriate sexual acts under the guise of legitimate medical treatment.
as a result of the indictment, on April 29, 1993, the Virginia Board of Medicine (Board) informed Dr. Arakaky of the
Board's intention to hold a formal administrative hearing to determine whether Dr. Arakaky violated certain laws
governing the practice of medicine in the Commonwealth of Virginia. On that same date, the Board issued an Order of
Summary Suspension of Dr. Arakaky's license to practice medicine.

Following the administrative hearing, the Board issued its decision on June 10, 1993. The Board found that Dr. Arakaky
behaved in an unprofessional and sexually inappropriate manner towards one female patient, and made similar findings
with respect to three other female patients. The Board therefore ordered that Dr. Arakaky's license to practice medicine
in the Commonwealth of Virginia be revoked.

The Deputy Administrator finds that as of June 10, 1993, Dr. Arakaky's license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth
of Virginia has been revoked, and as a result, he is not authorized to handle controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement
administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle
controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This
prerequisite has been consistently upheld. 

See James H. Nickens, M.D., 

57 FR 59847 (1992); 

Elliott Monroe, M.D., 

57 FR 23246 (1992); 

Bobby Watts, M.D., 

53 FR 11919 (1988).

Based on the foregoing, it is clear that Dr. Arakaky's DEA Certificate of Registration must be revoked. Accordingly,
the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C.
823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BA1999727,
previously issued to Franz A. Arakaky, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications for renewal
of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 16, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Revocation of Registration; Stephen A. Richards, D.D.S.</DOCTITLE>




On March 11, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Stephen A. Richards, D.D.S., of Sterling, Colorado. The Order to Show Cause
proposed to revoke Dr. Richards' DEA Certificate of Registration, BR2567266, and deny any pending applications
for renewal of such registration under 21 U.S.C. 823(f).


On March 14, 1994, the Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Richards' registered location by registered mail and was returned
to DEA unclaimed, with no forwarding address. The Order to Show Cause was then mailed to Dr. Richards' last known address
on July 25, 1994, and was also returned unclaimed. Subsequent repeated attempts by DEA to contact Dr. Richards have
been unsuccessful.


Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Richards has waived his opportunity for a hearing.
Accordingly, under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57, the Deputy Administrator enters his final order
in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative file.


The Deputy Administrator finds that on July 20, 1990, Dr. Richards' dental license was summarily suspended by the
Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners (Board), based in part upon his unsatisfactory care of several patients.
In October 1990, Dr. Richards entered into a Stipulation and Order with the Board in which he agreed that his license
would remain suspended for a total of five months (July 20, 1990 to December 24, 1990); that his license would be reissued
on or after December 24, 1990, subject to the completion of certain terms and conditions; and that upon resumption
of his dental practice, Dr. Richards was to be placed on probation. However, Dr. Richards failed to reactivate his
state dental license following its suspension, and as a result, his license to practice dentistry in the State of Colorado
remained suspended.

In February 1993, Dr. Richards was called before the Board for a disciplinary hearing. The administrative law judge
that presided over the hearing found, among other things, that Dr. Richards practiced dentistry at a number of locations
for over two years when his dental license was suspended. As a result, on May 6, 1993, the administrative law judge recommended
to the Board that Dr. Richards' dental license be revoked. On July 21, 1993, the Board voted to accept the administrative
law judge's recommendation, and revoked Dr. Richards' dental license.

The Deputy Administrator finds that as of July 21, 1993, Dr. Richards' license to practice dentistry in the State of
Colorado has been revoked, and as a result, he is not authorized to handle controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement
Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle
controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This
prerequisite has been consistently upheld.

823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BR2567266,

Aileen's South Hill, VA; Aileen's New York, NY; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Work Adjustment
Assistance 



In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
for Worker Adjustment Assistance on March 24, 1994, applicable to all workers of Aileen's, South Hill, Virginia.
The notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16663). 

At the request of the company the Department reviewed the subject certification. The findings show that a few workers
were laid off beginning in January, 1994 at the New York facility of Aileen's. The layoffs were the result of a reduced
demand from the South Hill plant whose workers are currently certified for TAA. Therefore, the Department is amending
the subject certification to include the New York location. 

The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers of Aileen's who were adversely affected by
increased imports. 

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,494 is hereby issued as follows: 

 


All workers of Aileen's South Hill, Virginia and New York, New York engaged in employment related to the production
of ladies' pants, skirts, blouses, jackets and shirts who became totally or partially separated from employment
on or after February 2, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

<DOCTITLE>Aspen Imaging International Inc.; Lafayette, CO and AZ; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for
Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>




In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on March 8, 1994, applicable to all workers of Aspen Imaging
International, Inc., in Lafayette, Louisiana. The Notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12984).

The Company requested that the Department review its certification for workers of the subject firm. New information
from the company shows some worker separations in Arizona who were engaged in employment related to the production
of computer printer ribbons.

The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers of Aspen Imaging International Inc., who were
affected by increased imports of computer printer ribbons.

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,383 is hereby issued as follows:




All workers of Aspen Imaging International Inc., Lafayette, Colorado and in Arizona engaged in employment related
to the production of computer ribbons who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after May 3,
1993 and before March 1, 1994 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

I further determine that all workers at Aspen Imaging International, Inc., Lafayette, Colorado engaged in the production
of laser printer toner cartridges are denied eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of
the Trade Act of 1974.

<DOCTITLE>Bell Helicopter; Fort Worth, TX; Negative Determination on Remand</DOCTITLE>


By an order dated April 29, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (USCIT) in 

Former Employees of Bell Helicopter Textron 

v.

 United States, 

(USCIT 93-01-00024) remanded this case to the Department for further investigation.
The workers under this petition were initially denied eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance on December
18, 1992. The negative determination was published in the Federal Register on January 13, 1993 (58 FR 4186). The basis
for that decision is the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the group eligibility requirements of
the Trade Act was not met. The findings show that Bell Helicopter does not import publications which are produced in
Fort Worth. The findings show that the production of manuals is done either by Bell Helicopter or contracted to domestic
vendors.
The court ordered the Department to investigate on remand where Bell Helicopters are now being produced and to determine
whether any manuals are also being produced at the new helicopter production sites. The Court further ordered the
Department to investigate whether manuals are being imported into the U.S. if it turns out that they are being produced
abroad. The court also instructed the Department to obtain independent verification of Bell's statements that no
English language manuals were being produced abroad and that no imported manuals were substituted for those formerly
produced in Fort Worth.
Item 

#

1 of the petition identifies the group of workers petitioning for TAA as the writers and illustrators of the Technical
Publications Department, AR 2. however, plaintiffs assert that the production of helicopters is linked to the production
of manuals.
Investigation findings show that during the period applicable to the petition, Bell Helicopter produced helicopters
in Fort Worth, Texas and in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada. The Quebec facility products the commercial helicopters while
the Fort Worth facility produces military and commercial helicopter components and assembles military helicopters
for the U.S. Government, namely the Cobra and the OH58D_an observation helicopter.
New findings on reconsideration show that Bell Canada in Mirabel, Quebec was opened in 1984 and is the final assembly
for commercial helicopter models. The final assembly for commercial models 206B, 206L, 212 and 412 was transferred
to Bell Canada between June 1986 and September 1988. However, the manuals for models 206B, 206L, 212 and 412 are produced
at Fort Worth except for the manuals of 100 helicopters (model 412) sold to the Canadian Government. The Canadian Government
mandated that the manuals be produced in Western Canada. The first effort to produce these manuals began in October,
1993 some 16 months after the layoff of the petitioners in June, 1992. According to Bell Helicopter officials, the
plaintiffs' layoffs had absolutely nothing to do with the Canadian government purchase of the model 412s. Furthermore,
some of the technical writing for these 100 manuals was returned to Fort Worth and Bell Helicopter has two technical
publications employees assisting in the creation of these manuals. The completion of the 100 technical manuals is
scheduled for January 1995.
Bell Canada is also producing helicopter model 230 and will soon put model 430 into production. However, these models
were never produced at Fort Worth. Furthermore, they are not like or directly competitive with the models that were
transferred to Canada.
Bell Canada or their subcontractors produce the manuals for models 206B, 206L, 212 and 230. Changes to the manuals
for the 230 model are, however, accomplished at Fort Worth. While some manuals for model 230 are being imported into
the U.S. they are not being substituted for the manuals formerly produced at Fort Worth.
In response to the court's order, the Department asked the plaintiffs to provide evidence for their assertions that
Bell has moved its manual production abroad and that imported manuals have replaced those formerly produced in Fort
Worth. The plaintiffs asserted that some manuals are being produced in Alberta, Canada. However, according to Bell,
these manuals are for model 

#

230 which is not like or directly competitive with models formerly produced at Fort Worth. Furthermore, the plaintiffs
also indicate that three Fort Worth employees are working on these manuals under a Canadian government contract.
As noted above, this contract had nothing to do with the plaintiffs' layoffs. Consequently, the plaintiffs' responses
do not provide a basis for certification.
Other findings on reconsideration show that the Technical Publications Department's layoffs in 1992 were the result
of company-wide reduction in force caused by severe curtailments in production and cancellations or loss of programs
from the Department of Defense.


Conclusion


After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for adjustment
assistance for workers and former workers of Bell Helicopter, Fort Worth, Texas.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Detroit Edison Company (Fermi, Unit 2); Exemption



I



Detroit Edison (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF-43, which authorizes operation
of Fermi 2 at steady state reactor power levels not in excess of 3430 megawatts thermal. This license provides, among
other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) now or hereafter in effect. The Fermi 2 facility consists of a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's
site in Monroe County, Michigan.



II




Section 50.54(q) of 10 CFR Part 50 requires a licensee authorized to operate a nuclear power reactor to follow and maintain
in effect emergency plans that meet the standards of 10 CFR 50.47(b) and the requirements of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part
50. Section IV.F.3 of Appendix E requires that each licensee at each site shall exercise with offsite authorities
such that the State and local government emergency plans for each operating reactor are exercised biennially, with
full or partial participation by State and local governments, within the plume exposure pathway emergency planning
zone. The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations which, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), are:
(1) authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, are consistent with the common
defense and security; and (2) present special circumstances. Section 50.12(a)(2)(v) of 10 CFR Part 50 indicates
that special circumstances exist when an exemption would provide only temporary relief from applicable regulation
and the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulations.



III



By letter dated April 19, 1994, as supplemented June 23, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from the schedule
requirement of Section IV.F.3 of Appendix E to perform a partial participation emergency preparedness exercise
for Fermi 2 during 1994. The licensee stated in the request that its response to the actual emergency event which occurred
on December 25, 1993, demonstrated the adequacy of its emergency plan and its ability to successfully respond to an
accident. Granting the exemption will allow the licensee to spend its resources to repair the damage to the plant and
restart the facility.

In the area of emergency preparedness and planning, the licensee's performance has been excellent. In the last two
SALP (systematic assessment of licensee performance) rating periods, Fermi 2 has received category 1 ratings in
the Emergency Preparedness category and in the new Plant Support category, which includes emergency preparedness
activities. This reflects a consistent high level of onsite emergency preparedness.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, the licensee has demonstrated an ongoing commitment to support and maintain its emergency preparedness
program. In the last 18 months, the licensee has conducted five full-scale drills and a medical drill, and conducted
an annual partial participation exercise in July 1993.

On December 25, 1993, an accident occurred at the facility which resulted in the declaration of an Alert. There was
a catastrophic failure of the turbine generator which caused a reactor scram, a fire, and significant damage to the
turbine auxiliary systems. During the event, the licensee implemented its Fermi 2 emergency plan and activated a
portion of its emergency response organization, including the technical support center, operations support center,
and alternate operations support center. The AIT (augmented inspected team) report covering the event and the response
to the event identified some problems with the licensee's ability to classify the event and perform personnel accountability.
In response to these findings, the licensee has performed additional training in the simulator, modified and revised
procedures, and conducted an integrated onsite drill on June 8, 1994, to verify the plant staff's capability to classify
an event and to demonstrate personnel accountability.

In its letter requesting an exemption, Detroit Edison included letters from the two surrounding counties and the
State of Michigan. All three letters concurred with the licensee's request as long as the licensee will continue to
support the September 1994 offsite exercise. FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) Headquarters and FEMA
Region V have reviewed the request and agree with the position taken by the State and local officials. The licensee
has committed to support the State and local support agencies by providing communication links, scenario data and
interface staff at the JPIC (joint public information center).



IV



Based on a consideration of the facts presented in Section III above, the NRC staff finds that the following factors
support the granting of the requested exemption:


a. The licensee demonstrated adequate response to the December 25, 1993, turbine-generator failure event.

b. FEMA, State and local agencies have indicated agreement with the proposed exercise exemption for 1994.

c. The licensee has a strong emergency preparedness program, as indicated by its last two SALP ratings. It has supported
its program with a continuing series of drills to maintain its performance levels. In response to the AIT inspection
and the concerns in the area of event classification and accountability, the licensee has instituted additional
training, revised its procedures, and held an integrated drill on June 8, 1994, to demonstrate its ability to classify
an event and account for its staff during an emergency.

d. The licensee has committed to support the State and local agencies in their September 1994 offsite exercise by supplying
scenario data, communication links and staffing for the JPIC.

e. The licensee will conduct a utility-only exercise in July 1995. The requested exemption is a one-time event, which
will result in cancelling the partial participation exercise scheduled for September 1994 and rescheduling a utility-only
exercise in July 1995. The exemption will relieve the licensee of the resource burden of conducting an exercise while
trying to repair the damage to the facility and return the plant to service. Based on the factors considered above,
the Commission has concluded that granting the proposed exemption will not result in a decrease in the effectiveness
of the licensee's emergency preparedness program.

The special circumstances for granting this exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12 have also been identified. As stated
in part in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v), special circumstances are present when the exemption would provide only temporary
relief from the applicable regulation and the licensee has made a good faith effort to comply with the regulation.
The licensee has made a good faith effort to comply with the regulations by conducting the required full-participation
exercises at Fermi 2 with the State and local government agencies since 1985. The licensee has taken into consideration
the various concerns of FEMA and the local governments by supporting the September exercise being conducted by the
State and local governments. All affected parties support the proposed exercise schedule change. Granting the proposed
exemption provides a one-time only relief from the requirement of 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.3. Therefore,
the Commission concludes that special circumstances are present.



V



Accordingly, the NRC has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), the exemption requested by the licensee's
letter of April 19, 1994, as supplemented June 23, 1994, is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public
health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security. The NRC further determines that special
circumstances as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v) are present justifying the exemption. Therefore, the NRC hereby
approves the following exemption:

Fermi 2 is exempt from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.3, for the conduct of a partial participation
emergency preparedness exercise in 1994, provided that a utility-only exercise be conducted by July 1995.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the NRC has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant effect
on the quality of human environment (59 FR 40626).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration
Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing; Illinois Power Co.</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. HPF-62, issued to the Illinois Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the Clinton Power
Station, Unit 1, located in Dewitt County, Illinois.

The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification (TS) Table 4.8.1.1.2-1, ``Diesel Generator
Test Schedule,'' to exclude three valid failures of the Division 1 emergency diesel generator (EDG) from contributing
towards accelerated diesel generator testing.

The last three valid failures (occurring on August 3, 1993, June 7 and July 12, 1994) were determined not as the result
of an actual surveillance test, but the confirmation of the failure of one of two CV-2 relays associated with
the Division 1 EDG output breaker. The relays are checked each shift for visible indication of failure. Failure of
the relay could cause premature closure of the breaker upon receipt of an automatic start signal due to or coincident
with a loss of offsite power. The cause of these failures was subsequently attributed to undersized current-limiting
resistors that were installed in the relays by the vendor. These resistors were replaced with appropriately sized
resistors and testing has been performed to ensure operability. The relay is normally tested only during the 18-month
shutdown test that assures proper functioning of the EDG and associated equipment upon receipt of a loss-of-offsite
power test signal. Weekly testing, as required by TS Table 4.8.1.1.2-1, allows for manual loading which bypasses
the CV-2 relay.

The valid failure of the Division 1 EDG on June 7, 1994, brought the number of failures in the last 100 valid tests up to
seven. In addition, the valid failure of July 12, 1994, was the second failure in the last 20 tests. In accordance with
TS Table 4.8.1.1.2-1, the frequency of testing increases from monthly to weekly until at least seven consecutive
successful tests are performed and there is a maximum of only one failure in the last 20 tests. Weekly testing, which
began following the failure of June 7, 1994, must now continue until at least the first week of October 1994.

In a letter dated August 5, 1994, the licensee requested an exigent technical specification change to modify TS Table
4.8.1.1.2-1 to exclude these three valid failures from contributing to accelerated testing of the Division
1 diesel generator. The licensee's basis for this request included the following:

 Additional weekly testing is inappropriate because the increased surveillance testing does not test the
relay that failed;

 The undersized current-limiting resistors found in the CV-2 relays have been replaced which should
eliminate similar failures in the future;

 Plant operators, who identified the previous three failures, will continue to tour the equipment once per
shift and check for targets that may have dropped;

 Testing of the EDG at the Clinton power Station involve paralleling the diesel generators to the grid. NRC Information
Notice 84-69 warns against operating diesel generators connected to offsite power unnecessarily as disturbances
in the offsite power system can adversely affect availability of the EDG; and

 Excessive or unnecessary testing of diesel generators can cause unnecessary wear or degradation and thus
contribute to their reduced reliability.

Approval of the proposed TS change will eliminate unnecessary testing of the diesel generator and will permit the
licensee to resume a monthly test frequency. Prompt action by the staff is necessary to eliminate unnecessary testing
and precludes the time available to permit the customary public notices in advance of this action.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940816-2-00102 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940816-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) The proposed change itself does not involve any changes to the plant design or operation and therefore does not
affect any initiators of any previously evaluated accidents. Consequently the proposed change does not involve
any significant increase in the probability of occurrence of any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change only allows certain identified test failures of the Division 1 diesel generator to not be included
in the total number of failure used to determine whether testing of the diesel generator should be increased. Because
appropriate corrective action has been taken in response to those particular test failures, acceptable reliability
of the Division 1 diesel generator is assured without increased testing in response to those failures. Further, the
Clinton Power Station design includes redundancy and consideration of single-failure criteria such that alternate
sources, both onsite and offsite, are provided to ensure safe shutdown of the facility in the event of an accident,
including mitigation of the consequences of an accident. Based on the above, Illinois Power concludes that the proposed
change will not increase the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 

(2) The proposed change does not involve any modification to plant design or operation which could introduce a new
failure mode. The proposed change only impacts the frequency of testing of the Division 1 diesel generator as it does
not directly affect operation or the design of the Division 1 diesel generator or any other plant structure, system
or component. As a result, no new failure modes are introduced and the proposed change will therefore not create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

(3) As noted above, other than the impact on the frequency of testing performed on the Division 1 diesel generator,
the proposed change involves no changes to the plant design or operation. Therefore, as they are typically defined
or established by the plant's accident analyses, no margins of safety are impacted by the proposed change. Notwithstanding,
if diesel generator reliability is viewed as a margin of safety, Division 1 diesel generator reliability is the only
margin of safety potentially impacted by the proposed change. However, as noted previously, reliability of the Division
1 diesel generator is not adversely affected by the proposed change since the corrective actions taken in response
to the noted failures provide assurance of acceptable diesel generator reliability without increased testing in
response to these failures. Further, the proposed change will reduce the potential for excessive or unnecessary
increased testing of the diesel generators which may adversely affect diesel generator reliability through wear
and degradation. Precluding unnecessary testing of the diesel generators will also limit the potential reduction
in plant safety resulting from disturbances in the offsite power system or in non-vital loads. In total, the proposed
change does not therefore involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analyses and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of the 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By September 15, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Vespasian Warner Public Library, 120 West
Johnson Street, Clinton, Illinois 61727. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the
above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman
of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held. 

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determinationis that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John Hannon, Director, Project Directorate III-3: petitioner's name
and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Sheldon Zabel, Esq., Schiff, Hardin and Waite, 7200 Sears Tower, 233 Wacker Drive, Chicago,
Illinois 60606, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
and Notice of and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendments 3, 4, 5, and 6 to Proposed Rule Change to Define
Members' Rights and Obligations More Precisely



I. Introduction



On November 19, 1993, as subsequently amended on December 29, 1993,
 May 5, 1994,
 July 5, 1994,
 July 26, 1994,
 July 29, 1994,
 and August 9, 1994,
 the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to adopt a short sale rule, amend its summary suspension rule and adopt procedures for the review
of summary suspensions, adopt provisions relating to suits against the Exchange and its employees, and adopt a provision
to make conduct inconsistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets or the protection of investors a violation
of Exchange Rules.













The proposed rule change and amendment nos. 1 and 2 were published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No.
34142 (June 1, 1994), 59 FR 29451 (June 6, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.






II. Description of the Proposal



Short Sale Rule



Currently, as a matter of just and equitable principles of trade, members must believe at the time they enter into a
contract to sell stock that they will be able to perform the contract. The Exchange is adopting Rule 17 under Article
IX of the Exchange's Rules to require that prior to effecting a short sale, members make arrangements to borrow the
security or obtain other assurances that delivery can be made on settlement.
 The new rule provides an exception for bona fide market making activities. To use the exception, specialists, market
makers, and odd-lot dealers must show that the sale was part of their bona fide market making activities. The rule also
requires specialists, market makers, and odd-lot dealers to notify the Exchange whenever they accumulate a position
in a security that is greater than or equal to 5% of the outstanding public float of the security.





Summary Suspension



The Exchange is modifying Article VII of its Rules concerning summary suspension and reinstatement of members and
member organizations (collectively ``members'').
 Currently, Rule 2 of Article VII permits the emergency suspension of a member if it has failed to perform its contracts
or is insolvent or is in such financial or operational condition or otherwise conducting its business in such a manner
that it cannot be permitted to continue in business with safety to its customers, creditors, or the Exchange. The rule
change codifies in Rule 2 the language of Section 6(d)(3) of the Act which allows national securities exchanges to
summarily suspend members, or limit members' or non-members' access to exchange services. Specifically, the Exchange
is adding to Rule 2 of Article VII that the president may suspend a member if the member has been and is expelled or suspended
from any self-regulatory organization, or barred or suspended from being associated with a member of any self-regulatory
organization.
 In addition, the rule change adds to Rule 2 that the President may limit or prohibit access to services offered by the
Exchange whenever it appears that persons who are not members fail to meet the qualification requirements or other
prerequisites for access to such services and cannot be permitted to continue to have access with safety to creditors,
investors, members or the Exchange.
 The rule change also clarifies that the CHX may find that the member cannot continue to do business as a member with safety
to investors, creditors, other members, or the Exchange if there is a reasonable belief that a member is violating
and will continue to violate any material provision of the Rules of the Exchange or the federal securities laws.

<DOCNO> FR940816-2-00106 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940816-2-00079 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Exchange also is adopting procedures for review of the President's summary action when taken according to the
new provisions.
 Any person affected by the President's summary action will have the right to appeal the President's decision to a panel
composed of three members of the Board.
 All appeals will be expedited to the maximum extent possible and, in any event, will be heard within ten days. After
consideration of the appeal, the panel will affirm, reverse, or modify the President's action. The decision of the
panel is final.






Standard of Review



Currently, the Exchange's Rules do not contain a formal standard of review for the hearing of appeals. The Exchange
is adopting a formal standard of review that prohibits an appeal panel from overturning the facts finder's decision
if the factual conclusions are supported by substantial evidence and if the decision itself is not arbitrary, capricious,
or an abuse of discretion.



Liability Provisions



The Exchange also is adopting several new provisions related to the liability of the Exchange and its officers, directors,
or employees. First, new Rule 17 under Article I of the Exchange's Rules prohibits members from instituting a lawsuit
or any other type of legal proceeding against any officer, director, employee or agent of the Exchange if that person
was acting on Exchange business. The provision does not prohibit members from suing the Exchange itself, nor does
it apply where there has been a violation of the federal securities laws.

Second, the Exchange is adopting a new rule that limits the liability of the Exchange to members for non-performance
or misperformance of its duties and responsibilities, except where damages are suffered as a result of the willful
misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith, or fraudulent or criminal acts of the Exchange or its officers, employees
or agents, and except where there has been a violation of the federal securities laws. The Rule is in addition to the
limitation of Exchange liability as a result of a member's use or enjoyment of Exchange facilities currently contained
in the Exchange's Constitution.






Finally, the Exchange is adopting a Rule that requires members who fail to prevail in a lawsuit or administrative adjudicative
proceeding they institute against the Exchange or its officers, directors, and employees, to pay all of the Exchange's
reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the Exchange in the defense of such proceeding. This
provision is applied only in the event that the Exchange's expenses exceed $50,000. In addition, the new Rule does
not apply to internal disciplinary actions by the Exchange or administrative appeals.



III. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes that, in general, the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
 which requires that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent
fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.






The Commission believes that the proposed rule change to adopt a short sale rule is consistent with Section 6(b)(5)
of the Act because it will help to ensure that members effecting short sales are in a position to complete the transaction.
In addition, the Commission believes that the rule change will help facilitate the settlement of transactions by
promoting the timely delivery of securities that are sold short.
 The requirement that specialists, market makers and off-lot dealers report to the Exchange short and long positions
in excess of 5% of the outstanding float will aid the exchange in monitoring compliance with its rule.





The Commission believes that the proposed rule change to the Exchange's summarily suspension provisions is consistent
with Section 6(d)(3) of the Act.
 Section 6(d)(3) permits a national securities exchange to summarily suspend members and non-members under certain
circumstances. Specifically, an exchange may summarily suspend members from the exchange or limit or prohibit members
with respect to access to services offered by the exchange if they (1) have been and are expelled or suspended from any
self-regulatory organization or barred or suspended from being associated with a member of any self-regulatory
organization, or (2) are in such financial or operating difficulty that the exchange determines that the member cannot
be permitted to continue to do business as a member with safety to investors, creditors, other members, or the exchange.
An exchange may limit or prohibit persons who are not members from access to exchange services if the exchange determines
that such person does not meet the qualification requirements or other prerequisites for such access and that the
person cannot be permitted to continue to have access with safety to investors, creditors, members, or the exchange.
The rule change to the CHX's summary suspension provision incorporates the language of Section 6(d)(3) described
above.

In addition, the rule change clarifies that a member may be summarily suspended or denied access to Exchange services
if there is a reasonable belief that the member is violating and will continue to violate any material provision of
the Rules of the Exchange or the federal securities laws or the rules promulgated thereunder, and if such violations
indicate that the member cannot be permitted to continue to do business with safety to investors, creditors, other
members, or the exchange. This provision is consistent with the summary suspension provisions of Section 6(d)(3)
of the Act and merely codifies that material violations of Exchange rules and the Act can result in a finding that the
member cannot be permitted to continue business with safety to customers, creditors or the Exchange. The Commission
notes that in determining that a material violation of Exchange rules or the Act and rules thereunder warrant an emergency
or summary suspension under Rule 2, the CHX must take into consideration the egregious nature of the conduct and the
likelihood of continuing violations.
Proposed Rule 2 also sets forth new due process procedures for review of a summary suspension action by the CHX president
under the rule. Those provisions ensure that a person aggrieved by a summary suspension will have a right to an expeditious
review of the matter, including the final decision by the hearing panel. Under the new provisions, any person suspended
under Rule 2 must be furnished with the reasons for the action within two business days of the suspension. In addition
any appeal will be heard within 10 days. The Commission believes these provisions ensure adequate due process and
that a suspension under these new provisions will be handled and treated in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements
of Section 6(b)(7) of the Act.
The Commission also believes that the proposed rule change to adopt a formal standard of review that prohibits an appeal
panel from overturning the fact finder's decision if the factual conclusions are supported by substantial evidence
and if the decision itself is not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, is consistent with Section 6(b)(7)
of the Act.
 Section 6(b)(7) requires that the rules of the exchange provide fair procedures for disciplining members and denying
access to services offered by an exchange. The Commission believes that adopting a formal standard for review will
add certainty and consistency to the Exchange's appellate process.




The Commission further believes the liability provisions described above should be approved. Specifically, the
rule change prohibiting members from suing Exchange officers, directors, employees, or agents of the Exchange will
prevent those parties from having liability to members when acting on official Exchange business, while maintaining
members' ability to pursue actions against the Exchange itself, as well as the ability to sue those persons and the
Exchange for violations of the federal securities laws. Moreover, under the provisions, actions against Board members
for breach of fiduciary duty consistent with Delaware law could still be pursued.
 The Commission believes this provision is consistent with the Act because it will help to ensure that such persons
will be able to carry out their duties under the Act and enforce compliance with the Act, the rules thereunder and Exchange
rules without the threat of personal liability from a lawsuit.




In addition, limiting the liability of the Exchange to its members to willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith,
or fraudulent or criminal acts of the Exchange or its officers, employees or agents, will preserve members' right
to pursue actions against the Exchange in certain circumstances where the Exchange should be held accountable, or
where there has been a violation of the federal securities laws. We find this provision consistent with the Act for
the same reasons set forth in our order approving a limitation on Board of Governor liability for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty.





Finally, the Commission believes that the rule change requiring that members who are unsuccessful in a suit against
the Exchange to pay the Exchange's legal expenses if they exceed $50,000 is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the
Act,
 which requires that the rules of the exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other
charges among its members. Because the funds to pay the legal expenses incurred by the Exchange in defending legal
suits are generated, in part, by membership fees, the Commission believes the rule change reflects a reasonable business
decision by the membership to shift the financial burden of litigation to the responsible member under certain circumstances.
Because the Exchange's legal expenses must be reasonable and must accrue to at least $50,000 before a member would
be obligated to compensate the Exchange, the Commission believes the rule change should not provide an undue disincentive
to litigation, in so far as it will permit the discovery needed to assess the merits of the members' cases. The Commission
also notes that the provision specifically excludes internal disciplinary actions by the Exchange and administrative
appeals. This will ensure that members will be able to freely pursue their right to appeal any disciplinary action
brought by the Exchange for violations of its rules. The Commission also notes that if the minimum amount in the fee
provision were substantially lower it might have a more difficult time concluding that the provision was consistent
with Section 6(b)(4) because such a lower threshold amount could be found to represent an inequitable allocation
of fees to the disadvantage of certain members.

The rule change and amendments nos. 1 and 2 were published in the 

Federal Register

 for the full statutory period and no comments were received.
 Amendment nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6 generally narrowed the scope of the proposal as published in the 

Federal Register

 and made clarifying and technical changes. The Commission therefore finds good cause for approving amendment nos.
3, 4, 5, and 6 to the rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication of notice of filing thereof.




IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning amendment nos. 3, 4, 5, and
6. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all
written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications
relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from
the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CHX. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CHX-93-31
and should be submitted by September 6, 1994.


V. Conclusion


Based on the above the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act.


It Is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CHX-93-31) as amended, including amendments nos. 3, 4, 5, and
6 on an accelerated basis, are approved.

Notice of Application for Exemptions under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Hartford Life Insurance Company (``Hartford Life''), Hartford Life Insurance Company/Separate Account Three
(the ``Separate Account''), and Hartford Equity Sales Company, Inc. (``HESCO'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemptions requested under Section 6(c) from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order permitting the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate
Account, which funds certain deferred variable annuity contracts called the Hartford Life Variable Annuity Contract
(the ``Contracts'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the Application. The complete Application is available for a fee from the Commission's
Public Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations




1. Hartford Life was originally incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts on June 5, 1902, and subsequently was
redomiciled in Connecticut. Hartford Life is a stock life insurance company engaged in the business of writing health
and life insurance, both ordinary and group, in all States of the United States and in the District of Columbia.

2. On June 13, 1994, the Board of Directors of Hartford Life passed a corporate resolution establishing the Separate
Account under Connecticut law. On June 23, 1994, the Separate Account registered as a unit investment trust under
the 1940 Act. The Contracts will be offered for sale by HESCO, the designated principal underwriter for the Contracts.
HESCO is a broker-dealer registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

3. The Contract Owner has the right to allocate purchase payments to several sub-accounts of the Separate Account,
each of which invests in a corresponding series of Dean Witter Select Dimensions Investment Series, and open-end
diversified investment company. A Contract Owner also may allocate purchase payments to Hartford Life's Fixed Account.
The Contract offers a death benefit that is applicable prior to the annuity commencement date as well as four annuity
options, including an annuity payable during the lifetime of the annuitant.

4. The Contract Owner will not pay a sales charge at the time of a premium payment, although a contingent deferred sales
charge may be assessed against Contract values upon surrender. The length of time from receipt of a premium payment
to the time of surrender determines the contingent deferred sales charge. Specifically, the contingent deferred
sales charge equals 6% of a premium payment surrendered in the payment's first year, 6% during the second year, 5% during
the third year, 5% during the fourth year, 4% during the fifth year, 3% during the sixth year, 2% during the seventh year,
and 0% for all older premium payments.

5. During the first seven Contract years, on a non-cumulative basis, a Contract Owner may make a partial surrender
of Contract values of up to 10% of the aggregate premium payments made to the Contract (as determined on the date of the
requested withdrawal) without the application of the contingent deferred sales charge. After the seventh Contract
year, the Contract Owner may make a partial surrender of the greater of 10% of premium payments made during the seven
years prior to the surrender or 100% of the Contract value less the premium payments made during the seven years prior
to the surrender without the application of the contingent deferred sales charge.

6. Each Contract anniversary, Hartford Life will deduct a $30 maintenance fee from each Contract Owner's Contract
value to reimburse it for expenses relating to administration and maintenance of the Contract and the sub-accounts
of the Separate Account. There is no annual maintenance fee with respect to Contracts with more than $50,000 of Contract
value on the Contract anniversary. In addition, Hartford Life will make a daily charge at the rate of .15% per annum
against the assets of the Separate Account during both the accumulation and annuity phases of the Contracts for administration
expenses. Neither of these charges may be increased during the life of the Contracts. Total revenues from all administrative
charges under the Contracts are not expected to exceed Hartford Life's average expected costs of administering the
Contracts.

<TEXT>
 

7. The Contracts will provide for the deduction of a 1.25% annual asset charge that will be paid to Hartford Life on a
daily basis for providing mortality and expense guarantees with respect to the Contracts. Hartford Life estimates
that this charge will be composed of a .90% mortality risk component and a .35% expense risk component. The mortality
undertaking provided by Hartford Life, assuming the selection of one of the forms of life annuities, is to make monthly
annuity payments (determined in accordance with the 1983(a) Individual Annuity Mortality Table with ages set back
one year and other provisions contained in the Contract) to Contract Owners regardless of how long an annuitant may
live, and regardless of how long all annuitants as a group may live. Hartford Life also incurs a mortality risk because
of its liability to pay a minimum death benefit under the Contract. Hartford Life may experience a profit or a loss on
the mortality component of the charge, depending on the actual mortality experience of Contract owners and Contract
annuitants. The expense risk assumed by Hartford Life is the risk that the administrative fees may be insufficient
to cover actual expenses. The rate of the mortality and expense risk charge cannot be increased. If the charge is insufficient
to cover the actual cost of the expense risk undertaking, Hartford Life will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge
proves more than sufficient, the excess will be surplus to Hartford Life and will be available for any proper corporate
purpose. Hartford Life expects a reasonable profit from the mortality and expense risk charge.
8. Applicants ask that the requested order apply to the Separate Account and to future separate accounts issuing contracts
that are substantially similar to the Contracts.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge. Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from
selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a trustee or custodian
having the qualifications prescribed by Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and are held under an agreement that provides
that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable
amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants' proposed
mortality and expense risk charge would not be considered a bookkeeping and administrative expense.
2. Applicants have consented that the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) may be made subject
to the following representations:
(a) The mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Hartford Life under the
Contracts.
(b) The mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity contracts
as determined by a survey of comparable contracts issued by a large number of other insurance companies. Applicants'
Contract is comparable to the contracts of other insurance companies in that (i) current charge levels are approximately
the same; (ii) all provide minimum death benefit guarantees the same as or lower than Applicants' Contract; (iii)
all have guaranteed annuity purchase rates; (iv) all have the same special accounting system for separate account
unit value administration; and (v) all are offered in the same market. Hartford Life undertakes to maintain at its
Home Office available to the Commission upon request a memorandum setting forth in detail the methodology and contracts
of other insurance companies underlying this representation.
(c) There is the likelihood that the proceeds from explicit sales loads will be insufficient to cover the expected
costs of distributing the Contracts. Any shortfall will be covered from the assets of the general account, which may
include profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. Therefore, Hartford Life has concluded that there is a
reasonable likelihood that the Separate Account's distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Separate
Account and Contract Owners. Hartford Life undertakes to maintain at its Home Office and make available to the Commission
upon request a memorandum setting forth the basis for this representation; and
(d) The Separate Account will invest only in open-end management companies which have undertaken to have a board of
directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the open-end management company, formulate and approve
any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses.


Applicants' Conclusion


Applicants request exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in order that they may offer
and sell the Contracts subject to the charge for mortality and expense guarantees described above. Applicants submit
that, for all of the reasons stated herein, the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) meet
the standards set out in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the Application. The complete Application is available for a fee from the Commission's
Public Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. ITT Hartford, formerly ITT Hartford Life Insurance Corporation, is domiciled in the State of Wisconsin, and was
incorporated on January 9, 1956. ITT Hartford is a stock life insurance company engaged in the business of writing
both individual and group life insurance and annuities in all states of the United States (except New York) and in the
District of Columbia.
2. On June 13, 1994, the Board of Directors of ITT Hartford passed a corporate resolution establishing the Separate
Account under Connecticut law. On June 23, 1994, the Separate Account registered as a unit investment trust under
the 1940 Act. The Contracts to be issued by the Separate Account will be offered for sale by HESCO, the designated principal
underwriter for the Contracts. HESCO is a broker-dealer registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
3. The Contract Owner has the right to allocate purchase payments to several sub-accounts of the Separate Account,
each of which invests in a corresponding series of Dean Witter Select Dimensions Investment Series, an open-end diversified
investment company. A Contract Owner also may allocate purchase payments to ITT Hartford's Fixed Account. The Contract
offers a death benefit that is applicable prior to the annuity commencement date as well as four annuity options, including
an annuity payable during the lifetime of the annuitant.
4. The Contract Owner will not pay a sales charge at the time of a premium payment, although a contingent deferred sales
charge may be assessed against Contract values upon surrender. The length of time from receipt of a premium payment
to the time of surrender determines the contingent deferred sales charge. Specifically, the contingent deferred
sales charge equals 6% of a premium payment surrendered in the payment's first year, 6% during the second year, 5% during
the third year, 5% during the fourth year, 4% during the fifth year, 3% during the sixth year, 2% during the seventh year,
and 0% for all older premium payments.
5. During the first seven Contract years, on a non-cumulative basis, a Contract Owner may make a partial surrender
of Contract values of up to 10% of the aggregate premium payments made to the Contract (as determined on the date of the
requested withdrawal) without the application of the contingent deferred sales charge. After the seventh Contract
year, the Contract Owner may make a partial surrender of the greater of 10% of premium payments made during the seven
years prior to the surrender or 100% of the Contract value less the premium payments made during the seven years prior
to the surrender without the application of the contingent deferred sales charge.
6. Each Contract anniversary, ITT Hartford will deduct a $30 maintenance fee from each Contract Owner's Contract
value to reimburse it for expenses relating to administration and maintenance of the Contract and the sub-accounts
of the Separate Account. There is no annual maintenance fee with respect to Contracts with more than $50,000 of Contract
value on the Contract anniversary. In addition, ITT Hartford will make a daily charge at the rate of .15% per annum against
the assets of the Separate Account during both the accumulation and annuity phases of the Contracts for administration
expenses. Neither of these charges may be increased during the life of the Contracts. Total revenues from all administrative
charges under the Contracts are not expected to exceed ITT Hartford's average expected costs of administering the
Contracts.

7. The Contracts will provide for the deduction of a 1.25% annual asset charge that will be paid to ITT Hartford on a daily
basis for providing mortality and expense guarantees with respect to the Contracts. ITT Hartford estimates that
this charge will be composed of a .90% mortality risk component and a .35% expense risk component. The mortality undertaking
provided by ITT Hartford, assuming the selection of one of the forms of life annuities, is to make monthly annuity payments
(determined in accordance with the 1983(a) Individual Annuity Mortality Table with ages set back one year and other
provisions contained in the Contract) to Contract Owners regardless of how long an annuitant may live, and regardless
of how long all annuitants as a group may live. ITT Hartford also incurs a mortality risk because of its liability to
pay a minimum death benefit under the Contract. ITT Hartford may experience a profit or a loss on the mortality component
of the charge, depending on the actual mortality experience of Contract owners and Contract annuitants. The expense
risk assumed by ITT Hartford is the risk that the administrative fees may be insufficient to cover actual expenses.
The rate of the mortality and expense risk charge cannot be increased. If the charge is insufficient to cover the actual
cost of the expense risk undertaking, ITT Hartford will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient,
the excess will be surplus to ITT Hartford and will be available for any proper corporate purpose. ITT Hartford expects
a reasonable profit from the mortality and expense risk charge.
8. Applicants ask that the requested order apply to the Separate Account and to future separate accounts issuing contracts
that are substantially similar to the Contracts.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge. Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from
selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a trustee or custodian
having the qualifications prescribed by Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and are held under an agreement that provides
that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable
amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants' proposed
mortality and expense risk charge would not be considered a bookkeeping and administrative expense.
2. Applicants have consented that the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) may be made subject
to the following representations:
(a) The mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by ITT Hartford under the Contracts;
(b) The mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity contracts
as determined by a survey of comparable contracts issued by a large number of other insurance companies. Applicants'
Contract is comparable to the contracts of other insurance companies in that (i) current charge levels are approximately
the same; (ii) all provide minimum death benefit guarantees the same as or lower than Applicants' Contract: (iii)
all have guaranteed annuity purchase rates; (iv) all have the same special accounting system for separate account
unit value administration; and (v) all are offered in the same market. ITT Hartford undertakes to maintain at its Home
Office available to the Commission upon request a memorandum setting forth in detail the methodology and contracts
of other insurance companies underlying this representation.
(c) There is the likelihood that the proceeds from explicit sales loads will be insufficient to cover the expected
costs of distributing the Contracts. Any shortfall will be covered from the assets of the general account, which may
include profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. Therefore, ITT Hartford has concluded that there is a reasonable
likelihood that the Separate Account's distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Separate Account and
Contract Owners. ITT Hartford undertakes to maintain at its Home Office and make available to the Commission upon
request a memorandum setting forth the basis for this representation; and
(d) The Separate Account will invest only in open-end management companies which have undertaken to have a board of
directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the open-end management company, formulate and approve
any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses.



Applicants' Conclusion



Applicants request exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act so that they may offer and sell
the Contracts subject to the charge for mortality and expense guarantees described above. Applicants submit that,
for all of the reasons stated herein, the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) meet the standards
set out in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.

<DOCTITLE>Thomson Fund Group et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



August 9, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'' or the ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for an order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS:

 Thomson Fund Group (the ``Trust''); Thomson Investors Services Inc. (the ``Distributor''); Thomson Advisory Group
L.P. (the ``Manager''); any future registered open-end investment company whose principal underwriter is the Distributor
or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Distributor or whose investment adviser
is the Manager or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Manager; and any other registered
open-end investment company whose investment adviser is a successor-in-interest to the Manager if such successor-in-interest
is created as part of a restructuring of the Manager because of the lapse of the grandfather provision of the Internal
Revenue Code (currently expiring on January 1, 1998) allowing the Manager to be taxed as a partnership.




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act for an order exempting applicants from sections 18(f)(1),
18(g), 18(i), 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applicants seek an order permitting the Trust to issue an unlimited number of classes of each of its now existing or
hereafter created series (``Funds'') and to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a contingent deferred
sales charge (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions of the shares.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the Application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Trust is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust.
It currently offers for sale to investors shares of eleven separate series representing interests in eleven corresponding
Funds. Each Fund has its own investment objective and policies. The Distributor serves as the Trust's principal underwriter
and the Manager serves as the Trust's investment adviser.

2. The Trust currently is permitted to offer two classes of shares for each of its Funds under an alternative purchase
plan pursuant to a prior order
 and to impose a contingent deferred sales load on one of its classes of shares and to waive the contingent deferred sales
load in connection with certain redemptions pursuant to prior exemptive orders (the ``Prior CDSC Orders'').

3. Applicants seek an order, which will supersede the prior orders, to allow the Trust to issue and sell an unlimited
number of classes of shares of each of its Funds pursuant to an alternative purchase plan (the ``Alternative Purchase
Plan''). Existing classes now will be sold under the Alternative Purchase Plan in reliance upon any order issued on
this application. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and
be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same
Fund will relate solely to: (a) the impact of any rule 12b-1 plan payments (which may include servicing fees or
distribution fees, or both) or non-rule 12b-1 shareholder servicing plan (``Shareholder Servicing Plan'')
payments made by a class and any other expenses that may be imposed upon a particular class of shares and which are limited
to (i) transfer agency fees attributable to a specific class of shares, (ii) printing and postage expenses related
to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders
of a specific class, (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) Commission registration
fees incurred by a class of shares, (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support
the shareholders of a specific class, (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares,
(viii) Trustees' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares, and (viii) any other incremental
expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the Commission
pursuant to an amended order (all of the foregoing expenses are collectively referred to herein as ``Class Expenses'');
(b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b-1 plans, except as provided
in condition 16; (c) the different exchange privileges of the various classes of shares as may be described from time
to time in any prospectus of the Trust; (d) the fact that only certain classes will have a conversion feature; and (e)
the designation of each class of shares of a Fund.

4. Under the Alternative Purchase Plan, shares of different classes would be sold under different sales arrangements
including, for example, sales at net asset value, subject to a front-end sales charge, or subject to a CDSC. Different
classes of shares could be subject to different rule 12b-1 plans. For any class, the sum of any initial sales charges,
asset-based sales charges, and CDSCs will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided for in Article III, Section
26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers.

5. The Trustees of the Trust may determine that any of the Class Expenses listed above are to be borne by the class to which
they are attributable. The Manager and/or the Distributor may choose to reimburse or agree not to impose Class Expenses
on certain classes on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount of Class Expenses reimbursed or not imposed by the Manager
and/or the Distributor may vary from class to class. Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and
obviously expected to vary from one class to another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent
with shareholder expectations to reimburse or agree not to impose Class Expenses at different levels for different
classes of the same Fund or series.

6. In addition, the Manager and/or Distributor may waive or reimburse expenses attributable to a particular Fund
(``Fund Expenses'') (with or without a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses for such Fund) but only if the same
proportionate amount of Fund Expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class of that Fund. Thus, any Fund expenses
that are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of a Fund based on the relative net assets of the classes.
The amount of Fund Expenses reimbursed or not imposed by the Manager and/or the Distributor may vary from Fund to Fund,
however. Fund expenses apply equally to all classes of a Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse
Fund expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund. Fund expenses will be allocated among the
classes of a Fund on the basis of the relative net assets of each class of that Fund. The income of a Fund will be allocated
among the classes of that Fund on the basis of the relative net assets of such class.

7. Under the Alternative Purchase Plan, any class may be given exchange privileges. Shares of such a class generally
will be permitted to be exchanged only for shares of a class with similar characteristics in another Fund. All such
exchanges will be allowed only between funds that are within the same ``group of investment companies'' as that term
is defined in rule 11a-3 under the Act. At the discretion of the Trustees, exchanges may also be permitted among dissimilar
classes. All permitted exchanges will comply with the provisions of rule 11a-3.

8. Any class of shares may offer a conversion feature. A conversion feature will automatically convert shares of one
class (``Purchase Class'') to shares of another class with different features (``Target Class'') after the expiration
of a specified period, subject to terms fully disclosed in the Fund's then-current prospectus. For purposes of the
conversion, all Purchase Class shares in a shareholder's account that were acquired through the reinvestment of
dividends and other distributions paid in respect of such shares (and which had not yet converted) will be considered
to be held in a separate sub-account (``Dividend Purchase Shares''). Each time any Purchase Class shares in the shareholder's
account convert, an equal portion of Dividend Purchase Shares then in the sub-account will also convert and will no
longer be considered held in the sub-account. The portion will be determined by the ratio that the shareholder's converting
Purchase Class shares bears to the shareholder's total Purchase Class shares, subject to the conversion feature,
but excluding Dividend Purchase Shares. Any conversion will be subject to the continuing availability of an opinion
of counsel or a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the conversion does not constitute
a taxable event under federal income tax law. Conversions might be suspended if such an opinion or ruling were no longer
available.

9. Any Fund or class may be subject to a Shareholder Servicing Plan whereby the Trust may enter into agreements on behalf
of a Fund with certain financial institutions, securities dealers, and other industry professionals providing
for the performance of services such as answering client inquiries, servicing client accounts, and other services
to existing shareholders.

10. Under the Alternative Purchase Plan, applicants expect to offer at least four classes of shares: Class A shares;
Class B shares; Class C shares; and Class Y shares. The Funds may create additional classes of shares, which will differ
only with respect to attributes described above. No Fund, however, will be required to offer all or any number of the
classes.

11. Class A shares are offered at net asset value plus a front-end sales load, and are assessed an ongoing service fee
under a servicing plan adopted by the Trust pursuant to rule 12b-1. Certain Class A shares that are offered without
a front-end sales load to certain classes of purchases may be subject to a 1% CDSC if such shares are redeemed within
eighteen months of purchase.

12. Class B shares will be offered at net asset value per share without the imposition of a sales load at the time of purchase.
Pursuant to a distribution and servicing plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b-1, the Trust would pay to the Distributor
with respect to each Fund a service fee of up to 0.25% per annum and a distribution fee of up to 0.75% per annum of the average
daily net asset value of that Fund's Class B shares. In addition, an investor's proceeds from a redemption of Class
B shares made within five years of his or her purchase may be subject to a CDSC which is paid to the Distributor. The rate
of the CDSC is expected to be approximately 5% on shares redeemed in the first year after purchase, 4% on shares redeemed
in the second year, 3% on shares redeemed in the third year, and 2% on shares redeemed in the fourth and fifth years. Class
B shares may also be subject to a conversion feature whereby such shares automatically would convert to Class A shares
after a specified number of years from the date the Class B shares were purchased.

13. Class A shares are offered at net asset value and will be identical in all respects to the Class B shares except that
the Class C shares will be subject to a lower CDSC and will never convert to Class A shares. The Class C shares are designed
as a so-called ``level load'' series. The Class C shares will be subject to a 1% CDSC if the shares are redeemed within
one year of purchase.






14. The Trust may also offer Class Y shares, which will not be subject to any servicing fees under any rule 12b-1 plan,
will not be subject to any front-end sales load or CDSC, and may bear lower transfer agency fees and other operating
expenses than some other classes. The Class Y may be designated as a class of shares (``Institutional Shares'') which
will be offered only to ``Institutional Investors''.
 Only Institutional Investors will be eligible to purchase any class of Institutional Shares, if created. All other
investors will be permitted to purchase only non-institutional classes of shares. No Institutional Investor that
is eligible to purchase any class of Institutional Shares, if any, will be permitted to invest in any class of non-institutional
shares. Accordingly, there will be no overlap between the investors eligible to purchase any class of Institutional
Shares and investors eligible to purchase any class of non-institutional shares.

15. Applicants seek an order of the Commission to allow the Trust to impose a CDSC on any appropriate class of shares
subject to the terms and in the circumstances appropriate to that class and to waive such a CDSC in certain circumstances.
Under the proposed CDSC arrangement, some or all shares of certain classes of a Fund may be subject to a CDSC if such shares
are redeemed or repurchased within a prescribed period of time after their purchase. No CDSC will be imposed with respect
to: (a) The portion of redemption or repurchase proceeds attributable to increases in the value of the shares due to
capital appreciation; (b) shares acquired through the reinvestment of income dividends or capital gain distributions;
or (c) shares held for more than a certain time after their purchase. Any CDSC would be imposed on the lesser of (a) the
net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase, and (b) the net asset value of the shares at the time of repurchase
or redemption. In determining whether a CDSC will be payable, it will be assumed that shares, or amounts representing
shares, that are not subject to a CDSC are redeemed or repurchased first and for other shares it will be assumed that
a redemption is made of shares held by the investor for the longest period of time. This will result in any such charge
being imposed on the fewest number of shares and at the lowest possible rate. The amount of the CDSC and the circumstances
and timing of its imposition may vary among classes and may be changed with respect to any class. Any change in the terms
of a CDSC will be reflected in the affected shares' prospectus. In addition, any such change will not affect the shares
that have already been issued unless such change would result in terms more favorable to the holders of such shares,
in which case the change may, but need not, apply to already-issued shares. No CDSC will be imposed on any shares purchased
prior to the effective date of the order requested by this application, except as permitted under the Prior CDSC Orders.
 
16. Applicants propose to vary or waive the CDSC in connection with certain categories of transactions. The conditions
in paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d-1 will be satisfied with respect to any category of transaction for
which a CDSC is waived.
 
17. If the Funds waive or reduce a CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be applied uniformly to all shares in the specified
category. If a Fund which has been waiving or reducing a CDSC determines not to waive or reduce such CDSC any longer,
the disclosure in the Fund's prospectus will be appropriately revised. Any such change will not affect shares that
have already been issued. A CDSC imposed on any given class of shares may be waived in all or any number of the circumstances
listed above and the waivers applicable to the CDSC on one class may differ from the waivers applicable to another class.
 


Applicants' Legal Analysis
 


1. Applicants seek exemption from (a) sections 18(f)(1) and 18(g) of the Act to the extent that the issuance and sales
of multiple classes of shares may result in a ``senior security'' prohibited by section 18(f) and (b) section 18(i)
of the Act to the extent that the different voting rights associated with such classes may be deemed to result in one
or more classes of shares having unequal voting rights with other classes of shares. In addition, applicants request
an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 thererunder to the
extent necessary to permit the proposed CDSC arrangement.
 
2. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and would not discriminate
against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement will not involve borrowing and will not affect the Funds'
existing assets or reserves; it also will not increase the speculative character of the shares in a Fund, since all
shares will participate 

pro rata 

in all of the Fund's income and all of the Fund's expenses (with the exception of the Class Expenses).
 
3. Under the Alternative Purchase Plan, mutuality of risk will be preserved with respect to all classes of shares in
a Fund, as the classes will represent interests in a single pool of assets presenting the same investment risk to all
shareholders of the Fund, regardless of class. Further, since all classes of shares will be redeemable at all times,
no class of shares will have any preference or priority over the other class of shares of the particular Fund in the usual
sense (that is, no class will have a distribution or liquidation preference with respect to particular assets of a
Fund and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account).



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that the order granting the requested exemptions will be subject to the following conditions:

1. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act (Investment Company Act Release
No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

2. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely
to: (a) the impact of any rule 12b-1 plan payments (which may include servicing fees or distribution fees, or
both) or Shareholder Servicing Plan payments made by a class and any other expenses that may be imposed upon a particular
class of shares and which are limited to (i) transfer agency fees attributable to a specific class of shares, (ii) printing
and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses
and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class, (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares,
(iv) Commission registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and
services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating
solely to one class of shares, (vii) Trustees' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares, and
(viii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which
shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately
with respect to a Fund's rule 12b-1 plans, except as provided in condition 16 below; (c) the different exchange
privileges of the various classes of shares as may be described from time to time in any prospectus of the Trust; (d)
the fact that only certain classes will have a conversion feature; and (e) the designation of each class of shares of
a Fund.

3. The Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall have approved each Alternative
Purchase Plan prior to its implementation by any Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees regarding the deliberations
of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement each Alternative Purchase Plan will reflect
in detail the reasons for determining that the Alternative Purchase Plan is in the best interests of the relevant Fund
and its shareholders.

4. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and
any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Trustees, including a majority of the
independent Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of the monies paid or payable
by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Trustees of the Trust, and such Trustees shall review, at least
quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. 

5. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees of the Trust, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares.
The Trustee, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Manager and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Manager and the Distributor at their
own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.


6. The Trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and servicing expenditures
complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements,
only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a class of shares will be used to support any distribution
or servicing fee charged to shareholders of such class of shares. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing
of a specific class of shares will not be presented to the Trustees to support any fee attributable to that class. The
statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the
independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 

7. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that payments made under the
rule 12b-1 plan or Shareholder Servicing Plan relating to a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively
by such class and except that any Class Expenses will be borne by the applicable class of shares. 

8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among such classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Independent
Examiner'') who has rendered a report to the applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology
and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner.
On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, will monitor
the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least
annually a report to the Trust that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Independent
Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1)
of the Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect to such reports, following request by the Trust
which the Trust agrees to make, will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request for
such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate
Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators
or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Independent Examiner is a ``report on the policies
and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed
in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in the Statement on Auditing Standards
No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar
auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 

9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of
expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Independent Examiner
in the initial report referred to in condition (8) above and will be concurred with by the Independent Examiner, or
an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred
to in condition (8) above. Applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Independent Examiner does
not so concur in the ongoing reports. 

10. The prospectus of the Trust that implements each revised Alternative Purchase Plan will include a statement to
the effect that any person entitled to receive compensation for selling shares of a Fund of the Trust may receive different
levels of compensation for selling or servicing one particular class of shares over another of such Fund.

11. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold
to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to these
standards. Such compliance standards will require that all investors eligible to purchase shares of any class of
Institutional Shares be sold only shares of a class of Institutional Shares, rather than any other class of shares
offered by a Fund.
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees
of the Trust with respect to the Alternative Purchase Plan will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to
the Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees.
13. The Funds will disclose their respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services,
fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares, other than a
class of Institutional Shares, in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through
each prospectus. If the Trust offers a class of Institutional Shares, it may offer such shares solely pursuant to a
separate prospectus. Any prospectus for Institutional Shares will disclose the existence of the Fund's other classes,
and the prospectus for the Fund's other classes will disclose the existence of Institutional Shares, if any, and will
identify the persons eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. The Funds will disclose their respective expenses
and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will
contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund
as a whole generally and not on a per class basis, whereas each Fund's per share data will be prepared on a per class basis
with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the
expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or
performance data applicable to all classes of shares, except Institutional Shares, if any. Advertising materials
reflecting the expenses or performance data for Institutional Shares will be available only to those persons eligible
to purchase Institutional Shares. Information provided by the Applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar
listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present each class of shares, except Institutional
Shares, separately.
14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to rule
12b-1 plans or Shareholder Servicing Plans in reliance on the exemptive order.
15. If any class of shares is created with a conversion feature, such class (``Purchase Class'') will convert into
another class of shares (``Target Class'') on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without
the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to maximum
asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules
of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the maximum asset-based sales charge and service fee
which they were subject prior to the conversion.

16. If a Fund implements any amendment to any of its 12b-1 Plans (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment to a Shareholder Servicing Plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by Target
Class shares subject to the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares unless
the holders of the Purchase Class shares, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees of the Trust
shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into
a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class shares as they existed
prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target
Class shares. If deemed advisable by the Trustees of the Trust to implement the foregoing, such action may include
the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing
Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target
Class shares. New Target Class shares or New Purchase Class shares may be formed without further exemptive relief.
Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Trustees of the Trust reasonably
believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 5 above, any additional cost associated
with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class shares or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely
by the Manager and the Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert
into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target
Class shares plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration
statement.

17. The Shareholder Servicing Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule
12b-1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders
need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

<DOCTITLE>Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company, et al.</DOCTITLE>



August 9, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for an Order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company (``Transamerica''), First Transamerica Life Insurance Company
(``First Transamerica''), Separate Account VA-2NL of Transamerica Occidental (``Separate Account VA-2NL''),
Separate Account VA-2L of Transamerica Occidental (``Separate Account VA-2L''), Separate Account
VA-2NLNY of First Transamerica (``Separate Account VA-2NLNY''), Separate Account VA-2LNY of
First Transamerica (``Separate Account VA-2LNY'') (collectively, ``Separate Accounts''), and Transamerica
Insurance Securities Sales Corporation (``TISSC''), (collectively, ``Applicants'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2)(C)
and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: Applicants seek to amend an order under Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
(``Act'') exempting Applicants from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the Act to the extent
necessary to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate Accounts in
connection with the issuance and sale of certain variable annuity contracts (``Contracts''). Applicants propose
that TISSC replace Dreyfus Service Corporation as principal underwriter for the Contracts, and that the amended
order extend to TISSC, and to any National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. member broker-dealer that may
in the future serve as principal underwriter for the Contracts, the same exemptions currently granted to Dreyfus.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations




1. Transamerica and First Transamerica are each a stock life insurance company. First Transamerica is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Transamerica, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transamerica Insurance Corporation of California
(``Transamerica-California''). Transamerica-California is, in turn, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transamerica
Corporation. Transamerica and First Transamerica are each principally engaged in offering life insurance and annuity
contracts. Transamerica is licensed in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, certain provinces of Canada,
the District of Columbia, and in all states except New York. First Transamerica is licensed to sell insurance and annuities
in New York and New Mexico.

2. Separate Accounts VA-2L and VA-2NL are separate accounts established by Transamerica. Separate Accounts
VA-2LNY and VA-2NLNY are separate accounts established by First Transamerica. The Separate Accounts
have been registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts.

3. TISSC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transamerica-California, is registered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

4. By orders of the Commission,
 Applicants, other than TISSC, and Dreyfus Service Corporation (``Dreyfus''), the primary principal underwriter
of the Contacts, were granted exemptive relief under Section (6)(c) of the 1940 Act from the provisions of Sections
26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of mortality and expense risk charges from the
assets of the Separate Accounts in connection with the issuance of the Contracts. Dreyfus is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Dreyfus Corporation.





5. Applicants represent that Dreyfus Corporation will soon be acquired by Mellon Bank. As a result of the proposed
acquisition, Dreyfus will become a bank affiliate and, consequently, cannot continue to serve in the capacity of
principal underwriter of the Contracts issued through the Separate Accounts because bank affiliates may not act
as principal underwriters of investment company securities. Accordingly, Applicants intend that TISSC replace
Dreyfus as principal underwriter of the Contracts.

6. Applicants request that the Commission amend the Commission Orders to extend to TISSC, as well as to any NASD member
broker-dealer that may in the future serve as principal underwriter for the Contracts (``Future Underwriters''),
the same exemptions granted Dreyfus under the Commission Orders.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants represent that all of the facts asserted and representations made in the applications for the Commission
Orders remain true and accurate. Applicants specifically incorporate such acts and representations by reference
to such prior applications and, further, represent that they each will comply with the conditions set forth in such
applications in connection with the exemptions requested.

2. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order under Section 6(c) of the Act amending the Commission Orders
to exempt TISSC as well as any Future Underwriters from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) to the extent
necessary to permit the deduction of mortality and expense risk charges from the assets of the Separate Accounts as
provided for in the Contracts. 



Conclusion



For the reasons set forth above in the applications requesting the foregoing orders, Applicants represent that the
exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of
investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations


1. Applicant, a Massachusetts trust, is an open-end management investment company. On October 3, 1989, applicant
filed a notification of registration under section 8(a) and a registration statement on Form N-1A under section
8(b). Applicant registered the following portfolios under the Securities Act of 1933: Yankee U.S. Government Income
Fund A; Yankee U.S. Government Income Fund B; Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund A; Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund B; Yankee
Equity Fund; Yankee Equity Income Fund; and Yankee Funds (the ``Yankee Money Market Fund''). 
2. Applicant's portfolios were organized as feeder funds in a master/feeder arrangement with seven registered management
investment companies (the ``Master Funds''). In early 1993, the investment adviser to the Master Funds recommended
to the boards of trustees of applicant and the Master Funds that the non-money market portfolios of applicant and the
corresponding Master Funds be reorganized into the Galaxy Fund and that the Yankee Money Market Fund be liquidated.

3. On February 22, 1993, the boards of trustees of applicant and the Master Funds approved the plan of reorganization.
A combined proxy statement and prospectus was sent to applicant's non-money market fund shareholders on April 11,
1993. Definitive copies of such materials were filed with the SEC as part of The Galaxy Fund's registration on April
23, 1993. A majority of applicant's shareholders, excluding the shareholders of the Yankee Money Market Fund, approved
the reorganization at a meeting held on May 6, 1993, and applicant, as holder of a majority of the units of beneficial
interest of the Master Funds, approved the reorganization by written consent dated May 6, 1993.
4. On May 7, 1993, applicant transferred all of the assets and liabilities of: (a) Yankee U.S. Government Income Fund
A and Yankee U.S. Government Income Fund B to Galaxy Intermediate Bond Fund; (b) Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund and
Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund B to Galaxy Tax-Exempt Bond Fund; and (c) Yankee Equity Fund and Yankee Equity Income
Fund to Galaxy Equity Growth Fund (Galaxy Intermediate Bond Fund, Galaxy Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, and Galaxy Equity
Growth Fund together, the ``Acquiring Funds'') in exchange for shares of the respective Acquiring Funds. Thereafter,
applicant distributed the appropriate Acquiring Fund shares to its shareholders. Applicant's shareholders received
shares of the Acquiring Funds with an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their respective
interests in applicant. 
5. On or before May 10, 1993, the three holders of beneficial interest in the Yankee Money Market Fund gave notice that
they wanted to redeem their entire holdings. The corresponding Master Fund's investment portfolio consisted entirely
of short-term investments all maturing on May 10, 1993. On May 10, 1993, a complete redemption totaling $65,585,130
was paid by applicant to its shareholders on a 

pro rata 

basis. 
6. In connection with the reorganization, applicant incurred expenses such as professional fees, custody and administration
fees and expenses totaling $164,666. These expenses were allocated to applicant's non-money market portfolios
based on the relative net assets of such portfolios and paid by applicant. In connection with the liquidation, applicant
incurred expenses such as professional fees, custody and administration fees and expenses totaling $13,401. These
expenses were allocated to the Yankee Money Market Fund and paid by applicant.
7. Applicant has no outstanding debts or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative
proceeding. Applicant has no shareholders and is not engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities
other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs.

Differential Global Positioning System, St. Marys River/Lake Huron Corridor Region; Environmental Assessment


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard has prepared a Programmatic Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
for implementing a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) Service in the St. Marys River/Lake Huron Corridor
Region of the United States. The EA concluded that there will be no significant impact on the environment and that preparation
of an Environmental Impact Statement will not be necessary. This notice announces the availability of the EA and FONSI
and solicits comments on them.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request for Comments


Copies of the Programmatic Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) are available
as described under ADDRESSES

. The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to comment on these documents. The Coast Guard may revise these documents
in view of the comments. If revisions are warranted, availability of the revised documents will be announced by a later
notice in the 

Federal Register

.


Background


As required by Congress, the Coast Guard is preparing to install the equipment necessary to implement a Differential
Global Positioning System (DGPS) service in the St. Marys River/Lake Huron Corridor area of the United States. DGPS
is a new radionavigation service that improves upon the 100 meter accuracy of the existing Global Positioning System
(GPS) to provide an accuracy of better than 10 meters. For vessels, this degree of accuracy is critical for precise
electronic navigation in harbors and harbor approaches and will reduce the number of vessel groundings, collisions,
personal injuries, fatalities, and potential hazardous cargo spills resulting from such incidents.
After extensive study, the Coast Guard has selected five sties along the St. Marys River/Lake Huron Corridor for the
DGPS equipment. The sites are in the vicinity of Detroit, MI: Saginaw Bay, MI; Cheboygan, MI; Neebish Island, MI; and
Whitefish Point, MI. The sites are used already for related purposes and were chosen, in part, because their proposed
use is consistent with their past and present use, thus minimizing further impact on the environment. DGPS signal
transmissions will be broadcast in the marine radiobeacon frequency band (283.5 to 325 KHz) using less than 50 watts
(effective radiated power). Signal transmissions at these low frequency and power levels have not been found to be
harmful to the surrounding environment.


Proposed Installations at Each Site


(a) Radiobeacon Antenna_The Coast Guard proposes to install a 90 foot guyed antenna with an accompanying ground plane
except at Whitefish Point where the existing whip antenna will be used. A ground plane for these antenna's consists
of approximately 120 copper radials (6 guage copper wire) installed 6 inches (or less) beneath the soil and projecting
outward from the antenna base. The optimum radial length is between 200-300 feet, but this length may be shortened
to fit within property boundaries.
Wherever possible, a cable plow method will be used in the radial installation to minimize soil disturbance. Installation
of the ground plane may require some clearing of trees and bushes on the site.
(b) DGPS Antennas_Each site will require two 10 foot masts to support four small (4 inches by 18 inches diameter) receiving
antennas. The masts will be installed on a concrete foundation measuring approximately 3 feet by 3 feet by 15 inches.
These masts are needed to support the primary and backup reference receivers and integrity monitors. The location
of the two masts will be in the vicinity of the electronic equipment building or hut, but at least 50 feet to 100 feet from
existing structures.
(c) Equipment shelter_A 10 foot by 16 foot equipment hut will be needed to house the DGPS equipment at each site except
at Whitefish Point, where the existing equipment building will be used.
(d) Utilities_The Coast Guard proposes to use available commercial power as the primary source for the electronic
equipment. However, an existing diesel generator is available at the Whitefish Point site and may be utilized if backup
power is needed. A telephone line will be required at each site for remote monitoring and operation.


Description of Each Site


The Detroit, MI site is located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers boat yard property, which is located adjacent to Fort
Wayne. The site will require installation of a 90 foot guyed transmit antenna. In addition, a 10 foot by 16 foot equipment
hut will be installed to house the DGPS electronic equipment.
The Saginaw Bay, MI site is located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers field office property, which is located near Essexville,
MI. The site will require installation of a 90 foot guyed transmit antenna and a 10 foot by 16 foot equipment hut to house
the DGPS electronic equipment.
The Cheboygan, MI site is located on U.S. Coast Guard property in the city of Cheboygan, MI near the intersection of
Western Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. The site will require installation of a 90 foot guyed transmit antenna and a 10 foot
by 16 foot equipment hut to house the DGPS electronic equipment.
The Neebish Island, MI site is located on the north end of the island, at the Neebish Cell Dock, and within U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers property. The site will require installation of a 60 foot guyed antenna and a 10 foot by 16 foot equipment
hut to house the DGPS electronic equipment.
The Whitefish Point Light Station, MI site is located on the upper peninsula approximately 35 miles northeast of Sault
Ste Marie. The existing radiobeacon has already been partially upgraded and is transmitting prototype DGPS signals
for test and evaluation purposes. The existing radiobeacon transmit antenna will be used and the DGPS equipment will
be housed in the existing equipment hut. The light is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Coast
Guard and MI State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) agree that the proposed project will have no effect on the
historic property.
Implementation of a DGPS service in the St. Marys River/Lake Huron Corridor Region is determined to have no significant
effect on the quality of the human environment or require preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement.
