Importation of Fuji Variety Apples From Japan and the Republic of Korea 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the Fruits and Vegetables regulations to allow the importation of Fuji variety apples from Japan and
the Republic of Korea. As a condition of entry, the Fuji variety apples have to be cold treated and fumigated for certain
injurious insects in Japan or the Republic of Korea under the supervision of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service. The Fuji variety apples also have to be inspected by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the
national plant protection agency in Japan or the Republic of Korea prior to export. This action relieves restrictions
on the importation into the United States of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea without presenting
a significant risk of introducing injurious insects into the United States. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



The regulations in 7 CFR 319.56 through 319.56-8 (referred to below as the regulations) prohibit or restrict
the importation into the United States of fruits and vegetables from certain parts of the world to prevent the introduction
and dissemination of injurious insects that are new to or not widely distributed within and throughout the United
States. 

On June 8, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 29557-29559, Docket No. 94-035-1) a document in which we proposed to amend the regulations
to allow Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea to be imported into the United States under certain
conditions. The importation of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea has been prohibited because
of the risk that they could introduce injurious insects into the United States. We proposed to allow importation at
the request of those countries' ministries of agriculture and after determining that the apples could be imported
under certain conditions without significant pest risk. 

We solicited comments on the proposed rule for a 30-day period ending on July 8, 1994. We received two comments by that
date. In one, a foreign ministry of agriculture supported the proposal. 

In the other, a State department of agriculture expressed concerns regarding the possible spread into the United
States of three fungal diseases (

Diplocarpon mali, Monilinia mali,

 and 

Alternaria mali

) known to affect apples in Japan and the Pacific rim. Two of the diseases are exotic to the United States and the other
is known to occur only in the Southeastern United States. The commenter recommends that we conduct pest risk assessments
for the three diseases in order to determine if mitigation measures are necessary. 

Prior to proposing to allow Fuji variety apples to be imported from Japan and the Republic of Korea, we assessed the
risk of exotic pests being introduced into the United States on the apples. Based on this assessment, we believe that
the risk of the three fungal diseases spreading into the United States will be mitigated by numerous factors. For instance,
these three fungal diseases are primarily leaf pathogens and seldom infect fruit, unless inoculum pressures are
high. Furthermore, the routine cultural practices for Fuji variety apple production in Japan and the Republic of
Korea, such as orchard sanitation and the bagging of fruit, effectively suppress outbreaks of these diseases. Finally,
we believe that the required inspections of the fruit following treatment in Japan or the Republic of Korea will allow
us to easily identify fruit infected with any of the three fungal diseases and prevent its entry into the United States.


Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule without change. 



Effective Date 



This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected
by restrictions we no longer find warranted. Making this rule effective immediately will allow interested producers
and others in the marketing chain to benefit from this additional source of fruit. Therefore, the Administrator of
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should be effective upon publication
in the 

Federal Register

.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes
of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 

We are amending the Fruits and Vegetables regulations by allowing the importation of Fuji variety apples from Japan
and the Republic of Korea. 

According to an estimate by the International Apple Institute, U.S. growers produced approximately 160 million
pounds of Fuji apples in 1993, about 1.5 percent of the total U.S. apple production for that year. It is likely that this
estimate understates the amount of Fuji apples produced domestically, as Fuji acreage in California, Washington,
and other States is expanding rapidly. 

About 75 percent of the Fuji variety apples grown in the United States are grown in California and Washington. In 1993,
growers in California and Washington produced about 60 million pounds per State, while growers in other States produced
a total of about 40 million pounds. Statistics on the number of domestic growers of Fuji apples and their sizes are not
available. 

Most of the domestic production of Fuji apples is exported because demand, and consequently the price, for Fuji apples
is quite low in the United States as compared to other countries, particularly in the Pacific Rim. Prices of $30 to $50
per 40-pound box (depending upon quality) are common in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim markets. Domestic
buyers, however, have been paying less than half that price. 

Growers in the Republic of Korea produce annually about 923 million pounds of Fuji variety apples. APHIS estimates
that about 220,000 to 440,000 pounds of Fuji variety apples might be exported per year from the Republic of Korea to
the United States. This estimate assumes the Republic of Korea's exports to the United States will approach levels
currently exported to European countries. 

Japanese growers produce annually about 1.18 billion pounds of Fuji variety apples, just over half of Japan's total
annual apple production. APHIS estimates that exports to the United States of all varieties of Japanese apples would
probably never exceed 2.2 million pounds. 

It is unlikely that imports of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea will reach the estimated levels
above, due to the low demand and low price for Fuji variety apples in the United States. However, even if imports were
to reach 2.6 million pounds (2.2 million pounds from Japan and 440,000 pounds from the Republic of Korea), this would
constitute less than 1.4 percent of domestic production of Fuji variety apples. Consequently, allowing Fuji variety
apples to be imported from Japan and the Republic of Korea will not have a significant economic impact on domestic Fuji
variety apple producers or other small entities. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12778 



This rule allows Fuji variety apples to be imported into the United States from Japan and the Republic of Korea under
certain conditions. State and local laws and regulations regarding Fuji variety apples imported under this rule
will be preempted while the fruit is in foreign commerce. Fresh apples are generally imported for immediate distribution
and sale to the consuming public, and will remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question
of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. No retroactive effect will
be given to this rule; and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court
challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this final rule will be submitted for approval
to the Office of Management and Budget.

Administrative instructions governing the entry of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea. 



Fuji variety apples may be imported into the United States from Japan and the Republic of Korea only under the following
conditions: 

(a) 

Treatment and fumigation. 

The apples must be cold treated and then fumigated, under the supervision of an Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) inspector, either in Japan or the Republic of Korea, for the peach fruit moth (

Carposina niponensis

), the yellow peach moth (

Conogethes punctiferalis

), the fruit tree spider mite (

Tetranychus viennensis

), and the kanzawa mite (

T. kanzawai

), in accordance with the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual, which is incorporated by reference at
 300.1 of this chapter. 

(b) 

APHIS inspection. 

The apples must be inspected upon completion of the treatments required by paragraph (a) of this section, prior to
export from Japan or the Republic of Korea, by an APHIS inspector and an inspector from the national plant protection
agency of Japan or the Republic of Korea. The apples shall be subject to further disinfection in the exporting country
if plant pests are found prior to export. Imported Fuji variety apples inspected in Japan or the Republic of Korea are
also subject to inspection and disinfection at the port of first arrival, as provided in  319.56-6. 

(c) 

Trust fund agreements. 

The national plant protection agency of the exporting country must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS before
APHIS will provide the services necessary for Fuji variety apples to be imported into the United States from Japan
or the Republic of Korea. The agreement requires the national plant protection agency to pay in advance of each shipping
season all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur in providing services in Japan or the Republic of Korea during that
shipping season. These costs include administrative expenses and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal
share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred
by APHIS in performing these services. The agreement requires the national plant protection agency to deposit a certified
or cashiers check with APHIS for the amount of these costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to
meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement further requires the national plant protection agency to deposit
with APHIS a certified or cashiers check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before APHIS
will provide any more services necessary for Fuji variety apples to be imported into the United States from that country.
After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds will be returned to the national
plant protection agency, or held on account until needed, at that agency's option. 

(d) 

Department not responsible for damage. 

The treatments prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section are judged from experimental tests to be safe for use with
Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea. However, the Department assumes no responsibility for any
damage sustained through or in the course of such treatment or by compliance with requirements under paragraph (a)
or (b) of this section.

Badges for Persons Authorized to Conduct Federal Poultry Inspection 


<AGENCY>

 Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the poultry products inspection regulations to require
the use of numbered official badges to identify persons authorized to conduct Federal inspection under the Poultry
Products Inspection Act. Such persons may be our employees or employees of other Federal agencies or State agencies
working under agreements with us. The amendment confirms our current practice of issuing badges to such persons and
removes an inconsistency between the meat and the poultry products inspection regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA_21 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA_21 U.S.C. 451 

et seq.

), the Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for carrying out inspection programs for assuring that meat, meat
food, and poultry products prepared for distribution in commerce are safe, not adulterated, and properly marked,
labeled, and packaged. The Secretary is required to staff the programs with persons appointed for the purpose of conducting
ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection of livestock and poultry; inspection of facilities, equipment, and sanitation
at official establishments; and inspection of further processing of meat and poultry. Under regulations implementing
the FMIA and PPIA, persons authorized to conduct inspection in meat and poultry slaughtering and further processing
establishments are provided with appropriate identification. 
The Federal meat inspection regulations have long required the use of a numbered official badge to identify each Federal
meat inspector who is entitled to enter the premises of official establishments to conduct inspection. Since the
merger of the meat and poultry inspection programs in the early 1970's, the badge has also been used to identify poultry
inspectors carrying out mandatory inspection under the PPIA. 
The poultry products inspection regulations currently require that inspectors have with them at all times the ``means
of identification'' furnished to them by the Department. The regulations have also required that ``licenses'' be
issued to persons carrying out Federal poultry inspection under agreements with State or other agencies. These requirements
originated in the era when the inspection of poultry for condition and wholesomeness was one of the Department's voluntary
inspection and certification programs. 
USDA administered voluntary poultry inspection in cooperation with State and other agencies, with poultry processing
establishments paying fees for the service. For much of this work, the Department entered into cooperative agreements
with State agencies whose USDA-licensed personnel operated under USDA supervision. 
After the PPIA was enacted and Federal inspection of poultry products prepared for distribution in commerce became
mandatory, the need for cooperative agreements was reduced. Even so, the mandatory poultry products inspection
regulations that were promulgated in February 1958 (23 FR 731) to implement the PPIA carried over from the earlier
regulations provisions allowing the Secretary to authorize ``licensed'' Federal or State employees to conduct
Federal poultry inspection. Such authorized State personnel have performed Federal inspection according to Federal-State
agreements concluded under the Talmadge-Aiken Act of 1962 (7 U.S.C. 450). 
Before the meat and poultry inspection programs were merged, poultry inspectors who were USDA employees used Department
identification cards as their means of identification. Employees of cooperating Federal or State agencies who were
authorized to conduct Federal poultry inspection were issued license cards. The license cards for the State employees
thus served the same purpose as USDA identification cards of Federal poultry inspectors and the badges of Federal
meat inspectors. 
In May 1972, FSIS amended the poultry products inspection regulations to implement the Wholesome Poultry Products
Act of 1968. The amendments reflected the organizational merger of poultry and meat inspection. Since that time,
poultry inspection has been administered in the same way as meat inspection. The same method of credentialling_the
badge_is used for both meat and poultry inspectors; State employees performing Federal inspection under ``Talmadge-Aiken''
agreements also are issued Federal inspection badges. 


The Final Rule 


Therefore, the Agency is removing and reserving section 381.30 of the poultry products inspection regulations to
delete the requirement for issuance of a license to non-USDA employees who are authorized to conduct Federal poultry
inspection. Section 381.31, which governs conditions for expiration, suspension, and revocation of licenses,
is also being deleted. The suspension and revocation provisions of this section have not been invoked since the merger
of the meat and poultry inspection programs. The qualifications and conditions of service of non-USDA employees
who are authorized to conduct Federal poultry inspection are contained in the agreements between FSIS and cooperating
agencies. Finally, the Agency is revising section 381.33, concerning identification of inspectors, to require
the use of the numbered official inspection badge for such identification. 


Executive Order 12866 


This rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 


Executive Order 12778 


This final rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) preempts
all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3)
does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 


Effect on Small Entities 


The Acting Administrator, FSIS, has determined that this action will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). 


Administrative Procedure Act 


Because this amendment is an amendment of Agency procedure, with nugatory public impact, this rulemaking is exempted
under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA_5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A)) from the requirement for notice and opportunity
for public comment. Similarly, because this amendment concerns only Agency procedure and is without measurable
public impact, this rulemaking is exempt for good cause from the APA requirement that a substantive rule be published
30 days prior to its effective date (5 U.S.C. 553(d)). 


List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 381 


Government employees, Poultry and poultry products.



For the reasons set out in the preamble, 9 CFR part 381 is amended as follows: 


PART 381_MANDATORY POULTRY PRODUCTS INSPECTION 


1. The authority citation for part 381 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 138F; 7 U.S.C. 450; 21 U.S.C. 451-470; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.55.



2. Sections 381.30 and 381.31 are removed and reserved and section 381.33 is revised to read as follows: 


 381.33 

Identification. 


Each inspector will be furnished with a numbered official inspection badge, which shall remain in his or her possession
at all times, and which shall be worn in such manner and at such times as the Administrator may prescribe. This badge
shall be sufficient identification to entitle the inspector to admittance at all regular entrances and to all parts
of the establishment and premises to which the inspector is assigned.

ACTION:

 Final rule; correction. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document corrects a typographical error that appeared in a reference 
to a service bulletin called out in the above-captioned airworthiness directive (AD) that 
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 20, 1994 (59 FR 36932). A typographical 
error in the service bulletin reference resulted in a reference to a service document that 
does not exist. This action is necessary to ensure that certain necessary repairs are 
performed in accordance with appropriate service instructions. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Airworthiness directive (AD) 94-15-02, 
amendment 39-8973, applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 series 
airplanes, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 20, 1994 (59 FR 36932). 
Among other things, that AD requires inspections to verify the installation and tightness of 
the shear pins, shear pin retainers, and shear pin retainer attaching parts in the aft end of 
the center pylon thrust link, and repair, if necessary. 



As published, paragraph (a)(3) of that AD contained a reference to McDonnell 
Douglas MD-11 Alert Service Bulletin A54-31, Revision 1, as a source of service 
information related to accomplishing a repair of the shear pin retainer and attaching parts. 
Due to a typographical error, the issue date of that service bulletin was listed as ``June 3, 
1994,'' rather than the correct date of ``June 3, 1993.'' (This date was cited correctly, 
however, in other portions of the rule that contained references to this same service 
bulletin.) As a result, the service bulletin referenced in paragraph (a)(3) of the published 
AD does not exist. 

Since it is essential that operators perform repairs in accordance with appropriate 
and available service instructions, this document changes the issue date of the service 
bulletin cited in paragraph (a)(3) of AD 94-15-02, amendment 39-8973, to read as: 
``June 3, 1993.'' 

The effective date of the rule remains August 19, 1994. 

Since no other portion of the regulatory information has been changed, the final 
rule is not being republished.

Limited Marketing Activities From a United States Location by Certain Firms and Their Employees or Other Representatives
Exempted Under Commodity Futures Trading Commission Rule 30.10 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Order.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC''), subject to the conditions specified below,
is expanding the category of persons to whom firms operating pursuant to the Limited Marketing Order issued on October
28, 1992 may direct limited marketing conduct with respect to foreign futures or option contracts within the United
States through their employees or other representatives. The relief as originally issued was limited to conduct
directed towards institutions and governmental entities identified in condition 5 of the Limited Marketing Order
whose description in terms of status and assets has been derived generally from the definition of ``qualified eligible
participant'' (``QEP'') as that term is defined in Commission rule 4.7(a)(1)(ii), 17 CFR 4.7(a)(1)(ii). This Order
will expand the relief to conduct directed towards all ``accredited investors'' as that term is defined in the Securities
and Exchange Commission's (``SEC'') Regulation D issued pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On October 28, 1992, the Commission issued an Order under rule 30.10, 17 CFR 30.10, to permit firms that have received
rule 30.10 relief, to engage in limited marketing conduct with respect to foreign futures or option contracts within
the United States through their employees or other representatives. 57 FR 49644 (November 3, 1992). 


Among other conditions,
 the Order provided that such solicitation or marketing activities occurring within the United States be limited
to such activities directed towards certain institutions and governmental entities whose description in terms
of status and assets has been derived generally from the definition of QEP as that term is defined in Commission rule
4.7(a)(1)(ii), 17 CFR 4.7(a)(1)(ii). The Commission noted that the Order was a first step and that absent any problems
that would warrant a reconsideration of the appropriateness of permitting rule 30.10 firms to operate in accordance
with the Order, the Commission may in due course expand the scope of the relief. Upon consideration of the matter, in
particular, that no issues have arisen in connection with the operation of the Limited Marketing Order in the two years
since its issuance, the CFTC is amending condition (5) of the Order issued on October 28, 1992 expanding the relief
to be generally consistent with the term ``accredited investors'' as defined in section 230.501(a) of Securities
Exchange Commission Regulation D promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, 17 CFR 230.501(a), who are not
already included within the scope of current condition (5) of the Limited Marketing Order. 




Accordingly, condition (5) of the Order is amended as follows (new language is italic): 
``(5) Such soliciting or marketing activities occurring within the United States will be limited to such activities
directed to the following persons, acting either for their own account or the account of another entity which is described
below: 
(a) A futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor registered
as such with the Commission;

Amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of State is amending the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120-130) (ITAR)
to reflect that it is no long the policy of the United states to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports
of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in South Africa. The regulations are also amended
to add Rwanda to the list of states for which such a policy of denial is in effect. A new provision is added to indicate
that whenever the United Nations Security Council imposes an arms embargo, all transactions which involve defense
articles and services and which are prohibited by the embargo are prohibited under the ITAR.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Department of State is amending  126.1(a) and striking  126.1(c) of the ITAR to reflect that it is no
longer the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles
and services, destined for or originating in South Africa. With respect to South Africa, all requests for licenses
or other approvals involving items covered by the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR part 121) will now be reviewed on a case-by-case
basis. This policy change was announced in a notice published at 59 FR 31667 on June 20, 1994.




The arms export embargo on South Africa was imposed by the U.N. Security Council in Resolution 418 of November 4, 1977.
An arms import embargo was called for by Security Council Resolution 558 of December 13, 1984. The Security Council
terminated both embargoes in U.N. Security Council Resolution 919 of May 25, 1994. The Council's actions follow the
first all-race multiparty election and the establishment of a democratic South African Government inaugurated
on May 10, 1994.

Section 126.1(a) is also amended to add Rwanda to the list of countries with respect to which the United States maintains
an arms embargo. It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense
articles and services, destined for or originating in Rwanda. This policy was announced in a notice published at 59
FR 28583 on June 2, 1994. This policy and amendment implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 918 of May 17, 1994,
which requires all states to prevent the sale or supply to Rwanda of arms and related material, and Executive Order
12918 of May 26, 1994.

Licenses and approvals subject to the South Africa and Rwanda policies include manufacturing licenses, technical
assistance agreements, technical data, and commercial military exports and reexports of any kind involving these
countries under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act.



A new section 126.1(c) is added to indicate that whenever the United Nations Security Council mandates an arms embargo,
all transactions which are prohibited by the embargo and which involve U.S. persons anywhere, or any person in the
United States, and defense articles and services of a type enumerated on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR part
121), irrespective of origin, are prohibited under the ITAR for the duration of the embargo, unless the Department
of State publishes a notice in the 

Federal Register

 specifying different measures. This would include, but is not limited to, transactions involving trade by U.S. persons
who are located inside or outside of the United States in defense articles and services of U.S. or foreign origin which
are located on U.S. territory or elsewhere.

This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States. It is exempt from review under Executive
Order 12866 but has been reviewed internally by the Department to ensure consistency with the purposes thereof. It
is also excluded from the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554.

Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, and under the authority of section 38 of the Arms Export Control
Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) and Executive Order 11958, as amended 22 CFR Subchapter M is amended as follows:



PART 126_GENERAL POLICIES AND PROVISIONS



1. The authority citation for part 126 is amended to read as follows:






Authority:

 Secs. 2, 38, 40, 42, and 71, Arms Export Control Act, Pub. L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778, 2780, 2791,
and 2797); E.O. 11958, 41 FR 4311; E.O. 11322, 32 FR 119; 22 U.S.C. 2658; 22 U.S.C. 287c; E.O. 12918, 59 FR 28205.




2. Section 126.1 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c), as follows:



 126.1

Prohibited exports and sales to certain countries.



(a) General. It is the policy of the Untied states to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense
articles and defense services, destined for or originating in certain countries. This policy applies to Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Cuba, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Moldova, Mongolia, North Korea,
Russia, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.

This policy also applies to countries with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma,
China, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, the former Yugoslavia, and Zaire) or whenever an export would not
otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States. Comprehensive
arms embargoes are normally the subject of a State Department notice published in the 

Federal Register

. The exemptions provided in the regulations in this subchapter, except   123.17 and 125.4(b)(13) of
this subchapter, do not apply with respect to articles originating in or for export to any proscribed countries or
areas. 



* * * * * 


(c) Exports and sales prohibited by United Nations Security Council embargoes. Whenever the United Nations Security
Council mandates an arms embargo, all transactions which are prohibited by the embargo and which involve U.S. persons
anywhere, or any person in the United States, and defense articles and services of a type enumerated on the United States
Munitions List (22 CFR part 121), irrespective of origin, are prohibited under the ITAR for the duration of the embargo,
unless the Department of State publishes a notice in the 

Federal Register 

specifying different measures. This would include, but is not limited to, transactions involving trade by U.S. persons
who are located inside or outside of the United States in defense articles and services of U.S. or foreign origin which
are located inside or outside of the United States.

Signature Authority for Approval of Certificates of Label Approval (COLAS) (94F-002P) 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Treasury.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule, Treasury decision.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Treasury decision will authorize the removal of imported alcoholic beverage products from Customs custody
in conformity with certificates of label approval signed by ATF specialists. Currently, ATF specialists issue label
approvals by affixing the Director's name to each application. This Treasury decision will eliminate from 27 CFR
  4.40(b) (wine), 5.51(b) (distilled spirits), and 7.31(b) (malt beverages) the requirement that certificates
of label approval bear the signature of the Director. This change will streamline internal procedures and improve
resource management.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Section 205(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), 27 U.S.C. 205(e), requires that all distilled
spirits, wine, and malt beverage products have either a certificate of label approval or a certificate of exemption
from label approval prior to bottling, or in the case of imported products, prior to removal from Customs custody.
Section 205(e) grants authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to issue certificates of label approval in such manner
and in such form as prescribed by regulation. The Secretary has delegated authority to administer the FAA Act to the
Director, ATF, including the issuance of certificates of label approval. See 37 FR 11696 (June 6, 1972).

Under an existing delegation order, ATF specialists issue label approvals and exemptions from label approvals 
for both domestic and imported products in the name of the 
Director. ATF is currently revising this delegation order 
to authorize specialists within the Product Compliance 
Branch to approve labels and grant exemptions in their own 
names. However, the regulations at 27 CFR 4.40(b), 
5.51(b), and 7.31(b) specifically require that certificates 
of label approval (ATF Form 5100.31) bear the signature of 
the Director before imported alcoholic beverage products may 
be released from Customs custody. This Treasury decision 
will amend these regulations so that the Director may 
delegate to Product Compliance Branch specialists the 
authority to approve labels for imported products in their 
own names. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 
Public Law 96-511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its 
implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part 1320, do not apply to 
this final rule because no requirement to collect 
information is imposed. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required by 
5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law, the provisions of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.) do not 
apply. 



Executive Order 12866 



Because this is a rule of agency management, the 
provisions of Executive Order 12866 do not apply. 



Administrative Procedure Act 



Because this final rule is a rule of agency management 
that merely redesignates signature authority for 
certificates of label approval, it is unnecessary to issue 
this Treasury decision with notice and public procedure 
under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) or subject to the effective date 
limitation in 5 U.S.C. 553(d).

Redelegation of Authority of Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, To Act as Central Authority or Competent
Authority Under Treaties and Executive Agreements on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 0.64-1 of Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, authorizes the Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Criminal Division to act as the Central or Competent Authority under treaties and executive agreements between
the United States and other countries on mutual assistance in criminal matters. Section 0.64-1, as amended,
also authorizes the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division to redelegate this authority to
her Deputy Assistant Attorneys General and to the Director and Deputy Directors of the Office of International Affairs.
This final rule amends the Appendix to Subpart K of Part 0. The purpose is to effectuate 28 CFR 0.64-1, as amended,
by formally redelegating the authority of the Assistant Attorney General under both treaties and executive agreements
on mutual assistance in criminal matters to designated individuals within the Criminal Division.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In Directive No. 81 in the Appendix to Subpart K of Part 0, as currently written, the Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Criminal Division has redelegated her authority to act as the Central or Competent Authority under treaties
on mutual assistance in criminal matters to her Deputy Assistant Attorneys General and to the Director of the Office
of International Affairs. This final rule extends the redelegation of such authority to each of the Deputy Directors
of the Office of International Affairs, Criminal Division. This final rule also expands the scope of that redelegation
to match the scope of 28 CFR 0.64-1, which encompasses executive agreements, as well as treaties, on mutual assistance
in criminal matters.




This rule is a matter of internal Department management. It has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with section
1(b) of Executive Order 12866. The Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division has determined that this
rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and accordingly this
rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal
Division has reviewed this rule, and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government
and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 0



Authority delegations (Government agencies), Government employees, International agreements, Organization
and functions (Government agencies), Treaties, Whistleblowing.




For the reasons stated in the preamble, Title 28, Chapter I, Part 0, of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as
set forth below.

Supplemental Regulations Governing Federal Housing Administration Debentures 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of the Treasury, Fiscal Service, Bureau of the Public Debt. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule implements provisions of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 that authorize the issuance
of Federal Housing Administration debentures in book-entry form. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) debentures have been issued since 1938 in registered certificated form in
payment of certain insured mortgages in default. FHA debentures are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest
by the United States. The Treasury acts as the fiscal agent of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
in administering its debenture issues. The general regulations of the Department of the Treasury governing U.S.
securities (31 CFR Part 306) have been adopted by HUD to govern transactions in its debentures. The Treasury regulations
at 31 CFR part 337 supplement the general regulations, setting out provisions that apply specifically to the debentures.




In 1986, the Department of the Treasury began issuing its marketable securities exclusively in book-entry form.
This action was taken as book-entry technology was determined to be quicker, more efficient, and less costly than
issuing certificated securities. To take advantage of this technology, HUD successfully secured legislation,
i.e., the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550,  516, 106 Stat. 3790 (1992),
authorizing the issuance of FHA debentures in book-entry form. 

This rule revises and expands 31 CFR Part 337 to include provisions relating to book-entry debentures. Book-entry
debentures will be governed by the rules for the TREASURY DIRECT Book-Entry Securities System (31 CFR part 357) with
several exceptions which reflect the unique nature of the debentures. First, book-entry debentures, unlike Treasury's
book-entry marketable securities, may not be transferred to, or held in, Treasury's commercial book-entry system;
they may be transferred only between accounts in the FHA book-entry debenture system. Second, while debenture payments
will be made by the direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) method, prenotification messages or test payment
messages will not be used to verify payment instructions since accurate payment information will have entities seeking
settlement of defaulted insured mortgages. Third, since debentures are issued in settlement of defaulted mortgages
rather than through an auction process, no issue price information will be maintained for the debentures. 

Book-entry debentures will be maintained in the FHA book-entry debenture system operated for Treasury by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia acting as fiscal agent of the United States. Debentures in certificated form may be exchanged
for similar debentures in book-entry form, but, once exchanged, may not be reissued in certificated form. Debentures
issued in book-entry form may not be exchanged for debentures in certificated form. 

This rule also revises 31 CFR Part 337 to reflect the centralization of processing of debentures in both certificated
and book-entry form at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and to eliminate the obsolete requirement that the
registered owner or assignee must assign certificated debentures presented for redemption when payment is to be
made to the registered owner or assignee. 



Special Analysis



It has been determined that the rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive
Order No. 12866. It has also been determined that prior notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and impracticable
because the rule sets out procedures that merely implement legislation authorizing the issuance of debentures in
book-entry form. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

) do not apply to this rule. 



List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 337 



Banks, Banking, Electronic funds transfers, Government Securities, Federal Reserve System, Housing.

 Scope of regulations. 



The United States Department of the Treasury is the agent of the Federal Housing Administration for transactions
in any debentures which have been or may be issued pursuant to the authority conferred by the National Housing Act (48
Stat. 1246), as amended; (12 U.S.C. 1701

Division, Ten Independence Mall, P.O. Box 90, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19105-0090. Debentures delivered
to any other Federal Reserve Bank or Branch, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), or to the Bureau
of the Public Debt will be forwarded to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for processing. 



 337.3

 Termination of transfers and denominational exchange 
transactions. 



Debentures, which by their terms are subject to call, may be called for redemption, in whole or in part, at par and accrued
interest, on any interest date on three months' notice. No transfers or denominational exchanges in certificated
debentures covered by a given call will be made on the books of the Department of the Treasury on or after the announcement
of such call. However, this does not affect the right of a holder of such debenture to sell and assign it on or after the
announcement of the call date.

 337.4

 Presentation and surrender. 



(a) 

For redemption. 

To facilitate the redemption of called or maturing debentures, they may be presented and surrendered in the manner
prescribed in this section in advance of the call or maturity date, as the case may be. Early presentation by holders
will insure prompt payment of principal and interest when due. The debentures must first be assigned by the registered
payee or his assignee, or by his duly constituted representative, if required, in the form and manner indicated in
 337.5, and should then be submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, accompanied by appropriate
written advice. A transmittal advice for this purpose will accompany the notice of call. 

(b) 

For purchase. 

Debentures, the purchase of which has been authorized prior to call or maturity, may be assigned as instructed in paragraph
(a) of this section and immediately submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed by HUD for this purpose. 



 337.5

 Assignments. 



(a) If the registered payee, or an assignee holding a certificated debenture under proper assignment from the registered
payee, desires that payment be made to such payee or assignee, the debenture need not be assigned. If the owner desires
for any reason that payment be made to another, without intermediate assignment, the debentures should be assigned
to ``The Federal Housing Commissioner for redemption (or, purchase) for the account of 

XXXX

,'' inserting the name and address of the person to whom payment is to be made. Proof of the authority of the individual
assigning on behalf of an owner will be required in accordance with part 306 of this chapter. 

(b) An assignment in blank or other assignment having similar effect will be recognized, but in that event the debenture
would be, in effect, payable to bearer, and payment will be made in accordance with the instructions received from
the person surrendering the debenture for redemption or purchase. For the owner's protection, such assignments
should be avoided unless the owner is willing to lose the protection afforded by registration. 

(c) Debentures submitted for conversion to book-entry form should be assigned to ``The Federal Housing Commissioner
for conversion to book-entry debentures for the account of 

XXXX

.'' The registration on the book-entry account and/or the account number in which the debentures should be deposited
should be indicated. 

(d) All assignments must be made on the debentures themselves unless otherwise authorized by the Department of Treasury.

 337.6 

Conversions to book-entry.



Upon implementation of the book-entry debenture system, to be announced in advance by separate public notice, all
new debentures will be issued only in book-entry form, and may not thereafter be converted to certificated form. 

Certificated debentures may, upon the owner's request in accordance with  337.5(c), be converted to book-entry.
If such action is taken, the owner shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived the right to hold such debenture in certificated
form. 



 337.7 


Servicing transactions. 



Upon implementation of the book-entry debenture system, to be announced in advance by separate public notice, any
transfer or denominational exchange of certificated debentures generally will be made in book-entry form. If certificated
debentures are desired, the owner should so request in writing, before the book-entry debentures are issued. 



 337.8 


Payment of mortgage insurance premiums. 



When certificated debentures are tendered for purchase prior to maturity in order that the proceeds thereof be applied
to pay for mortgage insurance premiums, any difference between the amount of the debentures purchased and the amount
of the mortgage insurance premium will generally be issued to the owner in the form of a book-entry debenture in the
exact amount of such difference, provided it is one dollar ($1.00) or more. However, if the owner so requests, such
difference will be settled with certificated debenture(s), together with a cash adjustment, if any. Such request
should be made in writing, before the book-entry debenture in the amount of the difference is issued. 



 337.9


Payment of final interest. 



Final interest on any debenture, whether purchased prior to or redeemed on or after the call or the maturity date, will
be paid with the principal. In all cases the payment of principal and final interest will be mailed or directed to the
payment address given in the form of advice accompanying the debenture surrendered. 



 337.10


Payments. 



Payments on certificated debentures will be made by fiscal agency check in accordance with part 355 of this chapter,
or, upon request, by direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) in accordance with part 370 of this chapter. Information
as to the deposit account at the financial institution designated to receive a direct deposit payment shall be provided
on the appropriate form(s) designated by the Department. 



Subpart B_Book-Entry Debentures 


 337.11



Original issue and conversions. 



Upon implementation of the book-entry debenture system, to be announced in advance by separate public notice, all
new debentures will be issued only in book-entry form in the exact amount payable to the owner. Once issued in book-entry
form, a debenture may not be converted to certificated form. 



 337.12 


Applicability of TREASURY DIRECT regulations. 



The regulations governing the TREASURY DIRECT Book-Entry Securities System (TREASURY DIRECT) (part 357 of this
chapter) apply to govern transactions in FHA book-entry debentures, with the following exceptions: 

(a) 

Securities account.

 (See  357.20 of this chapter.) An account in the book-entry debenture system may be established by the Department
of the Treasury upon receipt of the request that a new debenture be issued or that a certificated debenture be converted
to book-entry form. The statement of account shall contain information regarding the account as of the date of such
statement. It will include a unique account number, but will not include price information. 

(b) 

Transfers.

 (See  357.22 of this chapter.) A book-entry debenture may be transferred only between accounts established
in the FHA book-entry debenture system. 

(c) 

Debentures announced for call.

 Debentures, which by their terms are subject to call, may be called for redemption, in whole or in part, at par and accrued
interest, on any interest date on three months' notice. For purposes of a transaction request affecting ownership
and/or payment instructions with respect to a debenture announced for call, a proper request must be received not
less than twenty (20) calendar days preceding the next payment date. If the twentieth day preceding a payment date
falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the last day set for the receipt of a transaction request will be the
last business day preceding that date. If a transaction request is received less than twenty (20) calendar days preceding
a payment date, the Department may, in its discretion, act on such request if sufficient time remains for processing.
If a transaction request is received too late for completion of the requested transaction, principal and final interest
on the called debentures will be paid to the owner of record and sent to the payment address of record. 

(d) 

Payments.

 (See  357.26 of this chapter.) Direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) payments with respect to debentures,
e.g., principal, interest and cash adjustments, will be made without prenotification messages. 



 337.13


Payment of mortgage insurance premiums. 



When book-entry debentures are being purchased prior to maturity to pay for mortgage insurance premiums, the difference
between the amount of the debentures purchased and the mortgage insurance premiums shall be issued to the owner in
the form of a book-entry debenture in the exact amount of such difference, provided it is one dollar ($1.00) or more.




Subpart C_Additional Information 


 337.14

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision; South Coast
Air Quality Management Division; Ventura County Air Pollution Control District 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 

Federal Register

 on March 15, 1994. The revisions concern rules from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the
Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD). This approval action will incorporate these rules into
the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised
rules control emissions of VOCs from the transfer of gasoline into storage or fuel tanks, and from crude oil and natural
gas production and processing facilities. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of 
these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for
national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On March 15, 1994 in 59 FR 11958, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: SCAQMD Rule 461,
Gasoline Transfer and Dispensing, and VCAPCD Rule 74.10, Components at Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production and Processing
Facilities. Rule 461 was adopted by the SCAQMD on July 7, 1989, and submitted by the California Air Resources Board
(CARB) to EPA on December 31, 1990. Rule 74.10 was adopted by the VCAPCD on June 16, 1992 and submitted by the CARB on September
14, 1992. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement
that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance
with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background
for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) cited above.

EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA
interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the
NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule
provisions and evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 11958 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at
EPA's Region IX office. 


Response to Public Comments 


A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 11958. EPA did not receive any comments regarding these rules.



EPA Action 


EPA is finalizing this action to approve the above rules for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the
submittal under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D of the CAA. This approval
action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules
is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 


Regulatory Process 


This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory
action from Executive Order 12866 review.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; District of Columbia-Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the District of Columbia for the purpose
of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program
(PROGRAM). This SIP revision was submitted by the District to satisfy the Federal mandate of the Clean Air Act (CAA)
to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to
comply with the CAA. The rational for approval is set forth in this document; additional information is available
at the address indicated in the 

Addresses

 section. This action is being taken in accordance with section 110 of the CAA.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Background
 


Implementation of the provisions the CAA will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain
and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses
frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine
the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses,
the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program, and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs EPA to oversee
these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing
a PROGRAM
are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 

Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

 in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. 

On October 22, 1993, the District of Columbia submitted a formal revision to its SIP. The SIP revision consists of a
plan for establishing a PROGRAM. In order to gain full approval, the District's submittal must provide for each of
the following program elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical
and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a District Small Business Ombudsman to represent
the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP)
to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The plan must include the duties, funding, and schedule
of implementation for the three program components. The plan must also determine the eligibility of small business
stationary sources for assistance in the program. 
The District's plan for the establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) and Ombudsman was adopted
and will be implemented pursuant to the authority vested in the Mayor by section 422(6) of the District of Columbia
Self Government and Governmental Reorganization Act of 1973, as amended (1992), D.C. Code sections 1-242 (6),
(11) and (12), 6-901, 6-902 and 6-903. The creation and administration of the Compliance Advisory
Panel will be accomplished by Mayoral order. 

Milestones for implementing the essential elements of the District's PROGRAM are included as part of the SIP revision
submittal. The District has committed to establishing a SBAP, administered by the Air Resources Management Division
of the Environmental Regulation Administration, by September 1, 1993. In January, 1994 the District appointed a
small business representative to coordinate SBAP activities. Eligibility for assistance under the SBAP will be
determined by the criteria outlined in the PROGRAM submittal. Full SBAP implementation will begin no later than November
15, 1994. The District has committed to establishing an Ombudsman's office, to be located in the Office of the Administrator
of the Environmental Regulation Administration, by September 1, 1993. The Ombudsman will complete the first annual
review of the SBAP by November 15, 1994. A Mayoral Order establishing the creation and administration of the Compliance
Advisory Panel was issued on November 3, 1992. The District has committed to convening its CAP by June 1, 1993. The CAP
will submit its first annual report to EPA by November 15, 1994. 


II. Analysis of SIP Revision 



Section 507(a) of the CAA sets forth seven requirements that the District must meet to have an approvable SBAP. Six
of the requirements will be discussed in this section of this document, while the seventh requirement, establishment
of a state Small Business Ombudsman, will be discussed in the next section. 



1. Small Business Assistance Program



The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information
concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage
lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the CAA. The second requirement
is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention
and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies,
process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The District has met these requirements
by establishing a SBAP, administered by the District of Columbia Air Resources Management Division (ARMD). The ARMD
SBAP has the responsibility of collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and acceptable
control technologies for small business stationary sources. The ARMD will also work closely with the Office of Emergency
Preparedness and other District organizations in coordinating information exchange regarding alternative technologies,
process changes, products and other methods of pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection.
The dissemination of SBAP information shall take two forms. Technical and compliance information will be disseminated
to small businesses in a proactive manner via press releases, brochures and other media as necessary. Additionally,
``outreach'' programs such as conferences or meetings with Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, small businesses,
and/or trade associations, etc. may be utilized. The SBAP will also disseminate information in a reactive manner
via an established telephone hotline and information clearinghouse which will be capable of handling inquires from
the small business community.

The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
CAA in a timely and efficient manner. The SBAP will work closely with the staff of the ARMD Engineering and Planning
Branch and Compliance and Enforcement Branch to help sources identify applicable requirements and obtain permits.
Specifically, the SBAP will be responsible for providing advice and assistance to small businesses in the interpretation
of regulatory requirements, explaining permitting procedures and providing information regarding fees, when
and where to apply, the length of time necessary to receive a permit, etc. Additional responsibilities include helping
small businesses determine if they qualify for reduced fees under the waiver provisions of the title V Operating Permit
Program. 
 
The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the CAA in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the CAA. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources
of their obligations under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at
the option of the state, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the CAA.
The SBAP is responsible for notifying eligible sources of their statutory and regulatory rights and obligations
under the Clean Air Act in a timely fashion. Such communication will include explaining fine and permit policies,
the consequences of operating in violation of regulations, and appeal procedures. In addition, the District's SBAP
will administer an audit program which provides technical assistance on pollution prevention or control options.
Environmental professionals from the Compliance and Enforcement Branch and the Engineering and Planning Branch
of the ARMD are to serve as auditors for the program. 
The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source
for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practices or compliance methods preceding any applicable compliance date. The SBAP will
meet this requirement by developing procedures, in accordance with section 507(a)(7) of the CAA, for handling requests
from small businesses for modifications of work practices or alternative air pollution control methods. The District
has committed to establishing such procedures by November 15, 1994.
 
An ARMD program analyst, authorized to report directly to the Program Manager of the Air Resources Management Division,
is responsible for the development and initiation of SBAP programs. As SBAP programs are developed, additional staff
will be hired as required. The SBAP will be funded by District of Columbia and/or Federal air pollution control grant
funds until the effective date of implementation of the District's title V Operating Permits Program. After the effective
date, the District's SBAP will be funded by District of Columbia funds appropriated from the revenues generated by
fees required by the title V Operating Permits Program. 


2. Ombudsman Office 



The seventh requirement of section 507(a)(3) is the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small
business stationary sources in connection with the implementation of the CAA. The District's Ombudsman will work
in the Office of the Administrator of the Environmental Regulation Administration as a member of the Administrator's
staff. Consequently, the Ombudsman will be in an effective position to represent the views and interests of the small
business community on issues concerning the implementation of the CAA. The Ombudsman will have direct access to the
Program Manager of the ARMD and his/her superior, the Administrator. In this position, the Ombudsman can easily evaluate
the District's SBAP, investigate and resolve disputes between businesses and air pollution control authorities,
develop and propose legislation, and actively promote the small business point-of-view. The Ombudsman will also
have access to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, the Office of the Corporation Counsel,
and the Office of the Mayor.

A listing of the Ombudsman's duties indicate that it will be readily accessible to small businesses and, on their behalf,
be authorized to provide reports to and to communicate with appropriate personnel. The Ombudsman will also distribute
the District's CAP reports and advisory opinions and provide administrative support to the CAP. The District has
committed to hiring a program analyst to serve as the Small Business Ombudsman. Additional staff for the Office of
the Ombudsman will be recruited as necessary. The Ombudsman will be funded with District of Columbia appropriated
funds. After the effective date of the District's title V Operating Permits Program, the Ombudsman and his or her staff
may be funded by appropriations from revenues of the District's title V Operating Permits Program. 




3. Compliance Advisory Panel



Section 507(e) of the CAA requires each state to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel that includes two members selected
by the Governor (or equivalent) who are not owners or representatives of owners of small business stationary sources;
four members selected by the state legislature (or equivalent) who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses;
and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the air pollution permit program. The District has committed
to creating a compliance advisory panel. The composition of the District's CAP is in accordance with the method of
selection required by section 507(e)(2) of the CAA for a unicameral legislature. All CAP members, with the exception
of the representative of the Air Resources Management Division, a District of Columbia employee, will be unpaid appointees.


In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates certain responsibilities of the
panel. A description of the duties and authorities delegated to the District's Compliance Advisory Panel indicates
that it will be responsible for all activities required by section 507(e). These activities include rendering advisory
opinions on the effectiveness of the small business ombudsman and SBAP and preparing periodic reports to EPA concerning
the effectiveness of the PROGRAM following the intent of the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, and the Equal Access to Justice Act. The CAP will also be responsible for reviewing information disseminated
to small business stationary sources to assure such information is understandable to laypersons.
 


4. Source Eligibility



Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:



(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 

The District's program definition of the term ``small business stationary source'' is identical to the statutory
definition found in section 507(c). All small business stationary sources located in the District shall be eligible
to receive assistance from the SBAP. Any source which does not meet the criteria in (C), (D), and (E) above but does not
emit more than 100 tons per year of all regulated pollutants may petition the District of Columbia to be included in
the SBAP. The District may, after public notice and opportunity for public comment, permit such a source to participate
in the SBAP even though the source does not meet the criteria given above. 



III. Summary of SIP Revision 



The District has submitted a SIP revision which fully implements each of the program elements required by CAA section
507. As previously stated, the District has committed to fully implementing its SBAP, administered by the Air Resources
Management Division of the Environmental Regulation Administration, by November 15, 1994. The District's Ombudsman,
located in the Office of the Administrator of the Environmental Regulation Administration, shall complete its first
annual review of the SBAP, by November 15, 1994. The District's CAP, authorized by Mayoral Order, shall complete its
first annual review of the SBAP and Ombudsman and submit it to EPA by November 15, 1994. In this action, EPA is approving
the SIP revision submittal by the District of Columbia. Accordingly,  52.510 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart
J-District of Columbia to reflect EPA's approval action and the fact that it is considered part of the District
of Columbia SIP.
 
 EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will become effective October 17, 1994 unless, within 30 days of publication, adverse or critical comments are received.


If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective on October 17, 1994.



Final Action


EPA is approving the District of Columbia's plan for the establishment of a Small Business Stationary Source Technical
and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. Accordingly,  52.510 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart
J-District of Columbia to reflect EPA's approval action. EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved
state implementation plan for conformance with the CAA including section 507 and section 110(a)(2)(E).

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

By this action, EPA is approving a state program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the state. Therefore, because EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small
entities affected.




This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.


Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Wisconsin; Redesignation of Oshkosh, WI, to Attainment
for Carbon Monoxide 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The USEPA redesignates Oshkosh, Wisconsin from unclassifiable to attainment status for carbon monoxide. The State
of Wisconsin requested this redesignation and provided the necessary monitoring data for USEPA to approve the change.
The redesignation has no substantive effect because unclassifiable areas are subject to the same requirements as
attainment areas. Elsewhere in this 

Federal Register

, USEPA is proposing approval of and soliciting public comment on this redesignation. If adverse comments are received
in the time period specified below, USEPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments in a subsequent final
rule. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background



In November 1991, USEPA designated Oshkosh, Wisconsin as an unclassifiable area for carbon monoxide (56 FR 56850)
because the available air quality data was not representative of air quality at the date of enactment of the 1990 Clean
Air Act Amendments. Exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for carbon monoxide had been
recorded in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in late 1988 and early 1989, but the emissions causing the exceedances were brought
under control later in 1989. These controls were approved by USEPA and incorporated into the State Implementation
Plan on October 8, 1992 (57 FR 46309). 

Wisconsin's current request, submitted on April 7, 1994, is to change the designation of Oshkosh from unclassifiable
to attainment based on recent ambient air quality measurements. 



II. Evaluation of State Submission



A. Procedural Background



Redesignation requests are processed under section 107(d)(3) of the Clean Air Act (the Act). While section 107(d)(3)(E)
specifies a number of requirements for areas requesting redesignation from nonattainment to attainment, the redesignation
of unclassifiable areas is not explicitly addressed. However, the general criteria governing designations, set
forth in section 107(d)(1)(A), do apply. Therefore, to qualify an unclassified area for redesignation to attainment,
the State must show that the area has attained the relevant standard. 

For a carbon monoxide area to be designated as attainment for a pollutant, it must meet the NAAQS for that pollutant
(40 CFR part 50), based on the most recent two years of data. In its redesignation request, Wisconsin submitted carbon
monoxide data for Oshkosh from January 24, 1992 to January 31, 1994 (when the monitor was shut down). Wisconsin collected
the air quality data as required in the 1992 SIP revision and under procedures in accordance with the USEPA's monitoring
requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 58. This data has been entered into USEPA's Aerometric Information Retrieval
System (AIRS) and is summarized in USEPA's Technical Support Document for this action (M. Beardsley to Files, July
20, 1994). The data show that Oshkosh is well under the NAAQS for carbon monoxide concentrations and, thus, meets the
requirements for attainment status. 



C. Action 



The USEPA redesignates the City of Oshkosh, Wisconsin from unclassifiable to attainment for carbon monoxide. 


Because USEPA considers this action noncontroversial, we are approving it without prior proposal. This action will
become effective on October 17, 1994. However, if we receive adverse or critical comments by September 16, 1994, USEPA
will publish a document that withdraws today's action and will address all public comments in a subsequent final rule
based on the proposal published in the proposed rule section. The public comment period will not be extended or reopened.




IV. Miscellaneous 



A. Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Exectutive Order 12866 review. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

This redesignation does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant
impact on any small entities affected. 



D. Petitions for Judicial Review 



Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

Protection of Stratospheric Ozone 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of partial stay and reconsideration. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action announces a three-month stay of certain federal rules requiring the repair and/or retrofit of appliances
containing ozone-depleting substances contained in the regulations implementing the National Recycling Program.
The effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), as they apply to industrial process refrigeration equipment only, including
the applicable compliance dates, is stayed for three months pending reconsideration. EPA is issuing this stay pursuant
to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay
the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration. 


In the proposed rules section of today's 

Federal Register

, EPA proposes, under Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), to temporarily stay the effectiveness
of these rules and applicable compliance dates beyond the three months expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B),
but only to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the
rules in question. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The contents of this preamble are listed in the following outline: 



I. Background 
II. Rules to be Stayed and Reconsidered 
III. Issuance of Stay 
IV. Authority of Stay and Reconsideration 
V. Proposed Additional Temporary Stay 
V. Effective Date 



I. Background 


On July 13, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) sent to the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) a petition for reconsideration of the Refrigerant Recycling Rule, promulgated May 14, 1993, (58 FR 28660),
particularly the leak repair provisions under 40 CFR 82.156(i) as they concern industrial process refrigeration
equipment
. On that same date, CMA filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking
review of this Refrigerant Recycling Rule (

Chemical Manufacturers Association 

v.

 Browner, et. al., 

D.C. Cir. Docket 93-1444.) As part of a settlement agreement signed by EPA and the CMA on May 20, 1994, EPA agreed
to propose changes to the appropriate sections of the rules. A 113(g) notice of the settlment agreement was published
on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30584). 




The settlement agreement set a tight deadline for the completion of rulemaking, requiring EPA to propose changes
by September 1, 1994, and to promulgate amended regulations by June 1, 1995. By this action, EPA is convening a proceeding
for reconsideration.

Final regulations published on May 14, 1993 (58 FR 28660), establish a recycling program for ozone-depleting refrigerants
recovered during the servicing and disposal of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Together with the
prohibition on venting during the service, repair, and disposal of class I and class II substances (see the listing
notice January 22, 1991; 56 FR 2420) that took effect on July 1, 1992, these regulations should substantially reduce
the emissions of ozone-depleting refrigerants. 
The petition filed by the CMA asks for reconsideration of leak repair provisions under  82.156(i) as they relate
to industry process refrigeration equipment. In particular, the petitioners raised concerns regarding the ability
to repair or retrofit some industrial process refrigeration equipment within the timeframes established by the
final rule. CMA's concerns involve the need to shut down equipment and/or obtain custom built parts within the appropriate
timeframes. CMA also raised the possibility of delays caused by other regulatory requirements related to changes
at plants. 
EPA has evaluated CMA's information and is now reconsidering the leak repair provisions in light of this information.
Moreover, EPA believes that this information warrants review and response pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B) of the
Clean Air Act. In order to review and evaluate the ability of the owners and operators of industrial process refrigeration
equipment to comply with the leak repair provisions when extenuating circumstances exist, EPA will reconsider the
regulatory requirements applicable to repairing leaks in accordance with section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act. 


III. Issuance of Stay 


EPA hereby issues a three-month administrative stay of the effectiveness of provisions of  82.156(i) as they
apply to industrial process refrigeration equipment, including all applicable compliance dates, promulgated
as final federal rules requiring the reduction of emissions of ozone-depleting substances during the servicing
and disposal of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment (58 FR 28660). EPA will reconsider these rules, as
discussed above and, following the notice and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, will take
appropriate action. If, after reconsideration of these provisions, EPA determines that it is appropriate to impose
leak repair requirements that are stricter than the existing rules, EPA will propose an adequate compliance period
from the date of final action on reconsideration. EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced
by the Agency's reconsideration. Any EPA proposal regarding changes to the leak repair requirements and the appropriate
compliance period would be subject to the notice and comment procedures of Clean Air Act section 307(d). 
Because the settlement agreement between EPA and CMA set a tight deadline for the completion of the rulemaking, EPA
will reconsider the rules in question as expeditiously as practicable. 


IV. Authority for Stay and Reconsideration 


The administrative stay and reconsideration of the rules and associated compliance periods announced by this notice
are being undertaken pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B). That provision
authorizes the Administrator to stay the effectiveness of a rule for three months if it was impracticable to raise
an objection or if the grounds for an objection arose after the period for public comment and if the objection is of central
relevance to the outcome of the rule. Because some of the issues in the petition for reconsideration may have been impracticable
to raise during the comment period, EPA is authorized to stay the effectiveness of the relevant provisions. 


V. Proposed Additional Temporary Stay 


EPA may not be able to complete the reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rules stayed
by this notice within the three-month period expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). If EPA does not complete
the reconsideration in this timeframe, then it might be appropriate to extend temporarily the stay of the effectiveness
of the leak repair requirements for industrial process refrigeration and applicable compliance dates until EPA
completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration. EPA is going through notice and comment rulemaking to decide
whether to extend the stay beyond this initial three-month period. In the Proposed Rules Section of today's 

Federal Register

, EPA proposes a temporary extension of the stay beyond the three months, only to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration
of the rules in question. 


VI. Effective Date 


This action will become final on September 16, 1994.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act) for the plant 

Lilium occidentale 

(western lily). This lily is known to occur in 31 small, widely separated populations in sphagnum bogs, coastal scrub
and prairie, and other poorly drained soils along the coast of southern Oregon and northern California. Threats to
the species include development (e.g., roads, cranberry farms, buildings, and associated infrastructure), competition
from encroaching shrubs and trees into lily habitat, bulb collecting, and grazing by domestic livestock and deer.
Human activities have interrupted natural processes of bog and wetland creation and maintenance, so that there are
fewer bogs in early successional stages suitable for this lily. This rule implements the Federal protection and recovery
provisions provided by the Act for this species.

Carl Purdy first collected and described 

Lilium occidentale 

(western lily) from unspecified locations in the headlands around Humboldt Bay, California (Purdy 1897). There
are no other taxonomic treatments of this lily. Some researchers have speculated that separate Oregon and California
varieties of the lily may exist (Ballantyne 1980). The variation between lilies in these two regions is now believed
to be due to environmental differences; i.e. wetter (bog) sites and drier (coastal prairie) sites, and not geographic
variation (Mark Skinner, California Native Plant Society, pers. comm., 1991). In some instances, 

L. occidentale 

is known to hybridize with 

L. columbianum 

(tiger lily) that grows in generally drier sites. Hybrids are known only from disturbed sites such as road edges. 




Lilium occidentale, 

a perennial in the lily family (Liliaceae), grows from a short unbranched, rhizomatous bulb, reaching a height of
up to 1.8 meters (5 feet (ft)). Leaves grow along the unbranched stem singly or in whorls and are long and pointed, roughly
1 centimeter (cm) wide and 10 cm long (0.5 inch (in) by 4 in). The nodding flowers are red, sometimes deep orange, with
yellow to green centers in the shape of a star and spotted with purple. The six petals (tepals) are 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1.5 in)
long and curve strongly backwards. This species can be distinguished from similar native lilies by the combination
of pendent red flowers with yellow to green centers in the shape of a star, highly reflexed petals, non-spreading stamens
closely surrounding the pistil, and an unbranched rhizomatous bulb. 

Lilium columbianum 

is yellow to orange and grows from a typical ovoid bulb; 

L. vollmeri, L. pardilinum, 

and 

L. maritimum 

can have red tepals, but none have the distinctive characters of stamens that stay close to the pistil and a green central
star (which may change to yellow with age). 




Lilium occidentale 

has an extremely restricted distribution within 2 miles (3.2 kilometers (km)) of the coast from Hauser, Coos County,
Oregon to Loleta, Humboldt County, California. This range encompasses approximately the southern one-third of
the Oregon coast and the northern 100 miles (161 km) of the California coast. Its extreme westerly distribution is
the origin of its specific name. The plant is currently known from 7 widely separated regions along the coast, and occurs
in 31 small (2 square meters (2.4 square yards) to 4 hectares (10 acres) in area), isolated, densely clumped populations.
Of the 25 populations known in 1987 and 1988, 9 contained only 2 to 6 plants, 5 contained 10 to 50 plants, 6 contained 51
to 200 plants, 4 contained 201 to 600 plants, and 1 contained almost 1,000 plants (Schultz 1989). At some sites, particularly
the sites with more than 200 plants, the majority of plants were non-flowering, which is probably an indication of
stress (Schultz 1989). Schultz calculated a known population of 661 flowering and at least 2,750 non-flowering plants
in 1988. Since then, an estimated total of 1,000 to 2,000 flowering plants have been discovered at 4 sites near Crescent
City, California, where none were previously known (Dave Imper, Humboldt State University Foundation, pers. comm.,
1991). In addition, a population of about 125 flowering plants was discovered near Brookings, Oregon, in 1991 (Margie
Willis, Oregon Department of Parks and Recreation, pers. comm. 1991), and a population of 13 flowering plants was
discovered near Bandon, Oregon, in 1992. The known populations occur on State of Oregon (15), county (1), private
(15) including 1 site on land owned by The Nature Conservancy, and State of California (2) lands. Two sites span two
ownerships. 


In Oregon, Schultz (1989) identified a 20-mile stretch of coast from Bandon to Cape Blanco as an area likely to contain
undiscovered populations of 

Lilium occidentale. 

Previously, Ballantyne (1980) searched this area and did not find new populations, but his visit was after flowering
when the plants would have been inconspicuous. It is possible this area may support the lily. In California, little
suitable habitat remains that has not already been surveyed (Dave Imper, pers. comm., 1992). The extremely dense
vegetation in the coastal scrub habitat and around bogs makes surveying for the lily difficult.

Lilium occidentale

 grows at the edges of sphagnum bogs and in forest or thicket openings along the margins of ephemeral ponds and small
channels. It also grows in coastal prairie and scrub near the ocean where fog is common. Herb and grass associates include


Calamagrostis nutkaensis

 (Pacific reedgrass), 

Carex

 sp. (sedge), 

Sphagnum

 sp. (sphagnum moss), 

Gentiana sceptrum,

 and 

Darlingtonia californica

 (California pitcher-plant). Common shrub associates are 

Myrica californica

 (wax-myrtle), 

Ledum glandulosum

 (Labrador tea), 

Spiraea douglasii

 (Douglas' spiraea), 

Gaultheria shallon

 (salal), 

Rhododendron macrophyllum

 (western rhododendron), 

Vaccinium ovatum

 (evergreen huckleberry), and 

Rubus

 sp. (blackberry). Tree associates include 

Pinus contorta

 (coast pine), 

Picea sitchensis

 (sitka spruce), 

Chamaecyparis lawsonia

 (Port Orford cedar), and 

Salix

 sp. (willow) (Schultz 1989). 



Lilium occidentale

 has not been widespread in recent times. Historical records indicate that it was once more common than it is today.
After the ice age, rising sea levels flooded marine benches where bogs and coastal scrub would have been more extensive
than today. That may account for the patchiness of its current habitat distribution. It is known or assumed to be extirpated
in at least nine historical sites, due to forest succession, cranberry farm development, livestock grazing, highway
construction, and other development. Its status is uncertain in at least seven other historical sites (Schultz 1989).
These factors continue to threaten the lily, with development taking a primary role. Two known populations near Brookings,
Oregon were partially or totally destroyed by unpermitted development-related wetland fill activity in 1991. The
largest known population and three smaller populations near Crescent City, California are currently threatened
by housing and recreation development (Dave Imper, pers. comm. 1991). 



Previous Federal Action 



Federal action on this plant began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered,
threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presented
to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document, 

Lilium occidentale

 was considered to be endangered. 

On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) accepting the report as a petition to list the species within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)(A)) of the Act), and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. In
this and subsequent notices, 

Lilium occidentale

 was treated as under petition for listing as endangered. As a result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published
a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
species, including 

L. occidentale.

 The list of 1,700 plant species was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution
and the Service in response to House Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication. 

In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given
to proposals already over 2-years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including 

Lilium occidentale,

 along with four other proposals that had expired. 

The Service published an updated Notice of Review for plants on December 15, 1980 (50 FR 82480) including 

Lilium occidentale

 as a category 1 species, meaning that the Service had sufficient information to support a proposal for listing. A review
of the information available on this species in 1985 indicated that category 2 status was more appropriate, and the
plant was included as such in the September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526) Notice of Review for plants. Category 2 species are
taxa for which the Service has some information indicating that listing may be warranted, but additional information
on biological vulnerability and threats is needed to support a proposal for listing as threatened or endangered.
In 1989, a status review of the species was completed (Schultz 1989). This report provided the additional information
necessary to elevate the species to a category 1 candidate; it was included as such in the February 21, 1990, Plant Notice
of Review (55 FR 6184). 

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on pending petitions within 12 months of their
receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated
as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of this
species was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii)
of the Act; notice of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition
to be recycled yearly pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed each year from 1984 through
1991. A proposal to list 

Lilium occidentale

 as endangered was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 26, 1992 (57 FR 48495). The Service now determines 

L. occidentale

 to be endangered with the publication of this rule.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations 



In the October 26, 1992, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final listing decision. Appropriate
State agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment.
Newspaper notices were published in The Oregonian paper, Portland, Oregon, on November 27, 1992, and The World paper,
Coos Bay, Oregon, on November 25, 1992, which invited general public comment. Three letters were received. Two letters,
both from private citizens, were in support of the listing. One letter, from a local government, questioned whether
there has been enough study on the need to list the species, its habitat requirements, or whether habitat changes such
as cranberry farming may actually benefit the plant. 



Service Response:

 The Service believes that the status review of the plant was very thorough. All known populations from historical
herbarium collections were checked, and many were found to be extirpated. The restricted habitat requirements of
the species are accurately known, and most suitable habitat has been searched. Additionally, the Service contacted
all individuals knowledgeable about the species prior to proposing it for listing to assess the most current information
about the status of the species. In response to the concern with the ability of the lily to grow in cranberry farms, a
small population of lilies was found in 1992 in an apparently abandoned cranberry bog (Bruce Rittenhouse, Coos Bay
District, Bureau of Land Management, pers. comm.). No populations have been found in active cranberry farms. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that 

Lilium occidentale

 should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations
promulgated to implement the listing provisions (50 CFR part 424) were followed. A species may be determined to be
an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors
and their application to 

L. occidentale

 Purdy (western lily) are as follows: 

A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat or range. Lilium occidentale

 existed historically at several sites above Humboldt Bay in northern California. These populations have been extirpated
by development or, in some cases, encroachment by forest. From the 1940's to the present, conversion of bog habitat
to cranberry farms, roads, and residential dwellings has eliminated suitable 

L. occidentale

 habitat as well as some populations of the plant in the area from Bandon south to Cape Blanco, Oregon (Schultz 1989).
This area contained perhaps the greatest concentration of the species in Oregon 40 to 50 years ago, according to native
plant collectors and old-time residents of the area (Ballantyne 1980). In 1988, this area contained 6 small populations
with a total of fewer than 125 flowering plants (Schultz 1989). Clearing and draining along the Elk and Sixes Rivers
in Oregon for livestock grazing have eliminated many of the once numerous populations there (Ballantyne 1980). In
the mid-1960's, the construction of a picnic area and restroom facility in an Oregon State Park destroyed another
population. In the summer of 1987, trail maintenance by a crew from this same State Park destroyed the flowering shoots
of six 

L. occidentale

 (Schultz 1989). 

In 1984, the city of Brookings, Oregon, under an easement permit from the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT),
buried a sewer line along a powerline right-of-way through a lily bog that had contained up to 100 plants (Veva Stansell,
U.S. Forest Service, pers. comm.) The fill eliminated all the 

Lilium occidentale

 in a 20-ft (6.1 meter) wide strip, destroying almost half of the available lily habitat. The species that later colonized
the fill, rushes and alder, were not the same as those found in the adjoining bog (e.g., sphagnum and 

Drosera

 sundews) (Schultz 1989). In 1991, the City of Brookings again obtained permission from ODOT to bury a larger sewer
line in the site, widening the destroyed area to approximately 25 ft (7.6 meters). The project was completed without
obtaining proper wetland fill permits (John Craig, Army Corps of Engineers, pers. comm., 1991). It is unlikely that
the filled area will support 

L. occidentale

 in the future (Stewart Schultz, University of British Columbia, pers. comm., 1991). The effects on the hydrology
of the remaining bog are as yet unknown. At a second site, a private developer drained a lily bog that historically contained
about 100 plants, without obtaining a State or Federal permit for the wetland activity. Two lilies were found remaining
between two drainage ditches (Richard Mize, California Native Plant Society, pers. comm., 1991). 

Future development activities threaten the remaining sites where 

Lilium occidentale

 occurs. The largest known population occurs partly on private land in Crescent City, California. This land has been
surveyed and is platted as a subdivision in city records (Richard Mize, pers. comm., 1991). Other nearby populations
are privately owned and the owner has expressed the desire to develop the land (Dave Imper, pers. comm., 1991). The
ODOT is currently planning to widen Highway 101 at another lily site. After the proposed rule was published, ODOT modified
their plans and will avoid the lily population. Such pressure to develop wetland sites occupied by this lily will likely
increase in the future. The lily is limited to habitat very near the coast that is currently undergoing intense development
pressure. The species' bog and coastal prairie/scrub habitat occurs on level marine terraces that are desirable
for coastal development because of the gentle topography and proximity to the ocean. 

B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. Lilium occidentale

 is a showy, rare lily and the species has been collected by lily growers and for the commercial trade since before the
1930's. After the location of a California population of 

L. occidentale

 was published in lily society yearbooks in 1934, 1955, and 1972, bulb collecting by lily growers and breeders decimated
the population (Ballantyne, 1980). Overcollection continues sporadically at sites in Oregon and California (Schultz
1989). For example, in June 1987, seven bulbs were dug from an Oregon site. Lily breeders collect 

L. occidentale

 seed regularly from several sites. Plants near trails and roads are occasionally picked: at least seven plants were
picked in 1985, four to six in 1986, five in 1987, and two in 1988 at a site in Oregon (Schultz 1989). 

Lilium occidentale

 was reportedly advertised for sale in western United States and British seed and bulb catalogues (Siddall and Chambers
1978). Overcollection currently threatens this plant and would likely increase, if specific locations of this plant
were publicized. 

C. 

Disease or predation.

 Although a limited amount of grazing may be of benefit to 

Lilium occidentale,

 if it prevents forest succession (see Factor E); overgrazing by cattle is considered a threat to this plant. Until
recently, livestock overgrazing on the lily and surrounding vegetation was severe at three California ranch sites
(Schultz 1989). The lily population at one ranch was reduced from over 100 flowering individuals in 1984 to fewer than
10 between 1985 and 1988. At another ranch, half of the fruits were grazed by deer and cattle in 1985. By July 1987, cattle
had crushed 32 percent and grazed another 25 percent of 49 flowering shoots. Only 17 intact fruits remained in August
(Imper et al. 1987). Deer and elk herbivory is severe at 3 Oregon sites; 50 to 60 percent of fruit in one population of
about 60 flowering plants were browsed in 1987 and 1988 (Schultz 1989). Unknown vandals destroyed all flowering shoots
at one site in 1980 (Ballantyne 1980). 

Deer browsing continues to be a threat at the Oregon sites. The fences, however, are not deer-proof and deer are common
at these ranches. Though occurring sporadically, browsing by deer can cause major damage.

Grazing of leaves, buds, and flowers by Coleopteran and Lepidopteran larvae is an ongoing threat at one California
site (Imper et al. 1987). The highly clumped distribution and small number of populations of 

Lilium occidentale 

make any fungal, viral, or bacterial disease a potential threat. Fungal pathogens are common in cultivated lilies;
growers often avoid planting in ground known to be contaminated. 

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms

. 

Lilium occidentale

 is listed as an endangered species in both California (Chapter 1.5,  2050 

et seq.

) and Oregon (ORS 564.100_564.135; OAR 603-73-005 

et seq

.), and is included in the Oregon Wildflower Protection Act (ORS 564.020). In California, the ``take'' of State-listed
plants is prohibited, but the law exempts the taking of such plants via habitat modification or land use change by the
landowner. After the California Department of Fish and Game notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant grows
on his or her property, State law requires only that the landowner notify the agency ``at least 10 days in advance of
changing the land use to allow salvage of such plant'' (Chapter 1.5,  1913). In Oregon, the ``take'' of State-listed
plants is prohibited only on State-owned or -leased lands. Enforcement of State endangered species laws is inadequate,
as is evident from the list of recent depredations in Factor C above, and from the ``take'' of lilies by activities of
the city of Brookings on Oregon Department of Transportation land, as described in Factor A above. The seriousness
of the problem of enforcement is underscored by the fact that this lily population on State land was twice subjected
to destruction, although all involved parties were informed of the presence of the rare lily after the first incident.




Lilium occidentale 

grows in wetland habitat. Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates
the discharge of fill into the waters of the United States, including wetlands. The Clean Water Act requires project
proponents to notify the Corps and obtain a permit prior to undertaking many activities (e.g., grading, discharge
of soil or other fill material, etc.) that would result in the fill of wetlands under the Corps' jurisdiction. 

The Corps promulgated Nationwide Permit No. 26 (33 CFR 330, Appendix A) to address fill of isolated or headwater wetlands
totalling less than 10 acres. Where fill would adversely modify less than 10 acres of wetland, the Corps circulates
a predischarge notification to the Service and other interested parties for comment to determine whether or not an
individual permit should be required for a proposed fill activity and associated impacts. The Corps must respond
within 30 days or the proposed activity will be authorized under the nationwide permit.

<TEXT>
 

Individual permits are required for the discharge of fill material that would fill or adversely modify greater than
10 acres of wetlands or any size wetland if proposed or listed species are present and could be adversely affected by
the proposed activity. The review process for the issuance of individual permits is more rigorous than for nationwide
permits. Unlike nationwide permits, an analysis of cumulative wetland impacts is required for individual permit
applications. Resulting permits may include special conditions that require avoidance or mitigation of environmental
impacts. On nationwide permits, the Corps has discretionary authority to require an applicant to seek an individual
permit if the Corps believes that the resources are sufficiently important, regardless of the wetland's size. In
practice, the Corps rarely requires an individual permit when a project would qualify for a nationwide permit, except
when a threatened or endangered species or other significant resource would be adversely affected by the proposed
activity. 

Most of the populations of 

Lilium occidentale 

occur in wetlands that are less than 10 acres in size. Many are only a few square yards, and many are in wetlands with no
surface drainage to streams (i.e., ``isolated''). Therefore, filling them could fall under Nationwide Permit No.
26. If 

L.

 

occidentale 

is listed as endangered, formal consultation with the Service would be required before the Corps could issue an individual
section 404 permit that may adversely affect the lily. 

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. 

The primary long-term natural threat to 

Lilium occidentale i

s competitive exclusion by shrubs and trees as a result of succession in bogs and coastal prairie/scrub. Human activities
such as draining of wetlands, clearing of land, elimination of beaver, and stabilization of moving sand areas have
interrupted the natural processes of bog and wetland creation. As late-stage bogs and coastal scrub go through succession
to forest, lily habitat is eliminated with little new habitat being created. There is some indication that 

L. occidentale 

populations have been maintained in the past by periodic fires, perhaps set by native Americans (Schultz 1989). Charcoal
is abundant in the soil at several of the major populations, indicating past fires. Fires are now rare events in these
areas. 

Young plants of this species are almost always recruited under shrub cover, but the lily is shaded out if the canopy
cover is greater than 50 percent or shrubs are over 2 meters (6 ft) high. Several populations and portions of populations
have already been extirpated by forest succession. Eleven populations (ranging from 2 to about 1,000 plants) currently
are seriously stressed from competition, as indicated by low reproductive rates (Schultz 1989). Individual plants
do not flower every year, apparently as an energy-saving mechanism when stressed. Health of a population can be evaluated
by the number of flowering versus non-flowering plants, and the number of blooms per plant. It has been suggested that
the 11 stressed populations would probably survive less than a decade without habitat manipulation (Schultz 1989).
Invasion by the exotic shrub gorse (

Ulex europaeus

) into the bog habitat of 

Lilium occidentale 

has eliminated suitable habitat in Oregon near Blacklock Point (Ballantyne 1980). 

At four California ranch populations, livestock exclosure fences have solved the immediate problem of overgrazing
(Dave Imper, pers. comm., 1992). A limited amount of grazing may actually benefit the species by preventing succession.
Over time, without habitat management, forest succession within the exclosures would limit the lilies to the well-lighted
edges of the exclosures and reproduction would deteriorate. 

Some populations are so small (2 to 100 flowering plants) that loss of genetic variability is a threat. Plants with
genetic abnormalities such as 4-merous flowers, tepals replacing stamens, stamens replacing tepals, and double
flowers have been observed over two or more seasons at sites in both California and Oregon. The effects of inbreeding
may already be adversely affecting the viability of these small populations and remains a future threat to the plant
(Schultz 1989). 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by 

Lilium occidentale 

in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list 

L. occidentale 

as endangered. This species occupies an extremely restricted geographic range and is comprised of a total of 2,000
to 3,000 flowering individuals. Residential development, conversion of habitat to cranberry farms, shrub and tree
succession, overcollection, vandalism, overgrazing, and loss of genetic diversity threaten this plant with extinction.
Because the plant is in danger of extinction throughout its range, it fits the definition of endangered under the Act.


Critical habitat is not being designated for this species for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section
of this rule. 



Critical Habitat 



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time the species is listed. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat
is not presently prudent for this species. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,''


Lilium occidentale 

is threatened by taking. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the 

Federal Register

, as required for the designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to this species from take
or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to its decline and increase enforcement problems. The listing of this
species under the Act publicizes the rarity of the species and, thus, could make this plant attractive to researchers,
curiosity seekers, or collectors of wildflowers or rare plants. All involved parties and landowners have been notified
of the importance of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of the species' habitat will be addressed through
the recovery process and the section 7 consultation process. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical
habitat for this species is not prudent at this time because such designation would increase the degree of threat from
collecting or other human activities. 



Available Conservation Measures 


Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing results in public awareness and conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies,
private organizations, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and
cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection
required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed,
in part, below.

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation
provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to insure
that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed
species. If a Federal action may affect a listed species, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation
with the Service. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will become involved with this plant species after listing through its permitting
authority as described under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. By regulation, permits may not be issued where a federally
listed endangered or threatened species would be affected by the proposed project without first completing consultation
pursuant to section 7 of the Act. The presence of a listed species would highlight the national importance of these
resources. In addition, insurance of housing loans by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in areas that
presently support 

Lilium occidentale 

will be subject to review by the Service under section 7 of the Act. 
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61 and 17.62, set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to listed plant species. All prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply.
These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import
or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale
this species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possession the species from areas under
Federal jurisdiction. In addition, for plants listed as endangered, the Act prohibits the malicious damage or destruction
of any such species on lands under Federal jurisdiction; or removal, cutting, digging up, damaging, or destroying
of such plants in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, or in the course of any violation of a State criminal
trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR
17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered
plants under certain circumstances. Such permits are available for scientific purposes and to enhance propagation
or survival of the species. It is anticipated that trade permits might be sought because the species is in cultivation
and is very rare in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations regarding listed species and inquiries about prohibitions
and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits,
911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503/231-6241; FAX 503/231-6243). 


National Environmental Policy Act 


The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement,
as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining
the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

Atlantic Tuna Fisheries; Bluefin Tuna


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure of the General category fishery.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS has determined that the 1994 General category quota, minus a 65 metric tons (mt) set aside for a late season fishery
beginning September 15th, will be taken by August 14, 1994. Therefore, the General category fishery will be closed
effective at 0001 hours on Monday, August 15, 1994. This action is being taken to prevent overharvest of the quota established
for this fishery while providing an opportunity for areas that have not yet had an ample opportunity to harvest a fair
share of the quota beginning September 15, 1994. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Regulations implemented under the authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971 

et

 

seq

.) governing the harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction are found at
50 CFR part 285. Section 285.22 subdivides the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas recommended
U.S. quota among the various domestic fishing categories.


Implementing regulations for the Atlantic Tuna Fisheries at 50 CFR 285.22(a) provide for an annual quota of 531 mt
of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna to be harvested from the Regulatory Area by vessels permitted in the
General category. Of this amount, 65 mt are set aside for a late season fishery beginning September 15. The Assistant
Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, is required under  285.20(b)(1) to monitor the catch and landing statistics
and, on the basis of these statistics, to project a date when the catch of Atlantic bluefin tuna will equal the annual
quota minus 65 mt, and to publish a 

Federal Register

 document stating that fishing for, retaining, possessing, or landing Atlantic bluefin tuna under the early-season
quota must cease on that date at a specified hour, and not recommence until September 15th, whereupon a quota equal
to the difference between the annual quota and the estimated catch prior to September 15th will become available.
The General category has taken approximately 364 mt of its 531 mt quota as of August 10, 1994. While NMFS had calculated
an average catch in August of 12 mt per day, industry contacts have informed NMFS that catch per day has increased to
17 mt per day or more. Atlantic bluefin tuna are still abundant off of Maine and Massachusetts, the primary commercial
fishing grounds, and have not migrated offshore and further south. Effort by General category vessels remains high.
Based on the landing reports, it is projected that the quota of Atlantic bluefin tuna allocated for the General category,
minus a 65 mt set aside amount for the late season fishery will be reached by August 14, 1994. Fishing for, retention
of, possessing, or landing large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna by vessels in the General category must cease
by 0001 hours August 15, 1994. The intent of this action is to prevent overharvest of the quota established for this
fishery while helping continue traditional late summer and early fall fisheries and providing a fishing opportunity
in areas that have not yet had an ample opportunity to harvest a fair share of the quota.
Beginning September 15, 1994, in areas to be described and under conditions to be specified in a future document to
be filed with the Office of the Federal Register, vessels permitted in the General category may resume fishing for
Atlantic bluefin tuna at a catch rate of one large medium or giant bluefin tuna per day per vessel, until the set aside
allocation has been taken.

Northeast Multispecies Fishery 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; technical amendment.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to make corrections and clarifications to the regulations implementing Amendment 5 to
the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 5 to the FMP on September 27, 1993. Two measures
of the amendment were disapproved on September 30, 1993_one measure pertaining to a haddock possession limit, and
the other pertaining to winter flounder fishing in state waters. The remainder of Amendment 5 was approved on January
3, 1994. The final rule for Amendment 5 was published on March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9872). This action makes several corrections
and clarifications to that rule. 



Amendment 5 requires vessels in the Fleet days-at-sea (DAS) program, for multispecies trips longer than 24 hours,
to tie-up (layover) at the dock at the end of each trip for half the amount of DAS accrued on the trip. Since many vessels,
when in harbor, tie-up at a mooring instead of a dock and/or move between locations in the harbor to attend to operational
needs such as refueling, a definition for ``tied-up to the dock'' has been added to  651.2 to clarify that a vessel
may be tied to either a mooring or a dock and may move between locations in the same harbor during its layover period.
This definition complies with the objectives of the FMP. 

From March 1 through July 31, vessels in the Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge (SB/JL) juvenile protection area are
required by  651.20(a)(5) to have 6-inch (15.24-cm) square mesh in the last 140 bars of the codend and extension
piece of all mobile net gear. The final regulation inadvertently did not define square mesh. To clarify the square-mesh
requirement, a definition of ``square mesh'' has been added to  651.2. 

The final rule for Amendment 5 set forth how diamond mesh would be measured for enforcement purposes but inadvertently
omitted the measurement technique for square mesh. Language is added to  651.20(g) to set forth the measurement
technique for square mesh. 

The regulations implementing Amendment 5 allow vessels fishing for non-regulated species, in the regulated mesh
areas, to obtain an exemption permit to fish with midwater trawl or purse seine gear. Although the FMP only requires
such a permit in those areas that do not allow the stowage of small-mesh nets, the regulations are not clear and seem
to require that such a permit be obtained for all areas. Sections 651.20(e) and 651.20(f) are revised to remove that
ambiguity. 

According to the regulations as now written, a vessel, while its DAS are being appealed, may fish under the Fleet DAS
program until a determination is made on the appeal. The regulations are not explicit, however, on whether a vessel
that has received an initial allocation of individual DAS may fish pursuant to that initial allocation during an appeal
of the amount of DAS allocated. In such a case, the vessel has received, independent of the appeal, authorization to
fish under the individual DAS program. The fact that the vessel may be appealing the amount of DAS allocated does not
preclude the vessel from fishing the individual DAS that are not in dispute. The regulations as originally written
were intended only to define the rights of vessels that otherwise would not have any significant allocation of DAS
while an appeal was pending. To clarify the intent,  651.22(b)(7) is revised to specify that vessels may elect
to fish under the individual DAS program, while under appeal, if they have been initially allocated individual DAS,
provided they do not exceed their initial allocation of DAS and remain in the individual DAS program for the remainder
of the 1994-95 fishing season. 

In the October 27, 1993, proposed rule for Amendment 5 (58 FR 57774), dealer, operator and vessel permits were to expire
upon the date specified in the permit. This was done to eliminate unnecessary renewal burdens to permit holders and
to give the Regional Director the flexibility to deal efficiently with the administrative burden associated with
permit renewals. The final regulatory language inadvertently specified that permits must be renewed annually.
This was not the intent. Accordingly, changes are made to  651.4(i),  651.5(g), and  651.6(f) to
remove the annual renewal requirement. 

A prohibition concerning the reporting requirements in  651.7(b)(1) was inadvertently omitted and is added
at  651.9(a)(14). This prohibition requires federally permitted multispecies vessel operators to sell,
barter, or trade multispecies finfish only to federally permitted multispecies dealers. This prohibition mirrors
a prohibition at  651.9(e)(7) that prohibits federally permitted dealers from purchasing, possessing, or
receiving multispecies from a vessel that does not hold a Federal multispecies permit, with the exception of vessels
that fish exclusively in state waters. 

The regulation implementing Framework Adjustment 4 to the 
FMP (59 FR 26972) implemented a series of time and area closures for the sink gillnet fishery. Since these regulations
prohibit sink gillnet operators from possessing gillnet gear aboard their vessel while in the areas and for the times
specified in 
 651.32(a), vessels would be prevented from transiting a closed area while in possession of gillnet gear. Based
on a review of the record, it is clear that the Council did not intend that gillnet vessels be precluded from accessing
open areas. This action clarifies the Council's intent by adding language that will allow for net stowage pursuant
to  651.20(c)(4) so that a gillnet vessel may transit a closed area. The Regional Director, pursuant to  651.20(c)(4)(iv)
may specify by letter to permit holders additional methods for lawfully storing gillnet gear while transiting a closed
area. 

 Currently,  651.30 prohibits the transfer at sea of multispecies finfish. A review of the record revealed that
this prohibition should have been limited to the transfer of regulated species. Section 651.30(a) and  651.30(b)
have been revised to correct this error, as have the corresponding prohibitions in  651.9(a)(7) and  651.9(e)(5).


Finally, this action accomplishes three other corrections: The metric conversion for winter flounder in  651.23(a)
is corrected; in  651.22(c)(1)(i)(B), ``multispecies'' is replaced by ``regulated species;'' and clearer,
more detailed versions of figures 1 and 3 are provided.

Because this rule only corrects omissions and other errors or makes clarifications of intent to an existing set of
regulations for which full prior notice and opportunity for comment have been given, no useful purpose would be served
by providing prior notice and opportunity for comment for this rule. Accordingly, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) it is unnecessary
to provide such notice and opportunity for comment. 

All but one provision of this rule impose no new requirements on anyone subject to these regulations and many provisions
remove or relieve restrictions. Accordingly, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), they may be made immediately effective. Section
651.9(a)(14) adds a new prohibition which is effective 30 days from the date of filing with the Office of the Federal
Register. 

This rule is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.

(i) 

Vessels fishing under the Fleet DAS program during appeal. 

Any DAS spent fishing for regulated species by a vessel that has elected the Fleet DAS program while that vessel's initial
DAS allocation is under appeal, shall be counted against the Individual DAS allocation that the vessel may ultimately
receive. If, before this appeal is decided, a vessel exceeds the number of days it is finally allocated after appeal,
the excess days will be subtracted from the vessel's allocations of days in fishing year 1995.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule implements changes to Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) procedures that relate
to carrying firearms, expanding the arrest and service of process authority of immigration officers beyond matters
involving violations of the immigration laws, and requiring that every alien fourteen years of age or older, against
whom deportation proceedings are commenced, shall be fingerprinted and photographed and that such fingerprints
and photographs shall be made available to other law enforcement agencies upon request. This rule also codifies existing
policy guidelines regarding the authority of immigration officers under the direction and control of the Attorney
General to arrest persons, carry firearms, serve process, and perform other related enforcement functions. The
final rule affairs both existing and newly-developed policies and ensures the consistent application of these policies
by all immigration officers involved in the enforcement of the immigration laws.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 14, 1992, at 57 FR 47011-47020, the Attorney General published a proposed rule to implement section
503 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law No. 101-649 (8 U.S.C. 1357), and requested comments from
interested parties by November 30, 1992. Section 503(a) of IMMACT amended section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality
Act (Act). Section 503(a) authorizes immigration officers, when performing duties relating to the enforcement
of the immigration laws and when authorized under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, to arrest without
a warrant any person likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained, for any offense against the United States committed
in the officer's presence or for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States if the officer has reasonable
grounds to believe the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such a felony. Section 503(a) of IMMACT
also authorizes immigration officers, under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, to carry firearms
and to execute and serve any orders, warrants, subpoenas, summonses, or other process issued under the authority
of the United States.



Section 503(b) of IMMACT requires fingerprinting and photographing of any alien fourteen years of age or older against
whom deportation proceedings have been commenced under section 242 of the Act, and dictates that such fingerprints
be made available to law enforcement agencies upon request. Finally, section 503(a) of IMMACT requires, as a condition
of immigration officers' authority to make warrantless arrests under amended section 287(a)(5)(B) for felonies,
the Attorney General to publish final regulations that define the categories of immigration officers who may use
force, including deadly force, and the circumstances under which such force may be used; establish standards with
respect to enforcement activities of the Service; require that no immigration officer be authorized to make arrests
under section 287(a)(5)(B) of the Act unless that officer has been certified as having completed a training program
covering such arrests and standards and establish an expedited internal review process for violations of such standards.

The proposed rule set forth regulations implementing these provisions of section 503 of IMMACT. A total of 235 comments
were received, reviewed, and considered in writing this final rule.



General Issues



Five commenters stated that the proposed rule failed to comply with section 4(b) of E.O. 12291 as it relates to the comments
of persons directly affected by the rule, and sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of E.O. 12778 as they relate to adherence to
certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations.

Many of the provisions of E.O. 12291 pertain only to major rules. In the proposed rule, the Attorney General stated
that this rule is not a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291. Therefore, section 4(b) of that Executive
Order is inapplicable. With regard to E.O. 12778, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a Memorandum for
Agency Regulatory Contacts dated January 9, 1992, stating that there are two ways that an agency may certify compliance
to OMB as part of the regulatory review process. An agency may attach a certification of compliance with E.O. 12778
to Standard Form 83 signed by an attorney, or an agency may insert a statement of such certification in the preamble
to the draft rule itself. The Department of Justice (Department), following review of the rule in light of E.O. 12778
and in compliance with that Executive Order, attached a certification of compliance. Accordingly, the Department
and the Service believe that the requirements of E.O. 12291 (which was superseded by E.O. 12866 on September 30, 1993),
12866, and 12778 have been met.

One commenter stated that the proposed rule may be in violation of the Service's contract with its collective bargaining
unit because the required negotiations have not occurred regarding those aspects of the rule that constitute substantive
changes in conditions of employment affecting the bargaining unit. During development of the final rule, negotiations
occurred with both the National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council and the National Border Patrol Council.

One commenter asserted that the existing Service Firearms Policy could not be changed because it constituted an agreement
with the employee unions. The Service disagrees because there is no agreement between it and the employee unions regarding
the existing Service Firearms Policy.

One commenter pointed out that the proposed rule failed to indicate whether the regulations would preempt state or
local laws regarding peace officer status. The regulations implement new statutory authorities pertaining to arrests
and service of process for federal matters and would not affect current practices with states. State law may provide
immigration officers with peace officer status that would also provide the authority to make arrests for state law
violations. However, unless specifically authorized as a peace officer under state law, an immigration officer's
authority to enforce the state statute is that of an ordinary citizen. The limitations and liabilities associated
with such action are defined in state law.

One commenter stated that the proposed regulations appeared to conflict with sections 101(a)(18) and 235 of the Act
as they relate to the definition of ``immigration officer'' and an immigration officer's authority to administer
oaths, take and consider evidence, and require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and production
of documents. The Service disagrees. Section 101(a)(18) of the Act authorizes the Attorney General to designate,
individually or by regulation, any employee or class of employees to perform the functions of an immigration officer
specified by the Act or any section thereof. In the proposed regulations, the Attorney General accomplished this
by designating those categories of immigration officers authorized to perform the functions of sections 242 and
287 of the Act. The commenter stated incorrectly that  287.5(a) of the proposed rule required certain immigration
officers to obtain individual or class designation in order to be authorized to interrogate and administer oaths.
The proposed rule in  287.5(a) allowed any immigration officer as defined in 8 CFR 103.1(q) to interrogate and
administer oaths. With regard to subpoenas, the proposed rule made no changes to the current regulations in  287.4
pertaining to the subpoena process.

A number of commenters criticized the proposed rule for not providing a sufficient statement of the legislative history
of section 503 of IMMACT in the Summary section. An adequate description of the requirements of section 503 was provided
by the notice of proposed rulemaking in the Supplementary Information section of the rule in accordance with the Federal
Register's document drafting requirements.

One commenter recommended that the effective date of the final rule for other than permanent full-time (OTP) immigration
inspectors be extended to two years from date of publication in the 

Federal Register

 is order to have sufficient time to provide both basic immigration law enforcement training and training in the new
enforcement standards. Such an extension is impracticable as many permanent full-time immigration officers will
also need to receive both basic immigration law enforcement training and training in the new enforcement standards.
It would be inappropriate to allow the OTP immigration officers to take more time in meeting the training timetable
than the permanent full-time employees because this would result in having OTP immigration inspectors operating
under the old regulations while working side by side with permanent full-time immigration inspectors recently trained
in, and operating under, the new regulations. This situation would not only promote procedural inconsistencies
and confusion, but also subject the public to two different regulatory standards at ports of entry. The Attorney General
has delayed implementation of the final rule to one year from date of publication in order to ensure training of approximately
10,000 immigration officers in the new enforcement authorities and standards. The Attorney General recognizes
the difficulties inherent in meeting this rigorous training schedule. However, she is committed to ensuring a consistent
and unified implementation approach nationwide that only one delayed implementation date can provide.

Policy Issues


Sections 242.2 and 287.7_Apprehension, Custody, and Detention and Retainer Provisions


One commenter stated that the proposed rule was contradictory by requiring that an immigration officer successfully
complete basic immigration law enforcement training in order to be authorized to issue a detainer in   242.2(a)
and 287.7(a), yet not requiring the successful completion of basic immigration law enforcement training in order
to be authorized to issue an order to show cause in  242.1(a) or a warrant of arrest in  242.2(c). A detainer
is the mechanism by which the Service requests that the detaining agency notify the Service of the date, time, or place
of release of an alien who has been arrested or convicted under federal, state, or local law. The Service agrees with
the commenter that the standards for issuance of a detainer are no greater than those for issuance of an order to show
cause and a warrant of arrest for immigration violations. The final rule deletes the requirement of successful completion
of basic immigration law enforcement training for authorization to issue detainers. Training in immigration law
and procedure is necessary to issue detainers, but training as a law enforcement officer is not needed to effectively
conduct this portion of the immigration process. This does not eliminate the immigration officer's responsibility
to ensure that detainers are issued only to aliens who are amenable to exclusion or deportation proceedings.
Two commenters stated that the authority to issue a warrant of arrest in  242.2(c) should include the authority
to serve the warrant of arrest in  287.5(e)(2). The Service disagrees. Issuance of a warrant of arrest entails
signature by an authorized immigration officer, while service of the warrant entails a step-by-step process requiring
training and proficiency in service of process procedures. The two authorities are separate and distinct processes.


Section 287.1_Definitions


One commenter urged the inclusion of the Other Than Permanent Full-Time (OTP) Immigration Inspector Basic Training
Course in the definition of ``basic immigration law enforcement training'' in  287.1(g). The Service agrees
and this section has been amended accordingly. However, an OTP immigration inspector will not be authorized to make
arrests for federal offenses under section 287(a)(5) (A) and (B) of the Act until such time as he or she converts status
to permanent full-time and successfully completes training applicable to that position.
Four commenters urged the Service to expand the definition of ``basic immigration law enforcement training'' in
 287.1(g) to include prior law enforcement experience or training with other federal, state, or local agencies
as well as lengthy Service experience or other miscellaneous Service training courses apart from the basic training
courses. The Service acknowledges that successful completion of one or more training courses presented by the Federal
Government or a state-certified program may be substantially equivalent to basic immigration law enforcement training.
The final rule provides a mechanism for considering other training by expanding the definition of ``basic immigration
law enforcement training'' to include training that is substantially equivalent thereto as determined by the Commissioner
with the approval of the Deputy Attorney General. The Commissioner's review is necessary to ensure that each immigration
officer has all the required federal and, in particular, immigration law enforcement training. For example, an immigration
officer who was employed previously in another Federal agency as a special agent, and thus had training in general
Federal laws, would still need immigration law enforcement training.


Sections 287.5 and 287.9_Exercise of Power by Immigration Officers and Criminal Search Warrant and Firearms Policies


Ninety-eight commenters expressed concern that the proposed regulations precluded immigration officers from
carrying firearms in   287.5(f) and 287.9(b), effecting arrests for immigration violations in   287.5(c)
(1), (2), and (5), and serving process in  287.5(e) while off duty. The commenters stated that it is not uncommon
for immigration officers or other federal law enforcement officers in an off-duty status to receive telephone calls
at home from other federal, state, or local law enforcement officers requesting their immediate assistance. The
commenters pointed out that only   287(a)(5) (A) and (B) of the Act, regarding arrest authority for federal
offenses, stipulate that an immigration officer must be ``performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration
laws at the time of the arrest'' and that this language should not be included in those sections of the proposed rule
regarding the other enforcement authorities. In drafting the proposed rule, the Service did not intend to impair
an immigration officer's ability to place himself or herself on duty when necessary for the purpose of enforcing the
immigration laws of the United States. To avoid misinterpretation, the Service has removed the language ``performing
duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest'' from the enforcement authorities
except where required by statute. The Service has also removed the language ``In an on duty status'' from  287.9(b).
Administrative guidelines will be developed to explain when an immigration officer on his or her own initiative may
place himself or herself in an on-duty status.

Fifty-two commenters objected to establishing a separate process for Service managers, including district directors,
deputy district directors, officers in charge, and assistant officers in charge, to request the Commissioner's
authorization to exercise each of the enforcement authorities. The commenters stated that this process would hold
managers to a higher standard than their subordinates, many of whom are trainees still on probation, who are automatically
empowered to exercise an authority if they have completed the requisite training. The commenters asserted that this
process violates standard management hierarchy, and pointed out that the vast majority of affected individuals
are career immigration officers who not only have completed basic immigration law enforcement training, but also
have extensive experience in field enforcement operations. In fact, due to the Service's limited enforcement resources,
these managers participate frequently in Service field enforcement operations or respond to requests for assistance
from other law enforcement agencies when their subordinates are out of the office conducting field operations. The
commenters asserted that managers in other agencies within the Department, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
are vested with the same powers and authorities as their subordinates, and the Service's managers should not be treated
differently if they have undergone the requisite training.



The Service and the Department agree that a more streamlined process should be established for granting enforcement
authorities to Service managers who are trained and who have maintained qualifications. The rationale behind the
proposed rule's segregation of managers was to ensure that law enforcement authorities are granted only to those
immigration officers, regardless of rank, who need the authorities and are fully trained in how to exercise them.
To accomplish this task more expediently while ensuring the existence of a well-trained cadre of immigration officers
at all levels in the agency, the final rule provides enforcement authorities to managers who have successfully completed
basic immigration law enforcement training without creating a separate authorization process. The final rule also
provides a mechanism for empowering those managers, as well as other immigration officers within one of the designated
categories, who have not successfully completed one of the basic immigration law enforcement training courses by
allowing them either to attend one of the basic immigration law enforcement training courses or to seek a determination
from the Commissioner, with the Deputy Attorney General's approval, that they have training substantially equivalent
thereto.




A number of commenters stated that each immigration officer should have the power to exercise all of the enforcement
authorities as long as each such officer is trained and certified. They stated that the proposed regulations created
a rigid class system wherein only certain categories of immigration officers would be authorized to exercise certain
enforcement functions and that this system impedes the Service's ability to respond to operational emergencies.
In addition, some commenters stated that the enforcement role of immigration inspectors at ports of entry and the
field review work and office interviews conducted by immigration examiners necessitate empowering both inspectors
and examiners with all of the enforcement authorities. The Service and the Department disagree. In drafting the proposed
rule, the Service used the Attorney General's ``Guidelines for Legislation Involving Federal Criminal Law Enforcement
Authority'' (Guidelines) dated June 29, 1984. Although the Guidelines were developed to guide federal agencies
in preparing legislative proposals concerning future grants of law enforcement authority, the Guidelines' overriding
policy is that an officer should be given only the authorities that the officer needs and has been trained to execute.
The Guidelines require an agency to extend grants of law enforcement authority only to those employees who have graduated
from an accredited course of training in the exercise of that authority and only where a significant likelihood exists
that, in the course of performing their assigned duties, the employees will frequently encounter situations in which
it is necessary to exercise that authority. Each category of immigration officers has a different mission, and only
those categories who satisfied the Attorney General's criteria were granted one or more of the enforcement authorities.
In reviewing these regulations, consistent with the Department's review of other regulations, guidelines, and
policies affecting criminal law enforcement authority in the Executive Branch, the Department believes that the
same delineation of authorities is both appropriate and effective. The following chart summarizes the categories
of immigration officers who are authorized to exercise the principal enforcement authorities.

Some commenters stated that immigration inspectors at ports of entry need the authority to execute arrest warrants
for immigration violations to conform with historical practices of the United States Attorneys offices. In light
of existing practices, the Service and the Department agree that immigration inspectors at ports of entry do need
to continue executing arrest warrants for both criminal and administrative immigration violations. However, immigration
inspectors do not need the authority to execute arrest warrants for non-immigration criminal violations. The investigation
of non-immigration criminal offenses associated with the authority to execute an arrest warrant for non-immigration
violations is beyond the scope of an immigration inspector's responsibilities. Accordingly, the structure of  287.5(e)
in the final rule has been changed to focus on the distinction between ``immigration'' and ``non-immigration'' offenses,
and to grant authority to immigration inspectors to execute arrest warrants for immigration violations.

The revised language of  287.5(e) also specifies, as the structure of the proposed rule specified, that detention
enforcement officers are authorized only to execute warrants of arrest for administrative immigration violations,
not warrants for a criminal arrest that can be executed by other officers. In carrying forward this distinction, the
Commissioner is authorized to designate additional officers (individually or as a class) to execute warrants of
arrest for administrative immigration violations, while approval of the Deputy Attorney General must be sought
to designate additional officers (individually or as a class) to execute criminal arrest warrants. Finally,  287.5(e)(2)(ii)
grants authority to execute criminal warrants of arrest for non-immigration violations only to border patrol agents,
special agents, deportation officers, their supervisors and managers, and immigration officers who need such authority
and who have been designated by the Commissioner with the approval of the Deputy Attorney General. 


Several commenters questioned the efficacy of granting immigration examiners the power to arrest for immigration
violations in   287.5(c) (1) and (2) yet not authorizing them to carry firearms in  287.5(f). Similarly,
other commenters stated it was inappropriate to authorize detention enforcement officers to carry firearms yet
preclude them from effecting any arrests. The Service and the Department disagree. The ability to effect an arrest
is not conditioned upon the carrying of a firearm. Other federal, state, and local law enforcement officers' duties
require them to make arrests without a firearm, and they do so without incident. Similarly, the potential need and
ability to use deadly force to defend an officer does not imply a concomitant need for arrest authority. The two authorities
are not necessarily concomitant. Detention enforcement officers do not need arrest authority. Detention enforcement
officers' principal duties are to transport and guard detained individuals who have already been placed under arrest.
They also execute warrants of arrest for administrative immigration violations. In order to clarify the detention
enforcement officers' authorities,  287.59(c)(6) has been added to the final rule.


Five commenters questioned whether immigration examiners and deportation officers who perform inspectional duties
at ports of entry on an overtime basis would be precluded from exercising the enforcement authorities granted to immigration
inspectors. Immigration examiners, including free trade examiners, and deportation officers are considered to
be immigration inspectors when in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising
other immigration inspectors performing inspections, provided all training requirements for immigration inspectors
have been met. To avoid misinterpretation, the Service has added language to the rule stipulating that immigration
examiners are authorized to exercise the same enforcement authorities granted to immigration inspectors when they
are in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising other immigration inspectors
performing inspections. Deportation officers are already listed as authorized to exercise the same enforcement
authorities granted to immigration inspectors, but  287.5(b) has been amended for clarification to include
deportation officers only when in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising
other immigration inspectors performing inspections.


Two commenters stated that certain immigration officers stationed in Service offices overseas should be granted
law enforcement authority. They also noted that immigration officers stationed overseas occasionally must work
on cases within the United States. The Service and the Department note, however, that immigration officers cannot
exercise any of the enforcement authorities while working in foreign countries. When overseas officers are assigned
to a duty post within the United States, they assume the power to exercise all of the criminal and civil enforcement
authorities assigned to the applicable category of immigration officers, provided all training requirements have
been met. For example, a special agent overseas who is detailed to an assignment in the United States has all of the enforcement
authorities granted to special agents, provided that the detailed special agent has met all training requirements
for special agents. However, overseas immigration officers do need the authority to interrogate, administer oaths,
and take and consider evidence. Accordingly,  287.5(a) in the final rule has been amended to grant such officers
authority to interrogate, administer oaths, and take and consider evidence in or outside the United States.

One commenter stated that the proposed rule in  287.8(c)(2) should be changed to remove the requirement that
the immigration officer must document, on appropriate Service forms, the fact that an arrestee was advised of his
or her rights. The commenter pointed out that many United States Attorneys accept advice of rights given in the presence
of witnesses in lieu of a form. The Service disagrees. Immigration officers must document advice of rights on appropriate
Service forms, consistent with the practice of other components within the Department. 

One commenter suggested that proposed  287.8(c)(2) incorrectly stated that a person arrested and charged
with a criminal violation shall be advised of the appropriate rights as required by law at the time of arrest, or as soon
thereafter as practicable. The commenter pointed out that current law requires that such warnings be provided only
prior to a custodial interrogation. The commenter further stated that many criminal arrests are made where the arresting
officer does not want to conduct a custodial interrogation and therefore should not be required to advise the person
arrested of the appropriate rights. The Service and the Department disagree with the commenter's interpretation
of the rule. First, the rule states that the person arrested shall be advised of the appropriate rights as required
by law. The law, including constitutional standards, determines when advice of rights must be provided. Second,
to the extent that the rule encourages a uniform advice of rights at or shortly after the point of arrest, it serves as
an appropriate reminder of these constitutional standards and establishes a practice that will prevent situations
where interrogations are wrongfully undertaken without proper advice of rights. 

One commenter stated that the definition of a designated pursuit vehicle in  287.8(e)(1) should stipulate
that the vehicle must be a sedan in order to conform to the Border Patrol Vehicle Pursuit Policy. The Service disagrees.
Other enforcement programs will be developing their own vehicle pursuit policies that may permit the use if vehicles
other than sedans. The proposed regulations authorized certain categories of immigration officers, including
special agents and deportation officers, to initiate a vehicular pursuit. In the final rule, special agents and deportation
officers have been removed from the list until such time as the Investigations and the Detention and Deportation Programs
have developed their specific vehicle pursuit policy, the policy is approved by the Commissioner, and all of the special
agents and/or deportation officers authorized to initiate vehicular pursuits have undergone the requisite pursuit
driving training and received training in the new policy. 



Section 287.10_Expedited Internal Review Process



One commenter questioned the legitimacy of the Service's Office of Internal Audit, starting that the Service is trying
to create by regulation an office similar in function to the Office of Professional Responsibility, which was transferred
from the Service to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department pursuant to section 102(d) of the Inspector
General Act Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-504. The Service and the Department disagree. The Office of Internal
Audit was established in the reorganization of the Service and approved by the Attorney General in April 1991. Regulations
have been drafted wherein the Director of Internal Audit is responsible, in part, for providing the capability to
investigate alleged misconduct by Service employees and for coordinating that program with other agencies within
the Department. The transfer of the Office of Professional Responsibility from the Service to the Office of the Inspector
General neither relieved Service management from responsibility for ensuring proper employee conduct nor precluded
Service management from exercising its fundamental management authorities to identify and correct employee misconduct.


One commenter stated that the proposed rule in  287.10 was insufficiently specific because it stated only that
allegations of misconduct would be referred ``promptly'' and did not: describe how the process for resolution would
be expedited; describe the circumstances under which a Service employee, against whom allegations were made, might
not be notified of the allegations; indicate that more serious allegations would be handled differently than less
serious ones; call for the involvement of operational peers or supervisors in resolving allegations; and eliminate
from involvement in the process management officials who lack law enforcement experience. It is not appropriate
to incorporate the specific requirements for the handling of alleged violations of the enforcement standards into
administrative rulemaking, and therefore, no change has been made to the final rule.

Legal Sufficiency


Sixty-nine advocacy organizations and individuals filed substantially similar or identical comments stating
that the regulations are legally insufficient to meet the legislative mandate set forth by Congress. These comments
are generally summarized below and followed by specific comments and responses.
The commenters stated that the regulations are legally insufficient because they fail to comply with the congressional
mandates: (1) to define the enforcement authority; (2) to elaborate on the scope and limits of such authority and to
formulate written policies, directives, rules, and regulations to ensure the exercise of that authority within
those limits; (3) to provide training for officers in how to exercise the discretionary authority granted; and (4)
to outline a formal procedure for agency accountability to the community when the authority has been exercised. The
commenters stated that the regulations are insufficiently specific and detailed on each of these subjects.
While the Service agrees with many of the suggestions regarding appropriate law enforcement standards as consistent
with Department policy applicable to all law enforcement agencies, the Service disagrees that these regulations
are either the appropriate vehicle to specify the detail of such standards, or that Congress mandated such a degree
of specificity. The commenters effectively requested that the Service and the Department provide specific guidelines
for discretionary decisions under other legal constraints and sound judgment, detailed procedures of daily operation,
and substantive training materials, timetables, and protocols that are encompassed in enforcement manuals, supervisory
review procedures, and training curricula. For reasons discussed in greater detail below, the Service will not provide
this information and guidance in regulatory form; the Department declines to make an exception to standing policies
for the management of the criminal justice system in the Executive Branch.
The suggestions made by these comments are appropriately directed to the functions of training and management, not
administrative rulemaking. The Service and the Department agree with many of these suggestions, and, as noted below,
have either incorporated them into existing training and management guidelines or are in the process of doing so.
A section-by-section discussion of these comments follows.


Section 287.1(g)_Training


The commenters criticized  287.1(g) for not providing sufficient detail regarding the substance of the training
that must be completed by Service officers prior to assuming the new enforcement authority provided by section 503
of IMMACT. The commenters noted that neither the course subjects, length, nor materials are specified, and stated
that the regulations should at the very least indicate how the curriculum of existing Service training programs will
be amended.
The commenters also alleged that ``nothing new'' is added by these regulations because all Service officers have
already completed one course of basic immigration law training. The commenters suggested that the regulations should
require that Service officers attend additional training before assuming additional enforcement authority. Finally,
the commenters suggested that the regulations should require periodic attendance by Service officers at national
or local training events devoted to new legal standards, case decisions, and Service interpretations of the law.
In response, the Service notes that these commenters appear to have assumed that Service officers who have previously
completed a course of basic immigration law enforcement training will not be required to undergo additional training
before being authorized to undertake the enhanced enforcement authority prescribed in section 503. However,  287.5(c)(4)(iii)
of the proposed rule specifically stated that no immigration officer could assume enhanced arrest authority until
the Director of Training had certified that the immigration officer had completed a training course encompassing
such arrests and the standards for enforcement activities specified in  287.8 of the regulations. Virtually
all affected officers will receive additional training during the planned one-year interval between the publication
in the 

Federal Register

 of this final rule and its effective date. This training is currently being developed in conjunction with other components
of the Department to ensure that the training is consistent with existing training on the execution of law enforcement
authorities and the investigative and prosecutorial policies of the Department.
The Service agrees that existing training courses in basic law enforcement should be amended to include the training
required by section 503; these curricula are in the process of being revised. Furthermore, the Service agrees that
officers should receive training throughout their careers regarding new statutes, legal precedent, and policies
for enforcement. Service guidelines and training programs will be continually updated to meet these needs. Precisely
because judicial precedent and the Department's investigative and prosecutorial policies are constantly evolving,
the Department concludes that it is not appropriate to further specify in regulations the curricula or frequency
of training programs. Moreover, daily supervision to ensure compliance with legal standards enunciated by Congress
and the courts is generally more effective and efficient than developing detailed statements in the form of regulations
that cannot provide guidance in all situations.

Sections 287.5(a)(1) and 287.8(b)_Power to Interrogate and Detain 


The commenters suggested that the concept of a ``show of authority'' to restrain the freedom of an individual to walk
away under  287.8(b)(1) be expanded to specifically include verbal or psychological abuse. The term ``show
of authority'' in the proposed rule was intended to emphasize the intimidating gestures are prohibited during pre-detention
questioning. However, the Service has decided to eliminate the term ``show of authority'' as well as the language
``by means of physical force'' in the final rule, thereby clarifying that any action taken by an immigration officer
during pre-detention questioning must not lead the person being questioned to believe that he or she is not free to
leave the presence of the officer. The Service's training program will ensure that all immigration officers have
a thorough understanding of proper procedures for conducting pre-detention questioning. 
The commenters also suggested that  287.8(b)(2) be substantially amended to include current judicial precedent
defining ``reasonable suspicion'' and the general authority to interrogate and detain. Binding judicial precedent
such as 

Brewer 

v. 

Williams, 

430 U.S. 387 (1977), is subject to revision in the ongoing process of litigation, and would not be appropriate to codify.



Sections 287.5(c) and 287.8(c)_Power and Authority to Arrest 


The commenters generally stated that the provisions in   287.5(c) and 287.8(c) do not incorporate the
``standard with respect to enforcement'' mandated by section 503 of IMMACT. The commenters suggested that the regulations
be amended to incorporate the judicial construction of ``reason to believe,'' and to require compliance with outstanding
court orders regarding arrest and post-arrest procedures. As stated previously, judicial precedent and other policy
standards are subject to revision and are not appropriate to codify. The Service is clearly bound by such interpretations,
including those set forth in 

Gerstein v. Pugh, 

420 U.S. 103 (1975). Furthermore, the Service is bound to comply with outstanding court orders, and a regulatory provision
to that effect is unnecessary. The commenters also suggested that the specific provisions of a temporary settlement
agreement in 

Lopez 

v. 

INS, 

No. CV 78-1912-WMB (C.D. Cal. August 24, 1992), be incorporated into the final rule. The Service declines
this suggestion for the previously stated reasons, as well as for the fact that nothing in the 

Lopez 

case has required the Service to promulgate regulations on this subject. 
One commenter criticized these sections for permitting individuals who have not fulfilled the statutory training
requirement for enhanced arrest authority to be designated as service officers with arrest authority. However,
all officers who are designated to have such authority must receive the appropriate training pursuant to   287.5(c)(4)
(iii)-(iv). The commenter also stated that  287.5(c)(5), in specifying the authority for arrests under
section 274 of the Act, failed to distinguish adequately between arrests with and without a warrant. However, this
section of the rule incorporates the enforcement standard regarding arrests set forth in  287.8(c), which
includes a rule requiring officers whenever possible to obtain a warrant prior to arrest. In criminal cases, pursuant
to  287.5(c) (2) and (3), the issuance of such a warrant is reviewed by an Assistant United States Attorney and
a Magistrate Judge before an arrest is effected. 


Sections 242.2(c)(1) and 287.5(e)(2)_Arrest Warrants


The commenters stated that  242.2(c)(1) should be amended to provide that an arrest warrant must be obtained
unless there is a likelihood of the alien escaping before a warrant can be obtained. This suggestion calls for codification
of the judicial precedents concerning exigent circumstances. For the reasons stated previously, the Department
does not deem it appropriate to amend this rule to reflect evolving judicial standards. Such standards are incorporated
into Service training programs, enforcement guidelines, and manuals. 
The commenters also suggested that the rule should specify which factors Service officers should use to determine
the likelihood of escape. This is the type of discretionary detail that is appropriate in a training course and manual,
but not in a regulation. Finally, the commenters suggested that evidence obtained in violation of rules requiring
warrants should be suppressed in civil deportation hearings. The Department declines to extend by regulation into
civil proceedings the exclusionary rule, which has heretofore been applied exclusively in criminal proceedings.


Sections 287.5(d)-(e) and 287.9(a)_Searches


The commenters stated that the rule should provide specific standards governing searches of persons and property
at or inside the border; strip and body cavity searches; vehicle stops and searches of persons and vehicles at or inside
the border; and searches of private dwellings and lands. Section 503 of IMMACT does not require such specificity in
enforcement regulations. Moreover, for that reasons set forth above, such standards will be appropriately addressed
in Service training programs, guidelines, and enforcement manuals.

Sections 242.2(a)(1) and 287.7(a)(1)_Detainers


The commenters stated that the authority for issuance of detainers in   242.2(a)(1) and 287.7(a)(1)
of the proposed rule was overly broad because the authority to issue detainers is limited by section 287(d) of the Act
to persons arrested for controlled substances offenses. This comment overlooked the general authority of the Service
to detain any individual subject to exclusion or deportation proceedings. 

See 

8 U.S.C. 1225(b), 1252(a)(1). The detainer authority of these sections of the proposed rule were promulgated pursuant
to this general authority. The statutory provision cited by the commenters places special requirements on the Service
regarding the detention of individuals arrested for controlled substance offenses, but does not delimit the general
detainer authority of the Service.


Section 287.8(d)_Vehicle Transportation


The commenters suggested that the Service install seat belts in all vehicles transporting people. Current regulations
under which all motor vehicles, except buses, are manufactured require the factory installation of seat belts. While
the Service strongly agrees with the substance of the suggestion, it would be inappropriate to include any additional
requirements within an administrative rule. The reference to seat belts has been deleted in the final rule because
the standard governing the use of seat belts will be thoroughly addressed in Service training programs, guidelines,
and enforcement manuals.


Section 287.8(e)_Vehicular Pursuits


The commenters stated that the provisions of this section provided inadequate protection to public safety from accidental
injury and death resulting from collisions following high-speed vehicular pursuits. The commenters suggested
that the rule provide that a vehicular pursuit may not be initiated ``when there is imminent danger to the life and safety
of innocent third parties.'' In response to a number of publicized incidents, the Service revised its guidelines
and procedures governing vehicular pursuits. However, it would be inappropriate for the Department to codify the
standard suggested by these commenters in the final rule. The standard is both unduly restrictive and underinclusive.
Actual operating standards for Service officers must permit greater discretion and also specify in greater detail
the criteria that should be considered in deciding whether to undertake a pursuit.
The commenter also suggested that officers should be required to successfully complete a separate course in vehicle
pursuit prior to having authority under this section. The Department agrees that only those officers specifically
trained in pursuit techniques should be authorized to undertake a vehicular pursuit. The only such officers at present
who have received such training are border patrol agents. Accordingly, this section has been amended to delete the
designations of special agents and deportation officers.

Section 287.8(f)_Site Inspections




The commenters stated that this section was legally insufficient and should provide more detailed requirements
concerning the obtaining of warrants and consent for site inspections, the determination of ``exigent circumstances,''
and standards and procedures for detention. Commenters specifically suggested that the rule incorporate judicial
precedent based on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution concerning the issuance of warrants, the obtaining of
consent to enter a premises, and the detention of persons subject to questioning; that officers engaged in site inspections
be trained in standards of enforcement and procedure pertaining to site inspections; that Service officers not deliberately
provoke flight by persons in order to justify entry onto a premises; and that Service officers avoid ``unnecessary
embarrassment'' of persons subject to site inspections, as well as verbal abuse, psychological abuse, threats,
and unnecessary physical force.


The Service agrees with the substance of most of the suggestions made by the commenters, but has not incorporated these
suggestions into the final rule. For the reasons stated previously, the Department does not consider it appropriate
to incorporate evolving judicial precedent into regulations. Such precedents are included in Service training
programs, guidelines, and enforcement manuals. In addition, many of the procedural suggestions made by these commenters
either are included in current Service training programs, guidelines, and enforcement manuals or will be considered
for inclusion in these materials.


The Department has also revised the ordering of the paragraphs within this section and has revised the text of paragraph
(2) in the proposed rule, now designated as paragraph (4). The purpose of these changes is to clarify that the conditions
set forth in this section for the conduct of site inspections do not restrict the authority of Service officers to enter
into any area of a business or other activity to which the general public has access or onto open fields that are not farm
or other outdoor agricultural operations without a warrant, consent, or any particularized suspicion.



Sections 287.5(f), 298.8(a) and 287.9_Use of Force and Firearms




The commenters criticized these provisions of the proposed rule on a number of grounds. The commenters stated that
the rule failed to address the 27 recommendations presented in the Audit Report, ``Immigration and Naturalization
Service Firearms Policy, September 1991,'' prepared by the Department's Office of the Inspector General, Audit
Division. The commenters asserted that the rule's statement that standards on the use of force are based on a force
continuum model taught at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is inadequate and that the rule should adopt
the recommendations of standards for law enforcement agencies developed by the Commission on Accreditation of Law
Enforcement Agencies. The commenters also stated that the rule was too narrow in its statement of the authority to
carry firearms; the commenters recommended that the rule adopt guidelines that reflect the ``multiple psychological
dimensions'' that might influence an officer's behavior. The commenters also urged that the rule incorporate a statement
of 15 Shooting Reduction Techniques published in 1985 by the American Bar Foundation. The commenters stated that
the principle of proportionality must be specifically set forth in the rule's guidelines on the use of force along
with more specific guidelines on the use of force in specific situations that immigration officers are likely to encounter.


The Service agrees that many of the recommendations made by the commenters are sound and should be incorporated into
the training of immigration officers. In fact, a significant portion of the Service firearms training program is
devoted to judgment shooting that includes providing specific scenarios that immigration officers are likely to
face. However, as a matter of Departmental policy, it is not appropriate to incorporate such detailed guidelines
for law enforcement activities into administrative rulemaking. Most of the recommendations made by the Inspector
General in the Audit Report have been, or are in the process of being, adopted or implemented by the Service. The commenters
noted that, in a letter dated August 7, 1991, the Commissioner stated that the issues raised by the Audit Report would
be addressed in the process of drafting these regulations. The recommendations of the Audit Report have been taken
into account in the formulation of this rule. Given the increased training that has been and is being developed, no
specific response to these recommendations is provided in the regulatory text.


Several of the commenters criticized the designation of certain Service officers to carry firearms. The Service
disagrees with the suggestion that there is no justification for immigration inspectors or deportation officers
to carry firearms; this authority is consistent with Department policy in the implementation of other criminal law
enforcement authorities. Such authority is commensurate with the responsibility of such officers to exercise general
arrest and control authority at frequent points of contact with potential criminal offenders. These officers have
also been authorized to carry firearms for many years. The same commenters criticized the rule's delegation to the
Commissioner of authority to designate certain other immigration officers to carry firearms, and stated that any
such designations must be the subject of proposed rulemaking in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA). Neither section 503 of IMMACT nor the APA requires such discretionary grants of law enforcement authority,
made within general guidelines set forth in regulations, to be the subject of rulemaking. Withdrawing the authority
to make such designations would constitute an unwarranted burden on effective law enforcement. Moreover, the Commissioner's
action is subject to approval by the Deputy Attorney General because the authority to carry a firearm is a traditional
criminal law enforcement authority, not an authority intrinsic to the Service.

The commenters also criticized  287.9(b) for failing to specify procedures to be followed in the investigation
of a shooting incident involving a Service officer and for failing to provide specific rules regarding loss or theft
of an approved firearm, inventory controls on firearms and ammunition, and care and storage of firearms and ammunition.
Section 287.9(b) of the proposed rule stated that these matters would be addressed in guidelines promulgated by the
Commissioner. It is the view of the Department that since all of these matters relate to internal administration,
review, and discipline, the level of detail suggested by the commenters is not appropriate for administrative rulemaking,
but should be addressed through operational guidelines. The requirement that these matters be governed according
to guidelines promulgated by the Commissioner satisfies the congressional mandate set forth in section 503 of IMMACT.

The commenters also criticized the authorization in  287.9(b) for Service officers to carry personally owned
firearms while on duty, claiming that this will blur the distinction between official and personal use of firearms
and inhibit Service control over the use of firearms. The proposed rule required that all firearms, including those
personally owned, be approved subject to guidelines to be promulgated by the Commissioner. The authority to utilize
a Service-approved, personally owned weapon is needed to respond to the physical diversity of the Service law enforcement
workforce, including specific individual characteristics such as the size of an agent's hand. For example, many
firearms do not comfortably fit in some smaller or larger hands. Accordingly, the rule is designed to allow flexibility
while assuring that each individual agent's firearm has been approved. This is consistent with Departmental policy
for the law enforcement community.



Section 287.8(a)(1)_Non-Deadly Force



Several commenters criticized the rule for providing insufficient guidelines on the use of non-deadly force and
insufficient inducements for the use of control devices, such as stun guns and gas guns, that do not inflict bodily
injury. The commenters also stated that the rule should provide specific requirements for the use of self-defense
equipment, including bullet-proof vests and helmets, by Service officers. The Service issues batons, tear gas,
bullet proof vests, and helmets to law enforcement agents, as appropriate, and as appropriated funds permit; the
Service does not issue stun guns, gas guns, or other such devices for routine law enforcement purposes. The Service
and the Department agree that immigration officers should be trained in a broad range of options in the use of force
in order to handle varying situations, that the use of lethal force should be minimized, and that Service officers
should be minimized, and that Service officers should be furnished with self-protection equipment and techniques.
Such standards cannot be appropriately addressed in rulemaking because of the numerous contingencies that are involved.
Service officers are trained in such matters and receive updates in their training to incorporate new law enforcement
techniques and new protective devices.



Section 287.8(a)(2)_Deadly Force



The commenters stated that deadly force is an extreme measure and should only be used when an officer reasonably believes
it is necessary in defense of human life, including the life of the officer or any person in immediate threat of serious
physical harm. To this end, the commenters stated that the rule should require specialized training in specific types
of situations to offer guidance to the officer in order to minimize the use of deadly force. Training should include
ethics, human rights, and alternatives to the use of force and firearms. ``Reasonable belief'' and ``serious bodily
injury'' should be defined, according to the commenters, by current judicial standards. The commenters stated that
the rule should require that where use of deadly force is likely, the officer should give a warning and allow sufficient
time for the warning to be obeyed, but only when the officer or other persons are not at risk.

The Department agrees with many of these suggestions. Furthermore, the rule is consistent with the Department's
interpretation of 

Tennessee

 versus 

Garner, 

471 U.S. 1 (1985), and its progeny, as applied to the missions of the respective Service officers. However, the Department
disagrees that these issues can be appropriately addressed in this rule. As stated previously, Service training
standards on the use of force are in accordance with prevailing guidelines for all federal law enforcement officials.
These guidelines include provisions addressing the issues identified by the commenters.

Section 287.10_Expedited Internal Review Process


The commenters criticized the expedited internal review process proposed in  287.10 as legally insufficient
on a number of grounds. The commenters criticized the proposed rule for incorporating current policies and procedures
of the Department's Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility, stating that
these policies and procedures do not provide safeguards that are ``accessible and thorough.'' The commenters stated
that the proposed rule provided inadequate notice to the public of its right to lodge complaints. The commenters suggested
that an outreach system, including posters, private telephone for detainers, and a 24-hour toll-free number staffed
by multi-lingual personnel be mandated in the final rule.
The commenters also stated that a formal procedure for notifying complainants of the receipt and disposition of their
complaints should be implemented by the rule. Confidentiality of complaints should be ensured to protect against
retaliation, and information obtained in the process of investigation complaints should be excluded from use against
the complainant in deportation or exclusion proceedings. The commenters stated that an official record of all complaints,
even unsubstantiated complaints, should be retained so that individual officers can be properly evaluated and,
if necessary, retrained, counseled, or investigated. Some of the commenters suggested that this information, including
unsubstantiated complaints, should be kept in the officer's official personnel file.
The commenters suggested that specific procedures for the investigation of complaints, including provisions for
public hearings in the case of serious charges, should be included in the rule. The commenters also stated that an appeals
process should be available in cases where complainants or Service officers are dissatisfied with an investigator's
report and recommendations. Several commenters also stated that the process for reviewing complaints against Service
officers must be improved in order to address allegations of human rights abuses by Service officers patrolling border
areas adjacent to Mexico.
In response, the Department notes that many of the suggestions made by these commenters are good practices that are
addressed in the policies and procedures of the Department's investigative organizations. However, many of the
specific recommendations regarding notification and timeliness in the completion of investigations are beyond
the scope of this rule and must be addressed in these internal policies and procedures. The Department disagrees with
the suggestion that an appeals process be provided. Sufficient review of investigatory reports is already provided
in the policies and procedures mentioned above. Under these policies and procedures, confidentiality will be maintained
in the course of these investigations. If cause for administrative action is found, the administrative process will
be followed, and if grounds for civil or criminal prosecution are found, the appropriate litigation will be undertaken.
The Department's investigative organizations currently have established procedures to protect the identities
of complainants and witnesses from disclosure to Service personnel. Records of unsubstantiated allegations will
be centrally maintained by the Service for the purposes identified in the comments and to provide a basis for management
review of the number of allegations that have been made to determine whether additional action should be taken at a
management level to improve operations and training, but these records will not be kept in an officer's official personnel
file.
The commenters also stated that implementation of this section of the rule should be immediate because the reasons
for allowing a one-year delay in the provisions of the rule governing enforcement authority do not apply to internal
review. The Service and the Department would be in a position to agree if, immediately upon publication of the final
rule, the standards were developed and the commensurate training was provided to designated immigration officers.
However, the purpose of the one-year delayed implementation period is to enable the Service to develop the standards,
provide the training, and certify all designated immigration officers. Because  287.10 creates an expedited
review process exclusively for violations of the standards that will be developed during the one-year implementation
period, the effective date of  287.10 must coincide with all other sections of the final rule. However, this
does not alter the established internal review process for alleged violations of existing enforcement policies
and procedures.
The commenters also expressed concern that  287.10(e) of the proposed rule, which would permit Department
components to supplement or expand policies and procedures to ensure proper conduct of Service employees and officers,
should not limit or undermine the regulations that govern the review of allegations of improper conduct by Service
employees and officers. Neither the Department nor the Service intended that  287.10(e) be so construed. It
is the intention of the Department to provide greater assurances that its officers and employees will conduct themselves
appropriately, not to diminish existing standards.


Section 287.11_Disclaimer


The commenters claimed that  287.11 would preclude victims of unlawful Service enforcement practices from
pursuing remedies for regulatory violations. However, this disclaimer merely states that the regulations provide
no independent grounds for relief in any civil or criminal proceeding by any party. It does not prevent any party from
pursuing relief for alleged violations of the Constitution or laws of the United States. As such, the disclaimer is
consistent with the holding in 

United States 

v. 

Caceres, 

440 U.S. 741 (1979). This disclaimer is a standard element for all regulations affecting substantive federal criminal
law enforcement authority and is only intended to ensure that the regulations do not create rights not otherwise existing
in law.

Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Attorney General, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this final
rule and, by approving it, certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.


Executive Order No. 12866


This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice or the Immigration and Naturalization Service to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under E.O. 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of Management
and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A).


Executive Order No. 12612


The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with E.O. 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Executive Order No. 12606


The Attorney General certifies that she has assessed this rule in light of the criteria in E.O. 12606 and has determined
that this rule will not have an impact on family formation, maintenance, or general well-being.

Interrogation and detention not amounting to arrest. 

(1) Integration is questioning designed to elicit specific information. An immigration officer, like any other
person, has the right to ask questions of anyone as long as the immigration officer does not restrain the freedom of
an individual, not under arrest, to walk away.

(2) If the immigration officer has a reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts, that the person being
questioned is, or is attempting to be, engaged in an offense against the United States or is an alien illegally in the
United States, the immigration officer may briefly detain the person for questioning.

(3) Information obtained from this questioning may provide the basis for a subsequent arrest, which must be effected
only by a designated immigration officer, as listed in  287.5(c). The conduct of arrests is specified in paragraph
(c) of this section.

(c) 

Conduct of arrests.

 (1) 

Authority. 

Only designated immigration officers are authorized to make an arrest. The list of designated immigration officers
varies depending on the type of arrest as listed in  287.5(c)(1) through (c)(5).

(i) An arrest shall be made only when the designated immigration officer has reason to believe that the person to be
arrested has committed an offense against the United States or is an alien illegally in the United States.

(ii) A warrant of arrest shall be obtained whenever possible prior to the arrest.

(iii) At the time of the arrest, the designated immigration officer shall, as soon as it is practical and safe to do so:

(A) Identify himself or herself as an immigration officer who is authorized to execute an arrest; and 

(B) State that the person is under arrest and the reason for the arrest.

(iv) With respect to an alien arrested and administratively charged with being in the United States in violation of
law, the arresting officer shall adhere to the procedures set forth in  287.3 if the arrest is made without a warrant,
and to the procedures set forth in  242.2(c)(2) of this chapter if the arrest is made with a warrant.

(v) With respect to a person arrested and charged with a criminal violation of the laws of the United States, the arresting
officer shall advise the person of the appropriated rights as required by law at the time of the arrest, or as soon thereafter
as practicable. It is the duty of the immigration officer to assure that the warnings are given in a language the subject
understands, and that the subject acknowledges that the warnings are understood. The fact that a person has been advised
of his or her rights shall be documented on appropriate Service forms and made a part of the arrest record.

(vi) Every person arrested and charged with a criminal violation of the laws of the United States shall be brought without
unnecessary delay before a United States magistrate judge, a United States district judge or, if necessary, a judicial
officer empowered in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 3041 to commit persons charged with such crimes. Accordingly, the

(vii) The use of threats, coercion, or physical abuse by the designated immigration officer to induce a suspect to
waive his or her rights or to make a statement is prohibited.

(d) 

Transportation. 

(1) 

Vehicle transportation.

arrested or detained are being transported by vehicle, each person will be searched as thoroughly as circumstances
permit before being placed in the vehicle. The person being transported shall not be handcuffed to the frame or any
part of the moving vehicle or an object in the moving vehicle. The person being transported shall not be left unattended
during transport unless the immigration officer needs to perform a law enforcement function.

of such residence, or a farm or other outdoor agricultural operation, except as provided in section 287(a)(3) of the
Act, for the purpose of questioning the occupants or employees concerning their right to be or remain in the United
States unless the officer has either a warrant or the consent of the owner or other person in control of the site to be
inspected. When consent to enter is given, the immigration officer must note on the officer's report that consent
was given and, if possible, by whom consent was given. If the immigration officer is denied access to conduct a site
inspection, a warrant may be obtained.
(3) Adequate records must be maintained noting the results of every site inspection, including those where no illegal
aliens are located.
(4) Nothing in this section prohibits an immigration officer from entering into any area of a business or other activity
to which the general public has access or onto open fields that are not farms or other outdoor agricultural operations
without a warrant, consent, or any particularized suspicion in order to question any person whom the officer believes
to be an alien concerning his or her right to be or remain in the United States.


 287.9

Criminal search warrant and firearms policies.


(a) A search warrant should be obtained prior to conducting a search in a criminal investigation unless a specific
exception to the warrant requirement is authorized by statute or recognized by the courts. Such exceptions may include,

and border searches. The Commissioner shall promulgate guidelines governing officers' conduct relating to search
and seizure.

Milk in the New England and Other Marketing Areas; Amplified Decision 






<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Amplified Decision. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 14, 1994, the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota issued a memorandum opinion and order
that, in part, directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue an amplified decision that more fully explains the conclusions
reached in a final decision published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 5, 1993. This amplified decision responds to that order and supplements and clarifies the findings and conclusions
of the final decision. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557 and therefore is excluded from the
requirements of Executive Order 12866. 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a final rule on
small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Each order,
as amended, will promote more orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have a retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674) (AMAA), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the AMAA, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the
order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The AMAA provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's
ruling on the petition, provided a complaint is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.


When the administrative proceeding in this matter was initiated, the Notice of Hearing listed separately the Lubbock-Plainview,
Texas (Part 1120); the Texas Panhandle (Part 1132); and Rio Grande Valley (Part 1138) orders. A hearing on a merger
of these three orders was held in December 1989. As a result of that hearing, the three orders were merged effective
December 1, 1991, under the name of the New Mexico-West Texas order, which is 7 CFR Part 1138. Therefore, all proposed
order language in connection with this proceeding is in terms of the merged order. In this and future documents in this
proceeding, the New Mexico-West Texas order will replace the three orders named above.

Preliminary Statement 



A public hearing was held upon proposed amendments to the marketing agreements and the orders regulating the handling
of milk in the New England and other marketing areas. The hearing was held, pursuant to the provisions of the AMAA and
the applicable rules of practice (7 CFR Part 900), at Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Cloud, Minnesota;
Syracuse, New York; Tallahassee, Florida; and Irving, Texas, on September 5, 1990, through November 20, 1990. Notice
of such hearing was issued on July 11, 1990, and published July 17, 1990 (55 FR 29034). 

Upon the basis of the evidence introduced at the hearing and the record thereof, the Administrator, on November 6,
1991, issued his recommended decision containing notice of the opportunity to file written exceptions thereto.
Following the submission of exceptions and comments on the recommended decision, a final decision was issued on February
5, 1993. 



General Basis for This Amplified Decision 



On April 14, 1994, the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota issued a memorandum opinion and order.
The Court held that the Secretary of Agriculture's final decision for the ``1990 National Hearing'' on amending Federal
milk orders was deficient in part. The Court found that the Secretary's decision to retain the existing Class I pricing
structure was tantamount to a finding that the structure continued to satisfy the requirements of the AMAA as set out
in section 608c(18). The Court stated that this conclusion might or might not be supported by the substantial evidence
from the 1990 National Hearing, but since the explicit findings and explanations relative to the  608c(18)
factors were not issued, the Court was unable to make that determination. The final decision was remanded to the Secretary
for 120 days for filing of an amplified decision. 

This amplified decision provides additional findings and conclusions that address the material issue on the record
of the 1990 National Hearing concerning Class I milk pricing and related issues. This document provides an amplified
explanation of why the Secretary decided to not change the Class I pricing structure of Federal milk marketing orders
and that such determination is consistent with the pricing requirements of section 608c(18) of the AMAA.

Findings, Explanations, and Conclusions 



The following findings, explanations, and conclusions on the material issues are based on evidence presented at
the hearing and the record thereof: 



Statutory Price Factors 



7 U.S.C. 608c(18) states: 

Whenever the Secretary finds, upon the basis of the evidence adduced at the hearing required by section 608b of this
title or this section, as the case may be, that the parity prices of such commodities are not reasonable in view of the
price of feeds, the available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand
for milk and its products in the marketing area to which the contemplated agreement, order, or amendment relates,
he shall fix such prices as he finds will reflect such factors, insure a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome milk
to meet current needs and further to assure a level of farm income adequate to maintain productive capacity sufficient
to meet anticipated future needs, and be in the public interest. 




The statute mandates a two-step analysis for determining the appropriate level of prices under Federal milk market
orders. The first step involves ascertainment of parity prices. If the Secretary finds that the parity price levels
are not reasonable, then the second step requires investigation of appropriate price levels. Both pricing standards
require recognition of explicit statutory factors, namely the price of feeds, the available supplies of feeds, and
other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand. 

Parity prices are, and have been, at a level that is significantly higher than the prices applicable in competitive
milk markets. At the administrative hearing, official notice was requested and granted for a regular publication
of the United States Department of Agriculture titled ``Dairy Situation and Outlook Yearbook'', DS-426, Economic
Research Service, August 1990. On page 10, Table 1._United States dairy situation at a glance, annual average numbers
are listed for prices received by farmers (all-milk price for milk sold to plants) and how this price level relates
to the parity price measure. The statistics reveal that over the 7-year period from 1983 through 1989, the simple average
all-milk price was approximately 55 percent of the value of the calculated parity price level. These statistics show
that the calculated parity price levels relative to the all-milk price would be excessively high because more than
ample supplies of milk were available for all uses at prices far below the parity price level, and thus, the parity price
is not reasonable. This finding was set forth in the final decision at 58 FR 12675. Accordingly, the second step of the
section 608c(18) analysis was undertaken. The second step of price determination requires a more in-depth analysis
of dairy market structure. The statute allows the Secretary to decide the price levels that will achieve articulated
market performance goals: the chosen prices must ensure a sufficient supply of pure and wholesome milk to meet current
and future market needs and be in the public interest. As outlined below, the Secretary conducted an extensive analysis
of each individual marketing order in light of the statutorily-required dairy market performance goals. 

As required by 7 U.S.C. 608c(18), any administratively recognized price level must reflect the price of feeds, the
available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions that affect market supply and demand. The key economic
concept focuses on supply and demand. Milk markets consist of both buyers and sellers, the buyer representing a demand
for what the seller can supply. Each side could be studied independently. However, it is the simultaneous consideration
of all sides of the market that the Secretary must address when regulating dairy markets and in determining reasonable
price levels. 

To this end, federal order markets utilize an unregulated and competitive market equilibrium price that measures
all economic factors affecting the supply of and demand for milk and its products that captures all of the pricing criteria
established by section 608c(18). As discussed below, this price is embodied in the Minnesota-Wisconsin (M-W)
price. This price indicates the price-quantity relationship that buyers and sellers arrive at in a market where transactions
are free of government intervention, the competition for milk is the most competitive, and milk products produced
compete in a national market. The M-W price automatically adjusts to prevailing market supply and demand conditions.




The Minnesota-Wisconsin (M-W) Price 



Prior to adoption of the M-W price, federal milk orders relied upon various procedures to establish a basic milk
price. Using different measures, each of these procedures attempted to identify the competitive value of milk used
for manufacturing purposes. For example, certain orders variously based class prices on prices paid by specific
manufacturing plants, such as the Midwestern Condensary Series; on local plant averages; on a three-product U.S.
manufacturing price; or on product formulae, such as the butter/powder or butter/cheese formulae. 

One major problem with these pricing methods was the difficulty in keeping the pricing methods up-to-date with changes
taking place within the dairy industry. For example, varying local needs required that some milk be shipped from plants
to meet fluid demands and thus skewed plant-based formulae by affecting yields and prices of manufactured products
produced from reserve milk. Moreover, cost factors, which do not lend themselves to accurate evaluation or precise
and timely measurement, also complicated efforts to utilize efficiently these various formulae. Changes in labor
costs and technology similarly could not be reflected in these product price formulae in a timely fashion.

Thus, there was growing recognition that a competitive pay price which would automatically adjust to prevailing
supply and demand conditions (including feed cost and availability) would provide the most practical and reasonable
answer to shortcomings in the then-existing pricing methods. The superiority of using a competitive pay price rests
upon the economic principle that dairy processors in a highly competitive economy will tend to purchase milk at prices
close to the price an efficient processor could pay for that product. Increasing labor and other costs tend to reduce
prices that processors are willing to pay for milk. On the other hand, new assembling, processing, packaging and marketing
techniques that reduce costs or increase product returns tend to increase the prices processors are willing to pay
producers for milk. As these factors fluctuate, shifts occur in the prices that different processors may be able to
pay producers. Other groups of processors must meet or approximate these prices or risk losing their supplies of milk.
Similarly, various economic factors affecting producers (i.e., taxes, inflation, feed costs, capital assets costs,
salaries, etc.) are automatically reflected in the competitive price that producers are willing and able to charge
for their milk. Therefore, a competitive pay price was and is viewed as an excellent and superior indicator of the upward
and downward adjustments in costs which are automatically reflected in market prices paid to producers for their
milk. 

The M-W price is a competitive equilibrium market price that represents an estimate of the average of prices
paid to dairy farmers for Grade B milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin by plants producing manufactured dairy products
such as butter, nonfat dry milk and cheese. The M-W price was first adopted in 1961 as the basis for setting all
minimum classified milk prices in the Chicago Regional marketing area. By 1975, the M-W price had been adopted
by all federal milk orders. Both the industry and the Secretary view the M-W price as an accurate indicator of
the value of milk in large part because the price reflects all of the supply and demand conditions that must be considered
under section 608c(18). 

Manufactured dairy products (cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk) can be made from Grade B or Grade A milk. Because
manufactured dairy products are eight to ten times less bulky than raw farm milk and can be stored for much longer periods
of time than raw farm milk, these manufactured products are less expensive to move and market than raw farm milk on a
per pound basis. As a result, manufactured dairy products can and do compete on a national market basis while competition
for raw and packaged fluid milk occurs on a more local or regional level.

<TEXT>
 

Accordingly, since manufacture dairy products (unlike fluid milk) compete in a national market, there is a relationship
between the M-W price for Grade B milk and the price of surplus Grade A milk, which, like Grade B milk, is used to
produce manufactured dairy products. The M-W price reflects a competitive free market price for raw farm milk
and the explicit link between Grade B and Grade A surplus milk prices. Thus, the M-W price automatically incorporates
the effects of innumerable economic factors which have an impact on both buyers and sellers including the relative
price and availability of feed for dairy cows. Month-to-month changes in the unregulated free market M-W price
(i.e., the price of Grade B milk) reflect changes in the overall supply and demand conditions for milk and its products
nationally. 
Concern for the need to ensure competitive equity among handlers and the existence of basic price differences between
adjacent marketing areas also led to the universal adoption of the M-W price in all federal milk orders. Marketing
areas which relied on the other basic pricing formulae noted above often resulted in producer prices that were too
low compared to those received by Midwestern producers. This situation created a competitive disadvantage for Midwestern
processors with respect to sales of such manufactured dairy products as butter, nonfat dry milk and cheese because
these products, which compete on a national rather than ``local'' market, were more expensive relative to similar
products manufactured elsewhere. Consequently, it became clear that a competitive pay price would most accurately
indicate the basic value of milk on a national level. Use of the M-W price which, as noted above, is a competitive
pay price, automatically indicates the basic value of milk and eliminates the need for making possibly inaccurate
judgments concerning particular products, prices, yield factors and manufacturing allowances which otherwise
would be used to calculate product price formulae. 
In short, the M-W price provides automatic adjustments concerning all of the factors affecting the supply of
and demand for milk and its products. Thus, the M-W price has been adopted in all federal milk orders as the ``mover''
of all Class I and Class II prices and is the Class III price (subject to certain minor adjustments). Using the M-W
as the Class III price maintains price coordination between Grade B and surplus Grade A milk supplies used for manufacturing
purposes. 


Price and Supplies of Feed 


Agricultural commodities typically follow cyclical price-quantity patterns. Given fixed levels of demand, as
supplies become plentiful, price for feed trends downward. When supplies become scarce, price for feed trends upward.
The market signals incorporated into the M-W price indicate price movements up and down and elicit either more
or less commodity production. This coupling pattern between feed supplies and feed prices allows market analysts
to focus on either factor and implicitly know what the other is doing. 
The cost of feed is a significant factor involved in milk production. Officially noticed documents that are part of
the record of the administrative hearing outline cash feed expenses as they relate to the total economic costs of producing
milk. (``Economic Indicators of the Farm Sector: Costs of Production, Economic Research Service'', ECIFS 3-1,
1983; ECIFS 6-1, 1986; and ECIFS 9-1, 1989.) For the period 1981 through 1989, data describing the annual
average cost of producing one hundred pounds of milk were reviewed. Statistics for six individual regions plus the
entire United States were examined. Information for one additional region was available for the 1987, 1988, and 1989
years. 
Annual regional and total United States summary statistics for a nine-year period from 1981 through 1989 were reviewed.
The review of these statistics revealed that the total cash feed expenses as a percentage of the total economic costs
of production, on a per hundredweight (cwt.) basis, ranged from 30 percent to 58 percent from year-to-year. This percentage
measures the relative significance of cash feed expenses for each region and the United States relative to the estimated
total cost of milk production for the respective regions and the United States. 
Although the availability and cost of feed are primary factors involved in farm level milk production, there is a limit
to how much milk output can be obtained from a given quantity of feed input. This is a physical milk production constraint.
It relates to the biological limits of the cow and the economics of milk production decisions made by individual farmers.
In general, given a specified level of feed costs, a dairy farmer decides to purchase and/or grow a quantity of feed
and forage. This in turn determines the amount of feed that may be made available to cows for milk production and has
a direct impact on the aggregate level of milk that may be produced in absence of any consideration being given to the
price that can be obtained for the milk that is produced. 
Such analysis of the availability and costs of feed provides only one dimension, albeit an important dimension, of
the factors the Secretary must consider in establishing a price for milk. These important statutory pricing factors,
however, are automatically embodied in the M-W price. The M-W is a superior basic price indicator for milk
because it reflects all of the economic factors that affect the supply of milk as well as all of the factors that affect
the demand for the products of milk.

In summary, the rulemaking record contains ample evidence regarding the price and availability of feeds which the
agency reviewed when making its decision. However, these factors, as well as all other supply and demand factors,
continued to be automatically reflected in the M-W price, which has long been the moving factor in the Class I
(and also Class II and III) prices. 


The Class I Price and Class I Differential 


The Class I price in each order contains two components. The largest component is the M-W price, which applies
in all orders. The smaller component is a Class I differential that is specific to each order. Consequently, through
the M-W component the Class I price in each order automatically reflects the price and availability of supplies
of feed and all other economic factors that affect the supply and demand for milk and dairy products. 
Raw milk is a bulky product and is more expensive to transport than the equivalent amount of milk used to produce concentrated
manufactured dairy products. There is a direct link between weight and the cost of moving milk across geographic areas.

The Class I differential part of the Class I price is intended to partially reflect the cost of transporting milk. The
differential portion serves as a price incentive to draw milk from supply areas toward metropolitan demand centers.
One of the statutory objectives of the Federal milk order program is to provide a sufficient amount of fluid milk for
consumers. The differential serves as an incentive to move milk from supply areas to demand centers. 
In economic terms, a spatial pricing structure for milk evolves when it traverses geographic space. The structure
is characterized by a price at the area of supply. Such price increases proportionally as the distance to the area of
demand increases. It is noted that there does not need to be a single defined supply area. Furthermore, it is not necessary
that prices be identical at all recognized supply areas. Many different supply areas could be considered. However,
distance and the cost of transportation implicitly and efficiently link demand areas to the nearest and/or least
cost area of supply. The spatial Class I milk pricing structure recognizes these economic relationships. 
The Court's opinion appears to misconstrue the Secretary's description regarding the Class I differential and transportation
cost. The Court observed that: 



[T]he Secretary expressly states in his final decision that the differentials are no longer meant to reflect the cost
of transportation * * * (Opinion, p.7). 



In fact, the final decision pointed out that ``the Class I pricing structure does not cover the 

total

 cost of moving bulk fluid milk from one area to another.'' (58 FR 12648, emphasis added). 


In short, the relevant factor that establishes a limit for Class I differentials is the cost of transportation. Class
I differentials partially reflect the cost of transportation at a level that will insure an adequate supply of milk
pursuant to statutory objectives. Because some milk is produced just about everywhere, the mix of milk produced near
consumption centers with milk shipped from distant areas varies among orders. If no nearby milk is produced for a particular
consumption center, the Class I differential would have to more fully reflect the cost of transporting milk from the
nearest alternative surplus milk-producing area. However, because some milk is produced just about everywhere,
the Class I differential in any particular marketing area merely has to be high enough to bring forth adequate supplies
of locally produced milk together with supplemental supplies from other areas. 
As the mobility of milk increased, a transition necessarily occurred from considering only isolated local markets
to considering a system of regional markets that are linked through class price coordination. Individual markets
that previously set class prices based on local supply-demand conditions now are part of larger regional markets
whose prices are coordinated through the 
M-W price as the price mover in federal milk marketing orders. Once the M-W price was adopted, there was
a common mechanism for coordinating market price movements.

From the regulatory perspective, the statutory goal of providing an adequate milk supply for each market is furthered
by coordinating milk prices among the system of orders. Based upon the cost of moving milk, Class I differentials are
established so that the price of milk at any plant location does not exceed the cost of transporting milk from supply
areas. Proper alignment of milk prices between nearby adjacent markets is necessary so that handlers located in more
deficit milk producing areas can attract a supply of milk. 



The Blend Price 



Handlers in each order account for milk in Class I, Class II, and Class III uses at the minimum respective class price
established under each order. The blend price that applies to producers is calculated by dividing the total pounds
of producer milk into the total value of all milk at class prices used by handlers regulated under an order. Accordingly,
the blend price is a weighted average price that, because all milk of an order is part of the price calculation, assures
that each producer shares in both the benefits of supplying the fluid milk market and the burden of the reserve or surplus
milk supplies associated with each order. Thus, the blend price incorporates regional and national measures: it
is a measure of supply and demand conditions in each order as well as a measure of national supply and demand conditions
that are reflected in the class prices that are based on the M-W price. Blend prices increase or decrease as class
prices increase or decrease in response to changes in national supply and demand conditions. Also, the blend price
in each market increases or decreases as the Class III use in each market decreases or increases. Thus, blend prices
reflect all of the economic factors that affect the supply of and demand for milk and dairy products that are required
to be considered under the pricing criteria of the AMAA. 

Producers make their production and marketing adjustments on the basis of changes in blend prices and differences
in blend prices among orders. It is not uncommon for supply areas of individual orders to expand or contract in response
to blend price changes over time. Also, because milk is free to move to handlers regulated under different orders,
it is not uncommon for milk to shift from one order to another in response to blend price differences that result from
changes in supply and demand conditions under different orders. 



USDA's Supply-Demand Analysis 



A supply and demand analysis was conducted by USDA to consider the Class I differential portion of the Class I prices.
This analysis was based on the hearing record, exceptions, and comments, and was a proper and sufficient economic
review of dairy market performance. By focusing on milk market performance measures, USDA's analysis directly addressed
the statutory goal of ensuring adequate milk supplies to meet the needs of each federal milk marketing area. 

The examination conducted by USDA reviewed the level of Class III utilization for each market area. This market performance
measure is appropriate because of the basic underlying accounting definitions and regulations in all federal milk
orders. 

In general, each marketing order defines producer milk receipts as all Grade A milk that is associated with (i.e.,
used in) the particular order market. The producer receipts may be from dairy farms in or close to the defined ``marketing
area'', or it may come from dairy farms that are located hundreds of miles away. The key identifying factor is that the
milk is associated with the market as evidenced by its receipt by handlers regulated under that particular order.


Specific market definitions also describe milk used for Class I, Class II, and Class III uses based on the end products
made from such milk. The standard accounting identity applicable for all federal milk market orders requires that
the total amount of milk used in Class I, Class II, and Class III products equals the total amount of producer milk receipts
associated with each market order. The class utilization percentages are determined by dividing the amount of milk
used in each respective class by the amount of producer receipts for the market. In this manner, the class utilization
percentage represents how much milk is being used in each class of product relative to the total volume of milk associated
with a specifically defined geographic Federal milk marketing area. 

Markets generally function by serving Class I demand first, then meeting Class II demands, and finally utilizing
the residual volume of producer receipts as Class III. In this manner, the volume of milk utilized in Class III is an
indication of the surplus, or reserve, milk level available to meet any supplemental needs of the Class I and Class
II market. During certain periods of the year, the level of milk production is low while the demand for Class I and Class
II milk is high. In these deficit periods, it may be necessary to use all milk regularly associated with the market to
meet the Class I demand. A certain portion of the milk supply in most markets also is needed to meet regular Class II milk
demands; consequently, a reserve milk supply of 30 to 35 percent (i.e., Class III percent utilization) is not excessive
to ensure that sufficient milk is available in the market at all times to satisfy Class I and II demand. 

The Court's opinion suggests that the Secretary's reliance on producer milk in his analysis of whether Class I prices
meet the statutory price considerations required by Section 608c(18) does not consider milk supplies available
outside the marketing area (Opinion, p.20). In fact, producer milk and, more specifically, Class III utilization
does incorporate the availability of milk supplies from outside a marketing area because, regardless of its origin,
any milk received by a regulated handler in a marketing area is, by definition, producer milk. Thus, the Class III utilization
of producer milk is an important indicator of federal order supply and demand conditions.

<TEXT>
 

The opinion also focuses on the following statement in the final decision (58 FR 12648):

 


* * * There is no national supply and demand standard for the order program as a whole. This is not to say
that a regulated market cannot rely on milk supplies from another area, as is often the case. Nevertheless, viewed
on an individual market basis, we reaffirm our conclusion that milk supplies available for Class I and Class II uses
are adequate, but not excessive in most markets.

 


The above finding is in the first of three paragraphs that respond to an exception filed by the Upper Midwest Federal
Order Coalition (UMFOC) that maintained the Secretary used too high a measure of what should be considered a reasonable
reserve. The Secretary indicated that there was a range of views expressed concerning reserve supplies needed to
serve Class I needs on a year-round basis. (58 FR 12646) When both Class I and Class II needs are considered, the Secretary
indicated that this analysis of supply and demand for milk on the various markets and regions was valid. 

As noted above, the M-W is a measure of supply and demand factors throughout the country. However, there is no
single national standard for determining how much reserve milk should be, or needs to be, associated with each marketing
order. The amount of reserve milk varies among orders as a result of different circumstances that affect production
and marketing practices and conditions. Some regions are affected more than others from year to year by variations
in weather conditions that have an impact on milk production and reserve milk supplies. Also, some areas are more heavily
involved in manufacturing than others. The amount of involvement has an impact on the amount of reserve milk that is
historically associated with certain federal order markets relative to others. Moreover, since the blend price
drives producers' production and marketing decisions, milk is shifted to alternative outlets and orders to take
advantage of higher prices. This shifting of milk supplies impacts on the amount of reserve milk associated with different
orders. Also, milk may be alternatively associated or disassociated from orders altogether depending on the blend
price level of a federal milk order relative to returns from unregulated manufacturing plants. Consequently, Class
III milk utilization is an important indicator of a market's performance and its ability to meet Class I needs. For
these reasons, the Secretary's reliance on producer milk and Class III utilization is appropriate and automatically
considers the availability of milk supplies from outside a marketing area. 

As detailed in the final decision, the supply-demand analysis conducted by the Secretary considered the level of
Class III milk utilization relative to the established Class I price differential. Most markets appeared to have
a relative balance between supply and demand, while some markets were deficit and others were surplus. On a system-wide
basis considering all of the testimony from the hearing, comments, and exceptions, the Secretary properly determined
that the current Class I differentials were meeting the statutorily described market performance measures. 



General Findings 



The findings and determinations set forth herein have been issued in response to a memorandum opinion and order of
the United States District Court, District of Minnesota, Fourth Division, issued on April 14, 1994. The findings

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:





Regulations Schedule for 1994



On April 7, 1994, the Service published for public comment in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16762) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20, with comment periods ending July 21, 1994, for early-season proposals
and August 29, 1994, for late-season proposals. On June 8, 1994, the Service published for public comment a second
document (59 FR 29700) which provided supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting
regulations frameworks.

On June 23, 1994, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7 and June 8 

Federal Registers

 to review the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for those
species and for other early seasons.

On July 12, 1994, the Service published in the 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 35566) a third document in the series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents which dealt
specifically with proposed early-season frameworks for the 1994-95 season. This rulemaking is the fourth
in the series, and establishes final frameworks for early-season migratory bird hunting regulations for the 1994-95
season.






Review of Public Comments and the Service's Response



As of July 25, 1994, the Service had received 36 written comments; 28 of these specifically addressed early-season
issues. The Service also received recommendations from all four Flyway Councils. Early-season comments are summarized
and discussed in the order used in the April 7 

Federal Register

. Only the numbered items pertaining to early seasons for which comments were received are included. 






General





Written Comments:

 The Humane Society of the United States recommended that all seasons open at noon, mid-week, to reduce the large kills
associated with the traditional Saturday openings. They recommend special seasons be discontinued for the same
purpose. One individual from California suggested that the waterfowl bag limits and seasons should be established
on a flyway basis. Two local sportsmen's organization from Massachusetts requested that shooting hours remain one-half
hour before sunrise to sunset.






1. Ducks
 


The categories used to discuss issues related to duck harvest management are as follows: (A) General Harvest Strategy,
(B) Framework Dates, (C) Season Length, (D) Closed Seasons, (E) Bag Limits, (F) Zones and Split Seasons, and (G) Special
Seasons/Species Management. Only those categories containing substantial recommendations are included below.



G. Special Seasons/Species Management



i. September Teal Seasons





Council Recommendations:

 The Central Flyway Council recommended that September teal season shooting hours begin one-half hour before sunrise
to sunset without further evaluation for all non-production Central Flyway States.

The Central Flyway Council recommended that the Service review the guidelines for establishing a September teal
season for any new requests for seasons.

The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that Michigan
be permitted to hold an experimental September teal season in southeastern portions of the State.

The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that September teal season
shooting hours beginning one-half hour before sunrise be made operational and that no further evaluation of shooting
hours be required.



Written Comments:

 An individual representing a group of duck hunters from Wisconsin expressed concern that some States with a September
teal season are allowed shooting hours that begin one-half hour before sunrise. He believes that hunters are unable
to identify ducks and that most crippling loss occurs prior to sunrise.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources requested that Michigan be allowed to conduct a teal season in areas
where teal concentrate. They proposed limiting the season to no more than 2,000 hunters and believed that hunters'
skills at identifying waterfowl are better now than they were during initial evaluations of teal seasons in the 1960's.
Four individuals from Michigan supported the proposed September teal season for portions of Michigan. 


Service Response:

 Breeding population information for 1994 and harvest and band-recovery information from the 1993-94 waterfowl
season indicate that a September teal season can be offered to nonproduction States of the Central and Mississippi
Flyways in 1994. 

During their 1993-94 teal seasons, the States of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas in the Central flyway
and Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi in the Mississippi Flyway participated in a study that indicated that shooting
hours beginning at one-half hour before sunrise during teal seasons have a negligible impact on nontarget duck species
in those States. The Service believes the data are sufficient to address its concern about the potential harvest of
nontarget species during the presunrise period, and will permit those States that participated in the study to have
presunrise shooting hours during the 1994 teal season, without further evaluation. Other States that are permitted
a teal season (Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio), but did not participate in the study, must begin
shooting hours at sunrise. 

The Service recognizes the value of these September teal seasons in providing additional hunting opportunity but
remains concerned about the potential impacts of these seasons on non-target species in certain areas. The Service
strategy regarding use of teal seasons specifies that teal seasons can be offered only to nonproduction States of
the Central and Mississippi Flyways. Because Michigan is considered a production State and was not part of the original,
comprehensive evaluation, the Service does not support the requests for a teal season. Although the definitions
of production and nonproduction States may need to be reviewed, the Service has stated in the August 23, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 44577) that it prefers a Flyway-wide approach to assess whether expansion of teal seasons to areas beyond those
currently allowed is permissible. The Michigan proposal does not meet this criterion. The Service also notes that
such expansions would require a reevaluation of the entire teal season, including an analysis of information from
areas currently permitted teal seasons as well as areas into which teal seasons might be expanded.



ii. September Duck Seasons





Council Recommendations:

 The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that Iowa
be permitted to hold a portion of their regular duck season in September to increase harvest opportunity on blue-winged
teal.



Written Comments:

 Several individuals and petitions with 4,697 signatures requested nine additional days of duck hunting in Wisconsin.
The request notes that the efforts of duck hunters, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited,
and various sportsmen's organizations have resulted in record levels of duck production. The additional nine days
of duck hunting would make Wisconsin's season equal in length to certain other States in the Mississippi Flyway that
are permitted a September teal season.



Service Response:

 The Service previously determined in the ``Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations
Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (SEIS 88)'' that the extension of framework dates into September
for Iowa's September duck season was a type of special season. The Service further acknowledges that the 1990 assessment
of special September teal seasons included data from Iowa's September duck season segments during 1979-87. As such,
the effects of Iowa's special seasons were taken into account when determining the appropriateness of September
teal seasons as a harvest-management tool. Iowa's data also suggested little impact on other duck species during
this season. Therefore, the Service believes that Iowa's September duck season segment, as conducted during 1979-87,
is consistent with the Service's policy regarding the use of special seasons. Current status information for the
blue-winged teal supports Iowa's request for a September duck season in 1994. The Service stated in SEIS 88 that special
seasons should be re-evaluated periodically to assess potential changes in impacts to the waterfowl resource. The
Service notes that more than a decade has passed since Iowa conducted its evaluation of this season and requests that
Iowa collect information documenting the effect of this season on other duck species in Iowa. 

Regarding the requests for additional days of duck hunting in Wisconsin, an important consideration in the establishment
of hunting regulations is the distinction between regular hunting seasons and special seasons. Regular seasons
are developed by Flyway/management unit, and the same season length, bag limit, etc. are provided for all States in
that Flyway/management unit. Special seasons, however, usually involve additional harvest opportunity and are
focused on a single species or group of species. Because of this, the use of these seasons is limited to times and areas
where the species or group is sufficiently isolated to minimize impacts on other species/groups. This limitation
increases the likelihood that in some cases a special season or some compensating increase in other harvest opportunity
cannot be available to all States. The September teal season is an example. Wisconsin is one of nine States in the Mississippi
and Central Flyways that are not eligible for this special season.






3. Sea Ducks





Council Recommendations:

 The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that the 1994 sea duck season frameworks remain the same as the 1993-94
frameworks.



Written Comments:

 The Humane Society of the United States (Humane Society) opposed this season in the Atlantic Flyway because they believe
crippling and wanton waste occur, information is insufficient to justify a season, and available data indicate possible
declines for certain sea duck species. They believe that season length and bag limits in the Atlantic Flyway should
be reduced substantially until more complete information on biology and population status is available. They repeat
their concern regarding seasons and limits on sea ducks which are deemed too liberal, considering the quality and
quantity of data on population status and trends, and recommend reductions in those regulations. The Humane Society
notes that apparently the Pacific Flyway Council has not completed a comparable evaluation of its sea duck harvests
and believes such seasons should be closed until necessary data are obtained. Two local organizations from Massachusetts
requested a continuation of the 107-day sea duck season, with a 7-bird bag limit to include scoters.



Service Response:

 The Service continues to be concerned about the status of sea ducks and the potential impact that increased hunting
activity could have on these species. In recognition of the need for additional information on these species, the
Service prepared a report (dated June, 1993) on sea duck and merganser hunting seasons, status, and harvests in Alaska
and the Pacific Flyway coastal states. This document was prepared for use by the Service and the Pacific Flyway Council
in evaluating the effects of seasons on these ducks. There is no special season on sea ducks in the Pacific Flyway; however,
Alaska has a sea duck limit that is additional to the limit on other ducks. In the Atlantic Flyway, a report was recently
completed (dated April, 1994) and distributed, describing the status of sea ducks in that portion of the continent.
Cooperative efforts are ongoing to summarize additional information on sea ducks, however the Service continues
to emphasize the importance of completing the sea duck management plan. Furthermore, the Service considers improvements
in survey capabilities for these species to be extremely important for future management actions. In 1993, the Service
reduced bag limits on scoters from 7 to 4 within an overall 7-bird sea duck limit. The Service will continue to monitor
these species and notes that further harvest restrictions may be necessary.



4. Canada Geese



A. Special Seasons





Council Recommendations:

 The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that West Virginia be permitted to initiate a 3-year experimental resident
Canada goose season during September 1-15.

The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended modifications to hunt zones for September seasons on resident Canada geese
in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania (Northwestern and Southeastern Zones), and Virginia. These proposed
changes would be experimental.

The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council made the following recommendations pertaining
to special Canada goose seasons: 
In Indiana, expand the September season hunting area to Statewide with a September 1-15 framework. The proposed
changes would not be experimental.

In Michigan, extend the seasons in the northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula for 2 additional years and expand
the zone in the Upper Peninsula to approximately the eastern half of the Peninsula; change the season length in the
southern part of the Lower Peninsula from 10 to 15 days (September 1-15) for 3 years and include the southern portions
of Tuscola and Huron Counties. The proposed changes would be experimental.

In Minnesota, expand the Fergus Falls/Alexandria Zone and extend the framework for the 10-day season to September
1-16 for 3 years. The proposed changes would be experimental.

In Ohio, expand the September-season hunting area to Statewide with a September 1-15 framework. The proposed
changes would not be experimental.

In Wisconsin, enlarge the size of the Southeastern Wisconsin Zone and continue as a special season with a September
1-13 framework. The proposed changes would not be experimental.

The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that the Service closely monitor
all Canada goose seasons and fully analyze data from existing special or experimental seasons before expanding seasons
that cumulatively might increase harvest of the Southern James Bay Population. Also, current special seasons should
adhere to present criteria designed by the Service.

The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council also requested that a 3-year experimental,
10-day September Canada goose season be permitted in the eastern portion of Tennessee.

The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that there be no change in frameworks in the experimental goose zone in Oregon
or in the operational status in Washington. They also recommended no change in frameworks for Wyoming.



Written Comments:

 The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources expressed concern that all of their special September Canada goose
zone would return to experimental status, rather than just the expanded portion. They also indicated that they wish
to delay the zone expansion and later season dates until next year.



Service Response:

 The Service agrees with the proposed changes to resident Canada goose seasons in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin and the new seasons in Tennessee and West Virginia.
All of these proposed changes are considered experimental and subject to evaluation. 
The Service notes that all of the seasons proposed in the Mississippi Flyway, except those for Michigan, Minnesota
and Tennessee, were not proposed as experimental. The Service remains committed to population-specific management
of Canada geese. However, the Service believes that the contribution of different goose populations to the goose
harvest during special seasons must be determined experimentally. For this reason, the Service has established
criteria for special Canada goose seasons (58 FR 44578-44579), which clearly state the need for experimental
evaluation of new seasons, including extensions of geographic areas or times. Therefore, the Service agrees to the
changes proposed by the Mississippi Flyway Council, but on an experimental basis and provided an approved evaluation
is conducted as specified in the existing criteria.



B. Regular Seasons.





Council Recommendations:

 The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the early-season frameworks
provide for the opening of regular goose seasons in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as early as September
24.

The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that the Service closely monitor
all Canada goose seasons and fully analyze data from existing special or experimental seasons before expanding seasons
that cumulatively might increase harvest of the Southern James Bay Population of Canada geese.

The Pacific Flyway Council seeks a limited resumption of cackling Canada goose hunting throughout their range and
recommends that the Service provide an expedited review of their recommended changes in cackling Canada goose regulations
for impacts on Aleutian Canada geese under the Section 7 consultation process.



Written Comments:

 The Michigan Department of Natural Resources believes that regular goose seasons should be allowed to open as early
as September 24 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. They noted that significant numbers of migrant geese begin arriving
in the Upper Peninsula during September 20-24 in most years. They anticipate that harvest in this region would
remain small compared to the rest of the State. They also believe that nearly all Canada geese harvested in this region
are of the giant subspecies or the Mississippi Valley Population. Finally, they noted that allowing a September 24
opening would provide equitable hunting opportunity compared to other areas because most geese leave this region
by early November.

The Association of Village Council Presidents, representing Native American interests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim
Delta area of Alaska, supported modest liberalizations of white-fronted goose seasons in Alaska and Washington.
However, they did not support further liberalizations in Oregon or California, noting that liberalizations occurred
during each of the preceding years and that it was difficult to measure the effects of these incremental changes.



Service Response:

 The Service concurs with the September 24 opening of regular Canada goose seasons in Wisconsin and in Michigan's Upper
Peninsula. The Service routinely monitors Canada goose seasons for impacts on the Southern James Bay Population
through its harvest surveys and reviews of State evaluation reports on special seasons. 

The population index for cackling Canada geese was 164,300 geese in 1993, which was 10 percent above the 1992 index
and the largest since this special survey was initiated in 1979. The Service supports the Pacific Flyway Council's
recommendation for a resumption of the season on these geese and frameworks described herein reflect that change.
Section 7 consultation is an integral part of the season-setting process.

The population index for the Pacific Population of white-fronted geese was 295,000 in November 1993 and near the population
objective of 300,000. The Service concurs with the Association of Village Council Presidents for increased limits
on white-fronted geese in western Alaska and frameworks, herein, reflect that change. A decision regarding frameworks
affecting white-fronted goose harvests in Washington, Oregon, and California, however, will be deferred to the
late-season process.






9. Sandhill Cranes





Council Recommendations:

 The Central and Pacific Flyway Councils recommended no changes in the Federal frameworks for the hunting of sandhill
cranes during the 1994-95 seasons.



Written Comments:

 The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department responded to statements in the April 7, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16765) which indicated that there should be no increase or shift in crane harvest toward the Gulf Coast Subpopulation
of Mid-Continent Sandhill Cranes and especially the greater-sandhill-crane component. They noted that the Central
Flyway Council did not propose any framework changes for the 1994-95 seasons and asked for clarification of
the reasons for this concern, especially since the population remains stable. In this regard, they suggested that
the Service provide a harvest objective, rationale and method of evaluation of any harvest reduction proposed. Furthermore,
the appropriate level of management should be clearly identified, i.e. population, subpopulation, or subspecies
level. Although biologists working in Texas support management at the population or subpopulation level, they indicated
that zoning for the hunting of cranes could not be attempted until these issues had been resolved.
 


Service Response:

 In 1993, the Central and Pacific Flyways completed a revision of the Cooperative Management Plan for the Mid-Continent
Population of sandhill cranes. This revision established a goal of a stable population at levels observed during
the 1982-92 period and removed the harvest threshold (25,000) that had been in place since 1981. The Service
believes that future management actions for Mid-Continent cranes should be based on the recognition of biologically
discrete subpopulations, which would necessitate the development of certain data collection efforts at the subspecies
level. In the April 9, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16765), the Service reiterated its concern that overall harvest levels should not be increased and that there
should be no increase or shift in harvest toward the Gulf Coast Subpopulation or to the greater sandhill crane component.
The Service supports continuation of last year's frameworks but remains extremely concerned about possible increases
or shifts in harvest toward the Gulf Coast subpopulation, especially the greater-sandhill-crane component. The
Service considers a harvest threshold to be an integral component of the Cooperative Management Plan for the Mid-Continent
Population and hopes that the newly-formed crane working group, appointed by the Central Flyway Council, will strongly
reconsider the need for a harvest threshold in the development of a harvest strategy for this population.






11. Moorhens & Gallinules





Written Comments:

 The Humane Society of the United States believes the bag limits for moorhens are extremely high.



Service Response:

 The Service is not aware of any information indicating that the current bag limits have had any adverse impact on moorhen
populations. Since these bag limits have been the same for a number of years, the Service believes they are appropriate.






12. Rails





Written Comments:

 The Humane Society of the United States believes that bag limits for rails are extremely high and that they are not consistent
with wise use and conservation of the resource. 



Service Response:

 Available information indicates that harvest pressure on rails is relatively light and there is no evidence to suggest
that the frameworks provided herein are not appropriate.






13. Snipe 




Council Recommendations:

 The Pacific Flyway Council recommends no change in frameworks.



Written Comments:

 The Humane Society of the United States believes the bag limits for common snipe are extremely high.



Service Response:

 The Service believes that frameworks provided herein are appropriate, considering the relatively light harvest
pressure on snipe. 






14. Woodcock





Council Recommendations:

 The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that Tennessee be allowed to
divide the State into 2 zones (East and West) for woodcock hunting.



Service Response:

 The Service is concerned about the gradual long-term declines in woodcock populations in both the Eastern and Central
management regions. Although habitat changes appear to be the primary factor in the declines, adjustment of harvest
opportunities may be appropriate in light of current population trends. The Service will work with the Atlantic and
Mississippi Flyway Councils to review the status of woodcock and cooperatively develop a harvest-management strategy.
The Service believes that zoning has the potential to increase the harvest of woodcock. Therefore, the Service does
not support a zoned woodcock season at a time when woodcock populations are declining and restrictive harvest regulations
are being considered to bring harvest opportunities to levels commensurate with current populations.



15. Band-Tailed Pigeon





Council Recommendations:

 The Pacific Flyway Council recommended no change in the band-tailed pigeon frameworks for the Pacific Coast and Four
Corners populations.



Service Response:

 The Service supports the continuation of seasons on both the Coastal and Interior Populations. Regarding the Coastal
Population, the Service has reviewed recent population status and harvest information provided by the States. This
information indicates that the Coastal Population probably numbers between 2 and 3 million birds and that the 1993
harvest did not exceed 16,000 band-tails. However, the Service remains concerned about the long-term decline of
this population and continues to support restrictive harvest regulations. Again this year, all States having band-tailed
pigeon hunting seasons must require band-tailed pigeon hunters to obtain mandatory State permits (or participate
in the nationwide Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program) to provide a sampling frame for obtaining more precise
estimates of band-tailed pigeon harvest. Those States not participating in the Migratory Bird Harvest Information
Program will be required to conduct a harvest survey and provide the results to the Service by June 1, 1995. 






16. Mourning Doves





Council Recommendations:

 The Central Flyway Council recommended that Texas be allowed an increase in the number of segments from 2 to 3 in 2 of
the 3 mourning dove hunting zones now offered to Texas.

The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that there be no change in the frameworks for mourning doves.



Service Response:

 The Service denies the request pertaining to Texas. In the August 23, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 44581), the Service noted that the proliferation of zones and split seasons is contrary to the preferred alternative
in the ``1988 Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport
Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88-14).'' In regard to Texas, the Service noted that no other States are allowed to
select both 3 zones and 3 splits for any species; in fact, no State other than Texas is allowed to select 3 zones for doves.
The Service also expressed concern about the ability to detect and measure possible changes in harvest that may result
from those additional splits.

Additionally, the Service is concerned about changes in the schedule for inclusion of States in the Harvest Information
Program. It emphasizes the need for full implementation of this program to gain accurate harvest estimates for mourning
doves and other migratory game birds. This information is needed to evaluate changes in hunting seasons such as the
proposed change in Service policy governing zones and splits in Texas.



17. White-winged and White-tipped doves





Council Recommendations:

 The Central Flyway Council recommended that the number of white-winged doves allowed in the 12-bird aggregate bag
limit during the mourning dove season be increased from 2 to 6 in the Texas Counties of Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, and
Willacy.

The Pacific Flyway Council recommended no change in the frameworks.



Service Response:

 The Service approves the request to increase the bag limit in Texas. The whitewing population in the four-county area
of South Texas has improved dramatically from past years and has apparently recovered from significant population
decreases due to habitat degradation caused by drought and freezing temperatures. 


18. Alaska





Council Recommendations:

 The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that Alaska be allowed no more than 1 Canada goose in the daily bag for Unit 9E
and the western portions of Unit 18. The Council also recommended that the Statewide closure on cackling Canada geese
be removed.

The Pacific Flyway Council recommended removal of restrictive bag limits for white-fronted geese in Units 1-9
and 14-18 in Alaska. The goose limit would be 6 daily and 12 in possession, of which no more than 4 daily and 8 in possession
could be any combination of Canada or white-fronted geese.

The Pacific Flyway Council recommended no change in frameworks for tundra swans.



Written Comments:

 The Association of Village Council Presidents, representing Native American interests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim
Delta area of Alaska, supported modest liberalizations of white-fronted goose seasons in Alaska and Washington.


The Humane Society of the United States recommends that the opening date for all seasons in Alaska be delayed by two
weeks so that young birds are able to leave natal marshes before being subjected to hunting pressure. 



Service Response:

 The Service concurs with the Pacific Flyway Council's recommendations for one Canada goose in the daily limit in those
areas in western Alaska previously closed to protect cackling Canada geese and agrees with eliminating the state-wide
closure on cackling Canada geese. The frameworks herein reflect those changes.

The Service supports the Association for Village Council Presidents' recommendation for increased limits on white-fronted
geese in portions of western Alaska; and frameworks herein reflect that change. A decision regarding seasons in Washington
will be deferred until the late-season process. It is important to note that in Alaska, hunting pressure on migratory
birds is comparatively light. Many northern species will have migrated from the State before seasons open there in
September and there is no evidence to indicate that regulated hunting has adversely impacted local populations.



22. Falconry





Council Recommendations:

 The Pacific Flyway Council recommends no change in frameworks.



Written Comments:

 The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources supported the Service policy regarding exceptions to the 3-split
limit.
 


Service Response:

 The Service appreciates the support for the frameworks contained in this document.






NEPA Consideration



NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement:
Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88-14),'' filed with
EPA on June 9, 1988. Notice of Availability was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). The Service's Record of Decision was published on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). Copies
of these documents are available from the Service at the address indicated under the caption 

ADDRESSES.








Endangered Species Act Consideration



In August 1994, the Division of Endangered Species concluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical
habitats. Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between
seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species and their
habitats. The Service's biological opinions resulting from its consultation under section 7 are considered public
documents and are available for inspection in the Division of Endangered Species and the Office of Migratory Bird
Management.






Regulatory Flexibility Act; Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 and the Paperwork Reduction Act



In the 

Federal Register

 dated April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16762), the Service reported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq) and Executive Order 12866. These included preparing an Analysis
of Regulatory Effects, preparing a Small Entity Flexibility Analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and
publishing a summary of the latter. This rule was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under
Executive Order 12866. This rule does not contain any information collection requiring approval by the Office of
Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3504.

Regulations Promulgation



The rulemaking process for migratory bird hunting regulations must, by its nature, operate under severe time constraints.
However, the Service is of the view that every attempt should be made to give the public the greatest possible opportunity
to comment on the regulations. Thus, when the proposed early-season rulemaking was published on July 13, the Service
established what it believed was the longest period possible for public comment. In doing this, the Service recognized
that, at the close of the comment period, time would be of the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective
date of these regulations after this final rulemaking, the Service is of the opinion that the States would have insufficient
time to select season dates and limits; to communicate those selections to the Service; and to establish and publicize
the necessary regulations and procedures that implement their decisions.

Therefore, the Service, under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 703-712),
prescribes final frameworks setting forth the species to be hunted, the daily bag and possession limits, the shooting
hours, the season lengths, the earliest opening and latest closing season dates, and hunting areas, from which State
and Territory conservation agency officials may select hunting season dates and other options. Upon receipt of season
and option selections from these officials, the Service will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a final rulemaking amending 50 CFR part 20 to reflect seasons, limits, and shooting hours for the contiguous United
States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, for the 1993-94 season.

The Service therefore finds that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, and these frameworks will, therefore, take effect immediately upon publication.






List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20



Exports, Hunting, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation, Wildlife.

The rules that eventually will be promulgated for the 1993-94 hunting season are authorized under the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 703-712); the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act (November
8, 1978), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 742); and the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (August 8, 1956), as amended, (16 U.S.C.
742 a_j).

Final Regulations Frameworks for 1994-95 Early Hunting Seasons on Certain Migratory Game Birds



Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and delegated authorities, the Director approved the following proposed
frameworks which prescribe season lengths, bag limits, shooting hours, and outside dates within which States may
select seasons for certain migratory game birds between September 1, 1994, and March 10, 1995.






General





Dates:

 All outside dates noted below are inclusive.



Shooting and Hawking (taking by falconry) Hours:

 Unless otherwise specified, from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset daily.



Possession Limits:

 Unless otherwise specified, possession limits are twice the daily bag limit.



Area, Zone, and Unit Descriptions:

 Geographic descriptions that differ from those published in the August 23, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 44576) are contained in a later portion of this document.






Special September Teal Season





Outside Dates:

 Between September 1 and September 30, an open season on all species of teal may be selected by Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado
(Central Flyway portion only), Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico
(Central Flyway portion only), Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas in areas delineated by State regulations.



Hunting Seasons and Daily Bag Limits:

 Not to exceed 9 consecutive days, with a daily bag limit of 4 teal. 


Shooting Hours:

 One-half hour before sunrise to sunset, except in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio, where the hours
are from sunrise to sunset.






Special September Duck Seasons



Florida: An experimental 5-consecutive-day season may be selected in September. The daily bag limit may not exceed
4 teal and wood ducks in the aggregate.

Kentucky and Tennessee: In lieu of a special September teal season, an experimental 5-consecutive-day season may
be selected in September. The daily bag limit may not exceed 4 teal and wood ducks in the aggregate, of which no more than
2 may be wood ducks.

Iowa: Iowa may hold up to 5 days of its regular duck hunting season in September. All ducks which are legal during the
regular duck season may be taken during the September segment of the season. The September season segment may commence
no earlier than the Saturday nearest September 20 (September 17, 1994), with daily bag and possession limits being
the same as those in effect during the 1994 regular duck season. The remainder of the regular duck season may not begin
before October 15.






Scoter, Eider, and Oldsquaw Ducks (Atlantic Flyway) 





Outside Dates:

 Between September 15 and January 20.



Hunting Seasons and Daily Bag Limits:

 Not to exceed 107 days, with a daily bag limit of 7, singly or in the aggregate of the listed sea-duck species, of which
no more than 4 may be scoters.



Daily Bag Limits During the Regular Duck Season:

 Within the special sea duck areas, during the regular duck season in the Atlantic Flyway, States may choose to allow
the above sea duck limits in addition to the limits applying to other ducks during the regular duck season. In all other
areas, sea ducks may be taken only during the regular open season for ducks and must be included in the regular duck season
daily bag and possession limits.



Areas:

 In all coastal waters and all waters of rivers and streams seaward from the first upstream bridge in Maine, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York; in any waters of the Atlantic Ocean and in any tidal waters
of any bay which are separated by at least 1 mile of open water from any shore, island, and emergent vegetation in New
Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia; and in any waters of the Atlantic Ocean and in any tidal waters of any bay which
are separated by at least 800 yards of open water from any shore, island, and emergent vegetation in Delaware, Maryland,
North Carolina and Virginia; and provided that any such areas have been described, delineated, and designated as
special sea-duck hunting areas under the hunting regulations adopted by the respective States.






Special Early Canada Goose Seasons



Atlantic Flyway





Hunting Seasons:

 Experimental Canada goose seasons may be selected by Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. Areas open to the hunting of Canada geese must be described, delineated,
and designated as such in each State's hunting regulations. 



Outside Dates:

 Between September 1 and September 10, except that the closing date is September 15 in Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, New York, southeastern Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia and September 30 in North Carolina.



Daily Bag Limits:

 Not to exceed 5 Canada geese. 






Mississippi Flyway





Hunting Seasons:

 Canada goose seasons may be selected by Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.
Seasons in all States except Wisconsin are experimental. Areas open to the hunting of Canada geese must be described,
delineated, and designated as such in each State's hunting regulations.



Outside Dates:

 September 1-10 in Wisconsin and in the Upper Peninsula and Northern Lower Peninsula Zones in Michigan; September
1-15 in Indiana, Ohio, and the South Zone in Michigan; September 1-16 in Minnesota; September 1-30
in Tennessee; and October 1-15 in Missouri.



Season Length:

 Not to exceed 10 days except in Indiana, Ohio, and the South Zone in Michigan, where the season may extend for 15 days.



Daily Bag Limits:

 Not to exceed 5 Canada geese.
