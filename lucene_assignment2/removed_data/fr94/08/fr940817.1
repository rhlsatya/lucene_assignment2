NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 











Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc., et al.; Denial of Petition for Rulemaking

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Denial of petition for rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking (PRM-50-53) from Ms. Susan
L. Hiatt on behalf of the Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. (OCRE). The petition requested reopening of the
rulemaking procedure that led to promulgation of 10 CFR 50.62, the ``Anticipated Transient Without Scram'' (ATWS)
rule. The principal basis for the OCRE request was the possibility that the ATWS analyses that formed the underlying
bases of the ATWS rule were invalid because they did not appropriately account for the effects of large power oscillations,
such as those that occurred during the March 9, 1988, instability event at the LaSalle County Nuclear Station (Unit
2). The petition is being denied because the Commission has concluded, based on core stability analyses during hypothetical
ATWS events, and based on recommended procedure changes at nuclear power plants, that large-amplitude power oscillations
will not impact the core and containment response sufficiently to invalidate the assumptions and results of previous
ATWS analyses that were the bases for the ATWS rule. The NRC has carefully considered the issues raised in the petition
and has taken them into account in reaching its decision to deny the petition.

Expenditures; Personal Use of Campaign Funds 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Election Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; request for additional comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Election Commission is seeking additional comments on new rules governing the conversion of campaign
funds to personal use. The Federal Election Campaign Act, as amended, prohibits any person from converting campaign
funds to his or her personal use. The Commission is considering inserting a definition of personal use into its regulations.
Further information is provided in the supplementary information which follows.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In August of 1993, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [``the 1993 NPRM''] seeking comment on
proposed rules governing the conversion of campaign funds to personal use [``the proposed rules'']. 58 FR 45463 (August
30, 1993). The proposed rules were drafted to implement section 439a of the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C.
431 

et seq 

[``FECA'']. Section 439a says that no amounts received by a candidate as contributions that are in excess of any amount
necessary to defray his or her expenditures may be converted by any person to any personal use, other than to defray
any ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with his or her duties as a holder of Federal office. Those
who wished to comment on the proposed rules were invited to do so by September 29, 1993.


The Commission subsequently granted a request for a 45 day extension of the comment period, giving the regulated community
until November 13, 1993 to submit their views on the proposed rules. 58 FR 52040 (Oct. 6, 1993). The Commission received
32 comments from 31 commenters in response to the 1993 NPRM. The Commission also held a public hearing on January 12,
1994, at which it heard testimony from five witnesses on the proposed rules. 
On May 19, 1994, the Commission held an open meeting at which it considered draft final rules on the conversion of campaign
funds to personal use. The Commission also discussed several letters it had received at the time of the meeting requesting
an additional opportunity to comment on the rules before they are finally promulgated. These requests correctly
noted that, in an effort to address the concerns of the commenters, the draft final rules adopted a different approach
to defining personal use than the proposed rules. 
The Commission notes that the 1993 NPRM sought comments on all of the areas addressed by the draft final rules. Thus,
under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 

et seq., 

it would be appropriate for the Commission to proceed to adopt final rules.
Nevertheless, the Commission has decided to provide an additional opportunity to comment on the rules before they
are finally promulgated. The Commission has revised the rules and is publishing the revised version [referred to
as ``the revised rules''] in this NPRM in order to invite comments from the regulated community. Although this additional
comment period will delay completion of the personal use rules, the Commission still intends to finalize rules this
year. The Commission will maintan a schedule that will allow the rules to go into effect early in the next election cycle.



The Revised Rules


The revised rules would include a general definition of personal use and several enumerated examples. Section 113.1(g)(1)
would indicate that, generally, personal use would be any use of funds that confers a benefit on a candidate or a member
of the candidate's family that is not related to the campaign or the ordinary and necessary duties of a holder of Federal
office. Section 113.1(g)(1)(i) contains examples of uses that would be personal use if they confer the kind of benefit
described in the general definition. The list of examples includes mortgage, rent and utility payments, certain
vehicle expenses, household food items, clothing, tuition, and funeral expenses. The list also includes salary
payments to family members in excess of fair market value, legal expenses, certain travel and meal expenses, country
club dues and entertainment. In addition, the revised rules would specifically indicate that the use of funds to pay
the candidate a salary would be personal use.
Section 113.1(g)(1)(iii) of the revised rules would indicate that the Commission will use the general definition
to determine, on a case by case basis, whether other uses of campaign funds are personal use. The revised rules would
also indicate that the Commission may determine that a use of funds that confers a benefit on someone other than the
candidate or the candidate's family members is personal use if the benefit is not campaign or officeholder related.

Revised  113.1(g)(2) would indicate that charitable donations are not personal use unless the candidate making
the donation receives compensation from the recipient organization before the organization has used the funds donated
for other purposes. Under revised  113.1(g)(3), transfers of campaign committee assets to the candidate would
not be personal use so long as the committee receives adequate consideration. Revised  113.1(g)(3) also contains
provisions that would ensure that the cost of the asset being transferred is properly allocated between the committee
and the candidate.

Under  113.1(g)(4) of the revised rules, the use of funds for an expense that would be considered a political
expense under House rules or an officially connected expense under Senate rules would not be personal use to the extent
that the expense qualifies as an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.8 or is an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in
connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder. The Commission anticipates that, in most circumstances, political
and officially connected expenses will be ordinary and necessary expenses of a Federal officeholder for purposes
of the FECA, rather than conversions to personal use. However, section 439a of the FECA uses different standards than
House and Senate rules for determining whether a particular use of campaign funds is permissible. Specifically,
the Commission would not consider any use of funds that would be personal use under  113.1(g)(1) to be an ordinary
and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder under the FECA. Thus, the Commission
will have to determine whether political of officially connected expenses are personal use on a case-by-case basis.

Proposed section 113.1(g)(5) of the revised rules would indicate that payments for expenses that would be personal
use under paragraph (g)(1) of this section will generally be considered contributions to the candidate if made by
a third party. Consequently, the amount donated or expended will count towards the third party's contribution limits.
However, no contribution would result if the payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund, if the funds used were
the candidate's personal funds, if the payment was made by a member of the candidate's family from an account jointly
held with the candidate, or if the payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy and such payments were
made before the candidate became a candidate. Section 113.1(g)(6) would list the members of the candidate's family
for the purposes of  113.1(g).

The Commission is also proposing an amendment to the list of permissible uses of excess campaign funds contained in
11 CFR 113.2. The amendment would specifically indicate that certain travel costs and certain office operating expenditures
would be considered ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder
under the FECA. It would also specifically indicate that any use of funds that would be personal use under 11 CFR 113.1(g)(1)
is not an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officer.

The notice also contains a proposed conforming amendment to the definition of expenditure contained in section 100.8(b)(22).
Consistent with revised  113.1(g)(5), this amendment would clarify that payment of the candidate's personal
living expenses by a member of the candidate's family will not be considered expenditures if they are made from an account
jointly held with the candidate or were paid by the family member before the candidate became a candidate.

In addition to the comments on the proposed rules set out below, the Commission is interested in receiving comments
on whether additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements would be useful in administering section 439a.
Several of the commenters that responded to the 1993 NPRM expressed the view that additional reporting requirements
would be helpful in this area. However, it is difficult to craft a rule that would be both useful in enforcing the personal
use ban and not overly burdensome on the reporting committees. The Commission invites commenters to suggest ways
in which the reporting requirements could be amended to achieve this goal. Comments are also welcome on the alternative
of requiring committees to keep additional records to serve this purpose, without requiring additional reporting.
Commenters are encouraged to focus on how these amendments could be crafted to be both useful and not overly burdensome.

The Commission notes that Internal Revenue Service regulations under 26 U.S.C. 527 contain a definition of personal
use by political organizations. 26 CFR 1.527-5(a)(1). However, the IRS definition is not controlling in this
situation, and is not necessarily coextensive with the proposed rule. The Commission welcomes comments on the revised
rules, and on any other issues raised by this rulemaking.

payments exceed the fair market value of the property usage;
(B) Expenses incurred in using a vehicle at campaign expense, to the extent that such expenses exceed a 

de minimus 

amount. Persons who use a vehicle for personal purposes at campaign expense shall reimburse the campaign within thirty
days for that portion of the actual cost of the personal use that exceeds a 

de minimus 

amount;
(C) Household food items or supplies;
(D) Clothing;

(iii) The Commission will determine, on a case by case basis, whether other uses of campaign funds confer a benefit
on a candidate or a member of a candidate's family that is not primarily related to the candidate's campaign or the ordinary
and necessary duties of a holder of Federal office, and therefore are personal use.
(iv) The Commission may also determine that a use of campaign funds that confers a benefit on someone other than the
candidate or a member of the candidate's family is personal use, if the benefit is not primarily related to a candidate's
campaign or the ordinary and necessary duties of a holder of Federal office.
(2) 

Charitable donations. 

Donations of campaign funds or assets to an organization described in section 170(c) of Title 26 of the United States
Code are not conversions to personal use, unless the candidate receives compensation from the organization before
the organization has expended the entire amount donated for purposes unrelated to his or her personal benefit.
(3) 

Transfers of campaign assets. 

Transfers of campaign committee assets to the candidate or a member of the candidate's family for adequate consideration
are not conversions to personal use. In order to be adequate, the consideration must be for fair market value, and any
depreciation that takes place before the transfer must be allocated between the committee and the purchaser based
on the useful life of the asset.

(4) 

Political or officially connected expenses. 

The use of campaign funds for an expense that would be a political expense under the rules of the United States House
of Representatives or an officially connected expense under the rules of the United States Senate is not personal
use to the extent that the expense is an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.8 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred
in connection with the duties of a holder of Federal office. Any use of funds that would be personal use under 11 CFR 113.1(g)(1)
will not be considered an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.8 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection
with the duties of a holder of Federal office. 

(5) 

Third party payments.

 Notwithstanding that the use of funds for a particular expense would be a personal use under paragraph (g)(1) of this
section, payment of that expense by any person other than the candidate or the campaign committee shall be a contribution
to the candidate unless_ 

(i) The payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund established in accordance with the rules of the United States
Senate or the United States House of Representatives; 

(ii) The payment is made from funds that are the candidate's personal funds as defined in 11 CFR 110.10(b), including
an account jointly held by the candidate and a member of the candidate's family; 

(iii) The payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy and payments for that expense were made by the
person making the payment before the candidate became a candidate. Payments that are compensation shall be considered
contributions unless_ 

(A) The compensation results from bona fide employment that is genuinely independent of the candidacy; 

(B) The compensation is exclusively in consideration of services provided by the employee as part of this bona fide
independent employment; and 

(C) The compensation does not exceed the amount of compensation which would be paid to any other similarly qualified
person for the same work over the same period of time.

(1) Examples of uses that defray ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the duties of a holder
of Federal office include: 

(i) The use of funds for the expenses of a Federal officeholder and an accompanying spouse for travel that is part of
the ordinary and necessary duties of a holder of Federal office, such as a fact-finding meeting or an event at which
the officeholder's services are provided through a speech or appearance in an official capacity; and 

(ii) The use of funds for the costs of winding down the office of a former Federal officeholder for a period not to exceed
6 months after he or she leaves office.

Airworthiness Directives; Short Brothers Model SD3-60 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Short Brothers
Model SD3-60 series airplanes. This proposal would require installation of a certain time delay relay and associated
wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. This proposal is prompted by reports of inadvertent engagements of the
rudder gust lock on in-service Model SD3-60 series airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended
to prevent premature locking of the rudder gust lock, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane
in flight and during landing roll.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Comments Invited 



Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data,
views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in
triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments,
specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice
may be changed in light of the comments received. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the
Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with
the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-96-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 



Availability of NPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-NM-96-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.




Discussion 



The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Short Brothers Model SD3-60 series airplanes. The CAA advises
that it has received reports of inadvertent engagements of the rudder gust lock on in-service Model SD3-60 series
airplanes. Investigation revealed that these inadvertent engagements were caused by premature locking of the rudder
gust lock system. Premature locking of the rudder gust lock, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability
of the airplane in flight and during landing roll. 

Short Brothers has issued Shorts Service Bulletin SD360-27-23, Revision 1, dated April 15, 1994, which
describes procedures for installation of a 10-second time delay relay, having part number TDD-AYOF-1002,
and associated wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. Such an installation safeguards against inadvertent
locking of the rudder gust lock until the airplane can reach a ground speed at which the nose wheel steering can be used.
The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directive 013-02-94,
dated March 24, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 

This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed 
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated
for operation in the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require installation of a certain 10-second time delay
relay and associated wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 

The FAA estimates that 88 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
29 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,360, or $1,595 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is proposing for comment rule and form amendments relating to the reporting of expenses by investment
companies. The proposed amendments would require an investment company to reflect as expenses in its statement of
operations certain liabilities of the company paid by broker-dealers in connection with the allocation of the company's
brokerage transactions to the broker-dealers. The amendments would also require an investment company to include
expenses paid in this manner in the fee table and financial highlights table appearing in the company's prospectus,
and in calculating the company's yield. The amendments are designed to enhance the information provided to investors
so that they may be better able to assess and compare investment company expenses and performance. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission today is proposing for comment:



(1) Amendments to rule 6-07 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.6-07]. 

(2) Amendments to Form N-1A [17 CFR 239.15A, 274.11A], Form N-2 [17 CFR 239.14, 274.11a-1], Form
N-3 [17 CFR 239.17a, 274.11b], and Form N-4 [17 CFR 239.17b, 274.11c] under the Securities Act of 1933 [15
U.S.C. 77a 

et seq.

] (``1933 Act'') and the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a-1 

et seq.

] (``1940 Act''). 



Executive Summary 



The Commission is proposing to amend rule 6-07 of Regulation S-X, the regulation setting forth form and
content requirements for financial statements included in registration statements, proxy statements, annual
reports, and shareholder reports under the various securities laws. The amendments would require a registered investment
company (``fund'') to adjust the amount of expenses reflected in the statement of operations in its financial statements
to include amounts the fund would have paid to its service providers had a broker-dealer or any affiliate of the broker-dealer
not paid or agreed to pay those service providers on behalf of the fund in connection with the allocation of fund transactions
to the broker-dealer. The Commission is also proposing amendments to various fund registration forms to require
that the adjusted expenses be reflected in the fee table and financial highlights table included in fund prospectuses,
in the yield quotation required in fund Statements of Additional Information, and, as a result, in yield quotations
in fund advertisements and sales literature. Finally, the Commission is proposing to require that the financial
highlights table disclose the average commission rate paid by the fund. 



I. Background 



Some investment companies recently have entered into arrangements under which a broker-dealer agrees to pay the
cost of certain products or services provided to the investment company in exchange for fund brokerage (``brokerage/service
arrangements''). Under a typical brokerage/service arrangement, a broker agrees to pay a fund's custodian fees
or transfer agency fees and, in exchange, the fund agrees to direct a minimum amount of brokerage to the broker. The
fund usually negotiates the terms of the contract with the service provider, who is paid directly by the broker.

1 







By entering into a brokerage/service arrangement, a fund can reduce expenses reported to shareholders in its statement
of operations, fee table, and its expense ratio and can increase its reported yield.

2

 This is because the costs paid on behalf of the fund by the broker are embedded in the brokerage commissions the fund
pays.

3

 Under current accounting treatment, brokerage commissions are reflected in the cost basis of the purchased securities
or as a reduction of the proceeds from the sale of securities.

4

 In substance, however, a brokerage/service arrangement involves a rebate on brokerage commissions which, if paid
in cash to the fund, would not reduce fund expenses.

5 










As a result of the current accounting treatment of brokerage/service arrangements, investors may not be able to evaluate
fully the expenses of a fund that pays for services with commission dollars and accurately compare expenses and yields
among funds. This lack of comparability is particularly significant considering the wide use of fund expense data
by investors. 

Brokerage/service arrangements may benefit funds (and their shareholders) by reducing overall fund costs and increasing
total return,

6

 particularly if lower commissions are not available to funds that do not enter into the arrangements.

7

 The receipt of a net benefit by a fund does not, however, alter the substance of the services provided under these arrangements.
The services provided are generally wholly distinct from the execution of securities transactions, and their reflection
as capital costs can distort fund financial information.

8 









The Commission, therefore, is proposing to amend its accounting rules to require that amounts the fund would have
paid for services in the absence of brokerage/service arrangements be reflected as ``expenses'' in fund financial
information and in fund performance data. 



II. Discussion 



A. Accounting for Expenses Paid From Brokerage Commissions 



1. The Proposed Accounting Method 



The Commission is proposing to amend rule 6-07 of Regulation S-X

9

 to require that the amounts of the various expenses (such as custody fees, transfer agency fees, printing and legal
fees, and other miscellaneous fees) listed in a fund's statement of operations be adjusted, or ``grossed-up,'' to
include amounts paid with commission dollars.

10

 The required adjustments to the statement of operations would be made at the time financial statements are prepared,
and no daily expense accruals for services paid for with commission dollars would be required. No amounts in the financial
statements other than expenses and the expense ratio would be required to be adjusted.

<TEXT>
 

Under the proposed amendments, the total of the itemized expenses in the statement of operations, including the expenses
paid with commission dollars, would be shown as the fund's ``total expenses.'' As discussed below, the total expense
figure also would be used in determining the fund's expense ratio, its ``Other Expenses'' listed in the fee table,
and its yield. The total expenses would be reduced by the total amount paid with commission dollars and the remainder
shown on the statement of operations as ``net expenses.''
 The following example illustrates the adjustments to the statement of operations that would be required by the proposed
amendments if custodian fees were paid with commission dollars: 





The additional ``cost'' reflected on the statement of operations would be the amount that the fund would have paid
for the services if commission dollars had not been used. If a fund negotiates the service provider's fees directly
with the service provider, the cost of the services for purposes of making the required adjustments would be the amount
negotiated, presumably the same amount the fund would have paid for the service in the absence of the arrangement.
When the broker arranges for the services or provides them itself or through an affiliate, however, the actual cost
of the services may not be readily determinable by the fund. In this case, the proposed amendments would require that
the fund reflect in its financial statements an amount determined by making a good-faith estimate of the amount the
fund would have paid had it contracted for the services directly in an arms-length transaction.
 Comment is requested whether there are alternative methods for valuing services provided or arranged by brokers.







The amendments would specifically except research services, as that term is used in section 28(e) of the 1934 Act,
from the services the cost of which must be reflected as expenses.
 The cost of research ``purchased'' by an adviser with fund commission dollars could also be considered an expense
of the fund which is not reflected as an expense in the statement of operations and other financial information. The
Commission is concerned that the adoption of these disclosure rules might lead some funds to discontinue brokerage/service
arrangements and purchase more research through traditional soft dollar arrangements, which, under these proposals,
would not be required to be treated as an expense. Comment is requested whether these proposals would have this effect.





The Commission is studying whether the cost of research services provided by brokers should be reflected as fund expenses
and requests comment on this issue.
 Commenters favoring inclusion of research services in the amendments should address how such services should be
valued and how the value of the services should be allocated among clients of the adviser that may benefit from them.
If research services cannot be valued, should the Commission require that assumptions be made about their value by
extrapolation from the brokerage commissions paid? For example, should the difference between a brokerage commission
paid on a transaction and the lowest commission paid by the fund be considered a fund expense for research? Alternatively,
should the Commission require only that the values of research services that have readily ascertainable values be
quantified, such as subscriptions to newspapers, price quotation or valuation services, or research that is received
in return for the direction of a determinable amount of brokerage? 





2. An Alternative Accounting Method 



As an alternative to the accounting changes being proposed, funds could be required to allocate each commission paid
between execution cost and payment for fund services and to present their financial statements based upon those allocations.
This method would require separating commissions into brokerage and expense components, and reflecting the expense
component as an expense in the financial statements. 
The allocation method would assess the actual economic character of a fund's brokerage commissions and adjust all
fund financial information to reflect this assessment. Under the allocation method, the portion of a commission
properly allocated to expenses would have to be estimated and may need to be adjusted as the total amount of commission
dollars paid to the broker increases.
 This adjustment, in turn, would require that the cost bases and sales prices of particular securities be adjusted
periodically based upon the transactions directed to a particular broker. Therefore, using the allocation method
to account for expenses paid with commission dollars could prove to be costly and lead to undesirable uncertainties
in accounting.

<DOCNO> FR940817-1-00012 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940817-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission requests comment (i) on the ability of funds to account for amounts paid with commission dollars by
the allocation method, (ii) whether the proposed gross-up method adequately reflects the economic nature of these
arrangements, and (iii) on the costs of each of these accounting methods compared to their benefits to investors.




B. The Fee Table and Financial Highlights Table 



The Commission is proposing to amend instructions to the items of the fund registration forms that require funds to
include in their prospectuses a table presenting the expenses paid by fund shareholders, either directly or out of
the assets of the fund (the ``fee table'').
 The amended instructions would require that the expense percentages included in a fund's fee table be based upon total
expenses (

i.e., 

that the percentages include amounts paid with commission dollars).
 Similarly, the amendments would revise Form N-1A and Form N-2 to require that the ``ratio of expenses to
average net assets'' in a fund's ``financial highlights'' table reflect expenses paid with commission dollars.
 The fee table and financial highlights table are required to be placed prominently in the prospectus, and are intended
to be the primary means for the communication of fund expenses and performance to shareholders and prospective shareholders.
 The proposed amendments are intended to improve the ability of investors to use the fee table and financial highlights
table to compare fund expenses.
 








The financial highlights table in fund prospectuses presents key financial data for each of the last ten fiscal years.
Funds may not be able to readily determine amounts paid with commission dollars during past years. Therefore, the
proposed amendments would not require that total expenses be reflected in the expense ratio in the financial highlights
table for fiscal years ending before the adoption of the amendments.
 A footnote would be required disclosing the change in the manner in which expenses have been determined. 




C. Performance Information 


Commission rules require that any quotation of yield in a mutual fund advertisement be calculated in accordance with
a formula that reflects fund expenses accrued for the period.
 Use of total expenses in the calculation of a fund's yield may be appropriate to reflect actual fund expenses and necessary
to maintain the value of yield as an indicator of fund performance.
 Therefore, the Commission is proposing instructions to the yield formulas for funds (other than money market funds)
to require that the costs of services paid for with brokerage commissions be reflected in quotations of yield in a fund's
registration statement, and, as a result, in its advertisements. 





As discussed above, the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X would require that adjustments to fund expenses
be made at the end of a financial statement period.
 Those amendments generally would not require funds to accrue or otherwise determine at the end of the thirty-day period
for which yield is calculated the amount of expenses paid with brokerage commissions for that period. The proposed
instructions to the yield formulas, therefore, would require funds to estimate amounts paid with commission dollars
for the period of the yield quotation. Comment is requested on the feasibility of making such an estimate and whether
there are alternative approaches. 




The proposals would not revise the manner in which yield is calculated by money market funds. The money market fund
yield formula is based upon the net change in the value of a hypothetical account, and any spread or mark-up paid by a
fund would be amortized and reflected in that change in value.
 Therefore, requiring money market funds to include fees paid with commission dollars in the calculation of yield
would result in those fees being counted twice.
 Comment is specifically requested whether the money market fund yield formula should be revised to reflect the cost
of services paid for with commission dollars as expenses when they are incurred. Commenters should discuss the extent
to which money market funds pay or can pay expenses through brokerage/service arrangements, and commenters suggesting
revisions to the yield calculation should provide specific text or formulas. 





D. Related Arrangements 


The Commission is aware that funds enter into certain other arrangements that, like brokerage/service arrangements,
have the effect of reducing reported fund expenses. Some funds, for example, have ``compensating balance'' arrangements
with their custodians under which their custodian fees are reduced if they maintain cash on deposit with the custodians
in non-interest bearing accounts. In these arrangements expenses are reduced by forgoing income rather than by recharacterizing
them as capital items. The Commission requests comment whether an adjustment to fund expenses similar to that being
proposed for brokerage/service arrangements should be required for these expense offset arrangements, or whether
these arrangements should be addressed in footnotes to the financial statements. Because a fund that enters into
these arrangements forgoes income, comment also is requested whether such income should be estimated and reflected
in fund financial information, and how such estimates might be made. 
Some custodial arrangements may involve explicit oral or written understandings regarding the fee reductions that
will occur when uninvested cash balances exceed predetermined levels. Often, however, a fund's custodian fee reflects
an estimate of the income the custodian expects to derive from the fund's uninvested cash balances, and the resulting
reduction in the fee is not explicitly disclosed in the custodial agreement. The Commission requests comment whether
the amount of any increase in fund expenses to reflect these arrangements should include only amounts that are explicit
in the agreements, or should also include amounts implicit in the basic custodian fee.
 




E. Average Commission Rates 



Brokerage commissions and other costs incurred in connection with the execution of a fund's portfolio transactions
are not reflected in the fund's statement of operations, financial highlights table or fee table because these costs
are treated as capital items which increase the cost of securities purchased or reduce the proceeds of securities
sold. The Commission is concerned that adequate information about these costs currently may not be provided to investors.
 The Commission, therefore, is proposing to require that the average commission rate paid by a fund (in cents per share)
be disclosed in the financial highlights table next to the portfolio turnover rate.
 Other fund transaction costs, such as mark-ups, mark-downs, and spreads, would not be included in this commission
rate figure. Comment is requested whether these other costs should be reflected, and, if so, how they should be calculated
or estimated.

III. General Request for Comments 




Any interested persons wishing to submit written comments on the rule and form changes that are the subject of this
Release, to suggest additional changes, or to submit comments on other matters that might have an effect on the proposals
contained in this Release, are requested to do so. Comment is specifically requested regarding the prevalence and
significant terms of brokerage/service arrangements, the expenses paid through the arrangements, and the effect
of the arrangements on fund expenses and commissions.



IV. Cost/Benefit Analysis 




The rule and form changes proposed today are intended to improve the reporting of investment company expenses and
improve the ability of investors to compare investment company expenses and performance. While the rule and form
changes may increase the costs to funds of preparing financial statements and fund registration materials, the Commission
believes that any such cost increases would, at most, be minimal. A fund that has brokerage/service arrangements
would be required to add two captions and a footnote to its statement of operations and replace the net expense figures
currently disclosed in its fee table and financial highlights table with total expense figures. These figures will
normally be readily determinable by the fund. Funds should also be able to readily estimate expenses paid with brokerage
commissions for purposes of yield calculations. In short, the Commission believes that the costs of the amendments
proposed today would be substantially outweighed by the benefits to investors of receiving more accurate and useful
financial information about 
funds. 



V. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis




The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding
the proposed amendments. The analysis notes that the rule and form proposals contained in this Release are intended
to provide for the comparability of fund expenses reflected in fund disclosure documents and advertisements. Other
aggregate cost-benefit information reflected in the ``Cost/Benefit Analysis'' section of this release also is
reflected in the analysis. A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained by contacting Eric
C. Freed, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Mail Stop 10-6, Washington, DC 20549.

Review of Regulations for General Biologics and Licensing and Blood Establishments and Blood Products; Extension
of Comment Periods



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Intent to review regulations; extension of comment periods.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is extending to 
November 15, 1994, the comment periods for two documents. The documents requested comments on FDA's intent to review
certain biologics regulations, and were published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28821 and 28822, respectively). FDA is taking this action in response to requests to allow additional
time for public comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of June 3, 
1994 (58 FR 28821, 28822), FDA issued two documents entitled ``Review of General Biologics and Licensing Regulations''
(Docket No. 94N-0066) and ``Review of Regulations for Blood Establishments and Blood Products'' (Docket No.
94N-0080). Interested persons were given until August 17, 1994, to respond to the documents.



The American Blood Resources Association has requested a 90-day extension of the comment periods for the two above
mentioned documents. The Biotechnology Industry Organization and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
of America have requested a 60-day extension for the general biologics and licensing regulations document. In order
to allow interested persons to fully respond to the requests for comments, FDA believes it is in the public interest
to extend the comment period to allow interested persons to carefully review the regulations and submit written comments.
Therefore, FDA is granting the request by extending the comment periods for both documents to November 15, 1994. Interested
persons may, on or before November 15, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified
with the appropriate docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen
in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Safety Standards for Ventilation of Underground Coal Mines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Mine Safety and Health Administration, Labor. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public hearings. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) will hold public hearings to receive comments on the May 19, 1994,
proposed rule revising certain provisions of the existing safety standards for ventilation of underground coal
mines. These hearings are being held under section 101 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The hearings
will be held in Price, Utah; Monaville, West Virginia; and Washington, Pennsylvania. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 19, 1994, MSHA published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 26356) revising stayed provisions of MSHA's existing safety standards for ventilation of underground coal
mines. The proposal also revised, clarified or reproposed certain other provisions in the existing rule; included
some new provisions; and addressed concerns raised by the public. The comment period was scheduled to close on July
18, 1994, but, in response to a request from the 
mining community for additional time in which to prepare comments, MSHA extended the comment period to August 8, 1994
(59 FR 35071). 



The purpose of the hearings is to receive relevant comments and to answer questions interpreting or clarifying the
proposal. The hearings will be conducted in an informal manner by a panel of MSHA officials. Although formal rules
of evidence or cross examination will not apply, the presiding official may exercise discretion to ensure the orderly
progress of the hearings and may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious material and questions. 

Each session will begin with an opening statement from MSHA, followed by an opportunity for members of the public to
make oral presentations. The hearing panel will be available to address relevant questions. At the discretion of
the presiding official, the time allocated to speakers for their presentations may be limited. In the interest of
conducting productive hearings, MSHA will schedule speakers in a manner that allows all points of view to be heard
as effectively as possible. 

Verbatim transcripts of the proceedings will be prepared and made a part of the rulemaking record. Copies of the hearing
transcripts will be made available to the public for review. 

MSHA will also accept for the record additional written comments and other appropriate data from any interested party,
including those not presenting oral statements. Written comments and data submitted to MSHA will be included in the
rulemaking record. To allow for the submission of any post-hearing comments the record will remain open until November
18, 1994.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; 
District of Columbia-Small Business Stationary Source Technical 
and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program

AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the District of Columbia for the
purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program. In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is
set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct
final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on
this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting
on this action should do so at this time.

Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations; Consistency Update for California 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'').


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (``NPRM'')_consistency update.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to update a portion of the Outer Continental Shelf (``OCS'') Air Regulations. Requirements applying
to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent
with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (``COA''), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean
Air Act (``the Act''), the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The portion of the OCS air regulations that is being updated
pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (Santa
Barbara County APCD) and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD) are the designated
COAs, and a requirement submitted by the state of California. The OCS requirements for the above Districts and the
state of California, contained in the Technical Support Document, are proposed to be incorporated by reference into
the Code of Federal Regulations and are listed in the appendix to the OCS air regulations. Proposed changes to the existing
requirements are discussed below.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On September 4, 1992, EPA promulgated 40 CFR part 55,
 which established requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources in order to attain and maintain federal
and state ambient air quality standards and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the Act. Part 55 applies
to all OCS sources offshore of the States except those located in the Gulf of Mexico west of 87.5 degrees longitude.
Section 328 of the Act requires that for such sources located within 25 miles of a state's seaward boundary, the requirements
shall be the same as would be applicable if the sources were located in the COA. Because the OCS requirements are based
on onshore requirements, and onshore requirements may change, section 328(a)(1) requires that EPA update the OCS
requirements as necessary to maintain consistency with onshore requirements. 




Pursuant to  55.12 of the OCS rule, consistency reviews will occur: (1) At least annually; (2) upon receipt of
a Notice of Intent (NOI) under  55.4; and (3) when a state or local agency submits a rule to EPA to be considered
for incorporation by reference in part 55. This NPRM is being promulgated in response to the submittal of rules by two
local air pollution control agencies and one rule submitted by the state of California. Public comments received
in writing within 30 days of publication of this notice will be considered by EPA before promulgation of the final updated
rule. 
Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located
within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory
mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. This limits EPA's flexibility
in deciding which requirements will be incorporated into part 55 and prevents EPA from making substantive changes
to the requirements it incorporates. As a result, EPA may be incorporating rules into part 55 that do not conform to
all of EPA's state implementation plan (SIP) guidance or certain requirements of the Act. Consistency updates may
result in the inclusion of state or local rules or regulations into part 55, even though the same rules may ultimately
be disapproved for inclusion as part of the SIP. Inclusion in the OCS rule does not imply that a rule meets the requirements
of the Act for SIP approval, nor does it imply that the rule will be approved by EPA for inclusion in the SIP. 


EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action 


In updating 40 CFR part 55, EPA reviewed the state and local rules submitted for inclusion in part 55 to ensure that they
are rationally related to the attainment or maintenance of federal or state ambient air quality standards or part
C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that
they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1. EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure they are not arbitrary or
capricious. 40 CFR 55.12 (e). In addition, EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules.
 




A. As stated in the California Health and Safety Code, the following requirements shall be statewide, and no rule or
regulation of any district that is applicable to sandblasting operations shall be stricter or less strict than the
standards adopted by the state board pursuant to the recommendations of the committee appointed by the state board
to adopt air pollution standards for sandblasting operations. After review of the rule submitted by the State of California
against the criteria set forth above and in 40 CFR part 55, EPA is proposing to make the state abrasive sandblasting
requirements applicable to OCS sources:

B. After review of the rule submitted by the Santa Barbara County APCD against the criteria set forth above and in 40

APCD is designated as the COA. None of the existing OCS requirements were deleted. The following new rule was submitted
by the District to be added:



Rule 359 Flares and Thermal Oxidizers (Adopted 6/28/94)



C. After review of the rules submitted by Ventura County APCD against the criteria 
set forth above and in 40 CFR part 55, EPA is proposing to make the following rules applicable to OCS sources for which
Ventura County APCD is designated as the COA. None of the existing OCS requirements were deleted. 
The following rules were submitted as revisions to existing requirements:



Rule 54 Sulfur Compounds (Adopted 6/14/94) 
Rule 64 Sulfur Content of Fuels (Adopted 6/14/94)



D. Regulatory Flexibility Act_The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each federal agency to perform a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities.'' Small entities include small businesses, 
organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. 
As was stated in the final regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and the structure of the rule
averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates
onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328
of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule. 
The EPA certifies that this notice of proposed rulemaking will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities. 
E. Paperwork Reduction Act_The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements
contained in the final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the 

Paperwork Reduction Act

, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq., 

and has assigned OMB control number 2060-0249. This consistency update does not add any further requirements.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The USEPA proposes to redesignate Oshkosh, Wisconsin from unclassifiable to attainment status for carbon monoxide.
In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the USEPA is approving the redesignation as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial redesignation and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to the direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If the USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting
on this document should do so at this time.

Protection of Stratospheric Ozone 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed stay. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In the rules Section of today's 

Federal Register

, EPA is announcing a three-month stay and reconsideration of certain federal rules requiring the repair of leaks
in industrial process equipment promulgated as part of the National Refrigerant Recycling Program. That action
stays the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), including the applicable compliance dates, as they apply to industrial
process refrigeration equipment only. EPA is issuing that stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42
U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration.




This notice proposes, pursuant to Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), to stay temporarily the
effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), and applicable compliance dates, beyond the three months expressly provided
in section 307(d)(7)(B), but only to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration (including any appropriate
regulatory action) of the rules in question. Pursuant to the rulemaking procedures set 
forth in the Clean Air Act section 307(d), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d), EPA hereby requests public comment on this proposed temporary
extension of the three-month stay. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



In the rules Section of today's 

Federal Register

, EPA announces that pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), it is convening a proceeding
for reconsideration of certain federal rules requiring the repair of leaks of ozone-depleting substances for industrial
process refrigeration equipment promulgated as part of the National Refrigerant Recycling Program (58 

FR 

28660, May 14, 1993). Readers should refer to that notice for a complete discussion of the background and rules affected.
In that document EPA also announces a three-month stay of  82.156(i) as it applies to industrial process refrigeration
equipment only, and any applicable compliance dates, during reconsideration (including appropriate regulatory
action) expressly provided by the Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). If EPA does not complete the reconsideration
during the three-month stay, then it may be appropriate to extend the stay of these provisions for industrial process
refrigeration and applicable compliance dates until EPA completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration.
By this action, EPA proposes a temporary extension of the stay beyond the three months to the extent necessary to complete
reconsideration of the rules in question. If EPA takes final action to impose this proposed stay, the stay would extend
until the effective date of EPA's final action following reconsideration of these rules.

By this notice EPA hereby proposes, pursuant to Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), a temporary
administrative stay of the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i) as it applies to industrial process refrigeration equipment,
including the applicable compliance dates, promulgated as final federal rules requiring the repair and/or retrofitting
of equipment containing ozone-depleting refrigerants (58 

FR 

28660, May 14, 1993). Pursuant to the rulemaking procedures set forth in section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, EPA hereby
requests comment on such a proposed stay. 

EPA is proposing this temporary administrative stay of the rules and associated compliance dates in order to complete
reconsideration of these rules, EPA intends to complete its reconsideration of the rules and, following the notice
and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, take appropriate action. If the reconsideration results
in repair and retrofit requirements for industrial process refrigeration equipment that are stricter than the existing
and rules, EPA intends to propose an appropriate compliance period from the date of final action on reconsideration.
EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced by the Agency's reconsideration. Any EPA
proposal regarding changes to the leak repair requirements and the appropriate compliance period would be subject
to the notice and comment procedures of Clean Air Act section 307(d). 

The regulatory requirements that are affected by today's proposal were raised in the context of a settlement agreement
between EPA and the Chemical Manufacturers 
Association.

Roadway Worker Protection

AGENCY:

 Federal Railroad Administration (FRA); DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposal to Form a Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee and Request for Representation. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 FRA proposes to establish a Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990
and the Federal Advisory Committee Act to develop a recommended rule concerning the protection of railroad roadway
workers. The Committee would adopt its recommendations through a negotiation process. The Committee would be composed
of persons who represent the interests affected by the rule, such as labor organizations, railroads, railroad associations,
contractor associations, and the government. FRA invites interested parties to submit nominations and applications
for membership on the Committee. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background 



(A) History 



The Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act, Pub.L. No. 
102-365, 106 Stat. 972, enacted September 3, 1992, required FRA to review its track safety standards and revise
them based on data presented during that review. Among the topics to be addressed was ``an evaluation of employee safety.''
FRA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54038) to announce the opening
of a proceeding to amend the Federal Track Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 213). That ANPRM addressed the general topics
to be considered, including standards for railroad track itself, and protecting maintenance-of-way and other non-operating
railroad employees from the hazards of moving railroad equipment. 

As part of that proceeding, FRA conducted a series of workshops to obtain the industry's views on the need for and substance
of any changes to FRA's regulations. One such workshop session, announced in Notice No. 4 of that ANPRM issued on February
18, 1993 (58 FR 8928), and held in Washington, D.C. on March 31, 1993 addressed specifically the issue of protection
of roadway workers from being struck by moving trains and equipment. Since that workshop, FRA has received petitions
for emergency orders and rulemaking on the topic from the Brotherhood of Maintenance-of-Way Employees and the Brotherhood
of Railroad Signalmen. 

FRA originally planned to include protection from moving trains and moving equipment into a new Subpart G of 49 CFR
Part 213, but it will now be considered as part of 49 CFR Part 214, Railroad Workplace Safety. Given FRA's desire to address
this issue on an expedited basis, and because it relates more closely to workplace safety than to track standards,
this proceeding is now separated from FRA Docket No. RST-90-1 and has been placed in FRA Docket No. RSOR
13. Items related to this subject which were submitted as part of Docket No. RST-90-1 will be considered
as part of this proceeding, as will the transcript of the public workshop on March 31, 1993. 



(B) Purpose 



FRA is taking this action for the purpose of reducing the risk of death or injury railroad roadway workers face when
struck by moving trains and railroad equipment. Since 1989, 21 roadway workers have been fatally injured by moving
trains and equipment. Eight workers were struck by trains while performing work, three were struck by trains on track
adjacent to the work location, five stepped into a train's path, and five were struck by 
maintenance-of-way equipment. These fatalities are among the following crafts: signal maintainers, machine operators,
welders, track foremen, track inspectors, and track laborers. 

These figures reflect a serious problem that may require changes in railroad operating rules, training and practices.
In order to address the problem in the short term, FRA Administrator Molitoris convened a meeting on June 3, 1994 at
which FRA distributed summaries of the fatalities, and enlisted the support of the industry to address the issue immediately
on each railroad through local labor/management committees. FRA also discussed the option of proceeding with a negotiated
rulemaking, and has since preliminarily concluded that this issue is an appropriate subject for negotiated rulemaking.




(C) Terminology 



FRA proposes that the term ``roadway worker'' rather than ``maintenance of way employee'' be used in this proceeding
to define the subject persons. This term would encompass all employees of a railroad or a contractor to a railroad who
construct, maintain, inspect or repair railroad tracks, structures, signal and train control systems, communication
systems, utility systems, or any other fixed property of a railroad while in close or potentially close proximity
to tracks on which trains or equipment can be operated. The term would apply regardless of the craft or class title of
the employee, affiliation with any labor organization, or rank within the railroad organization. Examples of subject
persons would be trackmen, signal maintainers, bridge workers, communication technicians, electricians, surveyors,
roadmasters and chief engineers, while performing their duties along the line of road. 

FRA believes that extensive input from all interested parties is necessary to develop a rule that will address both
the risk of injury from moving railroad equipment and the operational concerns that this issue presents. Therefore,
this notice announces FRA's proposal to address these issues through a negotiated rulemaking. 

Set forth below are the basic concepts of negotiated rulemaking, suggested procedures to be followed, and criteria
for participant selection. In order to begin this process shortly, FRA asks that parties representing interests
affected by a roadway worker safety rule request appointment or representation on the Committee within thirty days
of publication of this notice. 



II. Regulatory Negotiation 



Due to the increasing complexity and formalization of the written rulemaking process, it can be difficult for an agency
to craft effective regulatory solutions to certain problems. In the typical rulemaking process, the participants
often develop adversarial relationships that prevent effective communication and creative solutions. The exchange
of ideas that may lead to solutions acceptable to all interested groups often does not occur in the traditional notice
and comment system. As the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) noted in its Recommendation 82-4:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940817-1-00029 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940817-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Experience indicates that if the parties in interest were to work together to negotiate the text of a proposed rule,
they might be able in some circumstances to identify the major issues, gauge their importance to the respective parties,
identify the information and data necessary to resolve the issues, and develop a rule that is acceptable to the respective
interests, all within the contours of the substantive statute.

 

ACUS adopted this recommendation in ``Procedures for Negotiating Proposed Regulations,'' 47 FR 30708, June 18,
1982. The thrust of the recommendation is that representatives of all interests should be assembled to discuss the
issue or hazard and all potential solutions, reach consensus, and prepare a proposed rule for consideration by the
agency. After public comment on any proposal issued by the agency, the group would reconvene to review the comments
and make recommendations for a final rule. This inclusive process is intended to make the rule more acceptable to all
affected interests and prevent the need for petitions for reconsideration and litigation that often follow promulgation
of a final rule. 
The movement toward negotiated rulemaking gained impetus with enactment of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990
(Reg-Neg), 5 U.S.C.  561, 

et seq. 

More recently, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 (EO) (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), which states the
need to reform the current regulatory process into one that is effective, consistent, and understandable. The objectives
of the EO are:

 

To reaffirm the primacy of Federal agencies in the regulatory decision-making process; to restore the integrity
and legitimacy of regulatory review and oversight; and to make the process more accessible and open to the public.

 



Id. 

Section 6(a) of the EO charges government agencies with providing the public meaningful participation in the regulatory
process:

 

In particular, before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, each agency should, where appropriate, seek the involvement
of those who are intended to benefit from and those expected to be burdened by any regulation . . . Each agency is also
directed to explore and, where appropriate, use consensual mechanisms for developing regulations, including negotiated
rulemaking.

 



Id. 

at 51740. 


Although relatively new, negotiated rulemakings have been used successfully by many regulatory agencies, including
the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. FRA now intends to begin this process in a formalized manner for the
first time, and does so with enthusiasm and high expectations. FRA welcomes the opportunity to work with those who
will be affected directly by a roadway worker safety rule, and is confident that the agency and the industry will benefit
from the process by creating an effective and reasonable regulation. 
Pursuant to section 563(a) of Reg-Neg, an agency considering rulemaking by negotiation should consider whether:

 

(1) There is a need for the rule; 
(2) There is a limited number of identifiable interests; 
(3) These interests can be adequately represented by persons willing to negotiate in good faith to reach a consensus;



(4) There is a reasonable likelihood that the committee will reach consensus within a fixed period of time; 
(5) The negotiated rulemaking procedure will not unreasonably delay the notice of proposed rulemaking; 
(6) the agency has adequate resources and is willing to commit such resources to the process; and 
(7) The agency is committed to use the result of the negotiation in formulating a proposed rule if at all possible. 


For the reasons stated in this Notice, FRA believes that these criteria have been met with respect to railroad roadway
safety issues. 
The regulatory negotiation FRA proposes would be carried out by an advisory committee (Committee) created under
the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. App., and in a manner that reflects appropriate rulemaking
objectives, including pertinent Executive Orders. FRA will be represented on the Committee and will take an active
part in the negotiations as a Committee member. However, pursuant to section 566(c) of 
Reg-Neg, the person(s) designated to represent FRA would not facilitate or otherwise chair the proceedings. The
agency is committed to this process and is quite optimistic that it will result in the issuance of an NPRM and final rule
that will be acceptable to the members of the Committee. Because of the need to issue a rule on this subject, FRA is prepared
to go forward with an NPRM that is not the product of the negotiations in the unlikely event the negotiation fails or
if the Committee's recommendation is not acceptable. 


III. Procedures and Guidelines 


The following proposed procedures and guidelines would apply to this process, subject to appropriate changes made
as a result of comments received on this Notice or as are determined to be necessary during the negotiating process.

(A) 

Facilitator: 

FRA is seeking the services of a facilitator for the negotiating group. The facilitator will not be involved with substantive
development of this regulation. This individual will chair the negotiations, may offer alternative suggestions
toward the desired consensus, will help participants define and reach consensus, and will determine the feasibility
of negotiating particular issues. The facilitator may ask members to submit additional information or to reconsider
their position. FRA will contact mediation organizations for potential candidates, and will consider nominations
made in comments received in response to this Notice. 
(B) 

Feasibility: 

FRA has examined the issues and interests involved and has made a preliminary inquiry among representatives of those
interests to determine whether it is possible to reach agreement on: (a) individuals to represent those interests;

(b) the preliminary scope of the issues to be addressed; and 
(c) a schedule for developing a notice of proposed rulemaking. On the basis of the history of this issue and our preliminary
inquiry, we believe that regulatory negotiation could be successful in developing a workable proposal for a notice
of proposed rulemaking and a final rule, and that the potential participants listed below would adequately represent
the affected interests. 
(C) 

Participants and Interests: 

The number of committee participants generally should not exceed 25.

<TEXT>
 

Please note that each individual or organization affected by a final rule need not have its own representative on the
Committee. Rather, each interest must be adequately represented, and the Committee should be fairly balanced. Individuals
who are not part of the Committee may attend sessions and confer with or provide their views to Committee members. 
The following interests have been tentatively identified as those that are likely to be significantly affected by
the rule: 
(1) Railroad labor organizations; 
(2) Railroads, including classes 1 through 3, the short lines, public transit operations, and their associations;

(3) Contractors to railroads who perform roadway work; and 
(4) The Federal government. 
FRA proposes that persons selected by the various interests be named to the Committee. The following interests have
been tentatively identified as those that would supply Committee members: 
(1) The Brotherhood of Maintenance-of-Way Employes; 
(2) The Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen; 
(3) The American Train Dispatchers Association; 
(4) The Association of American Railroads; 
(5) The American Short Line Railroad Association; 
(6) American Public Transit Association; and 
(7) FRA. 
As indicated in paragraph F of this notice, FRA invites applications for representation from any interests that will
be affected by a rule, but are not named in this list. FRA is committed to an open and comprehensive negotiation, and
therefore strongly encourages any such party to file an application for membership. These applications may come
from railroads, labor organizations, associations, or other interests, must be filed within thirty days, and must
meet the requirements set forth in this notice. Also, the interests listed above and those who apply for representation
on the Committee should provide the name(s) of the individual(s) they propose to represent their interests. The Committee
should not exceed twenty-five members. 
(D) 

Good Faith: 

Participants must be committed to negotiate in good faith. It is therefore important that senior individuals within
each interest group be designated to represent that interest. No individual will be required to ``bind'' the interests
he or she represents, but the individual should be at a high enough level to represent the interest with confidence.
For this process to be successful, the interests represented should be willing to accept the final Committee product.

(E) 

Notice of Intent to Establish Advisory Committee and Request for Comment: 

In accordance with the requirements of FACA, an agency of the Federal government cannot establish or utilize a group
of people in the interest of obtaining consensus advice or recommendations unless that group is chartered as a Federal
advisory committee. It is the purpose of this Notice to indicate our intent to create a Federal advisory committee,
to identify the issues involved in the rulemaking, to identify the interests affected by the rulemaking, to identify
potential participants who will adequately represent those interests, and to ask for comment on the use of regulatory
negotiation and on the identification of the issues, interests, procedures, and participants. 
(F) 

Requests for Representation: 

One purpose of this Notice is to determine whether interests exist that may be substantially affected by a rule, but
have not been represented in the list of prospective Committee members. Please identify such interests if they exist.
Each application for membership or nomination to the Committee should include: (i) the name of the applicant or nominee
and the interests such person would represent; (ii) evidence that the applicant or nominee is authorized to represent
parties related to the interests the person proposes to represent; (iii) a written commitment that the applicant
or nominee would participate in good faith; and (iv) the reasons any representative identified in the Notice does
not represent the interests the nominee is alleged to represent. If an additional person or interest requests membership
or representation on the Committee, FRA shall determine (i) whether that interest will be substantially affected
by the rule, (ii) if such interest would be adequately represented by an individual already on the Committee, and (iii)
whether the requester should be added to the group or whether interests can be consolidated to provide adequate representation.

(G) 

Final Notice: 

After evaluating comments received as a result of this notice, FRA will issue a final notice announcing the establishment
of the Federal advisory committee, unless it determines that such action is inappropriate in light of comments received,
and the composition of the Committee. After the Committee is chartered the negotiations would begin. 
(H) 

Administrative Support and Meetings: 

Staff support would be provided by FRA and meetings would take place in Washington, D.C., unless agreed otherwise
by the Committee. 
(I) 

Tentative Schedule: 

If the Committee is established and selected, FRA will publish a schedule for the first meeting in the 

Federal Register

. The first meeting will focus on procedural matters, including dates, times, and locations of future meetings. Notice
of subsequent meetings would also be published in the 

Federal Register

 before being held. 
FRA expects that the Committee would reach consensus and prepare a report recommending a proposed rule within six
months of the first meeting. However, if unforeseen delays occur, the Administrator may agree to an extension of that
time if a consensus of the Committee believes that additional time will result in agreement. The process may end earlier
if the facilitator so recommends. 
(J) 

Committee Procedures: 

Under the general guidance of the facilitator, and subject to legal requirements, the Committee would establish
the detailed procedures for meetings which it considers appropriate.

<TEXT>
 

(K) 

Record of Meetings: 

In accordance with FACA's requirements, FRA would keep a record of all Committee meetings. This record would be placed
in the public docket for this rulemaking. Meetings of the Committee would generally be open to the public. 

(L) 

Consensus: 

The goal of the negotiating process is consensus. FRA proposes that the Committee would develop its own definition
of consensus, which may include unanimity, a simple majority, or substantial agreement such that no member will disapprove
the final recommendation of the Committee. However, if the Committee does not develop its own definition, consensus
shall be unanimous concurrence.

(M) 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Final Rule: 

The Committee's first objective is to prepare a report containing a notice of proposed rulemaking, preamble, and
economic evalutation. If consensus is not obtained on some issues, the report should identify the areas of agreement
and disagreement, and explanations for any disagreement. It is expected that participants will address cost/benefit,
paperwork reduction, and regulatory flexibility requirements. FRA would prepare an economic assessment if appropriate.

FRA would issue the proposed rule as prepared by the Committee unless it is inconsistent with statutory authority
of the agency or other legal requirements or does not, in the agency's view, adequately address the subject matter.
If that occurs, FRA would explain the reasons for its decision, or would modify the proposal in a way that allows the
public to distinguish modifications from the original proposal. 


The Committee would reconvene to review comments received in response to publication of the proposed rule and would
negotiate to produce a recommended final rule. FRA would issue the recommended final rule as prepared by the Committee
unless it is inconsistent with statutory authority of the agency or other legal requirements or does not, in the agency's
view, adequately address the subject matter. If that occurs, FRA would explain the reasons for its decision, or would
modify the recommended final rule in a way that allows the public to distinguish modifications from the recommended
final rule. 


(N) 

Key Issues for Negotiation: 

FRA has reviewed correspondence, petitions, injury data, existing railroad operating practices, and has engaged
in extensive dialogue concerning the protection of roadway workers. Based on this information and rulemaking requirements,
FRA has tentatively identified major issues that should be considered in this negotiated rulemaking. Other issues
related to roadway protection not specifically listed in this Notice may be addressed as they arise in the course of
the negotiation. Comments are invited concerning the appropriateness of these issues for consideration and whether
other issues should be added.

1. Are devices available that may be used to reduce the risk of danger to roadway workers? If so, how do these devices
work and what are the costs associated with them? 

2. Are there appropriate procedures or operating practices that may be instituted effectively to reduce the risk
of danger to roadway workers? If so, what are the costs that will be associated with implementing these practices and
procedures? 


3. Are there appropriate training programs that may be given to reduce the risk of danger to roadway workers? If so,
at what intervals should they be taught? Also, what are the costs and the time associated with such a program? 


4. Are there peculiar topographical, environmental, and operational conditions that must be considered in developing
a program to reduce the risk of harm to roadway workers? What are the specific conditions, and how do they vary from one
region to another, and from one railroad to another? What would the cost for this program be? 


5. Should any program developed vary according to the size of a railroad? If so, explain why such variations are necessary
and how the programs should differ. 


6. What recordkeeping and reporting requirements, if any, should be instituted to advance the safety of roadway workers?
What is the amount of time and cost involved with these requirements? 


7. What enforcement procedures should FRA utilize to ensure compliance with any rule developed? 


8. Aside from the obvious benefit of providing safer working conditions and so reducing the risk of injury and death
for roadway workers, are there additional benefits (both monetary and non-monetary) that will result from the implementation
of a rule concerning roadway workers? 


9. Do any railroads currently have internal operating practices that address the intended purposes of this negotiated
rulemaking? If so, please provide the background for implementation of these practices, and a description of their
effectiveness. Also, what were the costs and benefits associated with implementing these practices? 




IV. Public Participation 




FRA invites comments on all issues, procedures, guidelines, interests, and suggested participants embodied in
this Notice. All comments and requests for participation should be submitted to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief
Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 8201, Washington, DC 20590.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Notice of 90-day Finding on a Petition To List the Scaled Dune Buprestid
Beetle



<AGENCY>

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of petition finding.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 90-day finding on a petition to list the scaled dune buprestid
beetle (

Lepismadora algodones

) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Service determines that substantial information
has not been presented indicating that the requested action may be warranted.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background




Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533) (Act), requires that the Service
make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial
information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the maximum extent practicable, this finding
is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. The Service determines that the subject petition did not present substantial information indicating that the requested
action may be warranted.

On August 10, 1992, the Service received a petition to list the scaled dune Buprestid beetle (

Lepismadora algodones

) as an endangered species. The petition was submitted by Dr. Charles Bellamy of Escondido, California and was dated
August 5, 1992. The petition stated that 

L. algodones

 is imperiled because its current distribution is small, its population size is low, and its habitat is being depleted
and degraded by off-highway vehicles (OHVs).

The scaled dune buprestid beetle was first collected in 1985 along the western edge of the Algodones Sand Hills, near
Glamis, Imperial County, California (Bellamy 1992). The beetle was first described in 1987 by R.K. Velten (Velten
and Bellamy 1987). It is quite distinct from other buprestids in North America (Bellamy 1992). The species has been
collected from its type locality every year since 1985.

The scaled dune buprestid beetle occupies ecotonal vegetation between Sonoran creosote bush scrub and southern
dune scrub along the perimeter of the Algodones Sand Hills, an area of extensive sand dunes approximately 45 miles
(70 kilometers) in length. Dominant shrubs in this habitat include 

Larrea divaricata

 (creosote), 

Ephedra

 sp., and 

Eriogonum deserticola

 (Imperial buckwheat). A variety of perennial herbs as also present in this habitat. Adult beetles have been observed
feeding on 

Tiquila plicata

 (plicate coldenia), but no information is available on larval hosts or the species' population biology.

The Bureau of Land Management owns the lands supporting the beetle. Portions of the Algodones Sand Hills are heavily
used by OHVs and are completely denuded of vegetation. A large portion of the sand hills are closed to OHV use, and much
of the open section of the dunes are unaffected by OHVs, because the area is not easily accessible.

Dr. Bellamy (pers. comm. 1992) suggested that the scaled dune buprestid is restricted to a single large colony, located
in the closed portion of the dunes. He acknowledge that seemingly suitable habitat exists along the perimeter of the
Algodones Sand Hills. 

Tiquila plicata

, an adult food plant, is common along the perimeter of the dunes. Dr. Bellamy indicated that much of the area has not
been surveyed because it is inaccessible without using OHVs, which would potentially damage the species habitat.

The Service has carefully reviewed the petition and interviewed Dr. Bellamy. Based upon this information, the Service
has determined that substantial information has not been presented indicating that the listing of the scaled dune
buprestid may be warranted. This finding is based upon a lack of data for the vast majority of apparently suitable habitat,
coupled with a lack of documentation of threats facing this species.

ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to amend the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) that prescribe the certification and training
requirements for mechanics and repairmen. Current regulations prescribing these certification requirements
do not reflect the significant technological advances that have occurred in the aviation industry and the enhancements
in training and instructional methods that have affected all aviation maintenance personnel. The proposed rule
would consolidate and clarify all certification, training, experience, and currency requirements for aviation
maintenance personnel in a newly established Part 66 of the FAR. The proposal would enhance aviation safety by establishing
new training programs for aviation maintenance personnel and would decrease the regulatory burden on these personnel
by providing alternatives for meeting experience and currency requirements. The proposed rule would enhance the
technical capabilities and increase the level of professionalism among aviation maintenance personnel. All proposals
are based on recommendations developed by the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC).

Background



In keeping with the FAA's policy of reviewing and upgrading regulations to ensure that they are consistent with changes
in the aviation environment, the FAA is conducting a two-phase regulatory review to amend Part 65, Subparts D and E
(14 CFR Part 65) of the FAR, which pertain to mechanics, mechanics holding inspection authorizations, and repairmen.
Since the recodification requirements for these airmen has not been accomplished and few significant revisions
to the subparts have been made. However, numerous technological advances in the aviation industry, recent FAA and
international regulatory activities, concerns over aging aircraft, and enhancements in training methods have
significantly affected all aspects of maintenance operations. Additionally, various and often conflicting interpretations
of the existing regulations periodically have resulted in confusion among the airmen for whom this part was intended.
Because of these factors, the FAA has instituted this complete regulatory review of Part 65, Subparts D and E.

In November 1989, a joint industry/FAA Part 65 review group was formed to evaluate and review certification requirements
for mechanics and repairmen. The review group's objective was to develop and present a unified position on Part 65.
The group comprised representatives from several aviation associations and was coordinated by the Professional
Aviation Maintenance Association (PAMA). FAA interests were represented by the Aircraft Maintenance Division
(AFS-300) of the FAA.

The review group conducted a series of panel discussions throughout the United States and, as a result, drafted the


Industry/FAA Part 65 Review Group Working Paper, 

which was published on January 31, 1991. This paper presented the issues of general agreement within the review group
and also presented those issues that the group believed would require further discussion.

Further impetus for the Part 65 review came with ARAC's establishment. The ARAC charter became effective on February
5, 1991. ARAC was established to assist the FAA in the rulemaking process by providing input from outside the Government
on major regulatory issues affecting aviation safety. ARAC includes representatives of air carriers, manufacturers,
general aviation, labor groups, universities, associations, airline passenger groups, and the general public.
Under the framework provided by ARAC, the previously established Part 65 review group became a working group of ARAC.
ARAC's formation has given the FAA additional opportunities to solicit information directly from significantly
affected parties who meet and exchange ideas about proposed rules and existing rules that should either be revised
or eliminated.

The issues agreed upon by the review group in the January 31, 1991, working paper and the consensus achieved at subsequent
meetings of the Part 65 working group have become the basis for the changes proposed in this NPRM, which constitute
phase I of the Part 65 regulatory review. The issues that require further discussion and agreement by the members of
the working group (such as the evaluation of any potential for additional certificates and ratings and the expansion
of aviation repair specialist privileges) will become the basis for phase II of the regulatory review and a subsequent
NPRM.

In support of this regulatory review, the FAA completed a historical review of Part 65, Subparts D and E, on October
22, 1991. This review revealed that there have been 17 amendments (1 of which was rescinded), 3 petitions for rulemaking,
and 100 exemption actions to these subparts since recodification. In addition, one accident, the Aloha Airlines
Boeing 737 structural failure on April 28, 1988, generated National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendations
related to these subparts.

The three petitions for rulemaking addressed issues associated with establishing certificates and ratings for
avionics and instrument technicians, recertifying mechanics, and allowing applicants for mechanic certificates
who desire to qualify on the basis of experience and have not graduated from an approved Part 147 aviation maintenance
technician school to take the oral and practical tests for a certificate or rating before completing the required
written tests.

The majority of requests for exemption, FAA policy letters, and legal interpretations regarding mechanics pertained
to inspection authorization renewal or the general eligibility and experience requirements. The majority of actions
concerning repairmen involved certificate privileges and limitations.

The FAA also conducted a survey of FAA regional offices on the certification of mechanics, holders of inspection authorizations,
and repairmen during 1991. A copy of this survey has been placed in docket number 27863. The survey questions were derived
from issues that surfaced during FAA participation in listening sessions with aviation industry associations and
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Aircraft Maintenance Engineer Licensing Panel and from issues
identified in legal interpretations, petitions for exemption, petitions for rulemaking, and enforcement actions.

Results of this survey showed clear support for: (1) replacing the term ``mechanic'' with ``aviation maintenance
technician''; (2) developing a system for granting additional privileges and limitations for mechanics; (3) encouraging
additional FAA participation with ICAO and other aviation authorities to standardize training and certification
of maintenance personnel; (4) using aviation maintenance instructor experience to satisfy recent experience requirements;
(5) clarifying  65.75(b), written test requirements; (6) adding ``facsimile'' to  65.16; and (7) developing
a separate certificate or rating for balloon repairmen. The majority of the respondents supported changes in the
English-language requirements for both mechanics and repairmen, the continued acceptance of military aircraft
maintenance experience as the basis for airframe and powerplant mechanic certification, and changing the units
of time used in  65.77 to designate experience requirements for mechanics from months to hours.



General Discussion of the Proposal



The proposals developed during phase I of the Part 65 regulatory review and set forth in this NPRM cover a broad range
of issues affecting the certification of aviation maintenance personnel. The proposals included in this NPRM would:
(1) establish a separate part for aviation maintenance personnel; (2) remove gender-specific terms from the current
regulation; (3) change the term ``mechanic'' to ``aviation maintenance technician''; (4) change the term ``repairman''
to ``aviation repair specialist''; (5) establish the equivalency of the aviation maintenance technician and aviation
repair specialist certificates with current certificates; (6) allow facsimiles to be used in the process of replacing
lost or destroyed aviation maintenance technician and aviation repair specialist certificates; (7) require applicants
to demonstrate English-language proficiency by reading and explaining appropriate maintenance publications
and by writing defect and repair statements; (8) discontinue the certification of aviation maintenance personnel
who are employed outside the United States and are not proficient in the English language; (9) require all aviation
maintenance technician applicants to pass a written test that would examine their knowledge of all applicable maintenance
regulations; (10) clarify the requirement that each applicant for an aviation maintenance technician certificate
pass all sections of the written test before applying for oral and practical tests; (11) recognize new computer-based
testing methods; (12) specify all experience requirements in hours instead of months; (13) establish a basic competency
requirement for aviation maintenance technicians; (14) allow aviation maintenance technicians to use equipment-specific
training as an additional means to qualify for the exercise of certificate privileges; (15) permit aviation maintenance
instructors to use instructional time to satisfy currency requirements; (16) establish training requirements
for aviation maintenance technicians who desire to use their certificates for compensation or hire; (17) extend
the duration of an inspection authorization from 1 to 2 years; and (18) expand the renewal options available to the
holder of an inspection authorization.

This preamble addresses the proposed changes through a discussion of the principal issues and in a section-by-section
general analysis of the proposed rule.

Principal Issues


Establishment of a Separate Subpart for Aviation Maintenance Personnel



The FAA proposes to establish a new Part 66 under the title, Certification: Aviation Maintenance Technicians and
Aviation Repair Specialists. This new part would be created by removing Subparts D (Mechanics) and E (Repairmen)
from the current Part 65 and using these existing subparts as the nucleus for the newly created Subparts B (Aviation
Maintenance Technicians) and C (Aviation Repair Specialists) under Part 66. The sections of the current Part 65 Subpart
A (General) that apply only to aviation maintenance personnel would be included in Subpart A of the proposed Part 66.

In addition to regulating the certification requirements for aviation maintenance personnel, Part 65 also currently
regulates the certification of airmen such as aircraft dispatchers, air traffic controllers, and parachute riggers,
whose certification requirements and duties differ markedly from those of aviation maintenance personnel. Currently,
there are more than 145,000 certificated mechanics and repairmen. The number of certificated aviation maintenance
personnel is second only to the number of certificated pilots. Aviation maintenance personnel work in all aspects
of the aviation environment, perform tasks vastly different from those performed by other airmen, and are affected
by training and currency requirements that are substantially more extensive than those affecting other airmen currently
regulated by Part 65.

The aviation maintenance sector is one of the most complex sectors of the aviation community and all aviation maintenance
personnel must possess many technical skills. The addition of this part to the FAR is warranted because of the complexity
of the certification and training requirements affecting aviation maintenance personnel. In addition, the certification
requirements for aviation maintenance personnel are expanding under this proposed rule, and additional certificates
and ratings are proposed for creation under phase II of the regulatory review.



Removal of Gender-Specific Terms



In accordance with the FAA's policy of implementing gender-neutral regulations and maintaining conformity with
other recently revised airman certification regulations that are now gender-neutral, and in view of the increased
role of women in the aviation maintenance profession, the FAA proposes to eliminate all gender-specific references
in current Part 65 and proposed Part 66. These changes are reflected in the proposed amendment; however, specific
changes are not listed in the section-by-section general analysis.

Redesignation of the Term ``Mechanic''



Because of changes in aircraft technology, the amount of specialized training required to perform aviation maintenance
has increased significantly since the introduction of the term ``mechanic.'' The highly complex and technical field
of contemporary aviation maintenance requires substantially more than the manual skills typically associated
with individuals classified as mechanics. The FAA asserts that the term ``aviation maintenance technician'' more
completely describes the type of skills necessary to maintain today's complex aircraft and more accurately reflects
the level of professionalism found in the aviation maintenance industry. Additionally, adoption of the term ``aviation
maintenance technician'' would standardize terminology throughout the aviation industry and make Part 66 consistent
with Part 147 of the FAR (which regulates Aviation Maintenance Technician Schools), aviation maintenance trade
publications, and many ICAO member states. These changes are reflected in the proposed amendment, however, specific
changes have not been listed in the section-by-section general analysis.



Redesignation of the Term ``Repairman''



In view of the specialized nature of aviation maintenance tasks performed by currently certificated repairmen,
the FAA proposes that the term ``aviation repair specialist'' replace the current term ``repairman.'' The FAA contends
that the term ``aviation repair specialist'' more accurately reflects the level of expertise required to maintain
today's highly complex aviation systems. In addition, the use of the term ``aviation repair specialist'' would serve
to increase the level of professionalism among aviation maintenance personnel. Adoption of the term would also be
consistent with the FAA's policy of implementing gender-neutral regulations. These changes are reflected in the
proposed amendment; however, specific changes have not been listed in the section-by-section general analysis.



Equivalency of Ratings



Any valid mechanic or repairman certificate would be equivalent to an aviation maintenance technician or aviation
repair specialist certificate, respectively. After implementation of this regulation, the holder of a current
mechanic or repairman certificate may continue to exercise the privileges of the corresponding aviation maintenance
technician or aviation repair specialist certificate and may exchange a current mechanic or repairman certificate
for an aviation maintenance technician or aviation repair specialist certificate respectively. Phase I of the regulatory
review does not create additional certificates or ratings.



Replacement of Lost or Destroyed Certificates by Facsimile



The proposal would revise current procedures by permitting an airman who has lost a certificate issued under proposed
Part 66 to request a facsimile of the certificate from the FAA as confirmation of the certificate's original issuance.
The proposal would also allow any request to the FAA to be made by facsimile and would permit the FAA to send directly
to the airman a facsimile that the airman may carry as proof of the original certificate's issuance for a period not
to exceed 60 days. Adoption of the proposed change would make the rule consistent with current practices implemented
by the Airman Certification Branch (AVN-460) at the Aviation Standards National Field Office in Oklahoma City.
Current regulations specify the use of telegrams only.

This change reflects advancements in communications technology and would speed access to FAA services by permitting
the use of other means, such as telephone facsimile or computer modem, to obtain a replacement certificate. The use
of these means would speed the replacement of lost certificates to the airman, thereby decreasing the time during
which the airman may not exercise the privileges of a certificate of rating. Similar provisions are under consideration
for adoption in other parts of the FAR.



Demonstration of English-Language Proficiency and Removal of Exception Criteria for Applicants Employed Outside
the United States Who Are Not Proficient in the English Language



The proposal would require an applicant for an aviation maintenance technician certificate or aviation repair specialist
certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English language, as is currently required for applicants
desiring to exercise the privileges of the certificate within the United States. The proposal would require the applicant
to demonstrate this knowledge by reading and explaining appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect
and repair statements. The proposal also would eliminate the issuances of certificates to individuals who cannot
meet this requirement and are employed solely outside the United States by a certificated U.S. repair station, or
a certificated U.S. air carrier.

This proposal recognizes the highly technical nature of aviation maintenance in today's aviation industry. Proficiency
with the general terminology of the English language is not sufficient to ensure the competency of an aviation maintenance
technician or repair specialist. The individual must be able to understand and master the complex and often very specialized
language of airworthiness instructions and other terminology associated with the maintenance of highly sophisticated
aviation equipment. In operations conducted at certificated U.S. air carriers, certificated U.S. commercial operators,
and U.S.-certificated repair stations, the vast majority of technical information is conveyed in the English language.
The FAA has determined that the proposed rule would guarantee a level of competency that would ensure that an applicant
for either certificate is able to use all relevant maintenance publications effectively.

The FAA also proposed that the current exception, which permits the certification of mechanics (aviation maintenance
technicians) who are employed outside the United States and are not proficient in the English language, be deleted.
The current airframe, powerplant, and general written tests for mechanics are all written in the English language.
Applicants taking these tests must be proficient in the English language to complete these examinations successfully;
therefore, the exception is not necessary.

Although repairmen (aviation repair specialists) are not required to take written tests, these individuals also
work in environments that require more than mere proficiency in the English language. Because the FAA does not certify
repairmen working under U.S.-certificated foreign repair stations and because of the need for all certificated
repairmen to understand technical material written in English, the FAA also proposed that all repairmen (aviation
repair specialists) demonstrate proficiency in the English language and that the exception allowing individuals
who are not proficient in the English language to be certificated to work only outside the United States be deleted.

Current holders of a mechanic or repairman certificate, who do not meet the English language requirement and are employed
outside of the United States by a certificated U.S. air carrier or a certificated U.S. repair station, would continue
to exercise the privileges of their certificate without a further showing of competency. Their certificates would
remain endorsed ``Valid only outside of the United States.''

Establishment of a Requirement for Aviation Maintenance Technicians To Pass a Written Test on all Applicable Provisions
of Chapter 14



Current regulations require an applicant for a mechanic (aviation maintenance technician) certificate to pass
a written test that includes the applicable provisions of Parts 43 and 91 of this chapter. Because contemporary maintenance
operations require the applicant to understand certification and maintenance regulations other than those found
solely in Parts 43 and 91, the FAA proposes amending the knowledge requirements for the certificate to require an applicant
to pass a written test on the applicable provisions of the entire chapter.



Clarification of Requirement To Pass all Sections of the Written Test Before Applying for the Oral and Practical Tests



There has been some confusion among applicants for the mechanic (aviation maintenance technician) certificate
who are not enrolled at Part-147-approved aviation maintenance technician schools regarding the language of  65.75(b).
This section requires an individual to pass each section of the written test before applying for the oral and practical
tests prescribed by  65.79. The FAA believes that it is essential that the applicant display knowledge of the
equipment and procedures to be used by the applicant before the oral and practical tests are given. The applicant must
possess adequate knowledge before being permitted to take the oral and practical tests, because it is this knowledge
that enables an applicant to solve practical problems and demonstrate the ability to perform the work of a certificated
aviation maintenance technician. In addition, when taking an oral or practical test, an applicant for a certificate
must handle complex equipment; a lack of knowledge about the use of that equipment could injure the applicant or others.
Therefore, the FAA has clarified the current requirement by proposing amendatory language that would require all
applicants, except students at an approved Part 147 aviation maintenance school, to pass all sections of the written
test before applying for the oral and practical tests.



Recognition of New Written Testing Methods



In the area of written testing, the FAA recognizes recent developments in training and testing technology. Because
the results of some written tests, such as those from recently approved computer-based testing, can be made immediately
available to the applicant, the FAA proposes that a report of the written test be made available, as opposed to sent,
to an applicant who has taken the examination using computer-based testing.



Specification of Experience Requirements in Hours



The FAA proposes that experience requirements for aviation maintenance personnel, currently expressed in months,
be expressed in an equivalent number of hours. A change to the hourly experience requirements would give the FAA and
the aviation industry a simpler method of measuring and verifying work experience. The proposed revision also would
enable aviation maintenance personnel working in part-time positions to better quantify their work experience.
FAA Order 8300.10, Airworthiness Inspector's Handbook, currently permits the practice of measuring part-time
experience requirements in hours. The proposed rule would expand this current practice by measuring both part-time
and full-time experience in hours. Equivalent levels of full time experience are: 6 months/1000 hours; 18 months/3000
hours; 30 months/5000 hours.



Establishment of Basic Competency Requirements



Currently  65.79, Skill requirements, requires an applicant for a mechanic certificate to pass an oral and
practical test covering the applicant's skills in performing practical projects covered by the written test. Because
of the complexity of current aviation maintenance operations, the FAA proposes to establish a broad-based competency
requirement in  66.79 that encompasses more than the skill requirements included in the current regulation.

Current interpretations of the existing regulation tend to emphasize the evaluation of basic skills that often concentrate
solely on tasks involving manual dexterity. Although mastery of these basic skills is invaluable, the FAA asserts
that a more comprehensive level of competency, based on current aviation maintenance practices, is required of aviation
maintenance technicians. The proposed rule would expand the evaluation of aviation maintenance technician applicants
to include a demonstration of competency in technical tasks and aircraft maintenance more appropriate to the current
aviation environment and the certificate and rating sought.



Use of Equipment-Specific Training to Qualify for Certificate Privileges



Through the use of equipment-specific training, the proposal would provide the holder of an aviation maintenance
technician certificate with an additional means to remain qualified to approve and return to service any aircraft,
appliance, or part for which that person is rated and to supervise the maintenance, preventive maintenance, alteration,
and return to service of these aircraft, appliances, and parts.

Under the current regulation, a certificate holder may supervise maintenance operations or approve and return to
service an aircraft, appliance, or part if the certificate holder has: (1) previously performed the work; (2) performed
the work to the satisfaction of the Administrator; or (3) performed the work under the direct supervision of a certificated
mechanic or repairman who has had previous experience with that specific task.

The proposal would allow the aviation maintenance technician to use equipment-specific training to obtain the competency
necessary to supervise these operations or approve an item for return to service without previously having performed
the work that is anticipated. Through the adoption of equipment-specific training to satisfy this experience requirement,
the FAA recognized enhancements in aviation maintenance training that can provide the aviation maintenance technician
with technical knowledge equal to knowledge gained in the work environment. However, in allowing training to replace
actual work experience, the FAA would require a high level of specificity between the training and the actual work
to be preformed or supervised. Therefore, the proposal would require that the training used to satisfy this requirement
be unique to the specific equipment on which the work is to be performed. A course of instruction detailing the maintenance
practices for the same make and model aircraft on which an aviation maintenance technician will perform work, or a
course of instruction detailing the overhaul procedures for a specific part or appliance, for example, would satisfy
the provisions of the proposed rule. Such courses may be provided by any manufacturer, individual, or organization
whose training has been found acceptable to the Administrator.

Training of a more general nature, which may be used to satisfy currency requirements as proposed in  66.83,
may not be sufficiently specific to allow an aviation maintenance technician to perform work on a specific aircraft,
part, or appliance. For example, a course in the FAR applicable to maintenance procedures would not satisfy the provisions
of proposed  66.81 but could be used to satisfy the provisions of proposed  66.83.

The FAA also proposes to clarify the intent of the current regulation by proposing amendatory language that would
allow a certificate holder, who desires to exercise supervisory, return to service, or approval responsibilities,
to demonstrate the ability to perform the work to the satisfaction of the Administrator. The current regulation requires
actual performance of the work.

Use of Instructional Time by Aviation Maintenance Instructors to Satisfy Currency Requirements



Under current  65.83, there are no provisions for allowing individuals involved in aviation maintenance instruction
to use that experience for maintaining the currency required to exercise the privileges of their certificate and
ratings. The FAA recognizes that the experience gained while providing aviation maintenance instruction or directly
supervising other aviation maintenance instructors is commensurate with the experience obtained while directly
performing aviation maintenance. The FAA already recognizes this experience in current  65.91(c)(2). Within
that section the phrase ``actively engaged'' includes instructors who are exercising the privileges of their certificate
and ratings at an aviation maintenance school certificated under Part 147 of this chapter. Therefore, the FAA proposes
to allow the use of instructional time also to satisfy currency requirements.

Under the proposed rule, a certificate holder would qualify to maintain currency by serving as an aviation maintenance
instructor or by directly supervising other aviation maintenance instructors under his or her certificate or rating.
The instruction concerned would have to be directly related to aviation maintenance and acceptable to the Administrator,
so that the time an individual spends providing instruction or directly supervising other instructors is equivalent
to the experience gained while performing aviation maintenance tasks. For example, instructional time provided
at Part 147 aviation maintenance technician schools or under an approved air carrier maintenance training program
would be acceptable and would meet the intent of the proposed rule.

The purpose of currency requirements is to ensure that all aviation maintenance technicians are familiar with current
maintenance practices and the applicable FAR. The aviation maintenance instructor must keep abreast of current
maintenance practices in a wide variety of disciplines to provide the high quality instruction required. Aviation
maintenance instructors perform a critical function in the aviation maintenance education process, and the FAA
believes that the adoption of the proposed rule would recognize this importance.



Establishment of Training Requirements for Certificated Aviation Maintenance Technicians Exercising the Privileges
of their Certificates for Compensation or Hire



Under current Part 65, there are no specific provisions that require the training of certificated mechanics. Current
regulations ensure that certificated aviation maintenance technicians supporting operations under Parts 121,
127, 135, and 145.2(a) are informed fully about procedures, techniques, and new equipment in use through participation
in maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs. In an effort to ensure that all aviation maintenance
technicians are informed of current maintenance practices in the rapidly changing aviation maintenance environment,
the FAA proposes the adoption of refresher training, requalification training, and other training appropriate
to the duties of the aviation maintenance technician, for aviation maintenance technicians who use their certificates
for compensation or hire and do not participate in the maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs
referenced above. This proposal would ensure that all aviation maintenance technicians who exercise the privileges
of their certificates for compensation or hire and have the sole responsibility for ensuring the airworthiness of
the equipment on which they perform maintenance meet training requirements similar to those currently in place for
aviation maintenance technicians supporting operations under Parts 121, 127, 135, and 145.2(a). In addition, this
proposal would also ensure that aviation maintenance technicians who support U.S. certificated repair stations
that do not have maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs receive comparable training.

Under the proposed rule, an aviation maintenance technician who meets the prescribed work experience requirements
and wishes to exercise the privileges of the certificate or rating for compensation or hire would be required to complete
refresher training or other training appropriate to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician.

An aviation maintenance technician refresher course, inspection authorization refresher course, or a series of
such courses that are acceptable to the Administrator and consist of a total of not less than 16 hours of instruction
within a 24-month period could be used to satisfy the refresher training requirement. The completion of an inspection
authorization refresher course by an aviation maintenance technician who does not hold a current inspection authorization
would also constitute completion of the mandatory aviation maintenance technician training requirement. Adoption
of such a provision would increase the range of training options available to the aviation maintenance technician
and would enhance the individual's understanding of the inspection authorization process.

As an alternative to refresher training, an aviation maintenance technician wishing to exercise the privileges
of the certificate and ratings for compensation or hire may complete other training appropriate to the duties of an
aviation maintenance technician. This training may be broad based and would consist of a course or courses of instruction,
acceptable to the Administrator, of not less than 16 hours within a 24-month period. Completion of courses dealing
with general maintenance practices or regulations applicable to maintenance operations, for example, would satisfy
the intent of this proposed rule.

The FAA recognizes that many certificated aviation maintenance technicians, who support Part 91 operations or other
maintenance facilities without maintenance or preventive maintenance training programs in place, receive periodic
maintenance training. For example, these aviation maintenance technicians may receive training through aviation
training centers or manufacturer's courses. The proposed rule would permit this type of maintenance instruction
to be credited toward the hours needed to complete the proposed training requirements, provided the instruction
is acceptable to the Administrator.

The training required under this provision, as set forth in proposed  66.83, encompasses more types of training
than the training that may be used to satisfy the provision of the proposed  66.81. Therefore, compliance with
proposed  66.83 does not automatically authorize the aviation maintenance technician to perform a specific
task. Additionally, equipment-specific training is encompassed within the concept of ``training appropriate
to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician.'' Equipment-specific training used by the aviation maintenance
technician to satisfy the requirements of proposed  66.81 also may be used to satisfy the proposed currency
requirements. For example, an aviation maintenance technician who received maintenance training on a Gulfstream
IV aircraft that enabled the aviation maintenance technician to perform work on that specific aircraft may credit
the hours of instruction received toward the training required in proposed  66.83.

An individual who exercises the privileges of the certificate, but not for compensation or hire, would not need to
complete these training requirements. Many of the individuals who do not exercise their privileges for compensation
or hire perform only limited work on aircraft that they own or on a limited range of aeronautical equipment. In such
cases, knowledge of a broad range of current maintenance technologies is not necessarily required. Although the
FAA encourages these personnel to attend refresher training, the FAA has determined that a mandatory training requirement
for these individuals is not warranted.

The proposal also sets forth a provision that would permit an aviation maintenance technician who has not exercised
the privileges of the certificate within the preceding 24 months to exercise the privileges of the certificate including
for compensation or hire by completing requalification training acceptable to the Administrator. A specific minimum
time for requalification training has not been specified in the proposed regulation in order to provide instructors
and examiners with greater flexibility in assisting non-current aviation maintenance technicians to achieve the
required proficiency.

An additional change to the current rule would enhance the ability of non-current aviation maintenance technicians
to regain the currency required to exercise the privileges of their certificate and ratings. The proposed rule would
allow these individuals to credit the time they work under the supervision of a certificated aviation maintenance
technician toward currency requirements.


The holder also may continue to exercise the privileges of the certificate and associated ratings if the Administrator
finds that the aviation maintenance technician is competent to exercise those privileges. Passing an oral and practical
test with a designed aviation maintenance technician examiner (currently, a designated mechanic examiner (DME))
would satisfy this requirement.

Sections 121.375, 127.137, and 135.433 require that an operator have a training program to ensure that persons performing
maintenance or preventive maintenance functions are informed fully about procedures and techniques and new equipment
in use. Additionally,  145.2(a) requires that repair stations performing maintenance for a Part 121 or 127
operator comply with either Part 121, Subpart L (which includes the requirements of  121.375) or Part 127, Subpart
I (which includes the requirements of  127.137). Compliance with any of these sections meets the intent of the
proposed rule. Individuals exercising the privileges of their certificates under the provisions of these sections,
therefore, need not comply with the training requirements set forth in the proposed rule.

In addition, an aviation maintenance instructor teaching under an aviation maintenance training program acceptable
to the Administrator need not comply with these proposed training requirements. As a result of their position as aviation
maintenance instructors, these individuals continually are exposed to current maintenance practices and often
disseminate information about new practices, techniques, and equipment to the aviation maintenance community.
The intent of the proposed rule would be satisfied because their position requires these individuals to be fully informed
about current maintenance practices.

In recognition of enhancements in training technology, the proposed rule also requires successful completion of
these courses rather than attendance and successful completion. Therefore, the Administrator may find home study
or video courses acceptable for fulfilling the requirements specified in the proposed  66.83. However, any
training should include a substantial review of regulations pertinent to the exercise of the privileges and limitations
of the aviation maintenance technician certificate.

This proposal for continued aviation maintenance training addresses concerns such as those expressed in recent
proposals to require formal training for all aircraft mechanic applicants. In conjunction with the issuance of a
proposed final rule, the FAA will develop policy on the content and conduct of any aviation maintenance technician
refresher course, other training appropriate to the duties of the aviation maintenance technician (including equipment-specific
training), and requalification training.

Extension of Inspection Authorization Duration



Under the proposed rule, the duration of an inspection authorization would be extended from the current 12 months
to 24 months. Extending the duration of the inspection authorization would make the authorization consistent with
FAA practices regarding the issuance of other renewable certificates, such as the flight instructor certificate,
which is renewed every 24 months. A 24-month renewal cycle would relieve the public of a significant regulatory burden
and FAA Flight Standards District Offices of a considerable administrative burden without compromising safety.
Modifying the existing training and currency requirements to coincide with the adoption of a 24-month renewal cycle
would give holders greater flexibility in meeting regulatory requirements.



Expansion of Inspection Authorization Renewal Options



The proposal would permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use a combination of annual inspections, inspections
of major repairs or major alterations, and progressive inspections to satisfy the renewal requirements for the inspection
authorization. Such a provision would give the holder of an inspection authorization much greater flexibility in
meeting renewal requirements. To better facilitate the combination of these inspections for the purpose of certificate
renewal with other inspection periods currently designated in months, the proposal would change the currently specified
90-day periods for inspections to 3-month periods.

The proposed rule would also permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use participation in current inspection
programs recommended by the manufacturer or other inspection programs established by the registered owner or operator
under  91.409(f)(3) or (4) to satisfy renewal requirements. Although an inspection authorization is not required
by an aviation maintenance technician in order to participate in these inspection programs, the FAA asserts that
the experience gained through participation in such inspection programs is commensurate with the experience currently
accepted to obtain the inspection authorization renewal. This proposal would benefit holders of an inspection authorization
who are employed by operators that maintain aircraft under a current inspection program yet also maintain an insufficient
number of aircraft under other annual inspection programs to provide the holder of the inspection authorization
with sufficient renewal options under the current rule. The proposed rule would neither change the privileges of
the inspection authorization nor compromise safety because the types of aircraft normally maintained under a current
inspection program are often more complex than those maintained under an annual inspection program.

Under the current regulation, the holder of an inspection authorization may renew the inspection authorization
by attending and successfully completing a refresher course, acceptable to the Administrator, of not less than 8
hours during the 12-month period preceding the application for renewal. Because the proposal would modify the duration
of the inspection authorization to 24 months, it would require that an inspection authorization refresher course
or series of courses consisting of a total of not less than 16 hours be taken in the 24 months preceding the application
for renewal. The proposed rule would not change the total amount of instruction an applicant is required to complete
in the 24-month period preceding the application for renewal.



Section-by-Section Analysis



Part 65



Under the proposal, the title of Part 65 would be amended to reflect the removal of Subparts D (Mechanics) and E (Repairmen)
from this part. The proposal would amend the title of Part 65 by revising the title of the part and would specifically
list airmen whose certification would continue to be regulated by this part. The title would be changed from ``Certification:
Airmen Other than Flight Crewmembers'' to ``Certification: Air-Traffic Control Tower Operators, Aircraft Dispatchers,
and Parachute Riggers.''



Section 65.1



Section 65.1 currently states that Part 65 is applicable to air traffic control tower operators, aircraft dispatchers,
mechanics, repairmen, and parachute riggers. Under the proposal, certification of mechanics and repairmen (aviation
maintenance technicians and aviation repair specialists under the proposed rule would be regulated by Part 66. The
proposal would revise  65.1 by limiting the applicability of this part to air traffic control tower operators,
aircraft dispatchers, and parachute riggers.



Section 65.3



Section 65.3 prescribes the certification requirements for foreign mechanics. Because the proposal would place
the certification for all mechanics under Part 66, this section would be removed from Part 65 and reserved. An equivalent
section,  66.3, is proposed for inclusion in Part 66.



Section 65.11



Currently,  65.11(d)(2) prohibits a person whose repairman or mechanic certificate is revoked from applying
for either of those kinds of certificates for 1 year after the date of revocation, unless the order of revocation provides
otherwise. Because the proposal would place the certification of all mechanics and repairmen under Part 66, this
paragraph would be removed from Part 65; an equivalent paragraph,  66.11(d), has been proposed for inclusion
in Part 66.



Part 65 Subpart D and Subpart E



The proposal would completely remove Subpart D (Mechanics) and Subpart E (Repairmen) from Part 65 and would establish
Subpart B (Aviation Maintenance Technicians) and Subpart C (Aviation Repair Specialists) under Part 66. The new
subparts would be based upon the subparts originally found in Part 65.

Part 66


Under the proposal, a new Part 66 prescribing the certification requirements solely for aviation maintenance personnel
would be created. Part 66 would include Subpart A (General), Subpart B (Aviation Maintenance Technicians), and Subpart
C (Aviation Repair Specialists). Subpart A (General) would be based on Part 65, Subpart A and modified to address regulatory
concerns applicable to aviation maintenance technicians and aviation repair specialists. The proposal would establish
the new part under the title ``Certification: Aviation Maintenance Technicians and Aviation Repair Specialists.''


Section 66.1


The proposed  66.1 sets forth the applicability of Part 66. This proposed section is based upon  65.1 of
the current FAR. This section would limit the applicability of this new part to aviation maintenance technicians
and aviation repair specialists.


Section 66.3


The proposed  66.3 prescribes the certification requirements for foreign aviation maintenance technicians.
This proposed section is based on  65.3 of the current FAR. There are no substantive differences between the
proposed section and the current  65.3.


Section 66.11


The proposed  66.11 prescribes the application and issuance procedures for a certificate and ratings under
this part. This proposed section is based on  65.11 of the current FAR. There are no substantive differences
between paragraphs (a) through (c) of the proposed section and the current  65.11. Paragraph (d) of the proposed
rule would not change the substantive provisions of  65.11 as it applies to aviation maintenance personnel;
however, it differs from the current  65.11 in that it removes provisions that are only applicable to air traffic
control operators, aircraft dispatchers, and parachute riggers.


Sections 66.12, 66.13


The proposed   66.12 and 66.13 are based on current   65.12 and 65.13. These sections refer
to offenses involving alcohol or drugs and temporary certificates. There are no substantive differences between
these proposed sections for Part 66 and current corresponding sections in Part 65.


Section 66.15


The proposed  66.15 is based upon the current  65.15 and establishes the duration of certificates issued
under this part. The proposed rule corrects an earlier omission by including the aviation repair specialist certificate
(experimental aircraft builder) among those certificates that are effective until surrendered, suspended, or
revoked.


Section 66.16


The proposal would revise current procedures by permitting an airman who has lost a certificate issued under Part
66 to request a facsimile of the certificate from the FAA as confirmation of the certificate's original issuance.
The proposal also would allow any request to the FAA to be made by facsimile and would permit the FAA to send directly
to the airman a facsimile that may be carried by the airman, for a period not to exceed 60 days, as proof of the original
certificate's issuance.


Sections 66.17, 66.18, 66.19, 66.20, 66.21, 66.23


The proposed   66.17, 66.18, 66.19, 66.20, 66.21, and 66.23 are based on current   65.17,
65.18, 65.19, 65.20, 65.21, and 65.23. These sections refer to written test general procedures, cheating or other
unauthorized conduct on written tests, retesting after failure, falsification of documents, changes of address,
and the refusal to submit to a drug test. There are no substantive differences between these proposed sections for
Part 66 and current corresponding sections in Part 65.


Part 66 Subpart B


The structure of Part 66, Subpart B, is based upon the current structure of Part 65, Subpart D. Under the proposed rule,
the title of Part 66, Subpart B, would become ``Aviation Maintenance Technicians.''

Section 66.71




The proposed  66.71 is based upon the current  65.71 and differs from that section solely in the language
of subparagraph (a)(2). The proposal differs from current  65.71, because in addition to requiring an applicant
for an aviation maintenance technician certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English language,
as is currently required, it would require the applicant to demonstrate this knowledge by reading and explaining
appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect and repair statements. The proposal also differs from
the current section in that it would eliminate the issuance of certificates to individuals who cannot meet this requirement
and who are employed solely outside the United States by a U.S. air carrier.





Section 66.73




The proposed  66.73 would establish the ratings issued under this subpart. This proposed section is based on
current  65.73. The proposal would revise current paragraph (b), to establish the equivalency of the current
mechanic certificate and the proposed aviation maintenance technician certificate. The proposal also provides
for the exchange of corresponding certificates and ratings.







Section 66.75





The proposed  66.75 would establish the knowledge requirements for certificates and ratings issued under
this part.


This proposed section is based on current  65.75. The proposed revisions to the current knowledge requirements
encompass the current requirement that the applicant be tested in the applicable provisions of Parts 43 and 91 of this
chapter and also expand the knowledge required of an applicant by requiring the applicant to pass a written test that
includes material on all applicable provisions of this chapter.




To clarify the existing language of  65.75, the proposed revisions would require the applicant to pass all sections
of the written test (as opposed to each section) before applying for the oral and practical tests for the certificate
or rating sought.



Because of the increased use of computer-based testing, the proposal would require a report of the written test to
be made available to the applicant upon completion of the test. The current section requires the FAA to send the applicant
a report.







Section 66.77




The proposed  66.77 would establish the experience requirements for certificates and ratings issued under
this part. This proposed section is based on current  65.77. The proposed revisions to the current experience
requirements would result in experience requirements being specified in hours instead of months. All proposed experience
requirements are approximate equivalents of the current full-time experience requirements.

Section 66.79



The proposed  66.79 would establish the competency requirements for applicants attempting to obtain a certificate
or rating under this part. This proposed section is based on current  65.79. The proposed revisions to the current
section establish a basic competency requirement for an aviation maintenance technician by requiring the applicant
to demonstrate competency in performing tasks appropriate to the rating sought. The proposal would also clarify
the existing regulation to ensure that an applicant passes both an oral and a practical test appropriate to the rating
sought.



Section 66.80



The proposed  66.80 prescribes specific requirements for the testing of certified aviation maintenance technician
school students. This proposed section is based on current  65.80 with no substantive differences.



Section 66.81



The proposed  66.81, based on current  65.81, would define the privileges and limitations of a certificate
holder under this part. The proposed revision to the current privileges and limitations of certificate holders would
clarify and expand the manner in which an aviation maintenance technician may become qualified to supervise the maintenance,
preventive maintenance, or alteration of any aircraft, or approve and return to service any aircraft or appliance,
or part thereof, for which that person is rated. The proposal would provide the holder of an aviation maintenance technician
certificate with additional means to qualify for the exercise of these privileges. In addition to the means specified
in the current  65.81, the holder may exercise the privileges mentioned above if the aviation maintenance technician
has received the equipment-specific training or has performed the work under the direct supervision of a certificated
and appropriately rated aviation maintenance technician or certificated aviation repair specialist who has also
received equipment-specific training.

Additionally, the proposal would clarify  65.81 by permitting the holder of an aviation maintenance technician
certificate to exercise the privileges of the certificate and ratings by demonstrating the ability to perform the
work to the satisfaction of the Administrator. The current regulation requires actual performance of the work.

The proposed regulation would require that the work recognized under proposed  66.81 be performed after the
individual has been certificated as an aviation maintenance technician. Work performed while an individual is in
training for certification as an aviation maintenance technician may not necessarily be of the same quality required
for the return to service of an article, and therefore would not be credited toward satisfying the requirements specified
in  66.81.

The proposal also would require that a certificated aviation maintenance technician understand all current maintenance
instructions (as opposed to maintenance manuals) for the specific operation concerned in order to exercise the privileges
of the certificate and rating.



Section 66.83



The proposed  66.83 would prescribe the specific currency requirements for aviation maintenance technicians.
This proposed section is based on current  65.83, Recent experience requirements. The proposal would provide
the holder of an aviation maintenance technician certificate with additional means to maintain the currency required
to exercise the privileges of the certificate and ratings. In addition to the means currently specified in  65.83(a),
the proposal would allow the aviation maintenance technician to maintain the currency required to exercise the privileges
of the certificate, if the person served as an aviation maintenance instructor under an aviation maintenance training
program acceptable to the Administrator, directly supervised other aviation maintenance instructors, who are
serving under an aviation maintenance training program acceptable to the Administrator, or served under the supervision
of a certificated aviation maintenance technician. The proposal also would allow the use of any combination of the
proposed and current methods to maintain currency.

The proposal would create a new subparagraph that would require the successful completion of refresher training
or training appropriate to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician if the individual desires to exercise
the privileges of the certificate or ratings for compensation or hire. The refresher training may consist of an aviation
maintenance technician refresher course, an inspection authorization course, or a series of courses, acceptable
to the Administrator, of not less than 16 hours of instruction. Training appropriate to the work to be performed must
also be acceptable to the Administrator and consist of not less than 16 hours of instruction.

The proposal would not require all aviation maintenance technicians to complete the new training requirements.
An aviation maintenance technician, who within the preceding 24 months exercised the privileges of the certificate
and ratings for a certificate holder authorized to operate under the provisions of Parts 121, 127, 135, or for a U.S.-certificated
repair station that performed work in accordance with  145.2(a) or conducted a maintenance and preventive
maintenance training program, would not be subject to the proposed training requirements. Additionally, aviation
maintenance instructors teaching under an aviation maintenance training program that is acceptable to the Administrator
need not complete the proposed training requirements.

The proposal sets forth an additional provision that would permit the aviation maintenance technician to exercise
the privileges of the certificate for compensation or hire if the certificate holder successfully completes a requalification
course acceptable to the Administrator.

<TEXT>
 

The proposed revision to the current regulation would change the 6-month currency requirement to be specified in
hours instead of months. The 1,000 hours of experience specified in the proposal approximately equal the current
6-month full-time experience requirement. 



Sections 66.85, 66.87, 66.89, 66.91 


The proposed   66.85, 66.87, 66.89, and 66.91 are based on current   65.85, 65.87, 65.89,
and 65.91, respectively. These sections refer to the additional privileges of the airframe rating, the powerplant
rating, the display of certificates, and the inspection authorization, respectively. There are no substantive
difference between these proposed sections for Part 66 and current corresponding sections in Part 65. 



Section 66.92 


The proposed  66.92 prescribes the duration of an inspection authorization. This proposed section is based
on  65.92 of the current FAR. There is one substantive difference between the proposed section and the current
 65.92. Under the proposal, the expiration date of the inspection authorization would be extended to March
31 of the second year after its issuance. Under the current regulation, the inspection authorization expires on March
31 of each year. 



Section 66.93 


The proposed  66.93 prescribed the renewal procedures for an inspection authorization and is based on current
 65.93. The proposed section would extend the inspection authorization renewal requirement to every 2 years
so that it would corresponds to the extension of the inspection authorization as proposed in  66.92 above. 

The proposal would permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use a combination of annual inspections, inspections
of major repairs on major alterations, and progressive inspections to satisfy the renewal requirements for the inspection
authorization. Participation in current inspection programs recommended by the manufacturer of other inspection
programs established by the registered owner or operator under  91.409(f)(3) or (4) now also may be used to satisfy
renewal requirements. To better facilitate the combination of these inspections, the proposal would change the
currently specified 90-day period to a 3-month period. 

Under the current regulation, the holder of an inspection authorization may renew the authorization by attending
and successfully completing a refresher course of not less than 8 hours, acceptable to the Administrator, during
the 12-month period preceding the application for renewal. Because the proposal would change the duration of the
inspection authorization to 24 months, the proposal would require that an inspection authorization refresher course
or series of course consisting of a total of not less than 16 hours be taken in the 24 months preceding the application
for renewal. The proposed rule does not change the total amount of instruction the applicant must complete in the 24-month
preceding the application for renewal. The proposed rule also differs from the current regulation in that it only
requires successful completion (as opposed to attendance and successful completion) of an inspection authorization
refresher course. The proposal recognizes recent developments in instructional techniques and permits instruction
methods, acceptable to the Administrator, that may differ from the standard classroom or lecture format. 



Section 66.95 


The proposed  66.95 prescribes the privileges and limitations of an inspection authorization and is based
on current  65.95 with no substantive differences. 



Part 66 Subpart C 



The structure of part 66, Subpart C, is based upon the current structure of Part 65, Subpart D. Under the proposed rule,
the title of Part 66, Subpart C, would become ``Aviation Repair Specialists'' 



Section 66.101 


The proposed  66.101 would prescribe the general eligibility requirements for the aviation repair specialist
certificate. This proposed section is based on current  65.101. The proposal would specify the current 18-month
experience requirement in hours instead of months. The 3,000 hours of experience specified in the proposal approximately
equal the current full-time 18-month experience requirement.

<TEXT>
 

The proposal differs from the current  65.101 in the language of paragraph (a)(6). The proposal would not only
require an applicant for an aviation repair specialist certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English
language, as is currently required, but also would require the applicant to demonstrate this knowledge by reading
and explaining appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect and repair statements. The proposal
also differs from the current section in that it would eliminate the issuance of certificates to individuals who cannot
meet this requirement and who are employed solely outside the United States by a certificated U.S. repair station,
a certificated U.S. commercial operator, or a certificated U.S. air carrier. The language in this portion of the proposed
rule corresponds with the language proposed in  66.71(a)(2), which similarly amends the eligibility requirements
for the aviation maintenance technician certificate.

The proposal adds to this section paragraph (c), which establishes the equivalency of the current repairman certificate
and the proposed aviation repair specialist certificate. The proposal also provides for the exchange of corresponding
certificates and ratings.



Section 66.103, 66.104, 66.105



The proposed   66.103, 66.104, and 66.105 are based on current   65.103, 65.104, and 66.105,
respectively. These sections refer to aviation repair specialist certificate privileges and limitations, the
experimental aircraft builder privileges and limitations, and the display of certificates, respectively. There
are no substantive differences between these proposed sections for Part 66 and current corresponding sections in
Part 65.



Paperwork Reduction Act



The information collection requirements in the proposed amendment to Part 65 and the newly established Part 66 have
previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under provisions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1990 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2120-0022.



Regulatory Evaluation Summary



Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations and maintain
current regulations only if they are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by a
``compelling public need.'' The order also requires that agencies assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and select the alternative that maximizes the net benefits and imposes the least burden on society.

Additionally, the order requires agencies to submit a list of all rules, except those specifically exempted by the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) because they respond to emergency situations or other narrowly
defined exigencies, to determine whether any rule is a ``significant regulatory action.''

``Significant regulatory action'' means an action that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) have an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities;
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order. A ``significant regulatory action'' is submitted for centralized regulatory
review by OIRA. OIRA and the FAA have determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action.''

This section contains the benefits and costs analyzed in the preliminary regulatory evaluation. In addition, it
includes an initial regulatory flexibility determination required by the 1980 Regulatory Flexibility Act and an
international trade impact assessment. The complete regulatory evaluation, which contains more detailed economic
information that this summary provides, is available in the docket.

This proposed rule change would revise the regulations that prescribe the certification and training requirements
for mechanics and repairmen. The proposal would enhance the professionalism of the aviation maintenance workforce
by expanding the means for aviation maintenance personnel to satisfy training, experience, and currency requirements.
Employers would also benefit from the increased supply of potential employees who are expected to maintain their
currency because of the wider range of options for achieving this objective that would be permitted under the proposal.
Another benefit for employers is expected to be an increase in the quality of new hires, thereby lessening the need
for initial training to assure that these employees have basic skills and knowledge. Recurrent training is also expected
to assist aviation maintenance personnel in staying abreast of the rapid changes in technology that are expected
to occur. The expected magnitude of these benefits cannot be quantified with any certainty, however, because of their
intangible nature.

Only one of the provisions would impose significant costs on the industry. This provision would require mechanics
who use their certificates for compensation or hire to receive refresher or requalification training. At present,
certified mechanics working under Parts 121, 127, and 135 and  145.2(a) must be fully informed about procedures,
techniques, and new equipment in use through participation in maintenance and preventive maintenance training
programs. These mechanics are, therefore, already in compliance with the proposed rule. This proposed requirement
for recurrent training would primarily affect those mechanics who work on general aviation aircraft rather than
aircraft used by the air carriers. The FAA estimates that this proposed rule would affect from 14,000 to 23,000 mechanics
of a total workforce of about 145,000.

Taking an Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) refresher courts, an inspection authorization refresher course,
or a series of such courses that are acceptable to the Administrator, would satisfy the requirements of this proposed
rule. However, the course or courses taken within a 2-year time period must consist of a total of not less than 16 hours
of instruction. This training may be broad based or narrowly focused but must be acceptable to the Administrator.
For example, courses dealing with general maintenance practices of regulations applicable to maintenance operations
as well as equipment-specific training would be acceptable. Some home study or video courses may also be acceptable
for fulfilling this requirement.

The FAA estimates that the total expected cost of recurrent training over a 10-year period would range between $37.28
million and $66.53 million on an undiscounted basis and between $25.94 million and $46.48 million on a discounted
basis. The midpoints of these ranges are $51.91 million (undiscounted) and $36.21 million (discounted).

The bulk of the expected benefits are expected to accrue from productivity gains. Productivity is expected to increase
because recurrent training in troubleshooting techniques or general maintenance practices should reduce the amount
of time required to diagnose problems and lower the incidence of unnecessary repairs, which inflate repair costs.
The lack of information regarding the prevalence of inefficient or ineffective repairs makes it difficult to project
the potential magnitude of the benefits expected to result from this factor. The adoption of the conservative assumption
that productivity would increase by only .5 percent per year, however, would result in an annualized benefit range
(undiscounted) of $4.17 million to $6.39 million, the midpoint of which ($5.28 million) would exceed the expected
magnitude of undiscounted annual costs, making the rule change cost beneficial.

Administrative cost savings are expected to add to the benefits. The most substantial component of these savings
should result from reducing the current annual requirement for IA renewal to a biennial one. The FAA estimates that
these cost savings for the FAA would amount to $.71 million on a discounted basis over a 10-year period. A provision
that would allow mechanics to substitute a requalification course for the requirement to work at least 6 months over
the previous 2 years in order to maintain one's currency would benefit employers by not only increasing the pool of
available qualified mechanics, but also by saving them the administrative costs involved in checking an applicant's
qualifications for the job. These benefits could not be quantified.



Regulatory Flexibility Determination



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congres to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules which may
have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities include businesses,
nonprofit organizations, and government jurisdictions.

The proposed regulation will affect individuals only and is, therefore, not expected to have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small businesses.



International Trade Impact



The proposed rule would have a negligible impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas or
on foreign firms doing business in the United States. The proposed rule primarily affects individuals, not businesses
involved in the sale of aviation products or services.



Federalism Implications



The regulation proposed herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Conclusion



For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a significant
regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, would
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant under DOT Order 2100.5,
Policies and Procedures for Simplification, Analysis, and Review of Regulations. A draft regulatory evaluation
of the proposal, including an initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Analysis,
has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

 Securities and Exchange Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed Rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission today is proposing amendments to its rules and forms regarding the filing of ownership reports by officers,
directors, and principal security holders, and the exemption of certain transactions by those persons from the short-swing
profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') and related provisions
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'') and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
The proposed rules are intended to streamline the Section 16 regulatory scheme, particularly with respect to employee
benefit plans; broaden exemptions from short-swing profit recovery where consistent with the statutory purposes;
and codify several staff interpretive positions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission is proposing amendments to Rules 16a-1, 16a-2, 16a-3, 16a-4, 16a-6,
16a-8, 16a-9, 16b-3, and 16b-5

1

 promulgated under Section 16

2

 of the Exchange Act.

3

 In addition, the Commission is proposing revisions to Item 405 of Regulation S-K

4

 and Regulation S-B,

5

 as well as to Forms 3, 4, and 5.

6

 












I. Executive Summary and Background 




In February 1991, in response to developments in the trading of derivative securities, the growth of complex and diverse
employee benefit plans, and substantial filing delinquencies, the Commission adopted extensive changes to the
beneficial ownership and short-swing profit recovery rules and forms applicable to insiders

7

 pursuant to Section 16.

8

 After three years of experience, unanticipated practical difficulties still arise in applying the new Section 16
rules, particularly with respect to thrift and similar employee benefit plans.

9

 The rule changes proposed today address these practical problems and further streamline the rules, to the extent
consistent with the purposes of Section 16. 







A. Employee Benefit Plan Transactions 





The focus of the proposed rules is the treatment of employee benefit plan transactions. In particular, the proposals
would: 


 
Exempt from short-swing profit recovery all purchase transactions in thrift and other broad-based, tax-qualified
plans, other than those involving transfers to and from an employer securities fund; 


 
Exempt from short-swing profit recovery transfers to and from employer securities funds in thrift and other plans
that are effected either during a quarterly window period or pursuant to a diversification election under the Internal
Revenue Code; 


 
Expand exemptions for plan distributions in connection with retirement or specified transactions authorized by
the Internal Revenue Code; 


 
Provide that exempt dispositions within six months of an exempt grant would not destroy the exemption for the grant;



 
Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' cash-only instruments issued as compensation by an employer
to an employee; 


 
Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' rights that include non-market price based conditions;



 
Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' rights to withhold (or to deliver securities already owned)
to satisfy tax or exercise price obligations, and exempt cash settlement of such rights where granted pursuant to
exempt employee benefit plans; 


 Eliminate the transferability restrictions applicable to derivative securities issued under an employee
benefit plan. 



B. Reporting 





The proposal also would simplify and clarify the reporting requirements by: 


 
Permitting joint and group reporting where more than one person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities;



 
Providing that Section 16 applies to a trust only if the trust beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered
equity securities; 


 
Eliminating officers' and directors' post-termination reporting obligations with respect to exempt transactions
and other transactions that are not matchable with a pre-termination transaction; 


 
Requiring a discrete caption for the disclosure about delinquent Section 16(a) reports required by Item 405 of Regulations
S-K and S-B. 



The Release also solicits comment on a variety of approaches to simplify the reporting of exempt transactions, including
elimination of the total holdings column in Forms 4 and 5, proposals to replace Form 5 with alternative reporting schemes
(including a Form 10-K summary of insider transactions), and elimination of the requirement to report exempt
employee benefit plan transactions. 



C. Other Issues 





Finally, the proposal would codify certain staff interpretive positions, and would establish new categories of
transactions exempt from short-swing recovery by:

Exempting the disposition of securities pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, whether or not the securities
are held by a Rule 16b-3 employee benefit plan; 


 
Revising the exemption for stock splits and stock dividends to include pro rata stock dividends in which securities
of a different issuer are distributed. 




II. Employee Benefit Plans



 
A. Expanded Exemptions for Broad-Based Plan Transactions and Intra-Plan Transactions 





The principal objection raised to the amended Section 16 rules has been that the treatment of thrift, stock purchase
and other broad-based, tax-qualified plans is unduly cumbersome, presents significant record-keeping problems,
and discourages insiders from participation in plan funds holding employer securities. These plans are subject
to significant restrictions under both the Internal Revenue Code

10

 and the Employee Income Retirement Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''),

11

 which establish an objective framework for the treatment of compensatory transactions and impose extensive administrative
requirements, thereby making plan transactions less vulnerable to the abuses that the short-swing recovery provision
of Section 16(b) was designed to prevent. Accordingly, the proposed rules would streamline the conditions necessary
to exempt transactions in such plans from short-swing profit recovery. Comment is solicited not only on the proposals
set forth, but also on whether there is any other aspect of the treatment of employee benefit plans that should be modified,
either in Rule 16b-3 or any other rule relating to employee transactions. 





As discussed below, the revised rule would exempt, without conditions as to timing, any purchase transaction arising
under a broad-based nondiscriminatory tax-qualified plan, other than an intra-plan transfer to or from an employer
securities fund.

12

 The proposed exemption would have a broader scope than the current rule, since it would be available not only to participant-directed
contributory plans, but also would apply specifically to related ``excess benefit'' or ``mirror'' plans and noncontributory
plans such as many employee stock ownership plans (``ESOPs'').

13

 The timing restrictions governing the exemption for transfers to or from an employer stock fund in any thrift, stock
purchase or similar plan, whether or not broad-based, nondiscriminatory and tax-qualified, would be more flexible.







1. Purchases Under Employee Benefit Plans 





In adopting the current exemption for transactions in a thrift, stock purchase, or similar ongoing securities acquisition
plan,

14

 the Commission reasoned that ``wide participation and equal treatment of all participating employees limits insiders'
opportunities to engage in short-swing speculation.''

15

 This reasoning may support a broader exemption. 





Under the proposal,

16

 all purchase transactions in a thrift, stock purchase or similar securities acquisition plan would be exempt if the
plan provides for broad-based employee participation, does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees,
and is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code.

17

 In light of the requirement for broad-based participation, the proposed rule would exempt one-time acquisitions,
as well as ongoing acquisitions (such as regular purchases by payroll deduction pursuant to a thrift plan).

18

 The exemption would apply whether the transaction results from an employer or an employee contribution. 







The proposal would eliminate the exemptive requirement that insider participants who withdraw from a fund holding
equity securities of the employer (``employer securities fund'')

19

 either cease further employer securities fund purchases for six months or hold the securities distributed for six
months.

20

 Similarly, insider participants who stop participating in an employer securities fund no longer would be required
to refrain from further participation for six months.

21

 The six-month holding period for securities offered without a fixed price under a stock purchase plan or similar plan
also would be eliminated.

22

 The tax law restrictions applicable to broad-based, tax-qualified plans, such as plan contribution limits, plan
benefit limits and nondiscrimination rules,

23

 should be sufficient to deter insiders from using such plans as vehicles for short-term speculation. 









Finally, the proposed rule would provide an explicit exemption for purchase transactions pursuant to an ``excess
benefit'' or ``mirror'' plan,

24

 defined as a plan, operated in conjunction with a tax-qualified plan, that provides only the benefits or contributions
that would be provided under a tax-qualified plan but for the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.

25

 Although such plans technically are outside the scope of the ERISA regulatory scheme, they are operated in a manner
that replicates plans that are so regulated, and accordingly are unlikely to be vehicles for speculative abuse.

Commenters are requested to address whether it is necessary to limit the proposed purchase exemption to plans that
are qualified pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. Are the conditions of the proposed rule that a plan be broad-based
and non-discriminatory sufficient safeguards? Does satisfaction of the minimum participation, minimum funding,
non-discrimination and vesting standards specifically imposed by the Internal Revenue Code provide additional
assurance that transactions pursuant to a plan will not be subject to abuse? Is the proposed exemption for excess benefit
plan transactions consistent with the theory that wide participation and equal treatment of all participating employees
limits insiders' opportunities to engage in short-swing speculation? 



2. Intra-Plan Transfers 


The proposed rule would simplify and shorten the timing restriction that conditions the exemption for transfers
of funds in an employee plan to or from an employer securities fund (``fund-switching transaction''). As proposed,
any fund-switching transaction effected pursuant to an election made during any quarterly ``window period'' would
be exempt.

26

 Moreover, the exemption no longer would be limited to transfers at least six months apart. The requirement that the
election occur in the ``window period'' following the release of quarterly and annual financial data should provide
an adequate safeguard.

27

 As under the current rules, the exemption would be available whether or not the plan is broad-based, tax-qualified
and nondiscriminatory.

28

 Finally, because of changes to the basic exemption for plan purchases discussed above, transferring assets out of
an employer securities fund would no longer trigger the requirement that the insider cease plan purchases for six
months.

29

 







Comment is requested as to whether the six month timing restriction between transfers should be retained, and, if
so, whether it should be limited to opposite way transactions, such as a transfer into an employer securities fund
followed by a transfer out of an employer securities fund. In addition, commenters should address whether requiring
that transactions be limited to every other window period, even if separated by a few days less than six months_rather
than requiring the transactions themselves to be six months apart_would alleviate difficulties in administering
the requirement while preventing opportunities for speculative abuse. Comment also is requested whether it would
be consistent with the statutory purpose to exempt fund-switching transactions without any timing restrictions.
In addressing these issues, commenters are asked to consider the manner in which the rule, as proposed, would function
in tandem with concurrently applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA regarding transfers.

30

 




In addition, the proposed rule would exempt any fund-switching transaction that results from a diversification
election satisfying the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, without regard to the ``window period'' timing
restriction.

31

 This would maintain the utility of the 90-day period following the close of the plan year specifically provided for
such transactions by the Internal Revenue Code

32

 in order to facilitate proper planning for retirement. Distributions to participants pursuant to such diversification
elections also are proposed to be exempted, as discussed below.

33

 Comment is requested as to whether such fund-switching transactions also should be subject to the ``window period''
requirement or any further timing restriction other than that imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. 







B. Participant-Directed Transactions_Six Month Advance Election 


The rule currently exempts participant-directed transactions made at least six months in advance of the effective
date of the transaction. This exemption

34

 would be clarified by codifying the staff's interpretation that a subsequent election that does not take effect for
six months does not destroy the exemption.

35

 





C. Compensatory Cash-Only Instruments 


Under the proposed rules, the derivative security definition would be modified to provide a more expansive exclusion
for compensatory instruments that can be redeemed or exercised solely for cash (``cash-only instruments''),

36

 such as phantom stock. The proposed exclusion would apply to all cash-only instruments issued in the context of an
employer-employee compensation arrangement,

37

 including compensation arrangements between a company and its non-employee directors.

38

 Historically the purpose of such plans has been to provide performance-based cash compensation to employees, using
stock price as a measure of company performance, rather than to provide employees with an equity interest in the employer.







Commentators have cited a number of problems with using these types of performance-based plans arising from the 1991
rule changes. For example, change-in-control provisions and hardship withdrawal provisions could render the current
exclusion unavailable because the rights would not be redeemable only on a fixed date or dates at least six months following
the award. Given the difficulties that have arisen, and recognizing the historic role of stock return as a measure
for long-term cash-based incentive plans, the proposals would restore these plans to a status similar to that which
existed pre-1991.

39

 




Comment is requested on the necessity or appropriateness of the proposed exclusion for compensatory cash-only instruments.
Is there any basis for according disparate treatment, for reporting and/or short-swing profit purposes, to equity-based
securities depending on whether they are settled exclusively in cash or stock (or in either stock or cash), where both
types of derivative securities provide identical opportunities for profit predicated on the underlying stock price
movement? Commenters should focus in particular on the need for retention of one or both of the current, alternative
conditions to the availability of the exclusion (compliance with specified requirements of Rule 16b-3; fixed-date
redemption or exercise).

40

 Alternatively, should the current exclusion for cash-only instruments be retained, with some relief provided for
hardship withdrawals or other specified exceptions? What impact, if any, would the proposed exclusion have on executive
and director stock-ownership programs that seek to align shareholder and managerial interests through awards of
issuer stock or derivative securities payable in stock?

41

D. Value Derived from Market Price of an Equity Security 



Numerous interpretive questions, particularly in the employee benefit area, have been raised concerning the treatment
of performance units and similar instruments as derivative securities. To provide clarification, the proposed
rules would revise the definition of derivative security to codify the staff interpretive view that an instrument
is not within the scope of Section 16 if it includes a material non-market price based condition (such as return on equity)
to exercise or settlement.

42

 As proposed, rights under which benefits are subject to a material condition (other than the passage of time or continued
employment) not tied to the market price of an equity security of the issuer would be excluded from the definition of
derivative security for purposes of Section 16.

43

 Commenters are requested to address whether the proposed rule sets forth an appropriate standard for exclusion,
and whether the language of the proposed rule articulates the standard in a workable manner. 





E. Surrender and Withholding Rights in Connection With Exercise or Tax Withholding 


Employee benefit plans commonly provide participants with the right to have securities withheld, or to deliver securities
already owned, either in payment of the exercise price of an option or to satisfy the tax withholding consequences
of an option exercise or the vesting of restricted securities. While a tax withholding right currently is treated
as a derivative security separate from the equity or derivative security to which it relates,

44

 it appears that this right, as well as the right to have securities withheld in satisfaction of an exercise price, properly
may be viewed as an integral feature of the related security.

45

 Accordingly, a newly proposed rule would exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' these withholding
rights, as well as rights to surrender previously owned securities in satisfaction of either a tax obligation or an
exercise price.

46

 






Today, when withholding rights are exercised or securities delivered, the exemptive treatment of the exercise transactions
differs, depending on whether securities are withheld by or tendered to the employer. The delivery of previously
owned shares with respect to shares of the same class is exempt without further conditions except for compliance with
the general plan requirements of Rule 16b-3.

47

 In contrast, the withholding of an equity security is exempt only when additional conditions applicable to stock
appreciation rights_information about the issuer, plan administration requirements, window period restrictions
and a six-month holding period_are met.

48

 





Consistent with the view that each such right functions as an integral feature of the security to which it relates,
the proposal would make the exemption for surrender transactions available to withholding transactions as well.

49

 




Comment is requested as to whether this approach, if adopted, also should be applied to withholding and surrender
transactions that occur in the employer-employee context but outside Rule 16b-3 plans. If so, commenters should
describe the situations in which such an exemption would be useful. 


F. Stock Appreciation Rights 


In addition to deletion of the clause that deems the cash settlement of a tax withholding right to be a stock appreciation
right,

50

 the rule would be amended so that it would not preclude insiders of newly public companies from relying on the exemption
for the cash settlement of stock appreciation rights.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940817-1-00061 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940817-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The current rule requires the issuer of the stock appreciation right to have been subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act for at least a year prior to the transaction, and to have filed all reports and statements
thereby required. Under the proposal, a one-year reporting history no longer would be required. Instead, the issuer
simply would have to have filed all required reports and statements for a year prior to the transaction, or such shorter
time as the issuer had been subject to Section 13(a). 



G. Grant and Award Transactions 



1. Disinterested Administration 



Two amendments are proposed to the exemption of grant and award transactions based on disinterested administration
of the employee benefit plan.

51

 First, the provision that permits a director to remain disinterested although he or she elects to receive in securities
``an annual retainer fee'' would be changed to permit receipt of ``a director's fee,'' thus broadening the term to
clarify that a meeting fee or other director's fee would be included.

52

 Second, the requirement that the securities elected to be received constitute an ``equivalent amount'' to the cash
would be deleted.

53

 The current requirement could impair companies' ability to provide directors with an adequate incentive to elect
the receipt of compensation in securities. Comment is requested, however, as to whether some limitation should remain
in order to assure that the director's receipt of stock is adequately linked to the fee, rather than a separate stock
grant. 







2. Formula Plans 



To assure that objective criteria govern the making of awards under formula plans, the rule currently requires that
the plan itself restrict the frequency with which the terms of the formula may be amended to not more than once every
six months, with limited exceptions.

54

 Under the proposal, no written restriction would need to be placed in the plan. Instead, the rule would require that
the plan not be amended periodically and in no event more often than every six months, with the same exceptions as currently
permitted.

55

 In addition, a reference to the automatic nature of a formula plan would be added to clarify that the rule does not permit
discretionary awards.

56

 







3. Six Month Holding Period 



Under the proposal, the six-month holding period for securities obtained in a grant and award transaction would not
apply to securities disposed of in a transaction that is exempted by rule from Section 16(b), such as a bona fide gift.

57

 In addition, it is proposed that the six-month holding period for dividend equivalent rights (``DERs'') and shares
purchased pursuant to the reinvestment of dividends should be deemed to commence on the date of acquisition of the
shares on which the DERs or dividends are paid.

58

 If adopted, should this treatment apply only to dividends and DERs paid at a rate that does not exceed dividends paid
on the issuer's common stock? Moreover, should this treatment be limited to dividends paid on a broadly held class
of securities, so that neither the timing nor the amount of dividend paid would be subject to manipulation by insiders?







H. Exemptions for Distributions 



Currently, distributions to plan participants of securities acquired in an exempt manner under Rule 16b-3
are also exempt.

59

 As proposed, this exemption would be broadened so it would apply to all distributions of plan securities, whether
those securities were acquired pursuant to Rule 16b-3, an exemption under the former rules, or in a nonexempt
manner.

60

 Such an exemption appears appropriate where these distributions merely change the form of the participant's beneficial
ownership, not its extent. Of course, if the participant then sells the securities, the sale would be subject to Section
16. 






When a plan distributes the cash value of securities in participants' accounts, rather than the securities themselves,
such a distribution would be viewed as a sale. As proposed, the rule would expand the categories of exempt cash distributions
to plan participants. 

First, distributions of securities and cash, or the deferral of such distributions, incident to death, retirement,
disability or termination of employment, would be exempt.

61

 Such distributions and deferrals currently are exempt if effected by means of a participant-directed election.

62

 The proposed rule would codify the staff's interpretation that the exemption is available even when the transaction
is not made pursuant to a participant's election.

63

 







This new exemption also would apply to distributions of securities and cash pursuant to ESOP diversification elections
permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.

64

 In addition, the proposed rule

65

 would provide that any involuntary distribution of securities or cash (including cash in lieu of fractional shares)
for the purpose of satisfying the limitations on employee elective contributions and employer matching contributions
imposed by the Internal Revenue Code is exempt.

66

 Comment is requested as to whether distributions of securities or cash mandated by the Internal Revenue Code

67

 to begin following the participant's attainment of age 701/2 years, whether or not the participant has retired or
otherwise terminated employment, also should be exempted. 








I. Maximum Number of Shares Requirement 



In order for a plan transaction to be exempt, the current rule requires that the plan set forth in writing the basis for
determining insider eligibility to participate, and either the price at which securities may be offered and the amount
of securities to be awarded or the method by which such price and amount are to be determined. Under the proposal,

68

 application of this exemptive condition would be restricted to plans subject to the shareholder approval requirement,
as was the case under former Rule 16b-3. 





Additionally, it appears that the manner in which shares are counted in any Rule 16b-3 plan appropriately may
be specified in the plan, or, to the extent not so specified, left to the discretion of plan administrators. Accordingly,
effective as of the date of publication of this release, the staff no longer will answer interpretive requests regarding
share counting, and the interpretive letters addressing this subject

69

 no longer will be required to be followed. Of course, the maximum number of shares issuable under a plan will be subject
to disclosure in the course of obtaining shareholder approval for the plan.

J. Transferability Restriction 



Currently, the availability of exemptions is conditioned on a written specification, in the plan or other written
agreement, that a derivative security awarded under the plan may not be transferred by the participant other than
by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.

70

 The restriction on transferability initially was derived from the Internal Revenue Code as a reflection of prior
business practice and was designed to limit opportunities for the speculative abuse of options. 





However, questions have been raised about whether this restriction needs to be retained, given the presence of other
safeguards in Rule 16b-3 and given the fact that the current Section 16 regulatory framework generally recognizes
economic parity between derivative securities and their underlying equity securities. Accordingly, the proposed
amendments to Rule 16b-3 would delete the transferability restriction.

71

 Commenters are asked to address whether there is any continuing need for this restriction, either in whole or in part,
and should address the extent to which nontransferability may act as a safeguard, both in Rule 16b-3 and in the
context of compensatory cash-only instruments as discussed above. 





Assuming the restriction is retained but modified, would it be appropriate to recast it as a transactional requirement,
so that only derivative securities for which the exemption is claimed would need to satisfy this requirement?

72

 Comment also is solicited on whether, if the restriction is retained, additional kinds of transfers should be permitted,
such as transfers to family members of insiders, family partnerships, charitable institutions, and trusts whose
beneficiaries are insiders and their families, or transfers by a non-employee director to a third party entity (such
as the director's law firm) without consideration pursuant to an agreement that provides that any compensation received
for the director's services is received for the benefit of that entity. Comment also is solicited on whether the rule
should permit only transfers that are exempt from short-swing profit recovery, such as bona fide gifts. 





If transfers to family members and family entities are permitted, should these be limited to transfers for estate
planning purposes? Should such transfers be limited to persons or entities composed of persons who are members of
the insider's immediate family sharing the same household, such that the insider will retain an indirect pecuniary
interest in the derivative securities following the transfer,

73

 and any subsequent disposition by the transferee would be attributed to the insider? Finally, comment is solicited
on the combined effect of liberalizing or eliminating transferability restrictions and the proposal, discussed
above, to provide that securities obtained in an exempt grant may be disposed of within six months if the disposition
is a gift or otherwise exempt from short-swing profit recovery. Should the rules provide that the six-month holding
period would continue to run in the hands of the transferee? 




III. Revisions to Reporting System 


A. Reporting of Exempt Transactions 


The Commission is reconsidering its approach to the reporting of transactions pursuant to the Section 16 regulatory
scheme. Under the current rules, transactions exempt from short-swing profit recovery (other than exempt exercises
and conversions of derivative securities) must be reported annually.

74

 Reporting of exempt transactions has been required to provide interested parties with the opportunity to evaluate
insiders' claims to exemptions; facilitate reconciliation of insiders' holdings at the end of the fiscal year; and
provide indications of insiders' views of their corporations' prospects, although annual reporting generally
is permitted since these transactions are viewed as having less potential than non-exempt transactions to reflect
insiders' investment assessments of their corporations. 




The Commission has received various suggestions that would further streamline Section 16(a) reporting. These proposals
seek to simplify reporting through different basic approaches. One approach would delete or substantially reduce
the reporting of exempt transactions. A second approach would not reduce significantly the reportable transactions,
but rather would reduce the flexibility provided insiders with respect to using Form 4 or Form 5 to report a number of
exempt transactions. A third approach would introduce issuer annual reporting of insider holdings and information
as to transactions during the fiscal year. These proposals highlight several questions as to what extent, if at all,
investors need information with respect to exempt transactions and whether investors need a reconciliation of insiders'
equity holdings from year to year. 

The suggestions received by the Commission include: 

1. Elimination of the requirement to report exempt transactions, or certain classes of exempt transactions, such
as exempt employee benefit plan transactions;

75

 





2. Replacement of annual reporting on Form 5 with a table to be included in the issuer's Form 10-K annual report
disclosing and reconciling transactions and insiders' holdings; 
3. Replacement of annual reporting on Form 5 with a requirement that each Form 4 filed include information (as a separate
line item, in a footnote or in a reconciliation column) with respect to exempt transactions that had occurred since
the last Form 4; 
4. Replacement of annual reporting on Form 5 with a requirement that each Form 4 filed include information with respect
to exempt transactions that had occurred since the last Form 4, except that broad-based plan transactions would continue
to be reportable annually (either on Form 5 or on Form 4); and

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940817-1-00063 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940817-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

5. Elimination of the total holdings column in Forms 4 and 5 (which the current rules limit to the class of securities
with respect to which a transaction is reported), or simplification of the reconciling data for such columns. 
The Commission is interested in obtaining the least burdensome reporting system that will effectively achieve the
disclosure purposes of Section 16(a), and therefore solicits comment on each of the above proposals. While the above
changes are not included in the text of the proposals published today, the Commission may adopt any of the alternatives
specified above, or a combination of those alternatives, and also may in the final rule amendments incorporate any
one or more of the approaches discussed above. Comment is solicited as to whether each of these suggested changes would
simplify the reporting obligations on insiders without materially reducing the flow of information that is significant
to investors. If the total holdings column is retained, comment also is requested as to whether any reconciling information
could be eliminated. Additionally, comment is solicited as to whether a new column should be added to Forms 4 and 5 requiring
insiders to reconcile their current holdings with those reported on the previous report. Would this reconciliation
requirement be appropriate only if reporting of exempt transactions were eliminated? 
In addition, commenters recommending the elimination of Form 5 should address the mechanism by which information
that currently is reportable only on an annual basis should be reported. Commenters also are asked to address whether
Form 5 has continuing usefulness in reducing reporting delinquencies, 

76

 and, if so, what mechanism could serve this purpose if Form 5 were rescinded. In particular, what mechanism would enable
issuers to determine, in connection with their disclosure obligations under Item 405 of Regulation S-K and
S-B, whether all required Section 16(a) reports had been filed?

77

 





Although the current reporting scheme generally requires transactions exempt from short-swing profit recovery
to be reported annually, certain transactions, such as stock splits and stock dividends, are exempt from the reporting
requirement. The Commission proposes to eliminate the reporting requirement for the exempt cancellation or expiration
of a long derivative security where no value is received.

78

 Comment is requested as to whether this reporting requirement should be retained, and whether there are other limited
classes of exempt transactions that could be exempted from reporting without impairing the ability of the public
to obtain useful information. 




Finally, a new transaction code K would be added to Forms 4 and 5 to report any transaction that changes only the form
of beneficial ownership and not the extent of a reporting person's pecuniary interest in the subject securities.
Such transactions are reportable on Form 5, but the code also would be added to Form 4 so it could be used for voluntary
reporting on that form. Comment is requested as to whether any additional codes need to be added, or whether any existing
codes may be deleted, consistent with the informational needs of persons who use Section 16(a) disclosure.

B. Reporting of Small Acquisitions and Option Exercises 



At present, small acquisitions of equity securities and exercises and conversions of derivative securities are
reported on an insider's next otherwise required Form 4 or Form 5, whichever is earlier.
 No change currently is proposed to the existing system of reporting these transactions, other than amendment of the
small acquisitions reporting rule
 to exclude from the $10,000 threshold acquisitions occurring within the prior six months of the current acquisition
that were exempted by rule from Section 16(b) or previously reported on Form 4 or 5, and to clarify that the current acquisition
cannot be disregarded in calculating the $10,000 threshold. Comment also is solicited as to whether reporting would
be made more convenient for insiders, consistent with the informational needs of other investors, by permitting
small acquisitions and exempt exercises and conversions to be reported solely on Form 5; or by providing that small
acquisitions be reported on Form 5 and exempt exercises and conversions be reported on Form 4. 





Currently, when an insider exercises an option acquired pursuant to a Rule 16b-3 plan and immediately sells
a portion of the shares to pay the exercise price under a cashless exercise program, the transaction generally is reported
on Form 4 or 5 as the exercise of a derivative security and sale of a non-derivative security.
 Comment is solicited as to whether insiders should be either required or permitted to reflect the sale of the portion
of shares necessary to satisfy the exercise price by using the transaction code for payment of an option exercise price
by delivery or withholding of securities,
 rather than the general sale of security code currently used, since all of these transactions constitute cashless
exercises. In addition, comment is solicited as to whether this transaction code also should be used in connection
with the exercise of stock appreciation rights. 





C. Joint and Group Reporting 


Currently, when more than one person subject to Section 16 is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same equity securities,
all such persons must report as beneficial owners and file separate reports. To reduce this duplicative reporting,
the proposed rules would permit such persons to file their reports either separately or jointly.
 




Under the proposal, where persons in a group have reporting obligations, the filing of collective reports on behalf
of all group members would be permitted.
 Such joint and group filings, and any amendments, could be submitted by any designated constituent beneficial owner.
Required information would have to be given for each beneficial owner, and such filings would have to be signed by,
or on behalf of, each beneficial owner by an authorized person, with statements confirming the delegation of signature
authority attached to the filing. Beneficial owners making a joint or group filing could authorize one of the beneficial
owners or a third party to sign on their behalf, provided that confirming statements are attached to the filing, or
are provided by amendment as soon as practicable, with respect to each owner delegating signature authority, unless
such a confirmation still in effect is on file with the Commission.
 Of course, to the extent a sufficiently broad power of attorney previously had been filed, such as with a Schedule 13D,
that power of attorney could be incorporated by reference in a Section 16(a) filing. Each beneficial owner would,
of course, retain individual liability for compliance with the filing requirements, including the obligation to
assure that the filing is timely and accurately made.
 Comment is solicited as to whether, in the alternative, authority to make a group Section 16 filing could be presumed
based on the filing of a group Schedule 13D,
 such that all group members thereby would be deemed to have granted authority to any group member to file a Section 16
form. 







D. Trust Transactions 


Today, a trust is subject to Section 16 not only if it beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered
equity securities,
 but also if the trustee otherwise is an insider and has investment control over the issuer's securities held by the
trust, and the trustee or a member of the trustee's immediate family has a pecuniary interest in such securities, except
in limited circumstances. This dual standard, newly established under the rules adopted in 1991, created a new reporting
obligation for some trusts, particularly family trusts where the insiders already were required to report most of
the trust transactions involved.
 





Since the primary effect of the new standard was to create duplicative reporting obligations, imposing independent
Section 16 obligations on the trusts does not appear necessary. Accordingly, the proposed rules would eliminate
these overlapping obligations by subjecting a trust to Section 16 only if it holds more than ten percent of a class of
registered equity securities of the issuer.
 




Duplicative reporting also can result because in certain instances the trust and a trust beneficiary must report
separately with respect to the same transaction. Accordingly, a proposed new note would provide that transactions
attributed to a trust beneficiary may be reported by the trustee on behalf of the beneficiary.
 




E. Post-Termination Reporting 


Under the current rules, any transaction following the cessation of director or officer status is required to be reported,
if executed within six months of a transaction that occurred while the person was a director or officer. However, it
appears that the record-keeping burdens of tracking post-termination transactions should be imposed only with
respect to those transactions where short-swing profit liability is likely. Accordingly, the proposal would eliminate
insiders' post-termination reporting obligations with respect to post-termination transactions that are exempt
and thus not subject to matching with pre-termination transactions.
 Similarly, a post-termination transaction would not be required to be reported unless it occurred within six months
of an opposite (purchase vs. sale), non-exempt transaction that was effected while the reporting person was an officer
or director.
 Comment is requested as to the continuing need to report these transactions. In particular, is it necessary to continue
to require reporting of exempt post-termination transactions to assure that an exemption properly may be claimed?

F. Compliance With the Reporting Requirements 



Since the adoption of the 1991 revisions to the Section 16 rules and forms, including issuer disclosure concerning
insider compliance and annual reporting of exempt transactions, compliance with Section 16(a) reporting obligations
generally has improved substantially.
 Accordingly, the Commission does not propose to change the disclosure requirements of Item 405 of Regulations S-B
and S-K, which requires issuer disclosure concerning insider compliance with these reporting obligations,
except that registrants would be required to set off any disclosure of non-compliance under an appropriate and discrete
caption.
 This should enable interested parties to locate quickly this disclosure, which often consists of only a sentence
or two, and to prevent it from being buried among unrelated disclosure. 





In addition, Item 405 would be revised to clarify the nature of the issuer's obligation to review insiders' filings
in order to determine whether there are any delinquent reports that must be disclosed. The issuer is entitled to rely
on the Forms 3, 4, and 5 furnished to it, as well as written representations by the insider that no Form 5 is required.
New language would be added to make it clear that the issuer is obligated to consider the absence of certain forms.
 The absence of a Form 3 from an insider is an indication that disclosure is required. Similarly, the absence of a Form
5 from an insider is an indication that disclosure is required, unless the issuer has received a written representation
that no Form 5 is required,
 or the issuer otherwise knows that no such filing is required. 





Further, comment is solicited on whether Item 405 should be revised to require issuers to include in their filings
an affirmative statement that there were no Section 16(a) delinquencies required to be reported, if such is the case.
 It has been suggested that there are instances where required disclosures are not made because Item 405 is overlooked.
An affirmative statement of the absence of reportable delinquencies has been proposed to the Commission as a potential
tool for minimizing this problem. Commenters should address whether the problem suggested does in fact exist, and,
if so, whether the proposed solution would be effective. 




Finally, the Commission is aware of and encourages the practice of many issuers to assist their officers and directors
in complying with their Section 16(a) reporting obligations. Since the use of powers of attorney is permitted, it
is also possible for an issuer to coordinate the filing of its officers' and directors' reports by having the corporate
secretary or other agent obtain powers of attorney from these reporting persons, and act on their behalf to collect
information every month about their transactions subject to Section 16 and make the filings by the due date.
 




G. Equity Swaps 



Questions have been asked concerning the proper method of reporting equity swaps for purposes of Section 16. Equity
swaps are individually negotiated contracts in which the specific terms may vary from agreement to agreement. For
instance, an equity swap may take the form of an agreement in which one party holding shares of equity securities agrees
to pay, or ``swap,'' the return
 on those securities in exchange for the return on an equity index, basket of equities, or an interest rate-based cash
flow. Section 16 consequences would arise from such a transaction where either party to the transaction is a Section
16 insider with respect to a security to which the swap agreement relates.
 





In order to demonstrate how Section 16 would apply,
 assume that an insider agrees to pay to the counterparty for a period of three years the value of dividend payments on
100,000 shares of issuer common stock, in exchange for payment of a fixed interest rate based on the market value of
the 100,000 shares of stock at the commencement of the swap term. The parties also agree that at the end of the swap term,
the insider will pay to the counterparty the cash value of any appreciation on the shares during the term, or, conversely,
the counterparty will pay to the insider the cash value of any depreciation. The insider retains title to and any voting
rights in the securities.
 





It appears that the following reporting scheme appropriately reflects the economic impact of the transaction on
the insider. The insider should report entering into the swap on Form 4 as (i) the sale or writing of a stock appreciation
right (``SAR''), and (ii) the purchase of a stock depreciation right (``SDR'').
 This result would reflect the fact that the insider has locked in the value of the 100,000 shares during the swap term
to the same extent as if the shares had been sold.
 





The manner in which an insider reports the closing of the swap would depend on the change in price of the underlying securities
during the swap term.
 If the price increases, so that the insider must pay cash to the counterparty, the insider should report the exempt
expiration without value of the SDR.
 The insider also should report on Form 4 the exempt exercise by the counterparty of the SAR, the insider's exempt deemed
disposition of the underlying securities to the counterparty pursuant to the SAR, and the insider's non-exempt deemed
re-acquisition of the underlying securities.
 






If the price decreases, so that the insider receives cash from the counterparty, the insider should report the expiration
of the SAR.
 The insider also should report on Form 4 the exercise of the SDR as the simultaneous exempt disposition of a put derivative
security as a result of its exercise, the exempt deemed disposition of the underlying securities as a result of the
exercise, and the non-exempt deemed acquisition of the underlying securities.
 





Comment is requested as to whether the derivative security analysis described above accurately reflects the economic
substance of the swap transaction described, or whether there is a more appropriate analysis for purposes of Section
16. Comment also is solicited as to whether there are other common forms of equity swaps for which a different Section
16 analysis may be appropriate. In setting forth the analysis above, the Commission does not wish to suggest that previously
filed Forms reporting swap transactions in another manner need to be revised, or that swap transactions reported
differently are subject to disclosure pursuant to Item 405 of Regulations S-B and S-K. Finally, comment
is requested as to whether there is a need for separate reporting codes for these transactions. 



IV. Additional Exemptions and Revisions 



A. New Exemption for Qualified Domestic Relations Orders 



The current rules limit the exemption for the disposition of securities pursuant to a qualified domestic relations
order (``QDRO''), as defined in the Internal Revenue Code or Title I of ERISA, and the rules thereunder, to employee
plan securities. Since such dispositions are unlikely to be influenced by access to inside information, this limitation
does not appear necessary. Accordingly, the proposal includes a general exemption for such dispositions.
 




By interpretation, the current exemption has been construed to permit the transfer of securities, issued under a
plan that is not subject to Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, pursuant to a ``domestic relations order''
that satisfies certain conditions of the Internal Revenue Code,
 but does not satisfy QDRO standards.
 Comment is requested as to whether the proposed exemption should require satisfaction of the QDRO standards in all
circumstances, or whether satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Code ``domestic relations order'' standards would
suffice.

B. Exemption for Stock Dividend Transactions 



As proposed, the exemption for stock splits and stock dividends would be expanded to include specifically a stock
dividend in which equity securities of a different issuer are distributed.

115

 The primary application of this exemption would be to ``spinoff'' transactions, in which assets previously owned
by the issuer are distributed 

pro rata

 to shareholders in the form of equity securities of another issuer. 




The Division has interpreted the current rule to apply to stock splits or stock dividends involving the issuance,
on a 

pro rata

 basis, of a different class of equity securities of the same issuer.

116

 The business purposes generally motivating spinoff transactions and the fact that the securities distributed represent
assets owned indirectly by shareholders appear to justify further expanding this exemption to securities of a different
issuer. 




C. Over-Allotment Options



Questions have arisen as to whether an over-allotment option written by an insider could be characterized as the establishment
of a put equivalent position and deemed sale of the underlying stock. Subsequent expiration of the unexercised option
arguably could constitute a purchase of the underlying security, matchable with the over-allotment option grant
or other sales by the insider within a six-month period. 
Recognizing that over-allotment options facilitate public offerings and do not lend themselves to the speculative
abuse Section 16 was designed to prevent, the staff issued interpretive relief to prevent this unintended result.

117

 The proposal would codify this relief by explicitly excluding over-allotment options from the derivative security
definition.

118

 Of course, a sale of securities to an underwriter upon exercise of the over-allotment option would remain a sale for
Section 16 purposes. Comment is solicited on whether additional conditions should be placed on the exclusion, such
as requiring that the option comply with all applicable regulations and policies of the National Association of Securities
Dealers. 





V. Request for Comment 



Any interested person wishing to submit written comments on the proposed revisions to the Commission's Section 16
rules and forms, and compliance disclosure requirements, as well as on other matters that might have an impact on the
proposals contained herein, is requested to do so. In addition, the Commission requests comment on whether any further
changes to the Section 16 rules, particularly Rule 16b-3, are necessary or appropriate at this time. Comment
is requested specifically from persons subject to Section 16; issuers whose officers, directors and ten percent
shareholders are subject to Section 16; and persons using the information afforded by the Section 16(a) reports.
The Commission also requests comment on whether the proposed rules, if adopted, would have an adverse impact on competition
or would impose a burden on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the
Exchange Act. Comments responsive to this inquiry will be considered by the Commission in complying with its responsibilities
under Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act.

119

 





VI. Transition to New Rules 



If the proposed rule revisions are adopted, provisions for a transition from the current rules will be necessary,
particularly with respect to proposed Rule 16b-3. Although the discussion below represents the Commission's
current intent regarding transition to the proposed revised rules, this schedule is subject to modification. 

The Commission intends to make the proposed rule amendments, other than those to Rule 16b-3, effective with
respect to reports that are, or would have been, due on or after the 45th day following the date of adoption (the ``Effective
Date''), with earlier compliance permitted. Of course, to the extent that proposed rules codify interpretive positions,
those positions continue to be valid before the Effective Date. Trusts currently subject to Section 16 that would
be relieved of Section 16 obligations under the proposed rules would not be subject to any post-termination reporting
obligations or required to file a final Form 5. 

In extending the phase-in period for current Rule 16b-3, the Commission stated that this period would continue
until September 1, 1994, or such earlier date as set in further rulemaking under Section 16. Given the timing of these
rule proposals, the Commission is extending the phase-in date until September 1, 1995 or such different date as set
in further rulemaking.

120

 Current and former Rule 16b-3 would remain available until September 1, 1995,

121

 unless a different date is set by the Commission in the adopting release. Comment is solicited on how long a transition
period issuers and insiders would need, assuming adoption of the proposals. Of course, issuers continue to be permitted
to convert their plans to current Rule 16b-3 at any time, provided that all plans of the issuer are converted.
After the phase-in date, issuers and insiders will no longer be able to rely on the former employee benefit plan exemptions,
but instead will need to comply with current Rule 16b-3 (modified to the extent the Commission adopts these rule
proposals). 






Because proposed Rule 16a-1(c)(8), which would exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' the
right or obligation to surrender a security or to have a security withheld in satisfaction of an exercise price or tax
withholding obligation, is inextricably linked to the proposed amendment of Rule 16b-3(e), the Commission
proposes to link the availability of proposed Rule 16a-1(c)(8) to conversion of the plan to proposed Rule 16b-3.




VII. Cost-Benefit Analysis 



Commenters are requested to provide their views and data to assist the Commission in evaluating the costs and benefits
associated with the proposed amendments. It is expected that the amendments would decrease significantly the compliance
burden imposed on persons subject to Section 16 and attendant costs without undercutting the statutory objectives
of disclosing information concerning insider trading and discouraging speculative short-term insider trading.

The proposed simplification of the treatment of employee benefit plan transactions would constitute the most important
reduction in compliance burden. The proposed rules also would reduce compliance costs by: permitting joint and group
reporting where more than one person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities; providing that Section
16 applies to a trust only if the trust beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered equity securities;
and limiting officers' and directors' post-termination reporting obligations. 

Furthermore, the proposed rules would expand the exemption for stock splits and stock dividends to include stock
dividends in which securities of a different issuer are distributed, and would provide a general exemption from reporting
and short-swing profit recovery for the disposition of securities 
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order. 



VIII. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 




An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 concerning the proposed
amendments. The analysis notes that the proposed amendments are intended to simplify the Section 16 regulatory scheme,
particularly with respect to employee benefit plans, and codify several staff interpretive positions. 

As discussed more fully in the analysis, most of the reporting persons the proposed amendments would affect are small
entities, as defined by the Commission's rules. The proposed amendments would decrease the reporting and compliance
requirements imposed upon corporate insiders subject to Section 16. 

The analysis discusses several possible alternatives to the proposed amendments including, among others, establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities or exempting them from all or part of the proposed
requirements. As discussed more fully in the analysis, implementation of any of these alternatives either would
be duplicative of the proposed amendments or inconsistent with the Exchange Act. 

Comments are encouraged on any aspect of the analysis. A copy of the analysis may be obtained by contacting Elizabeth
Murphy, Office of Disclosure Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.

 240.16b-3 

Employee benefit plan transactions. 



(a) 

Plan Conditions. 

A transaction by an officer or director shall be exempt from section 16(b) of the Act if it is pursuant to an employee
benefit plan that satisfies the conditions of this paragraph and of paragraph (b) of this section, if applicable;
and the transaction satisfies one of the transaction exemptions of paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section.
The plan shall set forth in writing the means or basis for determining eligibility to participate, as it relates to
officers and directors, and either the price at which the securities may be offered and the amount of securities to
be awarded or the method by which the price and the amount of the award are to be determined; 

provided, however, 

that plans for which paragraph (b)(3) of this section provides an exemption from the shareholder approval requirement
of paragraph (b) of this section need not specify the amount of securities to be awarded. 



* * * * * 



(c) * * * 

(1) 

Six Month Holding Period. 

The equity security is held for six months from the date of grant or, in the case of a derivative security, at least six
months elapse from the date of acquisition of the derivative security to the date of disposition of the derivative
security (other than upon exercise or conversion) or its underlying equity security; 

provided, however, 

that compliance with this paragraph (c)(1) is not required with respect to a disposition by a plan participant that
is exempted by rule from Section 16(b) of the Act. Dividend equivalent rights and stock acquired upon the reinvestment
of dividends, other than stock dividends exempted pursuant to  240.16a-9, shall be deemed to have been acquired
as of the date of acquisition of the securities on which such dividends or dividend equivalent rights were paid. 

(2) 

Plan Administration.

(i) 

Disinterested Administration.

 * * * 

(B) Participation in a securities acquisition plan meeting the conditions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall
not disqualify a director from being a disinterested person;

(A) By its terms permits officers and/or directors to receive automatic awards; and either: states the amount and
price of securities to be awarded to designated officers and directors or categories of officers and directors, though
not necessarily to others who may participate in the plan, and specifies the timing of awards to officers and directors;
or sets forth a formula that automatically determines the amount, price and timing, using objective criteria such
as earnings of the issuer, value of the securities, years of service, job classification, and compensation levels;


provided that 

(B) Such terms are not amended periodically, and in no event more often than every six months, other than to comport
with changes in the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder.




* * * * * 




(d) Broad-Based Plans and Intra-Plan Transfers. 

A transaction in a thrift, stock purchase or similar securities acquisition plan shall be exempt from Section 16(b)
of the Act if the plan satisfies the conditions of paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of this section, if applicable, and
the transaction satisfies the conditions of either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section. 

(1) For any purchase transaction resulting from an employee contribution and/or an employer contribution, other
than an intra-plan transfer, the transaction is pursuant to:

(i) A plan that provides for broad-based employee participation, by its terms does not discriminate in favor of highly
compensated employees, and is qualified pursuant to Section 401 or Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code; or 

(ii) A plan that: 

(A) Operates in conjunction with a plan that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section; and


(B) Provides only the benefits or contributions that would be provided under a tax-qualified plan but for the limitations
of Sections 401(a)(17), 415 and any other applicable contribution limitation set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.

(i) The transaction is pursuant to an election made during a quarterly time period specified in paragraph (e)(3) of
this section; or 

(ii) The transaction results from a diversification election that satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a)(28)
of the Internal Revenue Code. 

(e) 

Cash settlements of stock appreciation rights. 

A transaction involving the exercise and cancellation of a stock appreciation right (whether or not the transaction
also involves the related surrender and cancellation of a stock option), and the receipt of cash in complete or partial
settlement of that right, shall be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Act if the plan satisfies the conditions of paragraph
(a) and paragraph (b) of this section, if applicable, and the following conditions are met: 

(1)
