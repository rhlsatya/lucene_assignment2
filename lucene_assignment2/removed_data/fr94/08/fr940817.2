<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Notice of a Computer Matching Program for Federal Salary Offset</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Nutrition Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of computer matching programs between the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA), and the United States Postal Service (USPS).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

FNS, USDA, is giving notice that it intends to conduct a computer matching program with the USPS in order to identify
USPS employees who owe certain delinquent debts to the United States Government under the Food Stamp Program administered
by FNS for food stamp benefits which they received but to which they were not entitled.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This computer matching program is being initiated as part of an effort by USDA to increase the collection of overissued
food stamp benefits. These overissued benefits are benefits which households received but to which they were not
entitled. As part of their responsibility for administering the Food Stamp Program, State agencies are responsible
for establishing claims for these overissued benefits and for taking certain steps to try to collect those claims.
This computer match will provide otherwise unavailable information which State agencies can use to try to collect
delinquent food stamp claims owed by USPS employees and if necessary, which USDA can use to collect such claim by involuntarily
offsetting USPS employee salaries.

<TEXT>
 

This Notice is being published as required by Section (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(12)), as
amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-503).

The following information is provided as required by paragraph (b)(3) of Appendix I to Office of Management and Budget
Circular A-130, dated 

July 2, 1993.

1. 

Participating agencies:

 The recipient agency is USPS. The source agency is USDA.

2. 

Beginning and ending dates:

 The matching program will begin in November 1994 and continue in effect no longer than 18 months (April 30, 1996). If
within three months of that date, the Data Integrity Boards of both USDA and the USPS find that the matching program
can be conducted without change and both USDA and the USPS certify that the matching program has been conducted in compliance
with the matching agreement, the matching program may be extended for one additional year.

3. 

Purpose of the match:

 In addition to providing information to assist in collecting food stamp recipient delinquent debts, the names of
USPS employees identified through this matching program will be removed from lists of delinquent debts being referred
to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for collection from Federal income tax refunds. This action is required to conform
to an IRS requirement for the tax offset program. (A description of the Federal income tax refund offset program for
the Food Stamp Program is contained in a General Notice dated August 20, 1991 at 56 FR 41325-31.)

4. 

Description of the match:

 The subject matching program will involve several steps. USDA will provide USPS a magnetic computer tape of claims
submitted by State agencies participating in the Federal tax offset program. By computer, USPS will compare that
information with its payroll file, establishing matched individuals on the basis of Social Security Numbers (SSN's).
For each matched individual, the USPS will provide to USDA the individual's name, SSN, home address, date of birth,
work location, and employee type (permanent or temporary).

USDA will prepare lists of matched individuals according to the State agencies which established the claim for the
overissued benefits and will distribute the State lists accordingly. The respective State agencies will verify
identity and debtor status of the matched individuals by manually comparing those list of matched individuals to
their records on the debts, by conducting independent inquiries when necessary to resolve questionable identities,
and by reviewing the records of payments to determine whether or not the debt is still delinquent.

In addition to verifying debtor identity and the status of the debt, prior to USDA taking any steps to effect involuntary
offset of USPS employee salaries, State agencies will provide debtors with a 30-day written notice stating the amount
of the debt and that the debtor may repay it voluntarily by entering into a written agreement with the State agency.
Debts not repaid voluntarily would be referred to USDA for involuntary salary offset. Prior to such action, debtors
would be notified and offered an opportunity for a hearing on the debt, including the right to copy documentation relating
to the debt.

5. 

Legal authorities:

 This matching program will be conducted under the following authorities:

(a) The Debt Collection Act of 1982 (5 U.S.C. 5514), which gives authority to Federal agencies to offset the salaries
of Federal and USPS employees who are delinquent on debts owed to the Federal government;

(b) Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations, 5 CFR part 550, subpart K (Collection by Offset from Indebted
Government Employees),   550.1101-1108, which set the standards for Federal agency rules implementing
the Debt Collection Act;

(c) USDA regulations at 7 CFR part 3, subpart C, which implement 5 U.S.C. 5514 and OPM regulations, and which authorize
USDA agencies to issue regulations governing debt collection by salary offset (7 CFR 3.68); and

(d) Section 13941 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66), which amended sections
11(e) (8) and 13 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(8), 2022, to authorize the Federal salary offset program
for the Food Stamp Program.

6. 

Categories of individuals involved:

 Two groups of individuals will be involved with this matching program. One group is USPS employees. The other is individuals
who have participated in the Food Stamp Program but are no longer participating, and who owe delinquent debts for overissued
food stamp benefits for which they are not making repayments. This group is further defined in that the individuals
owe only delinquent debts resulting from inadvertent household errors and intentional Program violations. Individuals
owing claims due to State agency administrative errors will be excluded (7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(8)(C)).

7. 

Record systems used:

 (a) USPS will use records from its Privacy Act system of records ``Finance Records_Payroll System, USPS 050.020,''
containing payroll records for approximately 700,000 current employees. Disclosure will be made pursuant to routine
use Number 24 of USPS 050.020, (57 FR 57515, dated December 4, 1992).

(b) USDA will use records from its Privacy Act system of records ``Claims Against Food Stamp Recipients_USDA/FNS_3,''
containing approximately 230,000 records. Disclosure will be made pursuant to routine use Number 4 of record system
USDA/FNS_3, (58 FR 48633, dated September 17, 1993).

8. 

Agency contact:

 Inquiries about this matching program should be directed to James I. Porter, Supervisor, Issuance and Accountability
Section, State Administration Branch, Program Accountability Division, Food Stamp Program, FNS, USDA, 3101 Park
Center Drive, Room 905, Alexandria, Virginia 22302, telephone (703) 305-2385.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Revised notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Notice of Availability of EIS.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The USDA, Forest Service, Tahoe National Forest and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit are preparing a Legislative
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to determine the suitability or non-suitability of the approximately 58.8
miles (revised from previously published 61 miles) of eight eligible streams and rivers on the Tahoe National Forest
and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. In addition to the
Wild and Scenic River suitability analysis, the EIS will evaluate the environmental effects of possible Special
Interest Area designation, a Forest Service Administrative designation, as an alternative to Wild and Scenic River
designation. Lynn Sprague, Regional Forester, Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service, 630 Sansome Street,
San Francisco, California 94111, is the responsible official for Special Interest Area designation. Michael Espy,
Secretary of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 200-A, Adm. Bldg., Washington, D.C. 20250,
is the responsible official for recommendations for wild and scenic river designation.




The Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be available for public review beginning August 18, 1994 and a copy
can be obtained by writing: Forest Supervisor, Tahoe National Forest, P.O. Box 6003, Nevada City, California 95959

<DOCTITLE>Suitability Study of the North Fork, South Fork and Mills Rivers for Inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers
System; Pisgah National Forest (National Forests in North Carolina), Henderson and Transylvania Counties, NC</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

USDA, Forest Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service has prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) to evaluate the environmental impacts
of including suitable segments of North Fork, South Fork and Mills Rivers classified as wild, scenic, or recreational
rivers in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The decision to recommend the nomination of suitable river segments
to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System rests with the Secretary of Agriculture. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act
(PL 90-542) reserves to Congress the authority to include rivers in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.



The agency invites written comments on the suitability of these rivers and recommendations related to classifying
and including them in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. In addition, the agency gives notice of the full environmental
analysis and decision making process that has been occurring on the proposal so that interested and affected people
are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision. The Supervisor of the National Forests
in North Carolina is responsible for the preparation of the EIS. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In 1982, the Nationwide River Inventory developed by the National Park Service, U.S. Department of Interior, identified
South Fork and Mills River as potential wild and scenic study rivers. The 1987 Final Environmental Impact Statement
(FEIS) for the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Nantahala and Pisgah National Forests determined South Fork
and Mills River to be eligible for designation with potential wild and recreational classifications for different
segments of South Fork and recreational for Mills River. (That information and additional findings will be documented
in this environmental impact statement.) The rivers were determined to be potentially suitable for designation
pending further study. A follow-up study to the Forest Plan FEIS was begun in 1989. At the request of local citizens,
through a North Carolina Congressional Delegate, North Fork was added to the study area. In November 1990, Public
Law 101-538 was passed by Congress which designated 34.8 miles of the Mills River System (North Fork, South Fork
and Mills Rivers) as a Wild and Scenic Study River. This Act excluded the segment of the Mills River from the confluence
of the French Broad River to a point 750 feet upstream from the centerline of N.C. Highway 191/280.



The Environmental Impact Statement will consider the following river segments: 




North Fork, Bottom of Hendersonville reservoir spillway to South Fork 
 5.9 miles

South Fork, Pigeon Branch in headwaters to North Fork 
 25.4 miles

Mills River, Confluence North and South Forks to point 750 feet upstream from centerline of N.C. Highway 191/280 
 3.5 miles 




The area of consideration for each stream is a corridor a minimum of 1/4 mile from each stream bank for the entire length
of the study segment. These corridors include both public and private lands. 

Significant issues identified during initial scoping include the potential for future dams along these rivers based
on past proposals for impoundments, the effects of designation on private lands, and protection of the free-flowing
condition and resource values of these rivers. 

A range of alternatives will be developed based on issues and concerns raised during the study process. As a minimum,
one alternative will maintain current management with a recommendation of nondesignation for the three rivers (the
no action alternative). Other potential alternatives include: 1. Recommend designation for all eligible segments.
2. Recommend designation or nondesignation for specific segments of each river based on identified issues and 3.
Recommend designation of eligible segments with different classifications (wild, scenic, recreational) based
on identified issues. The environmental impact statement will disclose the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects
of implementing each alternative. 

Public participation is important at several points during the analysis process. The first point was the scoping
process (40 CFR 1501.7). The scoping process includes, but is not limited to: (1) Identifying potential issues, (2)
identifying issues to be analyzed in depth, (3) eliminating insignificant issues or those that have been covered
by a relevant previous environmental analysis, (4) exploring additional alternatives, and (5) identifying potential
(direct, indirect, and cumulative) environmental effects of the alternatives.

During the scoping process, the Forest Service sought information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State,
and local agencies and individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposal. News releases
were published in local newspapers; individual letters were distributed to government agencies, organizations,
landowners along the rivers and individuals assumed to be interested in this action; and several meetings were held
in the local community along the rivers. Informal contacts through phone calls and visits have also occurred throughout
the study. Additional mailings and media releases will occur when the Draft EIS and Final EIS are completed and available
for public review.
The responsible official is Mike Espy, Secretary of Agriculture, Administration Bldg., 12th Street and Jefferson
Drive, SW., Washington, DC 20250.
The Draft Environmental Impact Statement is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and available for public review by August 1994. The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will
be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the Notice of Availability in the 

Federal Register

.
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. Upon release of the draft environmental impact
statement, projected for August 1994, reviewers must structure their participation in the environmental review
of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

vs.

 NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement
stage, but are not raised until after the completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

vs.

 Hodel, 

803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

vs.

 Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposal participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider and respond to them in the Final
Environmental Impact Statement.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages and chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions at the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.
After the comment period ends on the draft environmental impact statement, the comments will be analyzed and considered
by the Forest Service in preparing the Final Environmental Impact Statement. The final statement is scheduled to
be completed by March 1995.
The Secretary of Agriculture will consider comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the
final environmental impact statement and applicable laws, regulations, and policies in making his recommendation
to the President regarding the suitability of these rivers for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
The decision on the inclusion of a river in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System rests with the United States Congress.

Postponement of Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determinations: Pure and Alloy Magnesium From the People's Republic
of China and the Russian Federation; and Pure Magnesium from Ukraine



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Commerce (``the Department'') is postponing its preliminary determinations in the antidumping
duty investigations of pure and alloy magnesium from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation
(Russia), and pure magnesium from Ukraine. The deadline for issuing these preliminary determinations is now no later
than October 27, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On April 20, 1994, the Department initiated antidumping duty investigations of pure and alloy magnesium from the
PRC, Russia, and Ukraine (59 FR 21748, April 26, 1994). The notice stated that we would issue our preliminary determinations
on September 7, 1994.



On May 16, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission determined that there was not a likelihood that a U.S. domestic
industry was materially injured, nor threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of alloy magnesium from
Ukraine, thereby terminating the investigation of alloy magnesium from Ukraine. With regard to pure and alloy magnesium
from the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation and pure magnesium from Ukraine, the ITC found that
there was a reasonable indication that an industry in the U.S. is materially injured, or threatened with material
injury, by reason of imports of pure and alloy magnesium from the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation
and pure magnesium from Ukraine.

We have determined that the remaining investigations are extraordinarily complicated within the meaning of section
733(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(2). Given the non-market
economy status of all countries subject to these investigations, the nature of government ownership of the participating
companies must be clarified for each country. Additionally, these investigations involve unusually complex foreign
trading channels as well as possible sales from foreign government stockpiles. Furthermore, we have determined
that the parties concerned are cooperating, as required by section 733(c)(1)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(1),
and that additional time is necessary to make these preliminary determinations in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(ii)
of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(3).

For these reasons, the deadline for issuing these determinations is now no later than October 27, 1994.

This notice is published pursuant to section 733(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(d).

<DOCTITLE>Public Scoping Meeting for Disposal and Reuse of Gentile AFS, OH </DOCTITLE>


The United States Air Force (AF) will conduct a public scoping meeting to provide a forum for public officials and the
community to provide information and comments concerning the disposal and reuse of portions of Gentile AFS, OH. The
meeting will be held September 14, 1994 beginning at 7 p.m. at the Kettering City Hall, 3600 Shroyer Road, Kettering,
Ohio. 
The purpose of this meeting is to identify the environmental issues and concerns that should be analyzed to support
base disposal and reuse, and solicit potential disposal and reuse alternatives for consideration in developing
the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In soliciting disposal and reuse alternatives, the AF will consider all
reasonable alternatives offered by any federal, state, or local government agency, and any federally-sponsored
or private entity or individual. The resulting EIS will be considered in making disposal decisions that will be documented
in the Air Force's Final Disposal Plan and Record of Decision for Gentile AFS. 
To ensure sufficient time to adequately consider public comments concerning environmental issues and disposal
alternatives to be included in the EIS, the AF recommends that comments and reuse proposals be presented at the upcoming
meeting or forwarded to the address below by December 1, 1994. The AF will, however, accept additional comments at
any time during the environmental impact analysis process. 
Please direct written comments or requests for further information concerning the base disposal and reuse EIS to:
William Myers, 8106 Chennault Road, Brooks AFB TX 78235-5318, (210) 536-3860.

<DOCTITLE>Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI) and Environmental Assessment (EA) for Realignment of Fort Monmouth, NJ</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Army, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Finding of No Significant Impact.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed action implements the July 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission's (BRAC 93) decision
to realign all Department of Army personnel and missions out of the leased U.S. Army Communications-Electronics
Command (CECOM) Office Building (Tinton Falls, New Jersey) and the Evans subpost (which is closing) onto the main
post or Charles Wood subpost of Fort Monmouth. Personnel and missions from Vint Hill Farms Station (VHFS) in Warrenton,
Virginia, will also be moved onto the main post or Charles Wood subpost as part of this action.





Since not all personnel can be accommodated in existing buildings, new facilities will be constructed. Actions to
implement this realignment include the construction of up to 7 new buildings, demolition of 5 buildings, and renovation
of 15 buildings.



Alternatives considered in the EA included:

Alternative 1: Consists of the following projects:




_Construction of a 16,000-square foot Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Directorate (IEWD) complex at main post.

_Construction of a 3,250-square foot calibration range laboratory at the Charles Wood subpost.

_Construction of a 2,600-square foot high bay facility at the Charles Wood subpost.

_Renovation of 14 main post buildings.

_Renovation of portions of the Myer Center (Building 2700) at the Charles Wood subpost.




Alternative 2: Alternative construction sites were identified on the Charles Wood subpost for the IEWD complex,
the calibration range laboratory, and the high bay facility. No reasonable alternative to the building renovations
at main post and the Charles Wood subpost of Fort Monmouth were identified.

Alternative 3: The No-Action Alternative. This alternative is the continuation of existing conditions without
the implementation of, or in absence of, the proposed actions. The proposed actions are required by BRAC law and must
be implemented. Therefore, the No-Action Alternative is being evaluated to provide a baseline for the other alternatives.

Alternative 2 was not selected for implementation based on the potential for significant environmental, biological
and cultural resources impacts.

Implementation of the preferred alternative (Alternative 1) will not substantially alter baseline environmental
conditions. Biological, physical, and cultural resources will not be impacted by the preferred alternative because
construction sites for new buildings are located in previously disturbed areas. The increase in the workforce at
Fort Monmouth will be largely off-set by the workforce decreases that will result from scheduled non-BRAC realignments
and Department of Defense downsizing. This workforce decrease offsets potential impacts on infrastructure such
as water, wastewater, solid waste and energy.

The proposed realignment is expected to have an insignificant impact on the socioeconomic environment, including
total sales, employment, population and income.

Based on the EA, which is incorporated into the FNSI, it has been determined that implementation of the proposed action
would have no significant individual or cumulative impacts on the quality of the natural or human environment. Because
there will be no significant environmental impacts resulting from implementation of the proposed action, an Environmental
Impact Statement is not required.

<DOCTITLE>Assumptions and Methodology Document for the Spent Nuclear Fuel Management Cost </DOCTITLE>
Evaluation 


<AGENCY>

 Department of Energy. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy has issued an Assumptions and Methodology 
Document for a cost evaluation of the management of Spent Nuclear Fuel, which discusses 
the assumptions and methodologies that will be used by the Department in preparing a cost 
evaluation report. The Department invites interested agencies, organizations, and the general 
public to provide comments on the Assumptions and Methodology Document. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 During the last fifty years, the Department of 
Energy has engaged in extensive nuclear energy operations that have made large contributions 
to our national defense and knowledge of nuclear technology. In the process, substantial 
quantities of spent nuclear fuel were generated. The Department must manage that spent 
nuclear fuel, and a much smaller amount that will be generated over the next 40 years, until 
final decisions about its ultimate disposition are made. 


In June 1994, the Department issued the Department of Energy Programmatic Spent 
Nuclear Fuel Management and Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental 
Restoration and Waste Management Programs Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SNF & 
INEL EIS) (DOE/EIS-0203-D) for review and comment. A Notice of Availability was issued 
on June 24, 1994 (59 FR 32688). The SNF & INEL EIS evaluates potential environmental 
impacts that may occur under several different alternatives for managing spent nuclear fuel 
over the next 40 years. 
Potential monetary costs associated with implementing the spent nuclear fuel 
management alternatives will be considered in the Department's decision-making on the 
alternatives identified in the EIS. The Cost Evaluation Report will also contain other 
information (for example, estimated costs of disposal in a geologic repository) which will be 
useful in the Department's efforts to establish baseline estimates for life-cycle program costs. 
Such information is relevant to the Department's environmental restoration and waste 
management responsibilities and is being consolidated into the Baseline Environmental 
Management Report to be issued later this year. 


Cost Evaluation Report



The Department is seeking public input on the Assumptions 
and Methodology Document, which is to be used in preparing the Cost Evaluation Report. 
The Cost Evaluation Report will be made available to the public before the EIS Record of 
Decision is issued in June 1995. Portions of this evaluation are among the many factors that 
will be considered by the Department when preparing the EIS Record of Decision. 


Scope of the Cost Evaluation



The Assumptions and Methodology Document 
presents the approach to be used in developing the cost evaluation, which has two primary 
purposes: to compare the monetary costs of the alternatives discussed in the SNF and INEL 
EIS and to explore estimated life-cycle costs to be used as relevant information to the 
Department's environmental restoration and waste management responsibilities. The Cost 
Evaluation Report will address a reasonable range of potential spent nuclear fuel management 
project expenses, which (depending upon the alternative) include potential costs for research 
and development, plant and equipment, operations and maintenance, capital/construction, 
decommissioning and decontamination, and potential costs associated with disposal. Some 
spent nuclear fuel management decisions may not be made for several years. Future selection 
of technologies or decisions on how to prepare some fuels for storage or disposition, for 
example, may significantly affect cost. Therefore, only relative predictions of these costs can 
be made at this time.

Assumptions: 



The assumptions used in the Assumptions and Methodology Document 
cover three tiers: 



Tier 1: Programmatic assumptions reflecting current Department policies and 
directives. 
Tier 2: Implementation of site-specific assumptions reflecting a site-specific 
planning basis. 
Tier 3: Technical assumptions based on expert knowledge and local conditions. 


Assumptions will be based on: 
 When, where, and how spent nuclear fuel will be managed and dispositioned 
 Technologies and requirements for stabilization (including processing), storage, 
transport, and licensing 
 The time frame required for various factors in managing spent nuclear fuel. 
 Facility lifespan, upgrades, new building, decontamination and decommissioning. 



Methodology: 



The Assumptions and Methodology Document is intended to provide a 
methodology for a relative comparison of costs that could be involved in Department of 
Energy spent nuclear fuel management. The DOE sites already engaged in spent nuclear fuel 
management activities will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of utilizing existing 
facilities and the costs of operating and maintaining those facilities. Certain functions or 
facilities are not available at all sites under all management strategies and alternatives. 
Generic facility descriptions and associated costs will be developed to fill the gap between 
existing and needed facilities.




To define the possible spread of costs for each alternative. To the extent practicable, estimates 
will be based upon historic data; analyses of similar activities and projecting cost to provide 
estimates for new actions; use of estimates developed in other programs that address some 
aspect of spent nuclear fuel management; and expert opinion.

The Washington Water Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company, et al.; Electric Rate and Corporate Regulation
Filings 


August 9, 1994.


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. The Washington Water Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company


[Docket No. EC94-23-000]


Take notice that on August 4, 1994, The Washington Water Power Company (Water Power) and Sierra Pacific Power Company
(Sierra Power) (together Applicants) filed, pursuant to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act and Part 33 of the Commission's
Regulations, a Joint Application requesting authorization to merge and reorganize Applicants' utility operations
and to dispose of Applicants' jurisdictional facilities. 
Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger, Sierra Pacific Resources Inc., Sierra Pacific and
Water Power will merge into a new corporation, Resources West Energy Corporation (Resources West) and Water Power
and Sierra Pacific will operate as separate utility divisions of Resource West. The subsidiaries of Water Power and
Sierra Pacific Resources (excluding Sierra Pacific, but including Sierra Pacific's subsidiaries) will become
subsidiaries of Resources West. The merger will be effected through an exchange of stock, with Sierra Pacific Resources
and Water Power shareholders exchanging their shares for the right to receive shares in Resources West. 
Applicants have submitted the direct testimony of nine witnesses who provide, 

inter alia, 

a description of the merger, the projected benefits for ratepayers and shareholders, an explanation of how Resources
West will provide comparable service to customers, and an analysis of the effects of the merger on competition in the
relevant markets. Applicants also have submitted 

pro forma 

open-access point-to-point transmission and network integration service tariffs for Resources West's Water Power
and Sierra Pacific Divisions which provide a range of flexible services at rates, terms and conditions designed to
be comparable to Resources West's use of Applicants' systems.
Applicants have requested, in a companion motion, that the Commission adopt an alternative procedural mechanism
to expedite consideration of the Joint Application by providing for discovery and a technical conference, followed
by a paper hearing if necessary. 
Copies of the Joint Application have been served on the state utility regulatory commissions in Washington, Idaho,
Oregon, Montana, Nevada and California.

<DOCTITLE>Fuels and Fuel Additives; Waiver Decision/Circuit Court Remand </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On July 12, 1991, under section 211(f)(4) of the Clean Air Act (Act), the Ethyl Corporation (Ethyl) requested a waiver
to permit the sale of its gasoline additive, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), an octane enhancer
commercially labeled by Ethyl as HiTEC 3000, for use in unleaded gasoline. The Administrator of EPA denied Ethyl's
application for a waiver on January 8, 1992, based primarily on concerns regarding the potential for increases in
hydrocarbon emissions resulting from MMT use. Ethyl subsequently sought judicial review of that decision in the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Based on new emissions data developed and submitted to
EPA by Ethyl, EPA requested that the Court of Appeals remand Ethyl's application to the Agency for further action.




On November 30, 1993, the Administrator of EPA found that Ethyl had met its burden to demonstrate under section 211(f)(4)
that approval of its remanded application would not cause or contribute to a failure to meet emission standards. Ethyl
agreed to resubmit its application at that time, thereby affording further time for the Agency to consider the issue
of potential health effects associated with use of MMT in unleaded gasoline. Ethyl and EPA later agreed to further
extend the deadline for final action on Ethyl's application to July 13, 1994. The Agency is today denying Ethyl's request
for a waiver for HiTEC 3000 based on unresolved concerns regarding the potential impact of manganese emissions resulting
from MMT use on public health.

I. Background 



Section 211(f)(1)(A) of the Act makes it unlawful, effective March 31, 1977, for any manufacturer of a fuel or fuel
additive to first introduce into commerce, or to increase the concentration in use of, any fuel or fuel additive for
use in light-duty motor vehicles manufactured after model year 1974 which is not substantially similar to any fuel
or fuel additive utilized in the certification of any model year 1975, or subsequent model year, vehicle or engine
under section 206 of the Act. An interpretive rule defining the term ``substantially similar'' under section 211(f)(1)(A)
was promulgated for unleaded gasoline at 46 FR 38582 (July 28, 1981), and revised at 56 FR 5352 (February 11, 1991).
Section 211(f)(1)(B) of the Act makes it unlawful, effective November 15, 1990, for any manufacturer of a fuel or fuel
additive to first introduce into commerce, or to increase the concentration in use of, any fuel or fuel additive for
use by any person in motor vehicles manufactured after model-year 1974 which is not substantially similar to any fuel
or fuel additive utilized in the certification of any model year 1975, or subsequent model year, vehicle or engine
under section 206 of the Act. Thus, section 211(f)(1)(B) expands the prohibitions of 211(f)(1)(A), which apply only
to light-duty vehicles.

Section 211(f)(4) of the Act provides that upon application 
by any fuel or fuel additive manufacturer, the Administrator of 
EPA may waive the prohibitions of section 211(f)(1) if the 
Administrator determines that the applicant has established that 
such fuel or fuel additive will not cause or contribute to a 
failure of any emission control device or system (over the useful 
life of any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to 
achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emissions standards to 
which it has been certified pursuant to section 206 of the Act. 
If the Administrator does not act to grant or deny a waiver 
within 180 days of receipt of the application, the statute 
provides that the waiver shall be treated as granted. The 
subject of this notice is an application by Ethyl under section 
211(f)(4) of the Act for a waiver for the fuel additive 
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), commercially 
labeled by Ethyl as HiTEC 3000, to be blended in unleaded 
gasoline resulting in a level of 0.03125 (1/32) gram per gallon 
manganese (gpg Mn). 

This Agency action is a reconsideration of Ethyl's fourth 
application for a waiver for MMT. Ethyl's first application was 
submitted on March 17, 1978 for concentrations of MMT resulting 
in 1/16 and 1/32 gpg Mn in unleaded gasoline. Ethyl's second 
application was submitted on May 26, 1981 for concentrations of 
MMT resulting in 1/64 gpg Mn in unleaded gasoline. The 
Administrator denied these requests for waivers due to concerns 
regarding increases in exhaust hydrocarbon emissions resulting 
from MMT use. The decisions and justifications thereof may be 
found in the September 18, 1978 

Federal Register

, 43 FR 41424, 
and the December 1, 1981 

Federal Register

, 46 FR 58630. Ethyl's 
third application was submitted on May 9, 1990, for 
concentrations of MMT resulting in a level of 0.3125 (1/32) gpg 
Mn in unleaded gasoline (the same levels which are requested in 
the application which is the subject of today's notice). Ethyl 
withdrew its third application on November 1, 1990, before the 
deadline for the Administrator to make a determination on the 
application. Because no determination had been made at the time 
Ethyl withdrew that application, EPA accepted the withdrawal and 
immediately terminated the proceeding without action on the 
application. 

Ethyl's fourth application was submitted on July 12, 1991. 
This application was, from a practical standpoint, an extension 
of the third application, the entire record of which was 
incorporated by Ethyl into the current proceeding. On January 8, 
1992, the Administrator of EPA denied Ethyl's fourth application 
for a waiver (57 FR 2535, January 22, 1992). The application was 
denied based in part upon data submitted by Ford Motor Company 
(Ford) which indicated that, for the model groups tested by Ford 
and, for the conditions under which Ford tested its vehicles, the 
increases in hydrocarbon exhaust emissions as a result of the use 
of MMT were substantially greater than those observed in the 
Ethyl test program. The Agency stated in its decision that a 
likely factor which might account for the differences observed 
between the Ethyl and Ford test programs was the severity of the 
driving cycle. However, the Agency also concluded that other 
factors might be responsible for the observed differences. In 
the denial decision, the Agency stated that it had always 
accepted data from test programs which ``model'' the fleet in 
support of waiver applications, but that if an interested party 
were to present data indicating that a potentially significant 
subset of the fleet, not tested by the applicant, was especially 
susceptible to the negative effects of the additive, the Agency 
could reasonably require specific testing on representative 
models of that sub-fleet. 

In its decision, the Agency also stated that it believes it 
is reasonable to consider the effect of a fuel on vehicles' 
ability to meet future emissions standards. (The ``Tier I'' 
tailpipe standards prescribed by section 202(g) of the Act began 
to take effect in model year 1994, which began approximately in 
September 1993.
) Therefore, regarding the Ford data mentioned 
above, the Agency stated in its decision that the concerns raised 
by that data related to both current and future standards. 





Although not the basis of the 1992 denial, another important 
issue arose during the consideration of Ethyl's third and fourth 
applications. The Agency, as well as several commentors, 
expressed concerns regarding the possible adverse health effects 
of an increase in airborne manganese resulting from MMT use. 
These concerns were centered around: (1) The known severe 
neurotoxic effects of high-level exposure to manganese through 
inhalation, (2) the lack of data regarding the chronic effects 
of low-level inhalation exposure to manganese in humans, and (3) 
the lack of knowledge regarding potential exposures due to MMT 
use. It was repeatedly pointed out by commenters that neurotoxic 
damage could occur prior to the onset of overt symptoms. 

In those proceedings, Ethyl also submitted comments 
regarding manganese emissions. Ethyl indicated that the 
manganese emissions resulting from the use of MMT in unleaded 
gasoline would be so small as to not materially affect human 
exposure to airborne manganese. In support of its view, Ethyl 
submitted analyses and data on exposure modeling and monitoring 
in both its 1990 and 1991 applications (and in subsequent 
submissions associated with the remand discussed below). (The 
issue of manganese emissions and public health is discussed in 
more detail in Section VI of this document.)

During EPA's consideration of the 1990 Ethyl submission, 
EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) conducted a 
manganese inhalation risk assessment based on the available data 
which found that because of ``the considerable uncertainties and 
data gaps in the available information * * * it is not possible 
* * * to conclude definitively that the increased use of MMT as a 
fuel additive will (or will not) increase public health risk.''
 
(EPA also investigated potential hazards associated with water 
contamination resulting from accidental spills or leakages of 
pure MMT and concluded that spills or leaks, if they occurred, 
are likely to be contained and therefore would not pose a human 
health risk due to groundwater contamination. However, data 
available to EPA are insufficient to determine whether spills and 
leaks could affect exposure to benthic organisms.) 





Additionally, in order to obtain assistance in describing 
information needed to improve its manganese health risk 
assessment (and also to improve its environmental hazard 
identification of issues associated with MMT itself), EPA, in 
conjunction with the National Institute of Environmental Health 
Sciences, conducted a Manganese/MMT Symposium and Workshop on 
March 12-15, 1991. The conference allowed the Agency to solicit 
scientific information from invited extramural scientists 
reflecting a wide range of scientific disciplines. Invited 
participants included representatives of Ethyl Corporation, the 
Environmental Defense Fund, the Centers for Disease Control, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Environment Canada. A 
summary of the workshop discussions was provided to each 
participant and the information obtained from this meeting was 
also used by EPA to prepare a report on prioritized research 
needed for improving its manganese inhalation risk assessment.






EPA raised the issue of potential health effects associated 
with manganese exposure as a concern in its January 1992 denial, 
but did not base its decision on this concern because the Agency 
concluded that the uncertainties regarding hydrocarbon emissions 
increases prevented EPA from making the requisite ``cause or 
contribute'' determination concerning effects on regulated 
emissions. 

On February 13, 1992, Ethyl filed a petition for review of 
the January 8, 1992 waiver denial decision in the United States 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. EPA and 
Ethyl subsequently entered discussions concerning a possible 
settlement of the court case. In the context of those 
discussions, Ethyl submitted to the Agency new emissions test 
data developed by Ethyl since the denial decision.

Based on its inspection and analysis of the new Ethyl data, EPA tentatively concluded that the data indicated that
driving cycle did not contribute significantly to MMT-induced increases in HC emissions. (EPA's preliminary analysis
was placed in docket A-92-41.) However, in addition to addressing the issue of driving cycle, the Ethyl
data appeared to confirm the finding by Ford that 1991 Escorts experienced a much higher MMT-induced HC increase than
that observed in other models tested (either in Ethyl's new program or in the original Ethyl test program). The Agency
remained concerned that these data might indicate that certain engine and emissions control system configurations
are more vulnerable to a MMT-induced emissions increase irrespective of driving cycle. 

To facilitate further settlement discussions with Ethyl, EPA decided to attempt to formulate an emission testing
program intended to address in a timely manner specific unresolved issues concerning the effect of MMT on emissions:
(1) whether other vehicles utilizing fuels containing MMT are likely to experience increases in hydrocarbon emissions
similar to those observed in 1991 Ford Escorts; and (2) whether fuels containing MMT have significant adverse effects
on emissions from vehicles utilizing the technologies most likely to be employed to meet future standards. On October
28, 1992, EPA held a public workshop to assist the Agency in its attempt to formulate such an emission testing program
(57 FR 44740, September 29, 1992). In particular, EPA hoped to obtain information and assistance from technical experts
outside of the Agency concerning the test program and, in view of the significance of any future waiver decision concerning
MMT for the auto industry and the general public, EPA was interested in obtaining comments concerning a decisional
framework designed to address and resolve these issues. A proposed emission test program developed by the Agency
and presented at the public workshop, was effectively adopted by Ethyl as its most recent vehicle emissions test program
involving the 1993 model fleet. 

Although further settlement discussions between Ethyl and EPA were held subsequent to the public workshop, the parties
were not successful in reaching a settlement. However, despite the failure of the parties to reach agreement, EPA
concluded that the Administrator's denial decision should be reconsidered in light of the new emissions data generated
by Ethyl subsequent to the decision. Accordingly, EPA requested that the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia remand the denial decision to EPA for reconsideration. 

On April 6, 1993, the Court of Appeals issued a decision granting the Agency's motion and remanding the case to the Agency
to redetermine within 180 days whether to grant or deny Ethyl's application. The mandate implementing this judgement
was transmitted to the Agency on June 3, 1993. Pursuant to the court's remand decision, the Agency published a notice
indicating the commencement of a comment period (58 FR 35950, July 2, 1993). The Administrator's final decision on
remand was due within 180 days after the transmittal of the court's mandate, or by November 30, 1993. 

After the Court of Appeals granted the Agency's motion to remand the denial decision concerning Ethyl's July 12, 1991
application, Ethyl submitted to EPA a substantial amount of additional data on emission testing with fuels containing
MMT. (Specific aspects of these data are discussed below in Section IV of this document). 

During the course of the remand of Ethyl's waiver application, the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviewed
the available data concerning the health effects associated with inhalation of manganese as part of a process to revise
the reference concentration (RfC) for inhaled manganese.
 An inhalation reference concentration is defined as an estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude)
of a continuous inhalation exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be
without appreciable risk of deleterious non-cancer health effects during a lifetime. The methodology for establishing
an RfC accounts for uncertainties and gaps in the health data base through the assignment of uncertainty factors.
In November, 1993, ORD completed preparation and review of, and EPA released to Ethyl, a document identifying and
describing the rationale for a new inhalation RfC of 0.05 ug/m3 for manganese and manganese compounds. 





Ethyl subsequently provided to EPA a detailed critique of the approach utilized to derive the revised manganese RfC.
Among other things, Ethyl argued that EPA used an inappropriate procedure to derive the RfC from a study of occupational
manganese exposures by Roels, et al. (1992). Ethyl also argued that use of MMT would not result in significant changes
in background manganese exposures, and that the favorable effects on public health resulting from changes in the
composition of gasoline when MMT is utilized would outweigh any potential for adverse health effects. (Copies of
documents describing the revised RfC and of the Ethyl comments are available in the public docket.) 

As the deadline of November 30, 1993, for final action by EPA on Ethyl's waiver application approached, EPA concluded
that the extensive data base on the emission effects of MMT assembled by Ethyl and others during the consideration
of the application was sufficient to permit a decision concerning whether Ethyl had satisfied the statutory requirement
to show that use of MMT will not cause or contribute to exceedence of emission standards. However, there had been insufficient
opportunity for public comment concerning the use of a revised manganese inhalation RfC in assessing any risks that
might be posed by granting Ethyl's application. Ethyl argued that it had not been afforded an adequate opportunity
to study the derivation of the RfC and to comment on its implications for Ethyl's application. While EPA scientists
did not necessarily agree with the specific technical arguments concerning the revised RfC and other issues pertaining
to health effects made by Ethyl, EPA concluded that it might be useful to review the revised RfC in light of further analyses
of the available data as well as the underlying data from occupational studies of inhaled manganese if such data could
be readily obtained. EPA also concluded that it would be desirable in any case to have further dialogue with Ethyl and
other interested parties on issues related to the health effects of manganese before EPA was to make a final decision
concerning Ethyl's waiver application.

As a result of these factors, Ethyl and EPA entered into discussions concerning a possible extension of the deadline
for a decision. Ultimately, an agreement between Ethyl and EPA concerning such an extension was implemented on November
30, 1993, and notice of the agreement was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 9, 1993 (58 FR 64761). The agreement provided for an extension of 180 days in the deadline for final action
by EPA on Ethyl's waiver application for HiTEC 3000.
 EPA was thus required to take final action either granting or denying Ethyl's resubmitted application by May 29, 1994.
For purposes of the resubmitted application, the EPA Administrator determined that Ethyl had demonstrated, as required
by section 211(f)(4), that use of HiTEC 3000 at the specified concentration will not cause or contribute to a failure
of any emission control device or system (over the useful life of any vehicle in which such device or system is used)
to achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emission standards with respect to which it has been certified.
 The Agency stated clearly in the December 9, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice that this determination would not preclude any subsequent regulatory action based on emission effects under
Clean Air Act section 211(c) or any other provision of the Clean Air Act in the event that the resubmitted Ethyl waiver
application were to be granted in the future. The Agency also made it clear that this determination would not apply
in the context of any other new waiver application concerning HiTEC 3000 or MMT which might be submitted in the future
if EPA were to deny Ethyl's resubmitted waiver application on other grounds. Further review of Ethyl's application
during this 180 day period focused in particular on the issues relating to the potential health effects on public health
if EPA were to permit use of MMT as a fuel additive.

Ethyl and EPA both desired and intended to assure continuity 
between the proceedings concerning the July 12, 1991 waiver 
application, as remanded to EPA by the Court of Appeals, and 
Ethyl's resubmitted waiver application. The entire 
administrative record compiled by EPA in support of the original 
denial decision, as well as all submissions to the public docket 
concerning the remanded application, was incorporated in the 
record this final decision on the resubmitted application. The 
docket number for the resubmitted waiver application also 
remained the same. 
The additional 180 days that were provided by Ethyl's 
agreement to resubmit the waiver application were utilized by EPA 
to evaluate remaining issues that may have been relevant to 
today's decision. In particular, EPA continued to examine the 
effects on public health that might be associated with approval 
of Ethyl's application. EPA considered any additional underlying 
data concerning studies of occupational manganese exposure that 
were obtained by or submitted to EPA, as well as any additional 
data or information pertaining to the health effects of manganese 
submitted by Ethyl or other interested persons during the comment 
period. Any additional information that was submitted was also 
considered in exploring alternative candidate RfC estimates and 
their relationship to the verified revised RfC. EPA also used 
the additional time provided by the extension to make a decision 
on how the RfC should be utilized in assessing health effects 
that may be associated with MMT use, evaluate potential exposure 
to manganese compounds associated with MMT use, complete a risk 
assessment concerning Ethyl's application, and decide what 
additional data, if any, should be provided by Ethyl either 
before or after MMT is introduced into the market. 
On April 28, 1994, EPA provided Ethyl Corporation with a 
draft of the revised risk assessment, which updated the 1991 ORD 
assessment and incorporated further analyses performed during the 
180-day extension period. Subsequent to providing Ethyl with 
this draft, Ethyl provided EPA with comments on the draft and 
some additional new data on ambient manganese concentrations in 
several Canadian cities. In order to allow the Agency time to 
consider this new data, Ethyl requested, and the Agency agreed 
to, an extension of the decision deadline until July 13, 1994. 
An agreement implementing this extension was executed by EPA and 
Ethyl counsel on May 24, 1994. 



II. Statutory Framework 



A. History of Statute 


Congress first added section 211(f) to the Clean Air Act in 
1977 based primarily on concerns that fuels or additives might 
damage vehicle emission control devices. Thus, the original 
statute focused on vehicles designed to use unleaded gasoline, 
prohibiting the general use in fuels of materials not 
``substantially similar'' to fuels used to certify vehicles to 
emissions standards. Section 211(f) also provided that the 
Administrator of EPA ``may waive the prohibitions * * * if he 
determines that the applicant has established that such fuel or 
fuel additive * * * will not cause or contribute to a failure of any 
emission control device or system * * * to achieve compliance by the 
vehicle with the emission standards with respect to which it has been certified pursuant to section 206.''
 Additionally, the 
statute provides that if the Administrator does not act to grant 
or deny the waiver request within 180 days of receipt of the 
application, the waiver request shall be treated as granted. 





Section 211(f) was initially interpreted by the Agency as 
applying only to unleaded gasoline. In the 1990 Amendments, 
section 211(f)(1) was broadly expanded to cover all other fuels 
and fuel additives, including leaded gasoline, diesel fuel, and 
consumer additives.
 The 1990 Amendments also apply the 
provisions of this subsection to vehicles other than lightduty 
vehicles. Section 211(f)(1)(B) of the Act makes it unlawful, 
effective November 15, 1990, for any manufacturer of a fuel or 
fuel additive to first introduce into commerce, or to increase 
the concentration in use of, any fuel or fuel additive for use by 
any person in motor vehicles manufactured after model year 1974 
which is not substantially similar to any fuel or fuel additive 
utilized in the certification of any model year 1975, or 
subsequent model year, vehicle or engine under section 206 of the 
Act. Thus, section 211(f)(1)(B) expands to all motor vehicles 
the fuel prohibitions of the original section 211(f)(1) (now 
redesignated as section 211(f)(1)(A)), which apply only to light-
duty vehicles.
 






In adding section 211, the first focus of Congress was to 
prevent the introduction of new additives which may prove harmful 
to emission control devices but to allow for the introduction of 
such additives if it could be demonstrated that they would not 
harm emission control devices. Furthermore, in framing the 
statute such that the Administrator was not required to grant a 
waiver, Congress provided authority to the Administrator to take 
into account other considerations associated with introduction of 
the new material into commerce. 


B. Two Stage Process 


Section 211(f)(4) of the Act provides the legal authority 
for this waiver decision.
 The Agency interprets 
section 211(f)(4) of the Act as establishing a two stage process 
for the decision to grant or deny a waiver application. The 
first stage of the process focuses solely on whether a waiver 
applicant has met its burden to demonstrate that a fuel does not 
cause or contribute to a failure to meet emission standards. The 
second stage of the process reflects the discretionary authority 
provided to the Agency by the statute.

<TEXT>
 

In the first stage of the waiver process, the sole issue is 
whether a fuel ``causes or contributes'' to an emission standard 
failure. The waiver applicant bears the burden of demonstrating 
that a fuel will neither cause nor contribute to an emission 
standard failure for any regulated pollutant. Balancing of the 
emission effects of a fuel for one pollutant against those for 
other pollutant(s) is not permissible under the statutory 
language. For example, an applicant would not meet its burden of 
proof if its testing of a fuel shows that it causes or 
contributes to an emission standard failure for CO, even though 
testing shows decreases in emissions of HC and NOx. If an 
applicant does not meet its burden of demonstrating that the 
``cause or contribute'' test is met, the Agency cannot grant a 
waiver. If an applicant does meet its burden, the Agency may 
then exercise its discretion to grant or to deny a waiver in the 
second stage of the process.
 






The statute provides that the Agency ``may'' grant a waiver 
application if the ``cause or contribute'' test is met, but does 
not require such an action. The Agency may therefore choose not 
to grant a waiver based on other issues (e.g., public health 
effects) that indicate that it would not be in the public 
interest to do so. In this second stage of the process, the 
Agency has a great deal of discretion to determine which issues 
should be examined and to balance the potential positive and 
negative impacts of a waiver. Such discretionary authority is 
grounded not only in Congress' use of the term ``may'' rather than 
the term ``shall'' in section 211(f)(4), but also in the goals and 
purposes of section 211 when read as a whole. The Agency does 
not believe that Congress intended to require EPA to grant a 
waiver under section 211(f)(4) when available information 
indicates that the fuel would be potentially subject to 
regulatory control under section 211(c)(1) immediately upon 
issuance of the waiver. Similarly, EPA believes that Congress 
did not intend to preclude a determination of whether issuance of 
a waiver is consistent with other important goals of the Act once 
it has been demonstrated that the mandatory ``cause or contribute'' 
test has been met. 
This does not mean that the Administrator has unfettered 
discretion to deny a waiver application for any reason. The 
grounds for any denial must not be arbitrary or capricious or 
constitute an abuse of discretion. Thus, in using discretion to 
deny an application, the Administrator must identify and explain 
the factors on which a discretionary denial decision is based and 
must assure that the policy adopted is consistent for all 
similarly situated waiver applicants. 


C. Consideration of Potential Health Effects 


Although the basis for a discretionary denial must be 
rational and non-arbitrary, nothing in the statute limits the 
type of factors which the Administrator may consider in deciding 
whether to deny an application. Section 101(b)(1) states that 
one of the purposes of the Act is to ``protect and enhance the 
quality of the Nation's air resources so as to promote the public 
health and welfare and the productive capacity of its 
population.'' Given this general goal of the Act, certainly the 
potential effects on public health of vehicle emissions would be 
a factor which the Administrator may reasonably consider when 
utilizing the discretion which section 211(f)(4) authorizes. 
Furthermore, under sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e), the 
Administrator must require the manufacturer of a fuel or additive 
to produce data concerning potential health effects as a 
condition of, or a prerequisite to, registration of the fuel or 
additive.
 Under section 211(c)(1), the Administrator may, 
based on data collected under sections 211(b) and 211(e) or 
otherwise available, issue regulations controlling manufacture or 
sale of any fuel or fuel additive which the Administrator finds 
``may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health or 
welfare.'' These provisions indicate that Congress intended that 
the Administrator be concerned about the potential health effects 
of fuels and fuel additives. 






The fact that the Administrator may control fuels or fuel 
additives which pose potential health effects under section 
211(c)(1) does not mean that the Administrator may not consider 
health effects as a factor in deciding whether to grant a waiver 
under section 211(f)(4). Such a construction of the statute 
would lead to absurd results, precluding the Administrator from 
denying a waiver application and leading to potential 
introduction of a fuel or additive into commerce, even in the 
specific circumstances where the Administrator has concluded that 
there are grounds for issuance of a proposed regulation 
prohibiting the fuel or additive under section 211(c). However, 
although this reasoning indicates that Congress could not have 
reasonably intended to completely preclude the consideration of 
health effects under section 211(f)(4), this does not mean that 
section 211(c) limits the circumstances in which the 
Administrator may consider potential health effects as part of a 
waiver decision. Clearly, it was the intention of Congress to 
treat fuels and fuel additives already registered and being sold 
for a particular purpose differently than those which have not 
already been introduced into commerce.

III. Method of Review


A. ``Causes or Contributes'' to Emission Standard Failure


Under section 211(f)(4) of the Act, twenty-three applications for waivers of the section 211(f)(1) prohibitions
have been received. Of these, twenty-two applications have sought a waiver for additives for unleaded gasoline.
One, the most recent, sought a waiver of the section 211(f)(1)(B) prohibitions for an additive to diesel fuel.
 Of these twenty-three applications, ten applications have been granted (some with conditions attached), ten have
been denied, and three were withdrawn by the applicant prior to the Agency's decision.




Section 211(f)(4) clearly places upon the waiver applicant the burden of establishing that its fuel will not cause
or contribute to the failure of any vehicle to meet emission standards. Absent a sufficient showing, the Administrator
cannot make the required determination and cannot grant the waiver. If interpreted literally, however, this burden
of proof imposed by the Act would be virtually impossible for an applicant to meet, as it requires the proof of a negative
proposition: that no vehicle will fail to meet emission standards to which it has been certified. Such a literal interpretation
could be construed as requiring the testing of every vehicle. Recognizing that Congress contemplated a workable
waiver provision, EPA has previously indicated that reliable statistical sampling and fleet testing protocols
may be used to demonstrate that a fuel under consideration would not cause or contribute to a significant failure to
meet emission standards by vehicles in the national fleet.





To determine whether a waiver applicant has established that the proposed fuel will not cause or contribute to vehicles
failing emission standards, EPA reviews all the material in the public docket, including the data submitted with
the application and public comments on the application, and analyzes the data to ascertain the fuel's emission effects.
The analysis concentrates on four major areas of concern_exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions, materials'
compatibility, and driveability_and evaluates the data under statistical methods appropriate to the various types
of emission effects. Emission data are analyzed according to the effects that a fuel is predicted to have on emissions
over time. If the fuel is predicted to have only an instantaneous effect on emissions (that is, the emission effects
of the fuel are immediate and remain constant throughout the life of the vehicle when operating on the waiver fuel),
then ``back-to-back'' emissions testing will suffice.





Unlike materials traditionally allowed in unleaded gasoline, metallics, such as MMT, produce non-gaseous combustion
products, some of which may be deposited in the parts of the vehicle that come in contact with the combustion products
of the burned fuel. These areas of the vehicle include the combustion chamber, the catalyst, the oxygen sensor, and
all parts of the exhaust system.
 Since these materials build up over time,
 it has been traditionally accepted that the emissions effects of such additives occur over time as miles are accumulated,
and that the method of deposition suggests that the effects are permanent. If the fuel is predicted to have such a long-term
deteriorative effect, durability testing over the useful life of the vehicle,
 in addition to back-to-back testing, is appropriate.

<TEXT>
 

In addition to emissions data, EPA also reviews data on fuel composition and specifications, both to fully characterize
a proposed fuel, and to determine whether that fuel would cause or contribute to a failure of vehicles to comply with
their emission standards. Such a failure often can be predicted from characterization data. For example, volatility
specifications of the fuel could demonstrate a tendency for high evaporative emissions. Similarly, data on materials
compatibility could show potential failure of fuel systems, emission related parts, and/or emission control parts
from use of the fuel. Such failures could result in greater emissions. Likewise, fuel characteristics that could
cause significant driveability problems could result in tampering with emission controls and, thus, increased
emissions.
One issue raised previously in the context of Ethyl's present application was whether Ethyl was required to show that
MMT will not cause or contribute to noncompliance with emission standards by vehicles certified to ``future'' emission
standards (i.e., 1994 model year standards, which were not in effect at the time of the waiver application), as well
as vehicles certified to ``current'' standards (i.e., standards in effect at the time of the waiver application).
Ethyl believes that the statute only requires it to establish that MMT will not cause or contribute to the failure of
vehicles to meet current emission standards. For the reasons outlined in the Agency's January 1992 waiver decision,
EPA disagrees with this reading of the statute and continues to believe that it is appropriate to consider the effects
of an additive on vehicles' ability to meet more stringent future standards under circumstances similar to these.
 (See 57 FR 2537-8 January 22, 1992.)




In the past, EPA has analyzed both instantaneous emission effects and durability effects using statistical tests
to determine if the fuel additive will cause a ``significant'' number of vehicles to fail emissions tests.
 Generally speaking, these tests have focused on the portion of the fleet that will actually fail emission standards
as a result of using the fuel or additive.
 Thus, the tests used to date by the Agency primarily consider only the ``cause'' language in the statute and do not consider
the portion of the statute which requires that the applicant must also show that the fuel or additive will not ``contribute''
to the non-compliance of vehicles with emission standards.





The Agency believes that its present statistical tests and criteria do not give adequate weight to the requirement
in Section 211(f)(4) that an applicant demonstrate that a fuel will not ``contribute'' to an emission standard failure.
 This is of particular significance in light of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990, which evidence a strong Congressional
concern that more needs to be done to ensure that people are not exposed to unhealthy levels of airborne pollution.
EPA is presently reviewing alternative criteria and statistical methodologies for determining whether use of a
fuel or fuel additive will ``cause or contribute'' to emission exceedances. The Agency expects to initiate a rulemaking
in the near future which will propose more appropriate criteria and statistical methodologies for reviewing waiver
applications and will afford formal notice to future applicants of the Agency's intention to adopt revised criteria
and methodologies.




As explained below, the Agency has concluded that it would not be appropriate to utilize new criteria and statistical
tests concerning which Ethyl received no prior notice in evaluating Ethyl's application. However, in the event that
Ethyl reapplies in the future for a section 211(f)(4) waiver to allow the use of MMT or any other additive, that application
will be evaluated in accordance with any new fuel waiver criteria in effect at that time.


B. Discretionary Review


As discussed in part II of this decision, above, the Agency believes that the use of the term ``may'' in Section 211(f)(4)
of the Act affords the Administrator broad discretion to consider other factors in deciding whether to grant a waiver,
once a waiver applicant has demonstrated that a fuel or fuel additive will not cause or contribute to an emission standard
failure. This construction of section 211(f)(4) is also consistent with the other provisions of and the general purposes
underlying the Clean Air Act. Although the Administrator has not relied on this discretionary authority to deny a
waiver in the past, certain general principles should guide the Administrator's exercise of such authority.
Although the discretion of the Administrator to consider other factors in making a waiver decision is broad, it is
not unfettered. To assure that any decision based on factors other than emission standard failures is not arbitrary
and is based on a proper record, the applicant and other interested persons should be afforded proper notice of any
additional factors to be considered by the Administrator and an opportunity to comment or submit information concerning
those factors. Any decision based on the discretionary authority of the Administrator to consider other factors
should include an explanation of the factors which were considered and the relation of those factors to the decision.
Moreover, any policy adopted as part of a decision to deny a waiver on a discretionary basis should be applied consistently
to all similarly situated applicants.
Protection of the public health is a major goal of both the Clean Air Act in general and the section 211 fuels provisions
in particular. Accordingly, the Agency believes that when a waiver is sought for a fuel or fuel additive and there are
unresolved concerns regarding the potential impact of that fuel or fuel additive on public health, potential health
effects can and should be examined as part of the waiver process. As part of this examination of the potential health
effects of a fuel or additive, the Agency should review any relevant studies or analyses of which it is aware or which
are brought to its attention by the waiver applicant or by commenters on the waiver application.

In addition to potential health effects, the Agency may 
consider other factors as appropriate in deciding whether it 
would be in the public interest to grant a waiver. In 
particular, the Agency may consider whether a waiver would be 
consistent with the objectives of the Clean Air Act. In each 
instance, the factors considered and relied upon should be 
clearly identified. 


IV. Analysis of Emissions Data 


A. Description of Previous Test Programs 


In support of its request, Ethyl conducted an extensive test 
program to determine the effect of MMT on the ability of vehicles 
to comply with current and future emission standards. It also 
considered the impact of MMT on nonregulated vehicle emissions, 
urban smog or ozone, refinery emissions, and crude oil use. 
Ethyl claimed that its test results established that MMT would 
not cause or contribute to exceedences of current or future 
emission standards. It also claimed that MMT use would result in 
other benefits consistent with Clean Air Act goals. 
In 1988, Ethyl assembled a test fleet of 48 light-duty 
vehicles, composed of eight different model types (six Buick 
Centurys (2.5 liter), six Buick Centurys (2.8 liter), six Buick 
Centurys (3.8 liter), six Chevrolet Cavaliers (2.0 liter), six 
Ford Escorts (1.9 liter), six Ford Tauruses (3.0 liter), six Ford 
Crown Victorias (5.0 liter) and six Dodge Dynastys (3.0 liter)) 
that together represented a broad spectrum of then current (1988) 
technology vehicles. To accumulate mileage, Ethyl utilized the 
``Alternative Mileage Accumulation Cycle'' (AMA) which is a 
standard procedure utilized to accumulate mileage for 
certification purposes.
 It utilized two laboratories to 
measure each vehicle's exhaust emissions of the regulated 
pollutants (HC, oxides of nitrogen (NO

x

) and carbon monoxide 
(CO)) at 5,000-mile intervals up to 75,000 miles in the case of 
most vehicles and up to 100,000 miles in the case of several.
 
It also tested a number of these vehicles for evaporative HC, 
particulate and manganese emissions, materials compatibility, 
driveability and catalyst durability.

Ethyl analyzed the data collected using EPA's previously 
used statistical tests (43 FR 41424, September 18, 1978) and 
additional tests developed by its consultants to further 
characterize the data. Its analysis indicated that, on average, 
MMT at the requested concentration would result in a 0.018 gpm 
increase in HC emissions and decreases in NO

x

 and CO emissions. 
The analyses further indicated that, when EPA's previously used 
tests are applied, the increase in HC emissions would not cause 
or contribute to vehicles' failure to meet the current HC 
emission standard. The results of Ethyl's testing for materials 
compatibility, driveability and catalyst durability also 
indicated that MMT would have no significant adverse effects on 
vehicles' ability to meet current emission standards under 
average driving conditions. On that basis, Ethyl claimed that it 
had made its statutorily required showing. 
Ethyl also submitted data on the catalyst efficiency of the vehicles which it tested. Ethyl performed back-pressure
tests
 on all its vehicle fleet except one model group after accumulation of 75,000 miles. Back-pressure tests were also
performed on a pair of Ford Crown Victorias, one operated on MMT-fuel and one on clear fuel, at speeds higher than those
used in Ethyl's 48-vehicle test program.
 The results of these tests indicated that back-pressure was not significantly different in the MMT vehicles when
compared to the clear fuel vehicles. Ethyl also operated two 5.7 liter Corvettes at extremely high speeds (100 mph)
for 25,000 miles, one using MMT fuel and one using clear fuel. Although similar in magnitude, the back pressure for
the MMT vehicle was slightly higher than that for the clear vehicle. Ethyl also presented catalyst efficiency
 data based on engine-out emissions of its fleet and based on ``slave engine'' testing
 for half of its fleet. Results of the slave engine testing indicated no statistically significant difference between
the catalyst efficiencies for the MMT vehicle components when compared with the clear vehicle components. Finally,
four Chevrolet Corsicas were operated to 100,000 miles, two utilizing MMT fuel and two with clear fuel. The purpose
of this testing was to investigate MMT's effect on the catalyst for a longer mileage interval than the 75,000 miles
over which most of Ethyl's fleet had been driven. Catalyst efficiencies of the MMT vehicles 
were not significantly different when compared to the clear fuel vehicles. 








Ford presented original test data which Ford said supported 
its contention that actual in-use MMT-induced HC emissions 
increases are potentially far greater than those reported by 
Ethyl.
 Ford conducted testing on a more limited scale 
utilizing eight vehicles, representing two model groups, run for 
105,000 miles. Ford chose two model groups which were 
representative of its newest technology vehicles at the time. 
One (the Explorer) represented a technology that Ford believed 
may be especially prone to exhibit a buildup of manganese, due to 
significantly higher operating temperatures and loads than those 
of passenger cars. The other model group, the Escorts, had 
close-coupled catalysts, a design which is being incorporated 
into many new vehicles in order to meet tighter emissions 
standards. Like Ethyl, Ford operated part of its test fleet on 
clear fuel and part on fuel containing 1/32 gpg MMT. However, 
Ford's test program differed from Ethyl's program in several 
ways. When accumulating mileage, Ford utilized a commercial 
gasoline which contained all of the additives (detergents, etc.) 
typically found in such fuels. Ethyl utilized a very high 
quality test fuel with tight specifications and no additives. 
(Although used for actual emissions testing purposes, Ethyl's 
fuel would not be allowed for mileage accumulation when 
certifying vehicles since it is not representative of in-use 
fuel.) When accumulating mileage, Ford utilized what it called 
its ``durability cycle'' which it had previously developed. 
Compared to the AMA cycle used by Ethyl, Ford's driving cycle had 
a higher average speed (54 miles per hour (mph) versus 30 mph), 
and a higher percentage of high speed driving.
 (As 
previously mentioned, Ethyl utilized the AMA cycle used for 
certification purposes.) Additionally, in the Ford program, 
vehicles were tested for emissions at five mileage intervals 
(5,000, 20,000, 55,000, 85,000
 and 105,000 miles) and six 
emissions tests were done at each testing interval. Ethyl, by 
comparison, conducted testing every 5,000 miles to 75,000 miles 
(15 intervals) and utilized two emissions tests at each 
interval.
 Ford's test vehicles showed an elevation of HC 
emissions with MMT that was substantially greater than the 0.018 
gpm reported by Ethyl from its test program.

Toyota also submitted data on a single vehicle which was 
operated for 30,000 miles on MMT-containing fuel after which the 
oxygen sensor and catalyst were replaced with new components and 
then driven on fuel not containing MMT for 30,000 miles. Toyota 
also used a driving cycle with an average speed (41.7 mph) higher 
than that used by Ethyl for mileage accumulation and used fuel 
with what Toyota believed was a relatively high trace level of 
lead than that usually found in unleaded gasoline (0.0045 gpg 
lead) and oil with a relatively high phosphorus level (0.13 
weight percent). Toyota referred to this test procedure as the 
``Toyota 9-Laps'' and presented evidence which it said suggested 
that the catalyst degradation seen by vehicles using the Toyota 
9-Lap test was very similar to in-use catalysts tested by Toyota. 
Hence, Toyota suggested, these ``adjustments'' made in creating the 
Toyota 9-Lap make the testing of a vehicle more consistent with 
what would happen in actual in-use driving. Toyota's data 
indicated an HC level after the first 30,000 miles of vehicle use 
(on MMT fuel) about 0.1 gpm higher than the same vehicle after 
the vehicle was driven for a second 30,000 mile interval with a 
new catalyst and oxygen sensor. Toyota also submitted data 
indicating that the efficiency at which the catalyst was 
operating for the MMT-exposed components was less than that for 
the non-MMT exposed components. 
Some time after EPA's January 8, 1992 denial decision, EPA 
and Ethyl entered into discussions concerning a possible 
settlement of the court case which Ethyl had filed. In the 
context of these discussions, Ethyl submitted to the Agency new 
data it had developed since the denial decision. Ethyl tested 
six 1991 Escorts, using both the relatively high-speed driving 
pattern similar to that utilized by Ford in its testing of 1991 
Escorts (the Ford cycle) and, also, after changing emissions 
system components (catalyst and oxygen sensor), the driving cycle 
used by Ethyl in the original test program (EPA's durability 
certification cycle also known as the AMA). Half of the vehicles 
utilized MMT-containing fuel and half were run on clear fuel 
(fuel not containing MMT). Ethyl also performed some catalyst 
efficiency tests on these vehicles utilizing a ``slave engine.'' 
Ethyl also tested six 1988 Escorts which were used in its 
original test program driven on the AMA cycle. In the new 
program, after replacing the catalyst and oxygen sensor, Ethyl 
continued mileage accumulation, from 75,000 to 100,000 miles, 
utilizing the Ford cycle. Likewise, Ethyl tested six 1988 Buicks 
from its original fleet accumulating mileage (100,000 to 115,000 
miles) using the Ford cycle but without replacing any components. 
Ethyl also accumulated mileage on seven pairs of 1992 vehicles 
(four Crown Victorias, Six Buick Regals and four Ford Mustangs) 
in test programs covering from 45,000 to 100,000 miles beyond 
break-in with and without MMT, using the Ford cycle. 
Based on its inspection and analysis of the new Ethyl data, 
the Agency ultimately concluded that Ethyl's program had 
demonstrated driving cycle does not contribute significantly to 
MMT-induced increases in hydrocarbon emissions. However, in 
addition to addressing the issue of driving cycle, the Ethyl data 
appeared to confirm the finding by Ford that 1991 Escorts 
experienced a much higher MMT-induced HC increase than that 
observed in other models tested (either in Ethyl's 1992 fleet or 
in the original 1988 Ethyl fleet). The Agency was concerned that 
these data could indicate that certain engine and emissions 
control system configurations were more vulnerable to an MMT-induced emissions increase irrespective of driving
cycle. 
To further assist the Agency in developing a test program, 
EPA held a workshop in October of 1992 and presented a proposed 
test program which could address in a timely manner specific 
unresolved issues concerning the effect of MMT on emissions: 
(1) Whether other vehicles utilizing fuels containing MMT are 
likely to experience increases in hydrocarbon emissions similar 
to those observed in 1991 Ford Escorts; and (2) whether fuels 
containing MMT have significant adverse effects on emissions from 
vehicles utilizing the technologies most likely to be employed to 
meet future standards. 
Ultimately the court case was not settled; however, the test 
program presented by the Agency at the workshop was largely 
adopted by Ethyl and is the basis of its most recent test program 
involving the 1993 fleet. These vehicles (with the previously 
mentioned 1992 vehicles) comprise Ethyl's most recent 
dataset.






Ethyl accumulated mileage on three 1992 model year vehicles 
(four Crown Victorias to 100,000 test miles,
 six Buick Regals 
to 65,000 test miles and four Ford Mustangs to 45,000 test miles) 
and six 1993 model year vehicles (six Toyota Camrys to 85,000 
test miles, six Oldsmobile Achievas to 65,000 test miles, six 
Dodge Shadows to 55,000 test miles, six TLEV Ford Escorts to 
85,000 test miles, six Honda Civics to 80,000 test miles and four 
49-state Ford Escorts to 30,000 test miles) with and without MMT. The driving cycles used for these vehicles were an
intermediate 
driving cycle of 45 mph on average for the 1993 model year 
vehicles, an average 55 mph driving cycle (i.e., the Ford Cycle) 
for all mileage accumulation on the 1992 Ford Mustangs and for 
the initial 45,000 miles of operation on the 1992 Crown Victorias 
and Buick Regals and an average driving cycle of 45 mph was 
utilized for these two models thereafter.

B. Comments on Vehicle Emissions Issues 


EPA provided an opportunity for the public to submit written 
comments.
 Many comments were received from a wide variety of 
interests, including refiners, automakers, emission control 
manufacturers, states committees, environmental and public 
interest groups and private citizens. Taken together, the 
comments touched on every aspect of Ethyl's application. The 
following is a summary of the comments. 





Four automakers (Ford Motor Company (Ford), General Motors 
Corporation (GM), Toyota Technical Center, U.S.A., Inc. (Toyota), 
and Chrysler Motors Corporation (Chrysler)), the American 
Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), and the 
Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA) all 
recommended denial of Ethyl's request and expressed several 
concerns with regard to the addition of MMT to unleaded gasoline. 
First, they noted that the use of MMT will cause an increase in 
HC emissions. Most indicated that the more stringent emissions 
standards that began taking effect in model year 1994 will make 
any increase in HC emissions particularly troublesome. Further, 
they stated that newer technology vehicles will likely be 
equipped with catalysts which are nearer the engine (more 
``closely coupled'') and that such close coupling, they stated, 
results in higher catalyst temperatures that may make the 
catalyst more prone to the deposition of manganese. These 
commenters indicated that deposition of manganese compounds on 
the surface of the catalyst would impair the catalytic breakdown 
of emissions from the engine, thereby decreasing catalyst 
effectiveness. Additionally, they were concerned that MMT, even 
at the 1/32 gpg Mn concentration requested, would plug catalysts 
and thus reduce the surface area of the catalyst available to 
break down emissions from the engine, especially in the case of 
vehicles operated under driving conditions which result in higher 
temperatures such as heavy load or high speed. Under such 
conditions, it was pointed out, the vehicle may be more prone to 
deposition of manganese. 

Ethyl indicated that the assertions that it must 
``conclusively'' demonstrate the absence of negative effects is not 
required by the section 211(f)(4) standard. Ethyl believes that 
it need only demonstrate, by a preponderance of evidence, that 
the additive will not cause or contribute to the failure of 
emission control devices to comply with applicable emission 
standards, and, further, it believes that it has made this 
showing. Ethyl also stated that the EPA test program proposed at 
its October 1992 workshop involving the accumulation of 65,000 
test miles, would be sufficient for purposes of gauging the 
effect of MMT on emissions. Ethyl commented that it followed 
this proposal in the 1992/93 test fleet, although mileage 
accumulation has continued beyond 65,000 miles for three of the 
eight model year vehicles tested without new emission results 
different from the trends established through 65,000 miles. 
With respect to the automakers' concerns about effect of MMT 
on newer emission technology such as close-coupled catalysts, 
Ethyl indicated that the use of the 1993 Transitional Low 
Emission Vehicle (TLEV) Honda Civic in its most recent test 
program was intended so as to introduce a vehicle which has the 
most physically possible close-coupled emission technology (i.e., 
one connected directly to the exhaust manifold). Despite such 
close-coupling, Ethyl indicated that the differences in 
hydrocarbon emissions between clear and MMT-fueled 1993 TLEV 
Honda Civics was minimal. Ethyl also indicated that this concern 
about close-coupled catalysts completely ignores that Ethyl 
tested two 1988 models and three 1993 models equipped with close- 
coupled catalysts without showing any significant adverse effects 
on emissions. 
Toyota submitted data on catalysts and oxygen sensors from 
in-use customer vehicles from Canada where MMT is used as a fuel 
additive. Toyota believes that these catalysts and oxygen 
sensors indicate that exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons and 
carbon monoxide are higher from catalysts/oxygen systems 
collected in Canada than comparable catalyst/oxygen systems from 
U.S. vehicles. Also Toyota submitted photographs of a catalyst 
taken from a high mileage Canadian Hilux pickup truck which 
showed plugging of the catalyst passages. 
Ethyl's response to Toyota's catalyst/oxygen system data is 
that it is not clear from the description of the Toyota test 
results precisely what can be concluded from the test program. 
Ethyl stated that, without a detailed vehicle history, there is 
no basis to conclude that MMT had an effect on the 
catalyst/oxygen system data.

Chrysler submitted data on the analysis of four catalysts, which was completed by Johnson Matthey Incorporated (JMI)
at Chrysler's request, that had various degrees of manganese deposition from Canadian vehicles exposed to MMT in
the fuel. It indicated that the results of the analysis demonstrate that the washcoat of both the partially plugged
catalysts and unaffected catalysts exhibit a clear layer of ``densified'' washcoat containing large quantities
of manganese oxides. Chrysler believes that the JMI report supports its concern that manganese oxides can fill the
catalyst pores, thereby covering precious metal sites or decreasing wash coat surface area, consequently eventually
decreasing catalyst activity. Regarding the automakers' concerns about the Additive's effect on emissions system
components, such as exhaust oxygen sensors, exhaust gas recirculation valves, catalysts and oxygen sensors, Ethyl
stated that it has already provided extensive data showing that the Additive does not adversely effect any of these
emission system components.
 (Ethyl's test programs are discussed in the previous section.) 





Nineteen small refiners including the National Petroleum Refiners Association all recommended approval. They
concurred in Ethyl's assessment of the economic benefits and reduced refinery and vehicle emissions that would accrue
from the replacement of octane obtained through higher-severity refining with octane obtained from MMT. Several
emphasized that MMT would be especially helpful to small refiners since octane enhancement from MMT requires less
capital investment than other means of increasing octane. Many refiners also pointed out that refinery operations
at lower severity would result in decreased aromatic and benzene emissions from vehicles and increased yield for
each barrel of crude oil refined. 



C. Available Data Meet Previously Used Criteria 



The criteria and statistical tests previously used by EPA to examine durability waiver applications were used only
once by the Agency prior to Ethyl's 1990 application for the use of MMT.
 These tests include a variety of approaches to durability data designed to determine whether the additive causes
increases in regulated pollutants and, if so, whether those increases bring about failure of vehicles in the fleet
to meet the standards to which they were certified. While EPA has some concerns regarding the appropriateness of these
criteria and tests for current conditions, the Agency does not intend in this action to hold Ethyl to any new criteria
and/or tests that are not currently in place. Accordingly, the following discussion is addressed primarily to the
results of applying the most critical of the previously used EPA tests.








The earliest set of test results under consideration here (tests of 1988 vehicles submitted with Ethyl's 1990 application)
exhibit the most pronounced MMT-caused emissions increases of the data generated by the applicant (about 0.02 gm/mi
, but these increases fall substantially short of failure on the determinative ``cause or contribute'' test
 (3 of 8 vehicle models tested fail for HC and 4 of 8 models fail for CO, while 7 of the 8 models tested are required to fail
before the additive fails this overall test on either pollutant).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940817-2-00069 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940817-2-00043 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

When the larger body of all available and appropriate
 long-term emissions data on High-Tech 3000 is evaluated using these previously used EPA tests, the conclusion is
that these increases (averaging 0.02 gm/mi for HC) bring about failure of the ``cause or contribute'' test in only
4 (for HC) or 5 (for CO) of the 19 model groups tested by the applicant and others. Failure of that test
 must occur in at least 13 of the 19 model groups examined before the additive is deemed to have failed the overall test
with 90% confidence. Fourteen of 19 must fail before the test is failed at the 95% confidence level.








If the newer technology 1992 and 1993 vehicles tested by the applicant are examined in isolation from the earlier test
programs, the data (with an average HC effect of 0.002 gm/mi) pass the historical tests even more easily than is the
case for the data combinations examined above. None of the nine models failed the ``cause or contribute'' test for
hydrocarbons and only one failed for carbon monoxide. Seven of nine models would have to fail for the additive to fail
the overall sign test at the 90 percent confidence level and eight would have to fail for 95 percent confidence. The
overall conclusion from the above analysis, then, is that Ethyl's additive passes the most critical of the historical
tests with a comfortable margin. 

D. Data on Newer-Technology Vehicles Meet More Stringent Criteria 

Notwithstanding the Agency's conclusion that it would not be appropriate to require Ethyl to satisfy new statistical
tests concerning which it has not been given prior notice and the Agency's decision to evaluate Ethyl's application
primarily according to the previously utilized statistical tests, the Agency nevertheless considers its existing
tests and the criteria that they implement to be obsolete under current conditions.






Therefore, EPA has gone beyond the historical tests to examine Ethyl's data on the use of the additive with newer technology
vehicles under more stringent criteria of the sort that seem to be warranted by current conditions. For this analysis,
EPA chose to examine the additive's performance against the most stringent of the possible criteria_a requirement
that the additive cause no statistically significant increase in emissions. If one uses a one-sided null hypothesis
that the additive causes no increase in HC emissions, one may employ various statistical tests to examine the credibility
of that hypothesis in light of the test results. One such test is the computer-intensive ``permutation test'' in a
form called an ``approximate randomization'' test.
 Application of this test to the full mileage range of HC emissions data from Ethyl's tests of 1992 and 1993 vehicles
results in a failure to discern any ``real'' emissions increase at all_that is, no increase that we may not reasonably
attribute to sampling error rather than to an additive effect on HC in the sampled vehicle population.







E. Finding 

Based on all of the information then available concerning the potential effect of use of MMT in unleaded gasoline on
regulated emissions, as submitted by Ethyl and others, the Administrator of EPA determined on November 30, 1994 that,
``Ethyl has satisfied its burden under Clean Air Act 211(f)(4) to establish that use of HiTEC 3000 at the specified
concentration will not cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system (over the useful life
of any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emission standards
with respect to which it has been certified.'' The basis for this determination was described briefly in the Administrator's
November 30, 1994 notice, and has been reviewed in detail above. 
The November 30, 1994 determination was specific to Ethyl's present waiver application. As the Administrator made
clear in the notice announcing the determination, it does not apply to any new application concerning either HiTEC
3000 or MMT in the event that this decision to deny Ethyl's application on the basis of concerns regarding potential
health effects is upheld in any subsequent judicial review. Although Ethyl may be able to sustain its burden under
Section 211(f)(4) in the context of any future waiver application, any such application must include satisfactory
data addressing the effect on vehicles in production at that time and will be evaluated according to the statistical
methods and criteria for evaluation of waiver applications in effect at that time.

V. The Onboard Diagnostics Issue 


Prior to the Administrator's November 30, 1994 finding 
concerning emission effects, three auto manufacturers, Ford, 
General Motors (GM), and Chrysler, and the American Automobile 
Manufacturers Association (AAMA), all commented on concerns about 
the impact of the oxidative products of MMT on onboard diagnostic 
(OBD II) systems employing before-catalyst and after-catalyst 
oxygen sensors.





GM concerns regarding the OBD II system were two-fold. Its 
first concern was that since it is known that manganese oxide has 
the ability to store oxygen, a potential problem could occur with 
dual oxygen sensor systems. GM stated that, with manganese oxide 
covering the catalyst and the oxygen sensors, a false oxygen 
storage capacity of the catalyst could be indicated by the OBD II 
system, which could then indicate that the catalyst was still 
working properly while the opposite could be true. GM's second 
concern was that the catalyst would act as a ``filter'' and 
manganese oxide from MMT combustion passing through the exhaust 
system would coat the before-catalyst oxygen sensor and after-catalyst oxygen sensors unevenly, thus causing the
OBD II system 
to malfunction. GM also stated that in the 1994 model year GM 
planned to market two engine families equipped with OBD II 
systems employing before- and after-catalyst oxygen sensors. 
With respect to the automakers' concern that use of MMT 
would adversely affect operation of the OBD II system, on July 
15, 1993, Ethyl submitted data which it believed demonstrated 
that this concern has no basis.
 Ethyl stated that no 
production vehicles were then equipped with OBD-II systems and 
that the primary hardware approach being considered by the 
automobile manufacturers involves the use of exhaust gas oxygen 
(EGO) sensors before and after the catalytic converter to monitor 
converter efficiency. Ethyl further commented that test data 
generated by Ethyl showed that use of the additive would have no 
adverse effect on either the hardware component of these planned 
ODB-II systems (i.e., the oxygen sensors), or on the catalytic 
converter itself. Ethyl noted that, ``[s]ince these future 
systems are currently under development, it is impossible to 
consider the long term effects of MMT on these systems.'' 




On November 4, 1994, only 26 days prior to the mandatory 
date for a decision on Ethyl's waiver application, Ford Motor 
Company submitted a report describing bench testing
 of 
catalysts, in which Ford measured the oxygen storage capacity of 
catalysts which had been deliberately degraded and then exposed 
to the emissions from MMT-containing fuel. Ford's conclusion 
based on these tests was that the exhaust gas oxygen (EGO) 
sensors would be affected by the deposition of manganese oxides 
associated with MMT use, thus sending incorrect signals to the 
diagnostic control system in the vehicle. 





Although the Agency regarded the concerns expressed by 
Ford in its November 4, 1994 submission regarding the effect of 
MMT use on OBD systems as potentially very important, based on 
the very limited analysis which could be undertaken prior to the 
November 30, 1994 deadline for a decision concerning Ethyl's 
application, the Agency concluded that the limited bench testing 
submitted by Ford did not allow a conclusion concerning the 
likelihood that a significant impact would actually occur during 
vehicle operation. In addition, the Agency had several questions 
regarding the procedures involved in the Ford testing which could 
not be resolved within the available time. The November 30, 1994 
notice announcing the Administrator's determination concerning 
emission effects made it clear that EPA was concerned about this 
issue and would retain the authority to take appropriate action 
in the future pursuant to Clean Air Act Section 211(c). 
EPA met with staff of Ford in February of 1994 in order to 
discuss Ford's concerns raised in its November 4, 1993 
submission. Ford generally expressed the same concerns as had 
been expressed by GM (and discussed above).
 According to 
Ford, its testing showed that combustion of gasoline containing 
MMT deposits a layer of manganese oxide on top of the catalyst 
washcoat and that this causes the EGO Sensor to measure a lower 
oxygen level, thereby indicating a higher oxygen storage capacity 
than that which would be indicated by the catalyst without MMT. 
As a result, a malfunctioning catalyst might not be detected. 
Ford expressed particular concern because it had just introduced 
three 1994 model year vehicle families employing OBD-II, whereas 
the other automakers will not have systems out until the 1996 
model year. 




Recently, on May 3, 1993, Ford submitted additional 
information which the Agency is currently reviewing. This new 
information appears to provide further evidence to substantiate 
the concerns expressed by Ford regarding the impact of MMT use on 
OBD systems. Unlike the previously submitted Ford data, the new 
data address an actual production vehicle fitted with a failed 
catalyst and the effect use of MMT had on the OBD system's 
ability to detect failure of the catalyst.

The Agency is continuing to investigate the question of the 
potential impact of use of MMT in unleaded gasoline on OBD 
systems. If after further investigation EPA concludes that the 
concerns expressed by the vehicle manufacturers are warranted,

VI. Manganese Health Assessment





A. Introduction 


In 1990, the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) assessed the potential health risks associated with the
use of 
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) as an additive 
in unleaded gasoline (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
1990).
 Later, ORD (Preuss, 1991) reaffirmed its assessment 
after considering a resubmitted waiver application for MMT from 
Ethyl Corporation. As identified in earlier ORD evaluations 
(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1990; Preuss, 1991), a key 
issue is the potential health risk associated with inhalation 
exposure to manganese tetroxide (Mn

3

O

4

), which is the primary by-product resulting from the combustion of MMT in gasoline. New 
information on manganese (Mn) health effects and exposure is 
incorporated in this revised risk assessment. (United States 
Environmental Protection Agency, 1994b) 




This reevaluation has four components: (1) a health effects 
assessment, (2) an exposure assessment, (3) a risk 
characterization relating the first two, and (4) a summary and 
conclusions. This evaluation summarizes earlier ORD assessments 
and incorporates information from certain other major new reports 
and analyses.

B. Health Effects Assessment 



1. Background 



The toxicity of Mn varies according to the route of 
exposure. By ingestion, Mn has relatively low toxicity at 
typical exposure levels due in part to a low rate of absorption 
from the gastrointestinal tract and in part to efficient 
regulation by homeostatic mechanisms. Manganese is considered a 
nutritionally essential trace element and is required for certain 
enzymes important for normal functioning of the central nervous 
system and other body organs. However, by inhalation, Mn has 
been known since the early 1800s to be toxic to workers. It 
should be noted that Mn occupational studies predominantly (and 
sometimes exclusively) involve men. Neurobehavioral, 
respiratory, and reproductive effects are the primary features of 
excessive occupational exposure to Mn. Manganism is 
characterized by various psychiatric and movement disorders, with 
some general resemblance to Parkinson's disease in terms of 
difficulties in the fine control of some movements, lack of 
facial expression, and involvement of underlying neuroanatomical 
and neurochemical factors. Neurobehavioral effects of Mn 
intoxication are generally more clinically prominent than 
respiratory or reproductive effects. However, respiratory 
effects (e.g., pneumonitis) and reproductive dysfunction (e.g., 
reduced libido) are also frequently reported features of 
occupational Mn intoxication. The available evidence is 
inadequate to determine whether or not Mn is carcinogenic; some 
reports suggest that it may even be protective against cancer. 
Based on this mixed but insufficient evidence, EPA has placed Mn 
in a Group D weight-of-evidence category, which signifies that it 
is not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. Given these 
features of Mn toxicity, the health assessment focuses on the 
potential for chronic noncancer effects. 

Various epidemiological studies of male workers exposed to 
Mn at average levels below the current American Conference of 
Governmental Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Value (TLV) (5 
mg/m



 have shown neurobehavioral, reproductive, and 
respiratory effects, both by objective testing methods and by 
workers' self-reported symptoms on questionnaires. 
Neurobehavioral effects generally have reflected disturbances in 
the control of hand movements (e.g., tremor, reduced hand 
steadiness) and/or the speed of movement (e.g., longer reaction 
time, slower finger-tapping speed). Reproductive effects have 
included a decrease in the number of children born to Mn-exposed 
workers (compared to matched controls) and various self-reported 
symptoms of sexual dysfunction. In recent studies at low to 
moderate occupational exposure levels, respiratory effects have 
been reflected primarily in self-reported symptoms of respiratory 
tract illnesses rather than in differences between objective 
pulmonary function measurements in Mn-exposed and control 
workers. However, the lack of studies using more sensitive 
investigational methods and the existence of some limited 
evidence from an epidemiological study of school children raise a 
degree of concern about pulmonary function effects in relation to 
lower level Mn exposure. 





The precise mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity are not well 
understood, but it appears that Mn can affect several different 
aspects of central nervous system (CNS) function and structure. 
Some experimental evidence suggests that the mechanisms of Mn 
toxicity may depend on the oxidation state of Mn. However, both 
the trivalent form (Mn

3+

) and the divalent form (Mn

2+

) have been 
demonstrated to be neurotoxic.
 Also, both forms of Mn can 
cross the blood-brain barrier, although research suggests that 
Mn

3+

 is predominantly transported bound to the protein 
transferrin (Aschner and Gannon, 1994), whereas Mn

2+

 may enter 
the brain independently of such a transport mechanism (Murphy et 
al., 1991). Unlike ingested Mn, inhaled Mn is transported 
directly from the respiratory system to the vicinity of the brain 
before its first pass by the liver. Depending on the form of Mn 
inhaled, its conversion to other oxidation states (e.g., 
oxidation of Mn

2+

 to Mn

3+

 or reduction of Mn

4+

 to Mn

3+

), and its 
ability to enter the brain (through a protein transport mechanism 
or otherwise), it is quite possible that a significant fraction 
of even small amounts of inhaled Mn would be able to reach target 
sites in the CNS. Thus, the apparently greater toxicity of 
inhaled versus ingested Mn may reflect important pharmacodynamic 
and pharmacokinetic differences of Mn that enters the body by 
different routes. A more definitive understanding of these 
issues will require more empirical information. 





2. Earlier Assessments 



Earlier ORD health assessments have been based on the RfC, 
which is defined as an estimate (with uncertainty spanning about 
an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure level 
for the human population (including sensitive subpopulations) 
that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious 
noncancer effects during a lifetime. The basic procedure for 
derivation of an RfC entails identifying a no-observed-adverse- 
effect level (NOAEL) and a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level 
(LOAEL) from a ``principal'' study, generally defined as the 
available study that best defines the highest NOAEL or lowest 
LOAEL for the most sensitive endpoint affected by a chemical. 
When an investigation of occupationally exposed humans is the 
principal study (as in the case of the Mn RfC), the NOAEL or 
LOAEL is adjusted for differences in ventilation rates and 
exposure durations between the occupational exposure scenario 
(10 m3 air breathed per 8-h workday, 5 days/week) and the 
``general public'' scenario (20 m3 air breathed per 24-h day, 
7 days/week). The adjusted NOAEL or LOAEL is then divided by 
uncertainty factors and a modifying factor. In the case of the 
original (1990) RfC for Mn, uncertainty factors of 10 each were 
used for extrapolating from a healthy worker population to the 
general population (including sensitive subpopulations) and for 
extrapolating from a LOAEL to a NOAEL. Also, an uncertainty 
factor of 3 (approximately one-half of 10 on a log scale) was 
used for extrapolating from subchronic to chronic exposure. A 
modifying factor of 3 was used because of statements by the 
authors of the principal study (Roels et al., 1987) that past 
exposure levels of workers in the subject study were probably 
lower than those measured at the time the study was conducted. 
The resulting RfC of 0.4 

m

g Mn/m3 was used for the earlier ORD 
risk assessment (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1990) and 
was entered on EPA's IRIS computer database of human health risk 
and regulatory information in December 1990.

3. 1993 Revised RfC 



The original RfC for Mn was revised, in part, because newer 
information supplied in conjunction with the resubmittal of the 
MMT waiver application by Ethyl indicated that the workers' 
exposure levels in the principal study had probably not increased 
over time, and thus the modifying factor could be ``eliminated'' 
(i.e., set equal to 1). Another reason for revising the original 
RfC was that more recent studies (Roels et al., 1992; Mergler et 
al., 1994) provided additional evidence of health effects in 
workers at relatively low airborne concentrations of Mn. 

Independently of their earlier study of Mn-exposed workers (Roels et al., 1987), Roels et al. (1992) conducted a cross-sectional
study of neurobehavioral and other endpoints in another group of workers from a different factory-namely, 92 male
alkaline-battery plant workers exposed to manganese dioxide (MnO

2

) dust_who were compared to a matched control group of 101 male workers without industrial Mn exposure. The geometric
mean 
occupational-lifetime integrated respirable dust concentration 
was 793 

m

g Mn/m3  x  years (range: 40 to 4,433). The equivalent 
value for total dust was 3,505 

m

g Mn/m3  x  years (range: 191 to 
27,465). The authors noted that the monitored concentrations 
were representative of the usual exposures of the workers because 
work practices had not changed during the last 15 years of the 
plant's operation. No data on particle size or chemical purity 
were provided in the report by Roels et al. (1992), but based on 
information provided by Roels et al. (1992) and Roels (1993), the 
median cut point for the respirable dust fraction was 5 

m

m 
aerodynamic diameter. The respirable fraction is more 
representative of the toxicologically significant particles 
(i.e., the smaller particles that are inhaled and deposit 
predominantly in the lower respiratory tract). Total dust 
measurements comprised the respirable dust as well as larger 
particles that deposit predominantly in the nose and throat 
region (via nasal breathing) and would be cleared more rapidly 
from the respiratory tract than the smaller particles retained in 
the lower regions. Therefore, the respirable dust measurements 
were considered to be a more accurate indicator of exposure in 
relation to the observed health effects. 

Manganese-exposed workers in the 1992 study by Roels et al. 
performed significantly worse than matched controls on several 
measures of neurobehavioral function, particularly visual 
reaction time, eye-hand coordination, and hand steadiness. 
Similar neurobehavioral impairments were also found in the 
earlier study by Roels et al. (1987) of a different occupational 
population exposed to mixed Mn oxides and salts at approximately 
the same levels of total dust (respirable dust was not measured). 
In addition, a recent study in Canada by Mergler et al. (1994) 
indicated that, among other effects, performance on tests of the 
ability to make rapid alternating hand movements, to maintain 
hand steadiness, and to perform other aspects of fine motor 
control was significantly worse, compared to matched controls, in 
workers who were exposed to even lower concentrations of 
respirable dust (35 

m

g Mn/m3 at the time of the study). If 
Mergler et al. had included information on integrated past 
exposure levels (which they have since provided to ORD in a 
preliminary form not yet submitted for publication), their study 
would have provided a fivefold lower LOAEL for the derivation of 
the RfC. In addition, reports of a Swedish study of Mn-exposed 
steel workers (Iregren, 1990; Wennberg et al., 1991, 1992) 
provided compelling evidence of comparable neurobehavioral 
impairments, including slower reaction time and finger-tapping 
speed. The median total dust concentration in the Swedish study 
was 140 

m

g Mn/m3, with respirable dust reported as constituting 
20 to 80% of individual workers' total dust exposures. Thus, the 
LOAEL from this study would be somewhat lower than that from 
Roels et al. (1992), but the less fully characterized exposure 
histories in the Swedish study made it more appropriate as a 
supporting (rather than principal) study for deriving the Mn RfC. 

Taken together, the above epidemiological studies provide a 
consistent pattern of evidence indicating that neurotoxicity is 
associated with low-level occupational Mn exposure. The fact 
that speed and coordination of motor function are especially 
impaired is particularly noteworthy, given its consistency with 
other epidemiological, clinical, and experimental animal evidence 
of higher concentration Mn intoxication. 

Differences among these studies in the duration of workers' 
exposure to Mn raise another issue of relevance to this 
discussion. In the Roels et al. (1992) study, the mean period of 
exposure was 5.3 years (range: 0.2 to 17.7 years). In the other 
studies, the mean durations of exposure were longer: 7.1 years 
in Roels et al. (1987), 9.9 years in Iregren (1990), and 16.7 
years in Mergler et al. (1994). The indications of lower LOAELs 
in the Canadian and Swedish studies suggest that neurobehavioral 
effects might occur at lower concentrations of Mn if the exposure 
periods were longer. In addition, the age of the workers may be 
an important factor in interpreting these findings. The oldest 
worker in the Roels et al. (1992) study was less than 50 years 
old; also, the average age in that study was only 31.3 years, 
versus 34.3 years in Roels et al. (1987), 43.4 years in Mergler 
et al. (1994), and 46.4 years in Iregren (1990). These points 
suggest that longer exposure and/or testing later in life might 
result in the detection of effects at lower concentrations than 
is possible after shorter periods of exposure and/or in younger 
workers. On the other hand, it is also evident from these 
studies that a much shorter period than a full lifetime of 
occupational Mn exposure may be sufficient to induce Mn 
neurotoxicity.

As Roels et al. (1992) and other investigators have noted, a threshold for the neurotoxic effects of Mn has not been
reported in the epidemiological literature. Therefore, instead of a NOAEL, a LOAEL was obtained from the study by
Roels et al. (1992) by dividing the geometric mean integrated respirable dust concentration (793  u g Mn/m

3

  x  years) by the average period of 
worker exposure (5.3 years) to eliminate time (in years) from the time-weighted average, thereby yielding a LOAEL
of 150  u g Mn/m

3

. 
(The geometric mean concentration was used to represent the average exposure because the workers' exposure measurements
were log-normally distributed, and the arithmetic mean exposure period was used because it was the only value reported
by Roels et al. (1992).) The workplace-based LOAEL of 150  u g Mn/m

3

 was then adjusted for nonoccupational lifetime exposure by multiplying it by (1) the quotient of 10 m

3

/day divided by 20 m

3

/day (for worker versus nonworker ventilation rates) and (2) the quotient of 5 days divided by 7 days (for work week
versus full week). The 
resulting adjusted LOAEL, labeled the human equivalent concentration (HEC), was 50  u g Mn/m

3

, which was then divided by a total uncertainty factor of 1,000 to yield an RfC of 0.05  u g/m

3

. 
The total uncertainty factor of 1,000 incorporated the following 
factors: 10 to protect sensitive individuals; 10 for using a 
LOAEL in lieu of a NOAEL; and a composite factor of 10 for 
database limitations reflecting the less-than-chronic periods of 
exposure and the lack of reproductive and developmental toxicity 
data, as well as potential but unquantified differences in the 
toxicity of different forms of Mn. A modifying factor was not 
used (i.e., it was set equal to 1). 
Each RfC is assigned an overall rating of low, medium, or 
high confidence level, based on two subsidiary confidence ratings 
reflecting the quality of the evidence from the principal studies 
and the quality of the overall database for the chemical in 
question, respectively. The revised Mn RfC was assigned a medium 
level of confidence. The evidence for the neurobehavioral 
effects of low-level Mn exposure by inhalation was compelling and 
consistent across several well-conducted studies. However, the 
limited duration of exposure and the lack of a NOAEL for 
neurotoxicity in any of the principal or supporting studies 
prevented assigning a confidence level greater than medium. 
Also, the lack of definitive data on the concentration-response 
relationship and on the potential reproductive and developmental 
toxicity of inhaled Mn limited the degree of confidence in the 
database to a medium rating. Virtually all of the human health 
evidence is based on healthy, adult male workers. No known 
studies have investigated human female reproductive function, and 
even though male worker reproductive function is known to be 
affected by Mn exposure, it has not received adequate 
investigation. The limited available information concerning the 
developmental toxicity of inhaled Mn suggests the possibility 
that prenatal exposure of laboratory rodents to MnO

2

 (via the air 
supplied to the pregnant mother) may depress neurobehavioral 
activity in neonatal rats and that continued postnatal exposure 
of the pups may intensify this depression. In addition, several 
studies have demonstrated alterations in neurochemical (dopamine) 
levels in young mice and rats exposed during early postnatal 
development to Mn via other routes. Thus, the potential for 
developmental toxicity due to Mn exposure exists. The 
concentrations and durations of exposure sufficient to induce 
such effects are not known. Although adequate epidemiological 
studies of children and the elderly have not been conducted, it 
is known that certain populations, such as children, pregnant 
women, elderly persons, iron- or calcium-deficient individuals, 
and individuals with liver impairment, may have an increased 
potential for excessive Mn body burdens due to increased 
absorption or altered clearance mechanisms. 
Another concern raised by the lack of studies involving 
longer periods of exposure and/or older subjects is that the 
compensatory or reserve capacity of certain neurological 
mechanisms may be stressed by Mn exposure earlier in life, with 
manifestations of impairments only becoming evident much later, 
perhaps at a geriatric stage. One reason for the latter concern 
is that Parkinson's disease is typically a geriatric disease in 
which symptoms are only seen when the loss of brain cells that 
produce dopamine (which is also apparently involved in Mn 
toxicity) reaches 80% or more. Indeed, some neurologists think 
that a long latency period of perhaps several decades may precede 
various parkinsonian syndromes. These points lead to a concern 
that if Mn reduces the compensatory or reserve capacity of the 
nervous system, parkinsonian-type effects might occur earlier in 
life than they would otherwise. Thus, several questions remain 
to be answered before higher confidence in the accuracy of the 
RfC can be achieved. 
The two studies of Roels et al. (1992, 1987) were considered coprincipal studies for the derivation of the revised
RfC, with supporting evidence in the reports of Mergler et al. (1994), Iregren (1990), and Wennberg et al. (1991, 1992).
Given the fact that these studies involved exposure to various oxides and salts of Mn, the RfC is designated as applying
to Mn and Mn compounds 
(including Mn

3

O

4

). The previous RfC of 0.4  u g Mn/m

3

 applied to Mn only, due to undifferentiated forms of Mn in the principal 
study. Given that different forms of metals may have different toxic properties (due to different oxidation states,
different solubilities, and possibly other factors), it is likely that different compounds of Mn vary in toxicity.
However, sufficient data on the comparative toxicity of various compounds of Mn are not available to judge the relative
toxicity of Mn

3

O

4

 specifically.

As noted above, Mn affects multiple organ systems, including 
the respiratory and reproductive systems as well as the CNS. 
However, because the only available evidence suggests that the 
CNS is the most sensitive target for Mn toxicity, neurobehavioral 
endpoints were the focus of the RfC derivation. Although other 
types of effects remain a concern, it is presumed, based on the 
limited data now available, that protecting against neurotoxicity 
provides protection against these other, apparently less 
sensitive endpoints. 
In revising the RfC for Mn, a draft version was subjected to 
peer review by external experts (from academic and non-EPA 
governmental institutions) as well as internal experts. 
Following this peer review, a further-revised version was 
submitted to and verified by an EPA-wide RfD/RfC work group in 
September 1993. The current RfC for Mn was made available 
through IRIS in early November 1993 through two mechanisms. A 
special notice beginning November 1 in the news section of EPA's 
internal IRIS2 database announced the availability of a hard copy 
of the text to EPA requesters who contacted the Risk Information 
Hotline; also, the text was obtainable through the National 
Library of Medicine's publicly accessible on-line computer 
database, TOXNET, beginning November 10, 1993. It also became 
available on line via the EPA IRIS database beginning December 1, 
1993.





4. Alternative Approaches to Deriving RfCs 


After the revised RfC for Mn became available to the public, 
Ethyl Corporation and other interested parties submitted comments 
on the RfC and issues related to it. One of the primary comments 
concerned the availability of various statistical techniques for 
deriving a NOAEL from the study by Roels et al. (1992) and/or 
from supplementary data for that study provided to ORD by Roels 
(1993). In response to Ethyl Corporation's request that EPA 
consider alternative approaches to analyzing these data and 
deriving an RfC for Mn, further analyses of the subject data were 
undertaken using a variety of statistical methods. These 
approaches may be identified as (1) conventional NOAEL- or LOAEL- 
based analyses, (2) ``no statistical significance of trend'' 
(NOSTASOT) analyses of the type described by Tukey et al. (1985), 
(3) benchmark dose analyses of the type described by Crump 
(1984), and (4) Bayesian analyses of the type described by 
Jarabek and Hasselblad (1991). These analyses and their 
results
 yield several possible RfC estimates, so designated 
because the current and only verified RfC for Mn is that which 
has been verified by the EPA-wide RfD/RfC work group and entered 
on IRIS. It must be emphasized that the RfC estimates developed 
for the purpose of this risk assessment do not represent a 
revision of the current verified RfC for Mn. Reexamination of 
the current Mn RfC, and any decision to revise or reaffirm the 
current RfC, will be under the purview of the EPA-wide RfD/RfC 
work group at some future date. 




A fundamental issue pertaining to all of the approaches 
presented here is the selection of a measure of exposure. Roels 
et al. (1992) described two measures of respirable dust, the 
occupational lifetime respirable dust concentration (LIRD), 
expressed as  u g/m

3

 x years, and the current concentration of 
respirable dust (CRD), expressed as  u g/m

3

. The CRD concentration 
was measured at the time the study was conducted by Roels et al. 
and refers to a representative concentration measured for the 
type of job performed by a worker (e.g., electrician, maintenance 
worker). The LIRD value for each worker was a cumulative 
exposure measure derived by adding the CRD values over the 
worker's entire period of employment. If a worker changed jobs 
within the plant during his period of employment, the CRD for 
each job held was multiplied by the number of years the worker 
performed that job. Thus, if more than one job classification 
was worked, the worker's LIRD was the sum of the products of CRD 
multiplied by years of performance of the respective jobs. 
However, if a worker held only one job classification, his LIRD 
was simply equal to his CRD multiplied by the number of years 
employed. Another measure of exposure may be derived from LIRD 
by dividing an individual worker's LIRD value by his total number 
of years of employment. The latter measure, designated as the 
average concentration of respirable dust (ACRD), reflects a 
worker's time-weighted cumulative exposure level but removes 
years from the unit of measurement of LIRD and is expressed as 
 u g/m

3

. Although Roels et al. (1992) did not refer to ACRD, this value could be calculated for each individual and for the entire

cohort by using the unpublished data provided to ORD by Roels 
(1993). For reasons to be discussed later, ACRD offers 
advantages for certain analyses and, unless otherwise noted, is 
the exposure measure used in the alternative RfC estimates 
discussed here. 
a. 

Conventional NOAEL- or LOAEL-Based Approach

. The conventional method, and only method used thus far by EPA, to derive an RfC has been to identify a NOAEL or LOAEL
from a study and divide that concentration by uncertainty factors, as described above for the Mn RfC. In the case of
the study by Roels et al. (1992), the geometric mean LIRD concentration of the 
Mn-exposed workers was used as a LOAEL. Roels et al. (1992) also 
performed an exposure-response analysis of their data by grouping 
the exposed workers into three exposure categories and comparing 
the prevalence of abnormal neurobehavioral scores for each of the 
three groups to those of controls. As indicated in the summary 
sheet for the Mn RfC (see Appendix C), the results of this 
exposure-response analysis were not used in deriving the revised 
Mn RfC because the reported analysis did not correct for multiple 
comparisons. However, ORD's analyses of additional data provided 
by Roels (1993) suggest a possible RfC estimate of 0.03  u g/m

3

 
(versus the current RfC of 0.05  u g/m

3

), if a one-tailed test of statistical significance is accepted (see Appendix A, 
``Reevaluation of Inhalation Health Risks Associated with Methyl- 
cyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl (MMT) in Gasoline'' as 
referenced in the reference section below, hereafter referred to 
as Appendix A.). Because it was based on an exposure-response 
analysis, this RfC estimate is labeled as such in Figure 1, which could not be reproduced in the 

Federal Register. 

It is available by calling the person listed in the 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

section of this notice. It is also available in docket A-93-26, item number II-A-17, page 12
(see 

ADDRESS 

section of this notice for docket location). 


b. NOSTASOT Approach

. Another approach to analyzing dose-response data makes use of a procedure known as NOSTASOT, described by Tukey
et al. 
(1985). In essence, the procedure applies a trend test sequentially to determine the highest noneffective dose of
a series of doses by eliminating one dose at a time. In this manner, the dose level at which the response is not significantly
different from controls is determined to be the NOSTASOT dose, which could therefore be considered a NOAEL. Applied
to Roels' 
(1993) epidemiologic data by beginning with the highest individual ACRD exposure and moving downward (i.e., a ``top-down''
approach), the procedure yielded a NOSTASOT of 285  u g/m

3

 for eye-hand coordination (see Table A-4, Appendix A). This approach implies that once nonsignificance is
reached, further application of trend tests to lower dose groups would also yield 
nonsignificance. However, this was not the case with Roels' (1993) epidemiologic data, and thus it was important
to determine not simply the highest NOAEL but the highest NOAEL below the lowest LOAEL. By this ``bottom-up'' approach,
the highest nonsignificant exposure below the lowest statistically significant exposure was 21  u g/m

3

, for visual reaction time. Using the latter value as a NOAEL and a total uncertainty factor of 100 (the same as that used
for the current Mn RfC, except omitting a factor of 10 for extrapolating from a LOAEL to a NOAEL), one would obtain a value
of 0.07  u g/m

3

 for an RfC estimate (Figure 1). Disparities in the NOSTASOTs obtained for various endpoints by the top-down and bottom-up
approaches raise 
questions about the suitability of this technique for deriving a NOAEL from the data of Roels (1993).

c. Benchmark Analyses.

 Another approach to deriving an RfC estimate is the benchmark dose (BMD) approach, which has been described by Crump
(1984) and others (e.g., Kimmel and Gaylor, 1988; Faustman et al., 1994; Allen et al., 1994). A BMD is an estimate of
the dose (the term dose is used interchangeably here with concentration, although the latter is more appropriate
for inhalation exposure) that will produce a specified effect (e.g., a 10% increase in the prevalence of abnormal
scores on a neurobehavioral test in the case of the study by Roels et al. (1992)). The BMD is calculated by fitting a mathematical
model to the available data and obtaining a maximum likelihood estimate of the dose associated with a specified increase
in response (typically 10, 5, or 1%). A lower confidence limit is then calculated for the BMD (usually the 95th percentile),
and the result is denoted as a benchmark dose level (BMDL), which has been proposed as a substitute for a NOAEL in deriving
RfDs or RfCs (Crump, 1984; Barnes et al., 1994). Subscripts designate the effect level (10, 5, or 1%) for which the BMDL
has been calculated, as in BMDL

10

, BMDL

5

, or BMDL

1

. 

A large number of mathematical models could be used for deriving BMDLs, but six frequently used models have been selected
for the present exercise (as discussed in Appendix A). In applying these models to the dataset provided by Roels (1993),
it appears that the models fit the CRD and ACRD data better than the LIRD data. (As explained in Appendix A, it made little
difference whether the LIRD values were obtained from the group data provided in the report by Roels et al. (1992) or
from the individual exposure data supplied by Roels (1993), so the latter LIRD data were used here.) In principle,
LIRD is superior to CRD as a measure of long-term or cumulative exposure. One reason for the difference in goodness
of fit between LIRD and either CRD or ACRD is that two workers with low LIRD values had abnormal eye-hand coordination
responses (exceeding the 95th percentile of control scores). These two subjects appear to have had rather short exposure
durations (0.3 and 0.4 years) and moderately high CRD values (201  u g/m3 each). Thus, these two data points suggest
an LIRD exposure-response relationship that is better fit by a supralinear curve with a power term <1 (see Figures
A-3 and A-5 in Appendix A) than by the more nearly linear curve such as that produced by the quantal linear
or restricted Weibull model (see Figures A-1 and A-4 in Appendix A). If CRD or ACRD exposure data are used,
however, the two individuals tend to fall in line better with a linear model (see Figures A-7 to A-10 in Appendix
A). Another factor contributing to difficulty in fitting the Roels (1993) data with linear models is a tendency for
the prevalence of abnormal eye-hand coordination responses to decline slightly at the highest LIRD, CRD, and ACRD
concentrations (evident in Figures A-1 to A-6). 

The supralinear exposure-response curve for abnormal eye-hand coordination scores suggests a possible corollary
to the healthy worker phenomenon; namely, the existence of newly employed, relatively sensitive workers vis-&aacute;-vis
long-term, relatively nonsensitive workers. It may be that the two above-noted workers happened to be rather susceptible
to Mn toxicity but had not been employed long enough for their greater sensitivity to become otherwise evident. There
could be a tendency for such workers to move to other types of employment, leaving a greater proportion of relatively
less sensitive individuals among the older workers. Although irregularities of the type posed by the data for these
two workers create complexities for model fitting, it is important to recognize that statistical curve fitting is
secondary to the objective of selecting the most biologically appropriate exposure variable. However, given that
the final results obtained with LIRD, CRD, and ACRD are roughly equivalent, ACRD has been selected for discussion
here because it estimates an average exposure over time and yet provides as good or better goodness of fit as CRD or LIRD
for most of the models considered. 

Of the six models considered, the quantal linear model fits the data reasonably well and is the least complex (see Appendix
A). It also gives equivalent results to the restricted Weibull model for BMDL calculations (although the two models
differ slightly when used in the Bayesian analyses, to be described below). Although much more conservative results
would be obtained if the unrestricted Weibull or unrestricted log-logistic model were used, the NOAEL/LOAEL surrogates
obtained with the latter models are so small as to be practicably incalculable and extend far below the range of actual
measurements. Therefore, the following discussion is focused on the results obtained with the quantal linear model.


In addition to choosing a model, a specified rate of increase in the effect of concern must be selected in using the BMD
approach. This percentage increment is expressed in terms of the effective concentration that would yield the stated
increase. Increases of 10, 5, and 1% in the incidence of abnormal eye-hand coordination scores (as dichotomized by
Roels et al., 1992) have been considered, with the concentrations associated with these levels called ``effective
concentrations'' and designated as EC

1

, EC

5

, and EC

10

, respectively. One guide to the choice of an effect level is that the resulting BMD (before calculating the lower confidence
limit) is preferably near or within the range of observed exposure concentrations (cf. Barnes et al., 1994). Because
the BMD for EC

1

 falls outside this range of observed concentrations, the primary focus in this discussion is devoted to the BMDL

5

 and the BMDL

10

. 

It should be kept in mind that the BMDL represents the lower 95th percent confidence interval for the effective concentration
in question, and therefore the BMDL probably inherently reflects some degree of conservatism. However, the degree
of conservatism obviously varies with the effective concentration for different percentage effect levels and with
the nature of the effect (e.g., severe versus moderate impairment). For the purposes of this assessment, if one treats
the BMDL

10

 derived from the dichotomized (quantal) data of Roels as if it were a minimal (less severe) LOAEL and the BMDL

5

 as if it were a NOAEL, uncertainty factors of 3 and 1, respectively, would be warranted. On this basis, as shown in Figure
1 and in Table A-39 of Appendix A for the quantal linear model using ACRD, an RfC estimate of 0.09  u g/m3 would
be obtained by using the quantal BMDL

10

 as if it were a LOAEL and a total uncertainty factor of 300 (10 for intraspecies sensitivity, 10 for database limitations,
and 3 for a minimal severity LOAEL). Similarly, the quantal BMDL

5

 would yield an RfC estimate of 0.1  u g/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 100 (10 for intraspecies sensitivity,
10 for database limitations, and 1 for a NOAEL). As applied here, the benchmark approach yields candidate RfC estimates
of 0.09 to 0.1  u g/m3.

d. Bayesian Analyses. 

Another approach to deriving a substitute for a conventional LOAEL or NOAEL, which bears some resemblance to the BMD
approach just described, is known as the Bayesian approach (see Appendix A). In essence, the Bayesian approach yields
a distribution of concentrations (rather than a point estimate) associated with a specified effect. Some features
of the BMD approach are common to the Bayesian approach: a mathematical model must be fit to the data, an effect level
must be selected, and a confidence bound on the estimated concentration associated with a given effect level must
be calculated (although the calculation procedures are different). If these choices are consistent with those for
the BMD approach, the results are quite similar. By the Bayesian analysis, for a 10% increase in abnormal eye-hand
coordination scores, the lower 90% credible set limit (roughly equivalent to the quantal BMDL 95% confidence limit
 based on the estimated median concentration obtained with the quantal linear model is 73  u g/m3. Adjusting this
value to a human equivalent concentration (HEC) and treating the result (26  u g/m3) as if it were a LOAEL(HEC), one
may divide by a total uncertainty factor of 300 (10 for intraspecies sensitivity, 10 for database limitations, and
3 for a minimal severity LOAEL) and obtain an RfC estimate of 0.09  u g/m3. Similarly, the 5% effect level yields an
RfC estimate of 0.1  u g/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 100. Thus, as applied here, the Bayesian approach
yields candidate RfC estimates of 0.09 to 0.1  u g/m3, essentially identical to the results of the benchmark analysis
(Figure 1). 





One advantage of the Bayesian approach is that it lends itself well to using continuous as well as dichotomous data.
Although Roels et al. (1992) did not provide individual continuous data (i.e., actual raw scores instead of designations
of normal/abnormal) on the performance of the workers in their study, they did report mean differences and standard
deviations. With this information, it is possible to estimate the concentration at which certain effect levels would
occur based on the Bayesian posterior distribution. For example, a 10% increase in the proportion of subjects with
abnormal scores would be associated with a median concentration of 112  u g/m3, which has a lower 90% credible set
limit of 90  u g/m3. Adjusting the latter value as if it were a LOAEL(HEC) yields a concentration of 32  u g/m3 and
an RfC estimate value of 0.1  u g/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 300 (10 for intraspecies sensitivity,
10 for database limitations, and 3 for a minimal severity LOAEL). Note that these calculations based on continuous
data essentially approximate the quantal BMD and Bayesian calculations for a 10% effect level based on dichotomous
data (see Figure 1). Similar calculations for the actually observed difference (i.e., 13%) between the Mn-exposed
and control workers in the Roels et al. (1992) study yield an RfC estimate of 0.2  u g/m3, based on a total uncertainty
factor of 300 (including a factor of 3 for a minimal severity LOAEL). Calculating the concentration associated with
the difference between the exposed and control mean values that just achieves statistical significance (a 4% difference
in this case) also results in a candidate RfC value of 0.2  u g/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 100 (eliminating
the minimal LOAEL factor of 3). Thus, as applied here, the Bayesian analyses of continuous data yield candidate RfC
estimates of 0.1 to 0.2  u g/m3. 



e. Summary of RfC Estimates.

 Figure 1 displays the current, verified RfC along with over 100 possible Mn RfC estimates based on various exposure
measures, models, effects measures, and uncertainty factors. Not all of these RfC estimates are equally plausible
or worthy of consideration in assessing the potential health risks associated with Mn inhalation exposure due to
MMT usage. As discussed above, some combinations of the three exposure measures and six mathematical models fit one
another better than other combinations. Based primarily on considerations of cumulative dose toxicity, statistical
goodness-of-fit, and parsimony, ACRD and the quantal linear model appear to achieve the best results in this respect.
Given the similarities of the benchmark and Bayesian analytic results using ACRD and the quantal linear model, little
distinction can be made between the two analytic approaches in the present application. As for the results obtained
for different effect levels, using a severity uncertainty factor of 3 with a 10% effect level (for either benchmark
or Bayesian analyses) is essentially equivalent to using a severity UF of 1 with a 5% effect level. Note that the terms
LOAEL and NOAEL do not actually correspond to the results for 10% and 5% effect levels, and therefore neither is preferable
to the other in the sense that a NOAEL is preferable to a LOAEL in deriving an RfC. Therefore, benchmark and Bayesian
results for 10% and 5% effect levels (using ACRD with the quantal linear model) are regarded as equally worthy of consideration
here. These particular analyses yield Mn RfC estimates of 0.09 to 0.1  u g/m3. 

In general, continuous response data are preferred to dichotomized data, primarily because they provide more information
and avoid the basically arbitrary division of effect measurements into categories (e.g., normal versus abnormal).
The Bayesian analysis based on mean differences between exposed and control groups offers some of the advantages
of using continuous data, in that the reported means and standard deviations (from Roels et al., 1992) provide a basis
for estimating the distribution of continuous response measures. However, this use of continuous data is not immune
to certain common problems, such as the issue of statistical power associated with studies of limited size, for the
approaches calculating observed or just-statistically significant differences. Also, whereas the dichotomous
data analyses yield more precision in estimating the effective concentration associated with a somewhat imprecise
response variable, the continuous data analyses offer the opposite trade off (i.e., more precision in the response
variable but less in the exposure estimate). Nevertheless, the continuous data analyses appear to merit consideration
as well as the analyses based on dichotomous data. By the Bayesian analyses of continuous data, Mn RfC estimates of
approximately 0.1 to 0.2  u g/m3 are obtained.

Based on the available data and on decisions and 
assumptions involved in analyses of these data, the leading 
candidate estimates for an alternative Mn RfC appear to fall in a

C. Exposure Assessment 



1. Background 



Very limited data have been available by which to 
estimate potential Mn personal exposure levels likely to be 
associated with the use of MMT as an additive in unleaded 
gasoline. For example, after the completion of ORD's 1990 
exposure assessment for Mn (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
1990), Ethyl Corporation provided EPA a brief report of a 
personal monitoring study as part of Ethyl Corporation's 
resubmittal of a waiver application for MMT. The study focused 
on 6 taxi drivers and 17 office workers in Toronto, ON, where the 
allowable MMT concentration in gasoline is 1/16 (0.062) g Mn/gal. 
(In the Toronto study, the actual concentration was reported as 
1/26 (0.039) g Mn/gal, which is only slightly greater than the 
1/32 (0.031) g Mn/gal concentration proposed for the United 
States. As confirmed by Kirshenblatt (1993), MMT concentrations 
in Canadian gasoline average well below the allowable limit 
there.) In comments on Ethyl's resubmittal, ORD considered the 
Toronto data in conjunction with results from independent field 
studies of personal exposures to carbon monoxide to develop a 
revised Mn exposure assessment (Preuss, 1991). A key element of 
the 1991 ORD assessment was the assumption that taxi drivers (six 
of whom were monitored in Toronto within a 2-week period) were 
members of a high-exposure cluster reflecting the upper 4% of the 
population in a model based on the carbon monoxide field studies. 
The result of the 1991 assessment was an estimate that 4% of the 
general public might be exposed to Mn at approximately 
0.09 

m

g/m3, although this estimate had an undetermined amount of 
uncertainty due to the inadequacies of the available data. 



2. Additional Canadian Studies 



Since the 1991 ORD assessment, additional personal 
exposure studies have been completed in Montreal and Toronto 
(described in Appendix B, ``Reevaluation of Inhalation Health 
Risks Associated with Methyl cyclopentadienyl Manganese 
Tricarbonyl (MMT) in Gasoline'' as referenced in the reference 
section below, hereafter referred to as Appendix B.) As shown in 
Figure B-10 of Appendix B, the average concentrations reported in 
the Canadian studies vary by as much as an order of magnitude for 
small groups (5 to 19 persons each) of garage mechanics, taxi 
drivers, and office workers. The highest average Mn personal 
exposure level was 0.25 

m

g/m3 for Montreal garage mechanics while 
at work; the other averages ranged from 0.002 to 0.035 

m

g/m3 for 
various particle size fractions. Although it is impossible to 
extrapolate the results of these studies to the distribution of 
Mn exposure levels for the general population, it does appear 
that there is a general relationship between personal exposure 
levels of Mn and proximity to vehicular emissions of combusted 
MMT. Thus, populations living near high traffic-volume areas 
such as inner cities and expressways would probably tend to 
experience higher Mn exposure levels in relation to MMT usage. 

Some of the limitations of the Canadian studies with 
respect to development of a quantitative exposure assessment are 
reviewed in detail in Appendix B and may be summarized briefly as 
follows. 




 The studies did not have adequate sample sizes and did not 
sample according to a probabilistic statistical design that 
would help ensure the representativeness of the sampled 
individuals. 
 The sampling periods were relatively short, 1 to 2 weeks at 
most. Meteorological and other factors that would be 
expected to influence ambient measurements over relatively 
short periods of time were not characterized. 
 Because the studies did not use ambient monitors collocated 
with reference monitors (such as the dichotomous samplers 
used by Canadian agencies), it is difficult to relate data 
from the studies to larger databases from the government 
monitoring networks. 
 Because the studies did not use identical monitors to 
measure personal exposure levels and outdoor ambient 
levels, it is difficult to distinguish between personal 
exposures and ambient levels or to relate one to the other. 
 Quality assurance and certain other important 
methodological details are not fully provided in the 
available reports. 




Because of the substantial limitations of the above 
exposure studies, no quantitative assessment of personal 
exposures to Mn in a Canadian population is possible at present.

3. The PTEAM Study 



The only published study that has used a probability-based 
representative sampling design for evaluating exposure levels of 
Mn in a general population is the Particle Total Exposure 
Assessment Methodology (PTEAM) study, which was conducted in 
Riverside, CA, over a 7-week period in the fall of 1990 
(Pellizzari et al., 1992). This study used personal and 
stationary monitors to measure Mn concentrations indoors and 
outdoors. The personal samplers collected PM

10

, and the 
stationary samplers collected PM

2.5

 as well as PM

10

 (see glossary 
of terms in Attachment B-6 to Appendix B). Of the 139,000 
nonsmoking residents age 10 years and older in Riverside, 178 
individuals were selected through a stratified sampling plan to 
represent the general population and were monitored over two 
12-hour periods (daytime and nighttime). More than 2,750 
particle samples were collected. Quality assurance and other 
procedures are summarized in Appendix B and are described 
extensively elsewhere (e.g., Pellizzari et al., 1992; Clayton 
et al., 1993; Thomas et al., 1993). The PTEAM study has been 
presented in various peer-reviewed publications and discussed in 
several scientific forums (see Attachment B-5 to Appendix B). It 
represents the best available information on an actual 
distribution of general population exposures to Mn. It also 
provides valuable information on potential Mn exposure associated 
with MMT use, because MMT was used in leaded gasoline in 
California prior to and during the period of the PTEAM study. 



4. Estimated Mn Exposure Levels Associated with MMT Usage 



As noted above, the substantial limitations of the 
available Canadian exposure studies make them unsuitable for 
estimating population exposure levels of Mn in relation to MMT 
usage. In addition, ambient monitoring data typically 
underestimate and may be uncorrelated with personal exposure 
levels of automotive-source pollutants. Therefore, of the 
currently existing published evidence pertaining to Mn exposure 
levels in relation to MMT usage, only the PTEAM Riverside study 
(Pellizzari et al., 1992) provides a reasonable basis for 
estimating potential future exposure levels in relation to a 
scenario where 100% of unleaded gasoline contains 1/32 g Mn/gal 
as proposed by Ethyl Corporation. 

In the PTEAM study, measurements of personal exposure 
levels of PM

10

 Mn indicated that approximately half of the 
population in Riverside in the 1990 study period had 24-hour 
personal exposures to PM

10

 Mn above 0.035 

m

g/m3, with the highest 
1% of the population having exposures above 0.223 

m

g/m3 PM

10

 Mn. 
However, given the use of PM

5

 Mn exposure measurements in the 
study of Roels et al. (1992), it would be preferable to consider 
a population distribution of personal exposure levels of PM

5

 Mn. 
Due to limitations in the available data, the exposure assessment 
in Appendix B focuses on estimated personal exposure levels for 
PM

4

 Mn, not PM

5

. Although the difference is probably small, PM

4

 
levels are an underestimate of PM

5

 levels. The derivation of the 
projected exposure estimates involved several steps, which may be 
summarized as follows. 

The automotive and nonautomotive contributions to 
particulate Mn exposures in the PTEAM study were estimated using 
data from Lyons et al. (1993), who reported particle size 
distributions up to PM

4

 of selected trace metals, including Mn, 
at two locations near Riverside in the winter and summer of 1989. 
They attributed most of the PM

4

 Mn to automotive sources. Based 
on their findings and data from other sources, it is possible to 
estimate that 69% of the PM

2.5

 fraction of PM

4

 Mn they measured 
was derived from automotive sources (namely the combustion of MMT 
in motor vehicle fuel, as then allowed in leaded gasoline in 
California) and that 31% was derived from paved road dust (mostly 
earth crustal material). Next, the PTEAM Mn measurements from 
stationary indoor monitors (SIMs) were used to estimate personal 
exposure levels by adjusting the SIM PM

2.5

 Mn data to reflect the 
typically higher levels of all elements measured by personal 
exposure monitors (PEMs). This adjustment was made in two ways, 
either by the PEM:SIM ratio obtained for Mn or by the ratio 
obtained for lead (Pb), another element related to automotive 
fuel usage. These two methods of adjusting the SIM data to PEM 
values resulted in two projected distributions, as will be 
described below. The next step in the derivation procedure 
involved adjusting the PM

2.5

 personal exposure estimates to 
reflect PM in the size range from 2.5 to 4 

m

m (based again on 
data from Lyons et al., 1993). 

With these estimates of PM

4

 Mn personal exposure levels due 
to automotive sources, it was then possible to project from the 
situation in Riverside around the time of the PTEAM study (when 
leaded-MMT gasoline constituted about 14% of the gasoline sold 
and contained an average of 0.048 g Mn/gal) to a future scenario 
that assumes 100% of the unleaded gasoline contains MMT at 1/32 
(0.031) g Mn/gal. This aspect of the derivation is described in 
detail in Attachment B-4 to Appendix B. In essence, a factor was 
calculated to reflect the estimated increase in MMT usage between 
1990 and 1995 (i.e., the first full year in the near future). 
This projection factor assumed an increase of 1% per year in 
gasoline usage and no difference in the Mn emission rate (grams 
Mn emitted per gram Mn in fuel combusted) for noncatalyst 
vehicles using leaded-MMT gasoline in 1990 versus catalyst 
vehicles using unleaded-MMT gasoline in 1995.

Next, the nonautomotive contribution to PM

4

 Mn was 
estimated and added to the estimated automotive contribution to 
obtain the projected personal exposure levels of total PM

4

 Mn. 
Assuming the estimated PM

4

 Mn distribution has the same form as 
the PM

10

 Mn distribution from PTEAM (approximately lognormal with 
equal geometric standard deviations), the ratio of the PM

4

:PM

10 


arithmetic mean personal exposure levels yields a scaling factor 
that can be applied to the PM

10

 distribution to obtain the PM

4

 
distributions. Because of the alternative bases for adjusting 
the SIM PM

2.5

 data for personal exposures (as noted above), two 
different scaling factors were multiplied by the PM

10

 
distribution, thereby producing a higher and a lower estimate of 
the distribution of 24-hour average PM

4

 Mn personal exposure 
levels. 
In addition, because long-term exposures are likely to have 
less variance than 24-hour exposures, it is appropriate to adjust 
the distributions of 24-hour average exposure levels to better 
reflect longer periods of exposure. Of various methods that may 
be used for this purpose (Wallace et al., 1994), two approaches 
were applied to adjust the geometric standard deviations of the 
two projected exposure distributions, based on data from either 
the PTEAM study or the smaller pilot study that preceded the 
PTEAM Riverside study. These alternative methods were applied to 
the two estimated distributions of 24-hour average exposures to 
yield the distributions of long-term average PM

4

 Mn personal 
exposure levels depicted as lines 1 and 2 in Figure 2 (only the 
highest and lowest of the four resulting estimates are shown). 
It must be emphasized that these two distributions do not 
represent upper and lower bounds, because even higher or lower 
estimates could be produced by alternative assumptions and 
adjustments of the data. Moreover, if data were available for 
another time of the year (e.g., spring in addition to fall), the 
estimates would not be season-specific and could possibly be much 
higher or much lower. Nevertheless, given the limited available 
data, lines 1 and 2 in Figure 2 represent two reasonable 
estimates of the projected long-term (autumnal) personal exposure 
levels of PM

4

 Mn in relation to MMT usage at 1/32 g Mn/gal in 
100% of unleaded gasoline.

By examination of the logarithmic-probability plot of long-term personal exposure levels of Mn, it is estimated
that half of 
the population would be exposed to PM

4

 Mn levels of more than 
approximately 0.045 to 0.050 

m

g/m3. Also, based on the two 
projection estimates, approximately 5 to 10% of the population 
would have personal exposure levels around 0.1 

m

g/m3 PM

4

 Mn or higher. The highest 1% would be predicted to have PM

4

 Mn 
exposure levels above 0.15 

m

g/m3. It should be noted that these 
projections refer specifically to Riverside, CA, with a 
population of more than 139,000 persons. However, in many 
significant respects (e.g., meteorology and traffic volume), 
Riverside is reasonably representative of the greater 
metropolitan area of Los Angeles, which has a total population of 
over 14.5 million persons. The exposure projection estimates for 
Riverside imply the possibility that hundreds of thousands of 
persons in the Los Angeles area alone could be exposed to PM

4

 Mn 
levels exceeding 0.1 

m

g/m3. To the extent that any other U.S. 
cities (e.g., in the Southwest) share some degree of resemblance 
in meteorology, vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and possibly other 
characteristics of relevance to automotive Mn levels, the 
estimated exposure levels for Riverside could be pertinent, at 
least qualitatively, to other locales or portions of locales as 
well. Similarities and differences in point-source contributions 
to Mn exposure would also figure into comparisons with other 
communities. The presence of a major point source or sources of 
Mn in a community (which was not a factor in Riverside) would add 
some increment to the level of Mn exposure experienced by the 
persons in that community. Although these Riverside estimates 
cannot be applied quantitatively to any other U.S. metropolitan 
areas, the total population of the U.S. counties with VMT levels 
greater than that of Riverside (apart from the four counties Los 
Angeles comprises) is approximately 15 million persons. 
Possibly, then, several hundreds of thousands of persons could be 
exposed to PM

4

 Mn levels of approximately 0.1 

m

g/m3 or higher if MMT were used in 100% of the unleaded gasoline in all of these 
areas. However, it must be emphasized that because of the 
limited available data, a great deal of uncertainty surrounds 
such estimates. The actual exposure levels could be much higher 
or lower.

D. Risk Characterization 



To assess the public health risk associated with the use of 
MMT in gasoline in the United States, the available qualitative 
and quantitative health effects information on Mn must be related 
to the available exposure information. From the standpoint of a 
qualitative hazard identification, the available evidence amply 
demonstrates that inhaled Mn is toxic to the nervous system, the 
respiratory system, and the male reproductive system. The 
toxicity of Mn by different routes of exposure has been 
demonstrated by numerous medical reports and epidemiological and 
experimental studies. However, available data do not allow 
quantitative estimation of the relative toxicological potency of 
different Mn compounds or permit quantitative route-to-route 
extrapolations for predicting the effects of Mn

3

O

4

. 

The focus of the above health assessment discussion has been 
on the RfC and the types of risks associated with chronic Mn 
exposures because, for the most part, acute effect levels appear 
to be considerably higher than the highest projected exposure 
levels. However, the issue of less-than-chronic exposures does 
arise with respect to the potential for developmental toxicity. 
It is widely recognized that the human CNS develops over a period 
of several years, prenatally and postnatally, and can be 
vulnerable to long-term or irreversible effects if damage occurs 
during certain ``critical stages'' of development. Recent evidence 
from ongoing longitudinal studies of children indicates that lead 
(Pb) exposure (measured as blood Pb level) around 2 years of age 
in particular is associated with reduced cognitive performance at 
4 to 10 years of age. Such evidence raises the concern that 
exposure to another neurotoxic metal such as Mn during part of 
early development might also be capable of inducing permanent or 
irreversible damage to the developing CNS. Moreover, the 
ramifications of such damage might extend to other important 
functions, such as reproduction. 

Children may also be at higher risk in terms of exposure 
because of biomedical and metabolic differences at a young age 
(greater uptake and retention) and/or because of the longer 
duration of their exposure over a lifetime. Over time, small 
impairments in neurobehavioral function may accumulate. For this 
reason, the elderly, whose neurobehavioral function may already 
be compromised by normal aging processes and possibly by other 
disease states (e.g., parkinsonism or preclinical parkinsonism), 
also represent a special population of concern. The ability of 
the elderly or other subpopulations to compensate for such 
declines in neurobehavioral function may be overwhelmed 
eventually by additional, albeit possibly quite small, insults 
due to Mn. If so, the effect could be manifested as a more 
severe or earlier onset of declining function in senescence, with 
consequent implications for increased societal health-care costs. 

Special subpopulations at increased risk may be defined not 
only in terms of their biological susceptibility, as exemplified 
above by the young and the elderly, but also by their increased 
risk of exposure. In this respect, inner city residents and 
others who live near high traffic areas such as expressways 
(e.g., low-income and minority communities) would possibly have a 
disproportionate likelihood of higher Mn exposure levels due to 
their closer proximity to vehicular emissions. 

The nature of the neurobehavioral effects observed in 
occupational studies such as Roels et al. (1992) should be 
understood as effects that probably would not be treated by, or 
even be readily evident to, a clinical physician. Nonetheless, 
they are significant from a public health standpoint when 
considered in terms of population effects. This concept is 
illustrated by the well documented findings on low-level Pb 
neurotoxicity in children, where changes of as little as 1 or 
2 points in IQ have been repeatedly demonstrated in several 
independent, prospective, epidemiological studies in recent 
years. Such changes could not be reliably demonstrated either in 
a clinical setting or in earlier cross-sectional epidemiological 
studies; yet they are now well established to be ``real'' and 
significant from a public health standpoint. With regard to the 
reductions in neurobehavioral function observed in various 
epidemiological studies of Mn-exposed workers, these studies 
independently converge on findings of impaired motor function 
(e.g., reductions in eye-hand coordination, slower hand or finger 
movements, and less control of fine movement). As recently 
expressed in a document prepared by the Subcommittee for Risk 
Assessment of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, 
Engineering and Technology (

Federal Register

, 1993), an adverse 
effect can include ``both unwanted effects and any alteration from 
baseline that diminishes the ability to survive, reproduce or 
adapt to the environment.'' Thus, it can be argued that these 
effects in themselves warrant consideration as adverse health 
effects. They may also have ramifications for health and safety 
of an even more serious nature, if a person's ability to react 
quickly and accurately to a situation (e.g., traffic conditions) 
was impaired. 

Another aspect of the findings from available occupational 
studies concerns the temporal relationship between exposure and 
effect. As noted above, the geometric mean average period of Mn 
exposure of the workers in the Roels et al. (1992) study was only 
4 years, with the longest period of Mn exposure for any one 
individual being less than 18 years. Also, the oldest worker in 
the Roels et al. (1992) study was less than 50 years old. This 
relatively limited period of exposure along with the absence of 
older subjects in the Roels study raises the question of whether 
sufficient time had elapsed for the full expression of the toxic 
effects of Mn. Some reports in the literature indicate that 
Mn toxicity may not be clinically evident until some years after 
exposure occurred or terminated (e.g., Cotzias et al., 1968; 
Rodier, 1955), and other reports point to a greater sensitivity 
of elderly persons, compared to middle-aged or young adults, for 
acute as well as chronic Mn toxicity (e.g., Kawamura et al., 
1941). An uncertainty factor for extrapolation from a subchronic 
exposure to chronic exposure was included in deriving the RfC 
estimates shown in Figure 1. However, a ``half-factor'' of 3 was 
used for this area of uncertainty. If the average period of Mn 
exposure (geometric mean: 4 years) in the Roels et al. (1992) 
study is compared to an assumed lifetime of 70 years, one could 
argue that a factor of 70/4=17.5, or at least 10, would be a 
more appropriate adjustment for subchronic to chronic exposures. 
Given the limited available data, this area of uncertainty is 
difficult to express in a quantitative manner, but in general 
practice, EPA has used an uncertainty factor of 3 for other 
chemicals with comparable databases. Nevertheless, this area of 
concern suggests that the Mn RfC estimates derived here with an 
uncertainty factor of 3 for subchronic to chronic exposure 
probably do not tend to err in the direction of being too 
conservative. 

Another qualitative concern that should be recognized in 
considering the potential health effects of Mn is the possibility 
of certain types of effects that are suggested by clinical and 
other evidence but are difficult to measure quantitatively or 
demonstrate with currently available methods. Specifically, much 
of the clinical literature on manganism refers to a psychiatric 
component of the illness, which often involves striking emotional 
or mood changes that tend to appear before changes in motor 
function are evident. Such effects are inherently difficult to 
measure in a quantitative manner. However, the possibility of 
such effects at lower levels of exposure than those at which 
motor control is affected should not be discounted out of hand. 
Some reports in the literature (e.g., Gottschalk et al., 1991) 
suggest that aggressive behavior may be associated with Mn 
exposure (as reflected in the concentration of Mn in hair of 
prison inmates). Such reports require substantiation by further 
studies, and the validity and relevance of hair Mn levels to 
environmental Mn exposure remains to be established, but the 
suggestion that an association might exist between hair Mn and 
behavior cannot be totally dismissed.

Quantitative analyses of neurobehavioral data obtained from 
an occupational cohort provide a range of possible RfC estimates 
in addition to the current, verified Mn RfC value of 0.05 

m

g/m3. 
In ORD's judgment, the leading candidates for a possible 
alternative RfC estimate are approximately 0.09 to 0.2 

m

g/m3, 
based on currently available information. By definition, RfC 
analyses do not yield a precise concentration that defines a 
demarcation between safety and hazard. Rather, interpretation of 
a Mn RfC estimate is best made in relation to an assessment of 
population exposures to Mn, with the understanding that the RfC 
is a protective level, not a predictive value. 

The exposure assessment, based largely on data from the 
PTEAM study, provides some reasonable but necessarily uncertain 
estimates of personal exposure levels of Mn that might result 
from the use of MMT in gasoline. These estimates indicate that 
if MMT (at 1/32 g Mn/gal) were used in all unleaded gasoline in 
Riverside, CA (or the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area), 
approximately 40 to 50% of the population could experience PM

4

 
Mn exposures exceeding the current RfC of 0.05 

m

g/m3 (derived 
from PM

5

 Mn health effects data), and approximately 5 to 10% 
could experience PM

4

 Mn exposure levels around 0.1 

m

g/m3 or 
higher (see Figure 2). In terms of the Los Angeles area 
population of 14.5 million persons, even an estimate of 5% of the 
population implies over 700,000 persons. 

Uncertainties are inherent in any risk assessment. In this 
case, on the health assessment side, the numerical uncertainty 
factors used in the RfC analyses presented here have been 
explicitly described and explained in and summarized above. 
These factors are intended to provide a reasonable degree of 
public health conservatism reflecting areas of biological 
knowledge as well as areas of information deficit. In addition, 
an RfC estimate by definition reflects uncertainty spanning 
perhaps an order of magnitude, and thus there is no significant 
difference between the verified RfC of 0.05 

m

g/m3 and alternative 
estimates of 0.09 to 0.2 

m

g/m3. Other qualitative uncertainties 
are also discussed above. On the exposure assessment side, the 
primary uncertainties are related to projections from the PTEAM 
data, rather than the PTEAM data per se. Inferences about the 
relative contributions of crustal and automotive sources to PM

4

 
Mn were drawn from studies conducted in geographical and temporal 
proximity to the PTEAM study, but both the data from these 
studies and the inferences based on them introduce uncertainties. 
Attempts to adjust the PTEAM data in various ways, including any 
extrapolation from the 24-hour average distribution obtained in 
the fall of 1990 to a long-term average for other seasons, 
introduce progressively greater uncertainties at each step. Some 
adjustments have not even been attempted. For example, a 
weighting of the daytime and nighttime PTEAM exposure data to 
reflect a higher average ventilation rate during daytime 
activities and a lower ventilation rate during nighttime 
activities (e.g., sleeping) would have resulted in higher 
personal exposure estimates. Thus, given other approaches or 
assumptions, different projection estimates are possible. It 
must therefore be emphasized that the two projections of Mn 
exposure levels in Figure 2 should not be interpreted as upper 
and lower bound estimates, for even the higher projection could 
possibly underestimate, or the lower projection overestimate, the 
PM

4

 Mn exposure levels associated with MMT. 

As for the relevance of the PTEAM Riverside personal 
exposure estimates to other communities, the PTEAM study was, 
strictly speaking, only designed to statistically represent 
Riverside, CA. In that respect, the design and conduct of the 
PTEAM study provide a high degree of confidence that it does 
accurately represent 24-hour average Mn exposure concentrations 
for the Riverside population in the fall of 1990. In ORD's 
judgment, the PTEAM study provides a reasonable representation of 
the Los Angeles Basin as well, given the commonalities in 
geography, vehicle usage, and meteorology. However, the 
relevance of the Riverside data to other U.S. communities depends 
upon their similarities or differences in the most relevant 
characteristics or dimensions. For example, to the extent that 
several other major U.S. metropolitan areas (or subcommunities in 
these areas) also have a high level of vehicle usage, the 
Riverside projections may have greater relevance. To the extent 
that these same areas do not share the meteorological conditions 
that contribute to the Mn exposure levels measured in Riverside, 
the Riverside projections have lesser relevance. It is also 
important to consider other sources of Mn exposure apart from 
automotive and crustal sources. Although Riverside had no major 
point sources of Mn contributing to the personal exposure levels 
measured in the PTEAM study, other communities may have such 
sources, and thus the personal exposure levels of Mn from all 
sources might be higher in other communities than in Riverside.

The exposure estimates shown in Figure 3 are in the range of 
or exceed some candidate RfC estimates as well as the current 
RfC. Exceeding the RfC does not necessarily indicate that a 
public health risk will occur. At present, it is impossible to 
state whether projected exposures above the RfC would result in 
an adverse health effect for either an individual or the general 
population. At a sufficiently high level of exposure, adverse 
effects would be expected to occur, first in any sensitive 
subpopulations, then with greater prevalence in the general 
population and extending to other types of effects (e.g., 
reproductive and/or respiratory as well as neurobehavioral 
effects in the case of Mn). However, the relationship between 
such ``sufficiently high'' levels and the population exposure 
levels estimated by the projection methods employed here is 
unknown. Expressed differently, given the gap between observed 
or modeled effect levels and the RfC values obtained by applying 
uncertainty factors of orders of magnitude, it is impossible to 
state whether projected population exposures would lie above or 
below a presumed threshold level on the actual concentration-response curve for Mn neurotoxicity. This gap between
projected 
exposure levels and the lowest concentrations obtained by 
modeling the concentration-response relationship (at least, by 
the quantal linear model) makes it impossible to make any 
assertion regarding the likelihood of a health risk at projected 
exposure levels. However, this conclusion should not be 
interpreted to imply that, therefore, no health risk is expected 
to exist at exposure levels exceeding the RfC.

F. Comments on Health Assessment and EPA Response 



The focus of most of Ethyl's comments regarding the effects on public health and welfare resulting from the use of MMT
in unleaded gasoline deal with issues related to EPA's risk assessment and specifically to the calculation of an RfC
for manganese by the utilization of various analytical methods, to the uncertainty factors used by the Agency in determining
the RfC for manganese, and to the exposure assessment for manganese. A summary discussion of the significant issues
related to these comments follows.







Generally, Ethyl states that ``ORD openly concedes that after four years of efforts it is unable to conclude that a
public health risk would exist for even the most highly exposed segment of the population.'' The Agency indicated
to Ethyl in 1991 the research it could conduct to provide for a more quantitative assessment of the MMT issue. Thus,
assessment of the risks or benefits of MMT could be, or perhaps could already have been, improved if more empirical
information were provided by Ethyl to the Agency. 

Ethyl commented on ORD's April 28, 1994 draft MMT Risk Assessment that, depending on the methodology used for the derivation
of the RfC for manganese, the level of manganese concentrations ``without appreciable risk'' lies somewhere within
the range of 0.1 to 3.0  u g/m

3

 and that all of ORD's RfC calculations fall within this range. Contrary to Ethyl's statement, the inclusion of Ethyl's
proposed RfC estimate of 3.0  u g/m

3

 in tables and figures summarizing the RfC estimates obtained by different methods was merely an attempt by the Agency
to illustrate all of the RfC estimates. The Agency did not imply or state a conclusion that ``The majority of ORD's RfC
calculations fall in the 0.1-3.0  u g/m

3

 range.'' ORD focused on a leading candidate RfC estimate of approximately 0.1  u g/m

3

, while explicitly noting that the current official RfC of 0.05  u g/m

3

 is not meaningfully different from a possible alternative RfC estimate of 0.1  u g/m

3

. 

To more effectively avoid possible ambiguity that is reflected in Ethyl's comment, Figure 1 of the final MMT Risk Assessment
(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1994b) shows all of the RfC estimates contained in Table A-39 of Appendix
A. Ethyl's preferred RfC estimate of 3  u g/m

3

 is now omitted from Figure 1 because it is not a value obtained by any of ORD's analyses. Moreover, it is ORD's view that
the best estimate of an alternative RfC estimate for Mn, based on the analyses and data considered to date, probably
lies in the range of 0.09 to 0.2  u g/m

3

. This judgment is based on the strengths and weaknesses of the various analytic approaches considered by ORD in the
April 28 draft assessment.

Ethyl has stated that EPA has failed to address issues regarding both the statistical treatment of the data underlying
the RfC and EPA's decision to employ a 1000-fold factor of uncertainty in calculating the RfC. EPA disagrees. Appendix
A of the ORD Risk Assessment addresses each of these issues. The extensive analyses the Agency has conducted represent
a concerted effort to respond to the statistical issues raised by Ethyl. The fact that EPA does not adopt Ethyl's advocated
position is not a failure to address the issues. In fact, no scientific consensus or policy exists on many of these issues,
such as the selection of a specific mathematical dose-response model, the selection of an effect level, how to address
continuous data, and the appropriate magnitude of severity regarding production of uncertainty factors for the
various effect levels. As is specifically described in the ``Response to Comments'' document, ORD utilized scientific
judgment in determining the appropriateness of certain models and the inclusion of specific uncertainty factors.


Ethyl also expressed concerns that EPA had not adequately addressed alternative analyses for estimating an RfC by
utilizing different groupings of subjects in the Roels analysis. ICF Kaiser, a consultant for Ethyl, commented that
``ORD ignores alternative analyses which most closely resemble the conventional method for calculating RfCs.''
The alternative approach Ethyl employed to group the data from the study by Roels et al. (1992) has no evident rationale
other than providing a statistically nonsignificant effect level. The groupings employed by Roels et al. (1992)
and used by ORD appear to have been selected because they provided approximately equal numbers of subjects per group.
The groupings selected by Ethyl result in both smaller and more disparate numbers of subjects per group, with a consequent
reduction in statistical power to detect a significant difference between a Mn-exposed group and controls. Further,
as explained in the Response to Comments Document previously cited, ORD does not view the use of the upper boundary
of the concentration associated with a group as a scientifically appropriate or representative metric to describe
the exposure of the entire group. 

Ethyl also took issue with the Agency for focusing on analyses using the average concentration of respirable dust
(ACRD). The decision to focus on ACRD was not arbitrary or designed to yield lower RfC estimates but, as explained in
Appendix A of the ORD Risk Assessment, was based on both an explicit consideration of the advantages ACRD offered for
fitting dose-response models and its ability to reflect average past exposure, thereby obviating some of the apparent
disadvantages of the two exposure measures reported by Roels et al. (1992), LIRD and CRD. Although the Agency views
ACRD as the best choice of these three available exposure measures for the analytical approaches employed in the ORD
risk assessment, Figure 1 (See Section VI-B, above.) illustrates all of the RfC estimates presented for all
three exposure measures and all analytical approaches. 

Ethyl recommends that certain analyses should be omitted from consideration on the ORD risk assessment. To some extent,
the Agency believes the difference between Ethyl's and EPA's positions is related to differing interpretations
of what is reasonable versus unreasonable, biologically plausible versus implausible, or valid versus invalid.
As addressed before, the Agency's basic approach in the ORD risk assessment was to present all of the results of its
analyses and then identify a subset of the total that have a scientifically stronger basis for being considered preferentially.







Ethyl offers several arguments directed at reducing the overall uncertainty and specifically the composite uncertainty
factor (UF) of 10 for database limitations applied in deriving estimates of an RfC for manganese. Ethyl's first argument
concerns the basic ``biological plausibility'' of the RfC, suggesting that inhaled manganese cannot be as toxic
(compared to ingested manganese) as the roughly 100-fold difference in RfC and RfD estimates would indicate.
 The Agency believes that a fundamental problem with Ethyl's comparison is that it is limited to what Ethyl estimates
is the ``systemic dose.'' The key issue is not systemic dose but delivered dose, i.e., the amount of manganese that
actually reaches and enters a critical target organ such as the brain. Furthermore, the Agency believes that, depending
on the form of manganese inhaled, and its ability to enter the brain, it is quite possible that a significant fraction
of even small amounts of inhaled manganese would be able to reach target sites in the central nervous system. Thus,
the apparently greater toxicity of inhaled versus ingested manganese may reflect important pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic differences of manganese that enters the body by different routes of exposure. Ethyl's analysis
of systemic dose does not adequately address this issue.








The more specific critique Ethyl offers regarding the composite UF of 10 for database limitations deals with three
areas of inadequate information represented by the composite factor: chronic exposure effects, reproductive/developmental
effects, and differences in toxicity of different forms of manganese. In deriving RfCs for other chemicals, any one
of these three areas of uncertainty has, in one case or another, warranted a full UF of 10.







The Agency believes that given the possible accumulation of manganese, the effects of chronic exposure to inhaled
manganese are of concern. The maximum average exposure duration of the available occupational studies cited by both
ORD and Ethyl is 16.7 years (Mergler et al. 1994),
 which does not constitute chronic exposure. Ethyl's comments ignore the point that the RfC is in fact aimed at extrapolation
to 70 exposure years. Reproductive and developmental toxicity are widely recognized as significant public health
concerns and therefore warrant specific consideration as uncertainties in RfC derivation. The available animal
studies on reproductive and developmental effects almost exclusively involved oral dosing of manganese and are
inadequate for inhalation RfC purposes. Studies of such effects in humans are limited for males and nonexistent for
females. 





The potential difference in toxicity potency of Mn3O4 in comparison to MnO2 or other compounds of manganese is a significant
uncertainty because no existing study has directly compared the toxicities of these compounds by inhalation exposure.
Ethyl's comparison of studies involving not only different routes of exposure but significant differences in methods,
subjects/subject populations, and other key features does not constitute an adequate quantitative assessment.

In summary, the three areas of uncertainty reflected in the 
composite UF of 10 used in deriving the manganese RfC estimates 
are appropriate because they are not adequately addressed by 
available studies. 
Ethyl stated that ORD has overlooked evidence from the 
Canadian exposure studies that indicate personal exposure levels 
of manganese are likely to be lower than indicated by the PTEAM 
Riverside Study. The Agency considers Ethyl's exposure 
assessment based on Canadian data to be deficient in several 
respects. Given the fundamental differences in the sampling 
procedures for the Canadian and Riverside studies, as well as 
other differences in the design and conduct of the studies in 
question, the Agency continues to judge the PTEAM Riverside data 
to be far more useful to exposure assessment purposes that the 
Canadian data. The ``consistency'' in the Canadian data that Ethyl 
emphasizes is a subjective matter that can be considered from 
more than one perspective.





Ethyl also disagrees with certain assumptions and features 
of ORD's draft exposure assessment. In particular, Ethyl claims 
that ORD's draft ``PTEAM Riverside exposure model'' overestimates 
manganese exposure levels for selected Canadian cities by a 
factor of approximately three when used with a factor for 
projected increases in MMT usage. Ethyl's application of the 
``Riverside model'' is incorrect for several reasons, including 
Ethyl's use of ambient monitoring data to estimate personal 
exposure levels (ORD used stationary indoor monitoring data 
collected as part of a personal exposure study). The Agency 
notes that qualitative differences in meteorology and the degree 
of automobile usage provide a more likely basis for the 
differences between Riverside and the Canadian cities cited by 
Ethyl. 
Ethyl also states that the manganese emission rate from 
catalyst vehicles should be a factor of three lower than that for 
noncatalyzed vehicles, which would lower ORD's projected exposure 
estimates by almost the same factor. After reevaluating the 
limited data on manganese emissions from noncatalyst and catalyst 
vehicles, ORD has concluded that no specific emission rate can be 
justified by the available data and that, consequently, an 
assumption of equivalent emission rates for both types of 
vehicles is reasonable and appropriate. 
Ethyl cited data pertaining to the amount of iron and 
manganese in soil and paved road dust (PRD) in Riverside that 
indicate the percentage of automotive contribution to personal 
exposure levels of PM

4

 manganese should be lower than the value 
ORD used. ORD agrees that the iron:manganese data for Riverside 
PRD provide a more geographically specific basis for estimating 
automotive contributions, and therefore the projection estimates 
of personal exposure levels of manganese would be slightly lower 
because of this adjustment.
 This adjustment in the exposure 
assessment was incorporated into the final assessment as 
described above in section VI-C. 




Ethyl states that Riverside is not representative of other 
U.S. cities, and ORD does not disagree. Nevertheless, ORD 
believes Riverside is reasonably representative of the greater 
Los Angeles metropolitan area. Consequently, the PTEAM Riverside 
exposure assessment can be considered representative for at least 
14.5 million people (the population of the greater Los Angeles 
area). To the extent that other U.S. cities share some degree of 
resemblance in meteorology, vehicles miles traveled, and possibly 
other characteristics of relevance to automotive manganese 
levels, the estimated exposure levels for Riverside may be 
pertinent to other locales and portions of locales as well. 
However, ORD can only point to qualitative similarities and is 
unable to make any quantitative statement on the degree of 
relevance of the Riverside data to other U.S. cities. 
In its May 27 submission,
 Ethyl has noted that a 
distribution of 24-hour average exposure levels is likely to have 
higher exposures at the upper portion of the distribution than 
would a longer term average for the same population. ORD agrees 
that this is likely, but the lack of adequate exposure data make 
it impossible to determine what the actual distribution would be. 
Although Ethyl attempts to correct the distribution of 24-hour 
average data to represent a longer term average, ORD notes 
unstated assumptions and possible errors in Ethyl's calculations 
and prefers alternative approaches to estimating such a 
correction to the distribution.






Ethyl commented that ORD's newly released PTEAM exposure 
modeling shows that 

no

 (emphasis in original) portion of the 
population would experience manganese exposures above the 0.1-0.3 
 u g/m

3

 range. The Agency believes that Ethyl is mistaken in 
making this conclusion. Statements and graphical information in 
ORD's risk assessment indicate that an estimated 5-10% of the 
Riverside/Los Angeles population would be projected to experience 
personal exposure levels of PM

4

 manganese at or above 0.1  u g/m

3

. Ethyl's statement regarding EPA's exposure assessment would be 
correct only if it were to replace ``0.1-0.3  u g/m

3

 range'' with 
``0.3  u g/m

3

 range''. 
Ethyl commented that the ``ORD risk assessment projects that 
the 99th percentile manganese exposure would be about 0.2 

m

g/m

3

 or lower, while the 90th to 95th percentiles would experience manganese exposures below even 0.1 

m

g/m

3

.'' On the contrary, as shown in the ORD risk assessment, by 

one

 estimate, the 98th 
percentile exposure level would be approximately 0.2 

m

g/m

3

, and both estimates are above 0.1 

m

g/m

3

 at the 95th percentile. (See Figure 2, Section VI-C of this Decision.) 
Finally, Ethyl raises issues from comparing ORD's assessment 
of MMT with ORD's assessment of methyl tertiary butyl ether 
(MTBE). Ethyl reduces the official EPA RfC for MTBE by 
inappropriate uncertainty factors, compares the result to both 
appropriate and inappropriate exposure values for MTBE, finds an 
overlap of these health and exposure assessments for MTBE, and 
concludes that, by comparison, MMT was treated too conservatively 
or erroneously. Basically, because of substantial differences 
between the databases and characteristics of MTBE (a volatile 
organic compound that remains in the body for a matter of hours 
to days) and Mn (a metal that accumulates in the body), Ethyl's 
direct comparisons are not valid.
 




Comments from other interested parties regarding potential 
health concerns related to manganese exposure are addressed in 
``ORD's Response to Public Comments'' found in Docket A-93-26. 


VII. Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration and Research Needs 


To more accurately define an RfC for manganese and to more 
accurately predict the distribution of expected manganese 
exposures associated with MMT use, additional research will have 
to be completed. Such research would ultimately lead to a risk 
assessment which could better define the risk associated with MMT 
use. Furthermore, regulations under sections 211(a), (b), and 
(e) of the Act, set forth a procedure under which required health 
and exposure data must be submitted prior to any new use of a 
fuel or additive. Given the basis for today's decision and the 
purpose of the testing requirements imposed by these regulations, 
the Agency expects that the testing required to resolve the 
concerns upon which today's decision is based will also be 
required under these regulations. The following section explains 
these newly promulgated requirements and how they would apply to 
the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline.

Under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, certain fuels and 
additives must be registered with EPA as a precondition to 
introduction into commerce. Section 211(a) of the Act authorizes 
EPA to designate any fuel or fuel additive for registration. 
Upon designation, fuels or additives may not be introduced into 
commerce unless they have been registered by EPA in accordance 
with section 211(b). In 1975, EPA issued regulations (40 CFR 
Part 79) implementing basic registration requirements, as 
stipulated by section 211(b)(1), that required applicants to 
submit certain information, such as commercial identifying 
information, range of concentration, purpose-in-use, and chemical 
composition, in order to register a fuel or fuel additive. 
The 1970 Clean Air Act also gave EPA discretionary authority 
to establish additional registration requirements under section 
211(b)(2). This section authorized EPA to require fuel and fuel 
additive manufacturers ``to conduct tests to determine potential 
public health effects of such fuel(s) or additive(s) (including 
but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic, or mutagenic 
effects),'' and to further furnish other ``reasonable and 
necessary'' information to identify fuel and fuel additive 
emissions and determine their effects on vehicular emission 
control performance and on public health and welfare. 
EPA did not exercise its discretionary authority to require 
testing of fuels and fuel additives under section 211(b)(2) when 
general registration regulations were first adopted in 1975. 
However, in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-
95, August 7, 1977), Congress added section 211(e), which 
required EPA to take certain actions to implement section 
211(b)(2). A final rule was signed by the Administrator of EPA on 
May 27, 1994 and was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 
27, 1994 (59 FR 33042). The final rule, ``Fuels and Fuels 
Additives Registration Regulations'', implemented additional 
registration requirements under sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of 
the Clean Air Act. The rule requires manufacturers to provide 
EPA with information to assist EPA in identifying and evaluating 
potential adverse health effects of motor vehicle fuel and fuel 
additive emissions, and to support and guide related regulatory 
actions in the future. 
The recently promulgated health effects testing requirements 
incorporate a three-tiered health effects evaluation structure. 
Under Tier 1, fuel and fuel additive manufacturers are required 
to perform a literature search on the health and welfare effects 
of fuel and fuel additive emissions, characterize the emissions, 
and provide exposure information. Tier 2 includes short-term 
biological testing to screen for specific health effects 
endpoints, involving the exposure of laboratory animals to the 
whole emissions of fuels or fuel/additive mixtures. 
Where appropriate, EPA has retained authority to modify or 
augment the standard Tier 2 test requirements. Under 
``alternative Tier 2'' procedures set forth in  79.58(c), EPA may 
substitute alternative tests for standard Tier 2 tests or impose 
additional testing requirements. Alternative Tier 2 procedures 
may be utilized to modify standard Tier 2 requirements, but may 
not be utilized to entirely delete testing for any of the 
standard endpoints. The alternative Tier 2 provision affords the 
Agency flexibility when available information indicates that 
another testing regimen is preferable to the standard set of Tier 
2 tests. Instances where Alternative Tier 2 requirements may be 
appropriate include scenarios where previously available 
information may cause EPA to be concerned about potential health 
effects related to an endpoint not specifically addressed in Tier 
2, or when otherwise available information identifies a 
potentially significant public health risk related to a Tier 2 
endpoint such that more definitive testing will be required for 
this endpoint than is ordinarily required. In both of these 
scenarios, alternative Tier 2 testing can facilitate earlier and 
potentially more efficient acquisition of the required data. 
After receipt and review of a manufacturer's Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 submittals, EPA determines, on a case-by-case basis, if 
additional testing is needed under Tier 3 to evaluate the risk of 
a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group of fuels or fuel 
additives) on human health or welfare. Tier 3 testing could 
include any emission analysis, health effects, welfare effects, 
and/or exposure testing or analysis deemed necessary by EPA for 
this purpose. 
The Agency has considerable discretion to formulate and 
impose appropriate testing requirements under either alternative 
Tier 2 or Tier 3 procedures. In practice, EPA will be more 
likely to utilize alternative Tier 2 procedures in instances 
where additional data needs are apparent even prior to completion 
and submission of the standard Tier 2 tests, and prompt 
formulation of appropriate alternative testing requirements will 
result in a more efficient use of industry and governmental 
resources. Tier 3 procedures will be preferred in those 
instances where standard Tier 2 tests are necessary to assist EPA 
in identification of potential hazards and/or in design or 
selection of appropriate follow-up studies. 
For fuels and fuel additives registered as of the date of 
promulgation of the final rule, registrants must submit Tier 1 
and Tier 2 test data within six years of that date. On the other 
hand, manufacturers seeking to register new fuel and fuel 
additive products after the date of promulgation must satisfy all 
testing requirements before registration will be granted. 
In this regard, the new rule clarifies what constitutes a 
``new'' fuel or fuel additive, distinguishing between two types of 
unregistered products which a manufacturer might seek to register 
after the promulgation of the final rule: (1) fuel and fuel 
additive products similar in composition and usage to those 
already allowed wide commercial distribution (e.g., registered 
for general use by other manufacturers), and (2) fuel and fuel 
additive products which differ significantly in composition 
and/or usage from such current products. To effectuate this 
distinction, EPA's final rule, promulgated under sections 211(b) 
and (e), makes use of grouping system concepts and definitions. 
Specifically, a fuel additive product not registered by its 
manufacturer
 for a specific type of fuel as of the date of 
promulgation of this rule is designated as ``registrable'' if the 
fuel/additive mixture resulting from use of the additive in the 
specific fuel is in the same fuel/additive group as one or more 
currently registered fuels or bulk additives.
 The grouping 
system establishes various fuel/additive groups within each fuel 
family.
 Conversely, a fuel additive product not registered 
by its manufacturer for a specific type of fuel as of the date of 
promulgation is designated as ``new'' if the fuel/additive mixture 
resulting from use of the additive in the specific fuel cannot be 
grouped with one or more currently registered fuels or bulk 
additives. In these definitions, the term ``currently registered'' 
refers to the date on which the prospective applicant seeks 
registration for the fuel or fuel additive in question. 






According to these definitions, an unregistered fuel 
additive which meets the criteria for grouping only with a 
currently registered aftermarket additive (and not also with a 
currently registered fuel and/or bulk additive) is not 
registrable. This does not preclude an unregistered aftermarket 
additive from being registrable (since aftermarket additives can 
group with fuels and bulk additives), nor does it affect the 
registration status of currently registered aftermarket 
additives. 
For example, an unregistered detergent additive (either bulk 
or aftermarket) intended for use in unleaded gasoline and 
conforming to the ``substantially similar'' criteria for unleaded 
gasoline (56 FR 5352) would be registrable, since it would be 
able to group with currently registered baseline unleaded 
gasoline fuels and bulk additives.
 On the other hand, MMT is 
considered ``new'' rather than ``registrable'' for unleaded gasoline, 
because there are no currently registered manganese-containing 
fuels or bulk additives in the unleaded gasoline family with 
which a mixture of MMT and unleaded gasoline could be grouped. 
This is true even though products containing MMT are currently 
registered for bulk use in leaded gasoline and as aftermarket 
additives grandfathered prior to the ban on such aftermarket 
additives.

The recently finalized rule requires that manufacturers of 
new fuel and fuel additive products (i.e., fuel and fuel additive 
products not registered by their specific manufacturers as of the 
date of promulgation and not fitting the registrable criteria) 
submit all testing requirements prior to registration, including 
any alternative Tier 2 tests or Tier 3 tests prescribed by the 
Agency. As discussed above, under the fuel and fuel additive 
testing rule, MMT is designated as ``new'' for purposes of 
registration for use in unleaded gasoline. Accordingly, any data 
required to register MMT for use in unleaded gasoline must be 
submitted prior to registration. 

As noted above, Tier 1 requires manufacturers of designated 
fuels or fuel additives (or groups of manufacturers pursuant to  
79.56) to supply to the Administrator: (1) the identity and 
concentration of certain emission products of such fuel and fuel 
additives, (2) an analysis of potential emissions exposures, and 
(3) any available information regarding the health and welfare 
effects of the whole and specified emissions. 

Under the General Provision of the emission characterization 
requirements of Tier 1, it is stated in  79.52(b)(1)(ii) that 
the emissions shall be generated three times (on three different 
days) without a functional aftertreatment device and, if 
applicable, three times (on three different days) with a 
functional aftertreatment device, and each such time shall be 
analyzed according to the remaining provisions in this section 
(b). Measurement of background emissions, under 
 79.52(b)(1)(iii), states that it is required that 
ambient/dilution air be analyzed for levels of background 
chemical species present at the time of emission sampling (for 
both combustion and evaporative emissions) and that background 
chemical species profiles be reported with emissions speciation 
data. Ethyl has yet to provide the Agency with data on the 
characterization of emissions resulting from the use of MMT in 
unleaded gasoline which meets the requirements of Tier 1 under 
these subsections. Thus, to EPA's knowledge, data has not yet 
been collected which would fully satisfy Tier 1 requirements 
under  79.52(b)(1) (ii) and (iii). 

Standard Tier 2 testing includes certain specific types of 
short-term biological testing to screen for specific health 
effects endpoints, involving the exposure of laboratory animals 
to the whole emissions of the fuel additive (when added to a base 
fuel). Where appropriate, the Agency may impose an alternative 
Tier 2 test in lieu of a standard Tier 2 test or prescribe 
additional Tier 2 testing in addition to the standard Tier 2 
tests. 

EPA's Office of Research and Development has prepared a 
report that specifically identifies research which would allow a 
more accurate evaluation of the risk involved in utilizing MMT in 
unleaded gasoline.
 Some of the research described in the ORD 
report is intended to address toxicologic endpoints which are 
also addressed by standard Tier 2 tests,
 while other research 
described in the report is intended to address other endpoints. 
EPA presently has an adequate basis to conclude that there are 
public health concerns associated with the potential use of MMT 
in unleaded gasoline, and anticipates that research addressing 
each of the areas identified in the ORD report will be necessary 
to support registration of MMT for use in unleaded gasoline. It 
is not necessary, and would be inefficient, to wait for the 
completion and submission of all of the standard Tier 2 tests in 
order to identify the requisite test data, and use of alternative 
Tier 2 procedures is therefore appropriate. 






If Ethyl or any other party seeks to register MMT for use in 
unleaded gasoline, it will need to submit the required test data 
in addition to obtaining the required waiver. In that case, EPA 
expects to identify specific alternative Tier 2 tests which must 
be performed prior to registration.
 In the case of endpoints 
addressed by the ORD report, that report will serve as the 
starting point for EPA in identifying appropriate alternative 
Tier 2 tests. In each instance where EPA does not adopt any 
alternative Tier 2 requirement for an endpoint which is addressed 
by standard Tier 2 tests, standard information or testing 
requirements will continue to apply. The process for 
establishment of alternative Tier 2 testing requirements for a 
product includes specific procedures for notification of the 
manufacturer and an opportunity for comment, and is set forth in 
40 C.F.R. 79.58(c). 






Submission of any data which is required by the registration 
regulations prior to registration of MMT for use in unleaded 
gasoline is not itself a specific legal prerequisite to the 
granting of a waiver under section 211(f)(4). However, in these 
circumstances, since the Agency is declining to grant the 
requested waiver based on potential health effects, the Agency 
considers it reasonable to require that Ethyl submit the same 
health effects and exposure test data which will be required 
prior to registration of MMT for unleaded gasoline before it will 
consider taking favorable action on another waiver application. 

As the health effects testing rule indicates, EPA believes 
that it should exercise particular caution in registering new 
fuel or fuel additive products that are significantly different 
from, or have a usage pattern which is significantly different in 
scope or character from, currently registered fuel or fuel 
additive products. EPA also believes that the same cautious 
approach is appropriate in evaluating waiver applications under 
section 211(f)(4).

In the event that Ethyl wishes to undertake the testing 
required to register MMT for unleaded gasoline, EPA will work 
with Ethyl to resolve the details of all necessary test data. 
Further, once the data requirements for registration have been 
duly established, EPA will not require submission of any 
additional health effects and exposure data as part of a new 
waiver application. 



VIII. Other Issues 



Ethyl has stated that certain other considerations and data 
associated with MMT use should be taken into account by the 
Administrator in utilizing the discretion authorized under 
section 211(f)(4). These issues include (1) decreased emissions 
of toxic air pollutants due to decreases in aromatic use when MMT 
is substituted as an octane enhancer; (2) decreased refinery 
emissions due to decreased reformer severity; (3) decreased 
carbon monoxide (CO) and oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) vehicle 
emissions, (4) increased crude oil yield and associated energy 
savings, and (5) decreased levels of tropospheric ozone 
associated with lower levels of reactive hydrocarbon emissions 
and NO

X

 emission decreases. 

Regarding CO emission decreases, EPA's analysis indicates 
that examination of all of the available test data on the CO 
effects of MMT shows a small (0.07 gpm or 2% of applicable 
standards
) decrease attributable to the additive.
 With 
the exceptions of two vehicle models, the CO effects in both 
directions were relatively small. The most significant exception 
to this general pattern is the test data from the 1988 Ford Crown 
Victoria 5L, which showed a decrease of 0.72 gpm (or 21% of the 
standard). The other unusual vehicle was also a Ford Crown 
Victoria_a 1992 model with a 0.36 gpm decrease (11% of 
standard). The small average size and somewhat erratic nature of 
the CO decreases seen in the vehicle sample lead to questions 
about whether this small potential benefit is likely to actually 
occur in the vehicle fleet. 






EPA also examined NO

X

 emissions changes demonstrated by the 
data which had been submitted by both Ethyl and Ford. The test 
data for NO

X

 show a more substantial and more consistent decrease 
for this pollutant than was the case for CO. The average across 
models was 0.08 gpm or 8% of the standard. The largest decreases 
were seen in the 1992 Ford Mustang 5.0L model and the 1988 Ford 
Crown Victoria 5L (each showing a 0.30 gpm decrease or 30% of the 
standard). Other models with substantial decreases were the 1988 
Ford Taurus (0.22 gpm or 22% of the standard) and the 1992 Buick 
Regal 3.8L (0.19 gpm or 19% of the standard). 

It is difficult to clearly determine the effects which NO

X

 
decreases of this magnitude might have on tropospheric ozone 
concentrations, since such effects are influenced heavily by the 
mix of ozone precursors and the atmospheric chemistry of 
particular non-attainment areas. Modeling studies performed by 
EPA have shown that NO

X

 reductions in NO

X

 limited areas can 
significantly reduce regional ozone levels. However, although 
the regional ozone decreased, some urban areas showed slight 
increases in ozone levels. It is not possible to quantify the 
degree of reduction in ozone associated with the introduction of 
MMT in general because many factors affect ambient ozone. In 
order to achieve such a quantification, individual cities would 
need to be analyzed to determine their VOC/NO

X

 ratios and the 
mobile source contribution to those ratios. 

EPA has therefore concluded that it is likely that in 
certain NO

X

-limited areas, ambient levels of ozone would decrease 
based on the expected NO

X

 reductions resulting from MMT use. It 
is impossible to quantify the exact degree of these decreases or 
the magnitude of the area which would be affected.






Ethyl indicates that ``use of the Additive will result in as 
many as 

25 fewer cancer cases

 [emphasis in the original] 
attributable to automotive exhaust over the 1995-2010 span.'' 
Although ORD has not independently verified Ethyl's current 
analysis, it is nevertheless possible to evaluate their analysis 
by taking it at face value. Significant uncertainties are 
inherent in any prediction of a net change in cancer risk. For 
example, there are various models and assumptions underlying 
estimated changes in carcinogen exposures. Assumptions must be 
made regarding the composition of gasoline at different times in 
the future; projected fleet emissions must be estimated based on 
measurements from a few vehicles; the impact of MMT on such 
emissions must be estimated. In addition, the relationship of 
changes in emissions is assumed to be related to population 
exposure levels. 

Cancer risk, whether characterized in terms of the number of 
cases in the entire U.S. population or in terms of individual 
unit risk estimates, also has inherent uncertainties. According 
to Ethyl, the predicted reduction in estimated cancer cases is 
0.6 to 2.0 cases per year. These represent upper bound 
estimates, and thus the true impact is very unlikely to be higher 
and may in fact be less. Ethyl also predicts that the changes in 
the probability of an individual contracting cancer is lowered 
with MMT use from about 12 cases per 100,000 to 6 cases per 
100,000. Again these estimates represent upper bounds, so the 
true risk to an individual would not be expected to be higher and 
could well be lower. In any case, the individual risk level 
remains in the 10-5 range. Relative to the uncertainties in the 
cancer risk estimates as well as in the emission and exposure 
aspects of Ethyl's analysis, the magnitude of the claimed change 
in risk is comparatively quite small. 

The accuracy of these estimates also depends very much on 
the estimates of decreased aromatics use for individual refiners. 
Very significant changes are taking place in the refining 
industry to comply with various aspects of programs being 
implemented pursuant to the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. 
Programs such as the introduction of ``reformulated gasoline'' will 
dramatically change the overall chemical and physical properties 
of gasoline. Thus, estimates of aromatics usage associated with 
refining are even more highly speculative over the next several 
years as these programs are implemented. 

In any case, it is not possible to weigh these predicted 
changes in cancer incidence or in ozone formation against the 
concerns which have been explained above in relation to increased 
manganese emissions. Therefore, the Agency disagrees with 
Ethyl's claim that it can be shown scientifically that a net 
public health benefit results from the use of MMT in unleaded 
gasoline. While the Agency agrees that such risk-benefit 
comparisons can be important, the present data are inadequate for 
this purpose. With regard to the potential risks associated with 
inhalation exposure to manganese, the Agency's Risk Assessment as 
described above indicates that there are insufficient data to 
conclude quantitatively whether the increased use of MMT will (or 
will not) increase public health risk. With regard to the 
potential reductions in cancer incidence and tropospheric ozone 
levels associated with MMT use claimed by Ethyl, the above 
analysis indicates that, while reductions are possible, the data 
are too sparse to provide reasonable quantitative estimates of 
the magnitude of such reductions. The estimated cancer reduction 
is not truly discernable as a quantifiable benefit. This is 
because relative to the uncertainties in the cancer risk 
estimates as well as in the emission and exposure aspects of 
Ethyl's analysis, the estimated magnitude of change in risk is 
quite small, even when based on the ``upper bound'' cancer 
estimates. For ozone, it is not possible in general to quantify 
the degree of reduction associated with the introduction of MMT 
because many factors, including local volatile organic compound 
(VOC)/NO

X

 ratios affect ambient ozone levels. To achieve a 
quantification, all appropriate individual cities would have to 
be analyzed.

IX. Decision 



As previously discussed, the Agency interprets section 
211(f)(4) of the Act as establishing a two-stage process for 
evaluating waiver applications. The first stage requires that 
EPA determine whether an applicant has met its burden of 
demonstrating that a fuel does not cause or contribute to a 
failure to meet regulated emission standards. Unless EPA finds 
that the waiver applicant has met this burden, a waiver may not 
be granted. The second stage of the process reflects the 
discretionary nature of the waiver authority provided to the EPA 
Administrator by the statute. In this second stage, the 
Administrator may consider other factors in determining whether 
granting a waiver is in the public interest and consistent with 
the objectives of the Clean Air Act. In this stage, the 
Administrator has broad discretion in selecting the issues to be 
examined and in balancing the potential positive and negative 
impacts of a waiver. 

For purposes of the pending waiver application, as remanded 
to EPA by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and resubmitted by 
Ethyl, I determined on November 30, 1993 that use of Ethyl's 
product HiTEC 3000 in unleaded gasoline at the specified 
concentration will not cause or contribute to a failure to 
achieve compliance with vehicle emission standards. The data and 
analysis upon which this determination was based are described in 
Section IV above. The data submitted by Ethyl in connection with 
this waiver application satisfy all of the quantitative criteria 
for determining whether an additive will ``cause or contribute'' to 
a failure to meet emission standards previously utilized by EPA. 
As noted above, EPA has serious reservations concerning the 
present suitability of these criteria. In light of the 
intractability of the nation's air pollution problems, EPA is 
considering adoption of new criteria which would be utilized in 
assessing future waiver applications. However, for purposes of 
Ethyl's present application, EPA concluded that it would not be 
appropriate to make the required determination concerning 
emission effects by utilizing a new methodology or new criteria 
concerning which Ethyl was not afforded any prior notice. My 
decision that Ethyl has met the requisite statutory burden for 
purposes of the present waiver application is also based on the 
Agency's assessment of the newest data provided by Ethyl on 
newer-technology vehicles which do not, when evaluated 
separately, indicate any statistically significant increase in 
regulated vehicle emissions. 

The Agency remains concerned about the possible effects of 
fuels containing MMT on the functioning of onboard diagnostics 
(OBD) equipment. At the time that EPA completed the assessment 
of emissions issues underlying my finding concerning emissions on 
November 30, 1993, the evidence to support the assertions by 
automakers that MMT would prevent the oxygen sensors in OBD 
systems from operating properly was quite limited and these 
assertions had not at that time been tested in any actual 
vehicles utilizing OBD systems. I expressed concern about the 
effect of MMT on OBD systems at that time, and indicated that if 
EPA ultimately concluded that MMT could prevent proper 
functioning of OBD systems, the Agency would consider appropriate 
action under Clean Air Act section 211(c). Since that time, the 
Ford Motor Company has submitted further research involving use 
of fuel containing MMT in an actual vehicle equipped with an OBD 
system, which Ford contends demonstrates that manganese oxides 
resulting from MMT use prevent the oxygen sensors in its OBD 
systems from functioning properly. EPA intends to fully 
investigate the significance of these findings. If further 
investigation supports the concerns expressed by Ford and other 
automakers, EPA intends to initiate an appropriate rulemaking 
under section 211(c). 

Since I determined that Ethyl had met its burden regarding 
the ``cause or contribute'' finding required by the statute, the 
Agency has been reviewing other issues bearing on the exercise of 
my discretionary authority to grant or deny Ethyl the requested 
waiver for use in unleaded gasoline, focusing in particular on 
the potential effects of manganese emissions resulting from use 
of MMT on public health and welfare. 

The Agency remains concerned regarding the issue of 
manganese emissions from vehicles utilizing fuels containing MMT. 
From a hazard identification perspective, manganese can clearly 
be toxic to the central nervous system, the respiratory system, 
and the male reproductive system. The level of manganese which 
may safely be breathed over a lifetime is not known with 
precision. EPA has assessed potential health risks associated 
with potential exposures utilizing a Reference Concentration 
(RfC), which is defined as an estimate (with uncertainty spanning 
perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation 
exposure level for the human population (including sensitive 
subpopulations) that is likely to be without appreciable risk of 
deleterious noncancer effects during a lifetime of exposure. 

Beginning with existing data on the effects of manganese 
exposures, the Agency utilized its standard procedure to develop 
a verified Reference Concentration (RfC) of 0.05  u g/m3. In 
response to comments and criticisms by Ethyl and others, the 
Agency then utilized a variety of additional techniques to 
consider potential alternative RfC's based on additional data 
from the occupational exposure study on which the current RfC is 
based (discussed in detail in Section VI-B-4 above). The 
techniques judged by EPA scientists to be most appropriate 
produced alternative candidate RfC's ranging from 0.09 to 0.2 
 u g/m3. Since any formal revision of the present verified RfC of 
0.05  u g/m3 based on the ORD reassessment will occur in the future 
and could not be completed prior to the deadline for this 
decision, I have evaluated the potential health effects 
associated with use of MMT in unleaded gasoline based on all of 
the likely values, focusing in particular on a potential 
alternative RfC of 0.1  u g/m3 and the present RfC of 0.05  u g/m3. 

Utilizing the newest and most accurate data available on 
personal exposures to particulate emissions of manganese from 
vehicular sources, Agency scientists also prepared an exposure 
analysis in which they attempted to predict the range of 
increases in personal exposure to particulate manganese that 
would occur in Riverside, California urban areas if MMT were to 
be used in all unleaded gasoline. If MMT were utilized in 
unleaded gasoline at the specified concentration in urban areas 
similar to Riverside, California, the Agency's exposure 
assessment predicts that the exposures of forty to fifty percent 
of the population in such areas to airborne manganese levels 
would exceed the present verified RfC of 0.05  u g/m3, and the 
exposures of five to ten percent would exceed manganese levels 
exceeding a potential alternative RfC of 0.1  u g/m3. Although it 
is impossible to state whether a health risk would definitely 
exist at the projected exposure levels, neither can the 
possibility of such a risk be ruled out.

It is reasonable to anticipate that persons living near 
major thoroughfares and in inner cities, often among the most 
economically disadvantaged Americans, will be disproportionately 
represented among persons with higher manganese exposure. 
Moreover, there is reason to believe certain subpopulations such 
as the young, the elderly, and persons with certain preexisting 
conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, might be more 
susceptible to any adverse effects of manganese exposure. 

Certain occupational groups who work in proximity to 
vehicular emissions such as toll takers, parking garage 
attendants, traffic policemen, taxi dispatchers, and service 
station attendants, are represented in the Agency's exposure 
estimates only to the extent of their prevalence in the general 
population. These occupational groups would likely experience 
manganese exposures attributable to MMT use near or even 
exceeding the highest predicted exposures
. I realize that if 
Ethyl is granted the requested waiver, MMT would not be utilized 
immediately in all congested urban areas. Some of the urban 
areas with higher vehicular usage are areas which will be 
required to begin using a cleaner gasoline referred to as 
``reformulated gasoline'' beginning in 1995. If Ethyl were to 
obtain the waiver under section 211(f)(4) which is the subject of 
this decision, MMT could not be used in reformulated gasoline 
unless and until Ethyl obtained an additional waiver under Clean 
Air Act section 211(k)(2)(D). However, I am nevertheless 
concerned about the effects of potential MMT use in areas 
required to utilize reformulated gasoline, both because a waiver 
under section 211(f)(4) of the Act is a necessary prerequisite to 
the use of MMT in either conventional or reformulated gasoline 
and because Ethyl has made it clear that it does not seek the 
present waiver solely to permit use in conventional gasoline. 





I have concluded based on the assessments prepared by EPA 
scientists that, if I were to approve use of MMT in unleaded 
gasoline at the specified concentration, a significant number of 
persons could thereby be exposed to manganese concentrations in 
the ambient air which approach or exceed the current RfC or the 
candidate RfCs described in the risk assessment. Although all 
risk assessments have some degree of uncertainty, in some cases 
it is reasonable to conclude that the risk of adverse health 
effects is either very great or very small because estimated 
exposure levels are either far above or far below a potential 
health effect level. However, this is not the case with MMT. 

Although it is not possible based on the present information 
to conclude whether specific adverse health effects will be 
associated with manganese exposures in the vicinity of or 
exceeding the RfC, neither is it possible to conclude that 
adverse health effects will not be associated with such 
exposures. Moreover, it is likely that, if adverse effects do 
occur as a result of MMT usage, such effects will be subtle and 
difficult to detect. In these circumstances, I am very reluctant 
to conduct a massive experiment in which the citizens of numerous 
American cities are subjected to the additional exposures to 
particulate manganese associated with MMT use. 

I am aware of the proposal by Ethyl that EPA conditionally 
grant its waiver application for HiTEC 3000, with conditions 
which would require Ethyl to develop in a specified period the 
additional health effects and exposure data necessary to address 
present uncertainties in the risk assessment, require Ethyl to 
conduct ambient monitoring of particulate manganese levels in 
certain cities where unleaded gasoline containing MMT would be 
sold, and provide for prompt withdrawal of HiTEC 3000 from the 
market in the event that ambient monitoring were to demonstrate 
airborne manganese levels exceeding a specified level of concern 
(e.g. 0.1  u g/m3). However, I believe that the additional 
information on health effects and exposure necessary to provide 
greater assurance that manganese emissions from MMT use will not 
jeopardize public health should be provided before I decide 
whether to expose Americans to such emissions on even a temporary 
basis. Moreover, Ethyl's proposal to monitor ambient exposure 
levels would not assure that personal exposures exceeding the 
specified threshold do not occur. The EPA risk assessment makes 
it clear that a substantial portion of the population exposed to 
airborne manganese as a result of MMT use would be expected to 
experience personal exposures exceeding measured ambient exposure 
levels.

I recognize that there are some benefits that will be likely to accrue from approval of MMT use. In addition to the obvious
economic benefits associated with reductions in petroleum use and in fuel prices, there might also be some favorable
health and environmental effects. It is probable that, if MMT use were to result in reduced NO

X

 emissions from motor vehicles, this would be accompanied by some site-specific decreases in ozone formation. The
small decreases in cancer risks claimed by Ethyl are considerably more speculative and cannot be quantified with
existing information. In any case, it is not possible for me to weigh any modest hypothetical decrease in cancer risk
or limited site-specific ozone benefit against a risk of effects on the nervous system that could significantly decrease
the quality of life for a large number of individuals. In addition, EPA is or will be taking a number of other actions
under the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions of carcinogenic air pollutants and to limit ozone formation.






Based on the EPA analyses described in this decision and on the administrative record compiled by EPA as part of this
decision, I have concluded that there is a reasonable basis for concern about the effects on public health that could
result if EPA were to approve use of MMT in unleaded gasoline pursuant to Ethyl's application. I have also concluded
that the actual and hypothetical benefits which could accrue from MMT use are insufficient to outweigh the concerns
regarding potential adverse health effects. In circumstances where there is substantial uncertainty regarding
the nature of potential health effects which would result if a fuel additive waiver were approved, the burden of resolving
such uncertainties should fall on the waiver applicant rather than on the public. This policy is consistent with the
general policy established by the recently promulgated health effects testing rule, which requires that manufacturers
of new fuels or fuel additives complete all necessary testing prior to registration. 

Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, utilizing the discretion afforded me under section 211(f)(4) of the Act,
I am today denying Ethyl's request for a waiver of the section 211(f)(1) prohibitions against the use of MMT in unleaded
gasoline. As previously stated in this decision, should Ethyl wish to undertake research intended to alleviate the
present uncertainties concerning the adverse health effects which could be associated with the use of MMT in unleaded
gasoline, the Agency will work with Ethyl to resolve the details of the needed research. If Ethyl decides to undertake
the research which is needed, and which would likely be required in any case to register MMT for unleaded gasoline under
the Agency's recently promulgated fuel and fuel additive health effects testing regulations, EPA will reconsider
granting a waiver to Ethyl at that time. 

EPA has determined that this action does not meet any of the criteria for classification as a significant regulatory
action under Executive Order 12866. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. This action is not a ``rule''
as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because EPA has not published, and is not required
to publish, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), or any other
law. Therefore, EPA has not prepared a supporting regulatory flexibility analysis addressing the impact of this
action on small entities. 

This is a final Agency action of national applicability. Jurisdiction to review this action lies exclusively in the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicial review of
this action is available only by the filing of a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit within 60 days of August 17, 1994. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, today's action may not be challenged
later in a separate judicial proceeding brought by the Agency to enforce the statutory prohibitions.

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with Section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended,
EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of requests by registrants to voluntarily cancel certain pesticide registrations.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Introduction



Section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, provides that a
pesticide registrant may, at any time, request that any of its pesticide registrations be cancelled. The Act further
provides that EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the 

Federal Register

 before acting on the request. 



II. Intent to Cancel



This Notice announces receipt by the Agency of requests to cancel some 147 pesticide products registered under section
3 or 24(c) of FIFRA. These registrations are listed in sequence by registration number (or company number and 24(c)
number) in the following Table 1.









 



Unless a request is withdrawn by the registrant within 90 days of publication of this notice, orders will be issued
cancelling all of these registrations. Users of these pesticides or anyone else desiring the retention of a registration
should contact the applicable registrant directly during this 90-day period. The following Table 2 includes
the names and addresses of record for all registrants of the products in Table 1, in sequence by EPA Company Number.















III. Loss of Active Ingredients 



Unless these requests for cancellation, one pesticide active ingredient will no longer appear in any registered
products. Those who are concerned about the potential loss of this active ingredient for pesticidal use are encouraged
to work directly with the registrant to explore the possibility of their withdrawing the request for cancellation.
This active ingredient is listed in the following Table 3, with the EPA Company Number.










IV. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request 


Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation must submit such withdrawal in writing to James A. Hollins,
at the address given above, postmarked before November 15, 1994. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation
will apply only to the applicable 6(f)(1) request listed in this notice. If the product(s) have been subject to a previous
cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action
are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to
fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements. 



V. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks 



The effective date of cancellation will be the date of the cancellation order. The orders effecting these requested
cancellations will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1-year after the
date the cancellation request was received. This policy is in accordance with the Agency's statement of policy as
prescribed in 

Federal Register

 No. 123, Vol. 56, dated June 26, 1991. Exceptions to this general rule will be made if a product poses a risk concern,
or is in noncompliance with reregistration requirements, or is subject to a data call-in. In all cases, product-specific
disposition dates will be given in the cancellation orders. Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide
products which are currently in the United States and which have been packaged, labeled, and released for shipment
prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Unless the provisions of an earlier order apply, existing
stocks already in the hands of dealers or users can be distributed, sold or used legally until they are exhausted, provided
that such further sale and use comply with the EPA-approved label and labeling of the affected product(s). Exceptions
to these general rules will be made in specific cases when more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use
of the products or their ingredients have already been imposed, as in Special Review actions, or where the Agency has
identified significant potential risk concerns associated with a particular chemical.

<DOCTITLE>Testing Guidelines for Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice announces the availability of the proposed Health Effects Test Guidelines for developmental toxicity
and for reproductive and fertility effects and the start of a 60-day comment period. The documents were developed
to amend and replace specific Agency guideline documents currently used for testing pesticides and toxic substances
under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA),
respectively.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The OPPTS Health Effects Test Guidelines for developmental toxicity (OPPTS 870.3700) will replace the Subdivision
F Pesticide Assessment Guideline Section 83-3 (FIFRA) and 40 CFR 798.4900 (TSCA). The guideline for reproductive
and fertility effects (OPPTS 870.3800) will replace the Subdivision F Pesticide Assessment Guideline Section 83-4,
under FIFRA, and 40 CFR 798.4700, under TSCA. These revised guidelines were drafted by an inter-agency work group
comprised of experts in the areas of developmental and reproductive toxicity. The proposed testing requirements
incorporated into these developmental toxicity and reproductive and fertility effects guidelines were reviewed
at a joint meeting of the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) and the Science Advisory Board (SAB) in December, 1993.


The revised guidelines will significantly improve the Agency's ability to identify and characterize potential
effects on the reproductive system and/or the developing fetus from exposure to chemicals. Availability of these
revised guidelines will enhance the ability of pesticide registrants and industrial chemical manufacturers to
plan, estimate costs of, and design studies that EPA currently requires for pesticides under 40 CFR Part 158 or may
require by test rule or consent agreement for industrial chemicals.
All interested parties are encouraged to submit comments on the proposed draft guidelines for developmental and
reproductive toxicity studies. Specific comments should reference the document title, section number, and paragraph
or subparagraph of the proposed guideline. Recommended technical or scientific changes/modifications should
be supported by current scientific/technical knowledge and include supporting references.
Comments on the proposed guidelines will be considered by the Agency and such modifications of the guidelines as are
considered to be of scientific and technical merit will be considered for inclusion before the guidelines are published
in a final form.

National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; Health and Exposure Surveillance of Siberian 
Asbestos Miners Cooperative Agreement 


Summary 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a cooperative agreement with the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH) to evaluate workplace exposures
and conduct health assessments of workers exposed to asbestos in a large mining, milling, and production center located
in Asbest, Russia. Approximately $150,000 will be available in FY 1994 to fund the cooperative agreement. The award
will begin on or about September 30, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding
estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation award(s) within the project period will be made on the basis
of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 

The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to assist the FIOH in further developing and strengthening epidemiologic
research, surveillance and monitoring, 
and training in order to promote the further understanding of the prevention of occupational respiratory disease.


The CDC will provide scientific, epidemiologic, engineering, environmental, and clinical technical assistance
to the recipient, as needed, for successful completion of this project; collaborate with the recipient on the methods
for the collection, tabulation analysis, and publication of the data related to the project; assist in the development
of the overall plan or study design for this project; assist in the design and implementation of the evaluation plan
for the project; coordinate the training of the appropriate grantee staff in technical and scientific procedures
necessary for the successful completion of the project; and assist in the development of a series of symposia to present
findings, provide training, and provide for the dissemination of information relevant to the prevention of occupational
lung disease due to asbestos exposure. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of 

Healthy People 2000

, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement
is related to the priority area of Occupational Lung Disease. (For ordering 

Healthy People 2000,

Authority 



This program is authorized under Section 22(e)(7) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 671(e)(7)).




Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission of promoting the protection and advancement
of an individual's physical and mental health. 



Eligible Applicant 



Assistance will be provided only to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH) for conducting this evaluation.
No other applications will be solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to FIOH. The
FIOH is the only appropriate and qualified institution to provide the services specified under this cooperative
agreement for the following reasons: 

There is a large asbestos mining, milling, and production activity in Asbest, Siberia, which produces in excess of
1,100,000 tons of asbestos and 300,000,000 tons of crushed stone annually. This mine supplies all of Russia's asbestos
and is one of its major exporting resources. There is an existing medical surveillance program in effect for the more
than 10,000 employees which could be reviewed for major health effects of asbestos. Russia does not have the expertise
or resources to conduct this review and analysis. However, it has expressed a desire to collaborate with others to
accomplish this effort. 

Finland has an existing working relationship with Russia and has the expertise and ability to initiate and coordinate
a study of this magnitude. FIOH, NIOSH, and the Institute of Industrial Hygiene and Occupational Diseases of the Academy
of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia, all serve as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) Workers' Health
Program which has as one of its top priorities the prevention of occupational respiratory diseases. This shared focus
has enabled FIOH to develop a unique collaborative relationship with the Institute of Industrial Hygiene and Occupational
Diseases of the Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia. As a result of this relationship, FIOH will be granted
access to the Asbest mining region and will be given support from the requisite Russian agencies so that they can successfully
accomplish the work required under this cooperative agreement. No one in the United States or its territories has
this unique capability. 



Executive Order 12372 Review 



The applicant is not subject to review under Executive Order 12372. 



Public Health System Reporting Requirements 



This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements. 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number 



The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number for this program is 93.957. 



Other Requirements 



Human Subjects 



If the proposed project involves research on human subjects, the applicant must comply with the Department of Health
and Human Services Regulations, 45 CFR Part 46, regarding the protection of human subjects. Assurance must be provided
to demonstrate that the project will be subject to initial and continuing review by an appropriate institutional
review committee. The applicant will be responsible for providing assurance in accordance with the appropriate
guidelines and forms provided in the application kit. 



Where To Obtain Additional Information 



If you are interested in obtaining additional information regarding this project, please refer to Announcement
489 and contact Oppie M. Byrd, Grants Management Specialist, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office,

Asparagus Deviating From Identity Standard; Temporary Permit for Market Testing


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that a temporary permit has been issued to The Pillsbury Co. to
market test experimental packs of canned asparagus containing zinc chloride. The purpose of the temporary permit
is to allow the applicant to measure consumer acceptance of the food. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 21 CFR 130.17 concerning temporary permits to facilitate market testing of foods deviating from
the requirements of the standards of identity promulgated under section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (21 U.S.C. 341), FDA is giving notice that a temporary permit has been issued to The Pillsbury Co., Technology Center,
330 University Ave. SE., Minneapolis, MN 55414-2198. 


The permit covers limited interstate marketing tests of experimental packs of canned asparagus. The test product
deviates from the U.S. standard of identity for canned asparagus (21 CFR 155.200) in that the test product will contain
added zinc chloride in an amount necessary to retain the green color of the product (at a maximum level of 75 parts per
million of zinc in the finished food). The test product meets all requirements of the standard, with the exception
of the variation. 
This permit provides for the temporary marketing of 10 thousand cases, each containing 12 425-gram (15-ounce) cans,
of the test product. The product will be manufactured at Green Giant Co., 711 East Main St., Dayton, WA 99328-0026.
The product will be distributed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
For the purpose of this permit, the name of the product is ``canned asparagus.'' Each of the ingredients used in the
food must be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of 21 CFR parts 101 and 130. This permit is effective
for 15 months, beginning on the date the test product is introduced or caused to be introduced into interstate commerce,
but no later than November 15, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Aplin & Barrett Ltd.; Papetti's Hygrade Egg Products, Inc.; Filing of Petition for Affirmation of GRAS Status</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Aplin & Barrett Ltd., and Papetti's Hygrade Egg Products,
Inc., as copetitioners, have filed a petition (GRASP 4G0408) proposing to affirm that nisin preparation is generally
recognized as safe (GRAS) as an antimicrobial agent in various standardized and nonstandardized liquid egg products.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201(s) and 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 321(s) and 348(b)(5)) and the
regulations for affirmation of GRAS status in  170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Aplin & Barrett
Ltd., c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001; and Papetti's Hygrade Egg Products Inc., c/o 424 S. Washington
St., Alexandria, VA 22314, have filed a petition (GRASP 4G0408) proposing that nisin preparation be affirmed as GRAS
for use as an antimicrobial agent in standardized and nonstandardized liquid egg, egg whites, egg yolks, and blends
of these egg products.


The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in  170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and  170.35 is filed by the
agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition
for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation.
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact
statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding
of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the

<DOCTITLE>Fuji Oil Co., Ltd.; Filing of Petition for Affirmation of GRAS Status</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Fuji Oil Co., Ltd., has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0407),
proposing that a triglyceride containing behenic and oleic acids be affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)
for use as a tempering aid and as an antibloom agent in chocolate and chocolate coatings. The petitioner proposes that
bohenin be the common or usual name for this triglyceride.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 201(s) and 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 321(s) and 348(b)(5)) and the
regulations for affirmation of GRAS status in  170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Fuji Oil Co., Ltd.,
Osaka, Japan, has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0407), proposing that a triglyceride containing behenic and oleic acids
be affirmed as GRAS for use as a tempering aid and as an antibloom agent in chocolate and chocolate coatings. The petitioner
proposes that bohenin be the common or usual name for this triglyceride. 



The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above).

Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in  170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and  170.35 is filed by the
agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition
for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation.

The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact
statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding
of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).

Interested persons may, on or before October 17, 1994, review the petition and file comments with the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments should be filed and should be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments should include any available information that would be
helpful in determining whether the substance is, or is not, GRAS for the proposed use. In addition, consistent with
the regulations promulgated under the 


National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency encourages public participation by review of and
comment on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice. A copy of the
petition (including the environmental assessment) and received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that a joint final Environmental Impact Report/Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) has been prepared
by the Bureau of Land Management and the County of San Bernardino for the proposed Bolo Station Class III landfill.
The proposed Federal action comprises a land exchange involving 2.5 sections of public land, 2 rights-of-ways for
access and utilities, and a plan amendment to the California Desert Conservation Area (CDCA) Plan.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed land exchange involves 2.5 sections of public land of which 1.5 sections are designated Multiple Use
Class L (Limited Use) under the CDCA Plan. The proposed use as landfill is not consistent with the guidelines for Class
L, and the proposed amendment would designate the 1.5 sections as Class M (Moderate Use). The guidelines for Class
M allow disposal of public lands for potential landfill purposes. The proposed 3 sections of private land to be acquired
contain tortoise habitat, including critical habitat, recreational value and land in the proposed East Mojave National
Park.


The proposed landfill site is located between Amboy and Cadiz, south of Highway 66 and about 35 miles northeast of the
City of Twentynine Palms. The proposed landfill consists of 4800 acres of which 2100 acres would be used for the landfill.
Solid waste would be sorted and processed for recyclables at a Materials Recovery Facility in Southern California.
The residue would be packed into containers and transported by train to the Bolo Station site. At full operation, approximately
21,000 tons per day of solid waste would be transported, and the facility would be operated between 60-years and 100-years.
Besides the proposed action, two alternatives and a no-action alternative are analyzed. The EIR/EIS analyzes the
affects of the proposed action on such environmental issues as ground water, air quality, geology, visual resources
and wildlife among other resources. Copies of the Final EIR/EIS are located in the California Desert District Office,
Riverside, California and in the Needles Resource Area Office, 101 W. Spikes Rd., Needles, CA.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announces that the following described parcels of public land have been examined
and identified as suitable for disposal by sale under section 203 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA)
of 1976 (90 Stat. 2750; 43 U.S.C. 1713) at no less than the appraised fair market value shown. The parcels are isolated,
difficult and uneconomical to manage as part of the public land, and are suitable for management by another Federal
department or agency. The sale is consistent with the BLM's planning efforts, and the public interest will be served
by offering this land for sale. 




Sale Method 



Parcels 1 and 7 will be offered for sale using competitive bidding procedures (43 CFR 2711.3.-1). On parcel 3,
the bidding will be modified to allow bids from designated bidders only (43 CFR 2711.3-2). Parcels 2, 4, 5, and
6 will be offered to the listed parties through Direct sale procedures not less than 60 days from publication of this
notice (43 CFR 2711.3-3).

The sale of parcels 1 and 7 will be by competitive sealed bids followed by oral bidding. However, on parcel 3 competitive
bids will only be accepted from the designated bidders named below.

a.m., following the opening of all sealed bids, at the same place on the same sale date. Sealed bids of less than the appraised
fair market value will be rejected. The apparent highest qualified sealed bid will be publicly declared by the Authorized
Officer. The apparent highest qualified sealed bid will then become the starting point for the oral bidding. If no
apparent qualified sealed are received, the oral bidding will start at the appraised fair market value. In the absence
of oral bids, the apparent highest qualified sealed bid will establish the sale price for that parcel. In the event
that two or more sealed bids are received containing valid bids of the same amount for the same parcel, and no higher
oral bid is received for that parcel, the determination of which is to be considered the highest designated bid will
be by supplemental bidding. In such a case, the high bidders will be allowed to submit oral or sealed bids as designated
by the Authorized Officer. After oral bids, if any, are received, the highest qualifying bid, whether sealed or oral,
shall be declared by the Authorized Officer. 


Bidders must be 18 years of age or over and United States citizens, and corporations must be subject to the laws of any
State or of the United States. Apparent high bidders must submit proof of these requirements within 15 days after the
sale date.

Successful bidders, whether such bid is oral or sealed, will be required to pay the remainder of the full bid price prior
to the expiration of 180 days from the date of the sale. Failure to submit the full bid price within the above specified
time limit will result in cancellation of the sale of the specific parcel and the deposit will be forfeited and disposed
of as other receipts of sale.
All sealed bids will be either returned, accepted, or rejected within 30 days of the sale date. Competitive and Modified
Sale Parcels not sold on the day of the sale, will be reoffered for sale every first Tuesday of each month, same time and
place, by the same procedures described above until sold or until February 10, 1995 at close of business.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan Proposed Establishment of
Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge St. Tammany Parish, LA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan for the Proposed Establishment
of Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Southeast Region, proposes to establish a
national wildlife refuge in the vicinity of St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana. The purpose of the proposed refuge is to
protect, enhance, and manage a valuable wetland area known as the Big Branch Marsh, which is threatened by urban expansion
from the city of New Orleans. A Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan for the proposed refuge has
been developed by Service biologists in coordination with the State of Louisiana, the Northshore Coast Watch, the
Coalition to Restore Louisiana, the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, the St. Tammany Sportsmen's League, and
the St. Tammany Police Jury. The assessment considers the biological, environmental, and socioeconomic effects
of establishing the refuge. The assessment also evaluates three alternative actions and their potential impacts
on the environment. Written comments or recommendations concerning the proposal are welcomed and should be sent
to the address below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The primary objectives of the proposed Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge are to provide: (1) Habitat for a
natural diversity of wildlife associated with the Big Branch Marsh, (2) wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl,
(3) nesting habitat for wood ducks, (4) habitat for non-game migratory birds, and (5) opportunities for compatible
public outdoor recreation, such as hunting, fishing, hiking, birdwatching, and environmental education and interpretation.



The proposed refuge area is located along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana,
just south of the town of Lacombe. It is bordered by Cane Bayou on the west, Lake Pontchartrain on the south, and the Southern
Railway trestle on the east. The northern boundary runs along several parish roads and bayous which separate the marsh
from residential development south of U.S. Highway 190, an east-west highway that runs from Slidell to Mandeville,
Louisiana.

The proposed rufuge would consist of up to 12,000 acres of land acquired in fee title from willing sellers.

The major wildlife values are the numerous species of shorebirds, wading birds, neotropical migratory birds, and
wintering watefowl. Raptors include the osprey, northern harrier, peregrine falcon, and bald eagle. White-tailed
deer, mink, raccoon, and river otter are among the many species of mammals dependent on the area.

The entire area serves as an important nursery for fish, shrimp, and crabs and represents one of the better fish production
areas on Lake Pontchartrain. The estuaries, ponds, and bayous provide a diverse mix of brackish and freshwater habitats
for many species of saltwater and freshwater fish of both recreational and commercial importance.

<DOCTITLE>Draft General Management Plan/Implementation Plan Alternatives/Environmental Impact Statement for Lake Chelan
National Recreation Area, WA</DOCTITLE>


<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the availability of a draft general management plan/environmental impact statement (GMP/EIS)
and five implementation plans for Lake Chelan National Recreation Area (NRA). This notice also announces public
hearings for the purpose of receiving public comments on the draft documents.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Draft General Management Plan/Implementation Plan Alternatives/Environmental Impact Statement describes
and analyzes a proposed action and four alternatives for future management and use of Lake Chelan National Recreation
Area as required by the consent decree that was approved and entered on April 22, 1991, in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Washington (Civil Case No. C-89-1342D). Under the proposed action,
the National Park Service would not manipulate the Stehekin River or remove or manipulate woody debris except to protect
public roads and bridges. The active sand, rock, and gravel borrow pit would be maintained at less than or equal to its
current size. Fire suppression, prescribed natural fire, management-ignited prescribed fire, and selective manual
fuel reductions would be used to restore or replicate the natural role of fire. Firewood would be provided at fair market
value instead of a set permit fee and there would be no guaranteed cordage per year. The airstrip would remain open.
Land protection would emphasize high flood influence areas, wetlands, riparian areas, and high visual sensitivity
areas. Under the no-action/minimum requirements alternative, river erosion and flooding would be controlled only
to protect life, health, public roads, and bridges. Where feasible, federal lands would be treated with prescribed
fire to reduce fuels. Firewood would be obtained from harvesting 1-acre woodlots. The airstrip would remain open.
Land protection would emphasize wetlands, shoreline characteristics, high scenic quality, water quality, visitor
access, restriction of unsightly development, and development on areas with gradients greater than 20%. Under alternative
A, new river shoreline or bank protection structures would be prohibited. The mining of sand, rock, and gravel would
be prohibited within the valley. Natural ignitions would be suppressed on the valley floor for the protection of human
life and property. Woodlot cutting of firewood would stop immediately. The airstrip would be closed and restored
to natural conditions. The Stehekin Valley road between the Landing and Cottonwood Camp would be converted to a trail.
All NPS and concession housing and maintenance facilities would be substantially reduced and located at the Landing.
Land protection would involve acquisition, on a willing seller/willing buyer basis, or by eminent domain authority,
of all private lands within the recreation area. Under alternative B, riverbank protection structures would be allowed
if no adverse environmental impacts would result. Mining of sand, rock, and gravel in the valley would be prohibited.
Fire and forest fuels would be managed to restore or replicate the natural role of fire. Firewood would be provided
at fair market value instead of a set permit fee. There would be no guarantee of firewood cordage per year. The airstrip
would be closed. Land protection would emphasize high flood influence areas, wetlands, riparian areas, and high
visual sensitivity areas. Under alternative C, protection of public or private improvements threatened by river
erosion and flooding would be allowed. The size of the borrow put would remain constant. Selective manual forest fuel
reduction techniques would be used to reduce hazard forest fuel loadings. Firewood would be supplied from administrative
wood and natural selection ecoforestry selective cutting from a designated area. The airstrip would be managed by
the National Park Service for emergency use only. Land protection would emphasize high flood influence areas, wetlands,
and high visual sensitivity areas. Major impact topics assessed for the proposed action and alternatives include
natural and cultural resources and the socioeconomic environment, including the local and regional economy.

<USDEPT>UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

United States International Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Institution and scheduling of a review investigation concerning the Commission's affirmative determination in
investigation No. 731-TA-473 (Final), Certain Electric Fans from the People's Republic of China (China).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission hereby gives notice that it has initiated an investigation pursuant to section 751(b) of the Tariff
Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.  1675(b)) (the Act) to review its determination in investigation No. 731-TA-473
(Final). The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether an industry in the United States would be materially
injured, or would be threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States would
be materially retarded, by reason of imports of ceiling fans from China if the antidumping order regarding such merchandise
were to be modified or revoked.
 Ceiling fans are provided for in subheading 8414.51.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.





For further information concerning the conduct of this investigation, hearing procedures, and rules of general
application, consult the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, part 201, subparts A through E (19 CFR part
201), and part 207, subparts A and E (19 CFR part 207).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Background._

On October 25, 1991, the Department of Commerce determined that imports of ceiling fans from China are being sold in
the United States at less than fair value (LTFV) within the meaning of section 731 of the Act (19 U.S.C.  1673)
(56 F.R. 55271, October 25, 1991) (an amendment to its determination, modifying the margins according to specific
companies, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 9, 1991 (56 F.R. 64240)); and on December 2, 1991, the Commission determined, pursuant to section 735(b)(1)
of the Act (19 U.S.C.  1673d(b)(1)), that an industry in the United States was materially injured by reason by
imports of such LTFV merchandise. Accordingly, Commerce ordered that dumping duties be imposed on such imports (December
9, 1991, 56 F.R. 64240).
 On March 2, 1994, however, Commerce published in the 

Federal Register

 a revision of its original dumping determination, effectively excluding one of the Chinese producers from the order
and reducing the margin for non-specified firms (59 F.R. 9956, March 2, 1994).




On May 4, 1994, the Commission received a request to review its affirmative determination in investigation No. 731-TA-473
(Final) pursuant to section 751(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C.  1675(b)). The request was filed by Encon Industries,
Inc., Fort Worth, TX. On June 10, 1994, the Commission requested written comments in the 

Federal Register

 (59 F.R. 30036) as to whether the changed circumstances alleged by the petition were sufficient to warrant a review
investigation. On August 10, 1994, after reviewing comments received in response to that request, the Commission
determined that the alleged changed circumstances were sufficient to warrant a review investigation.

Persons wishing to participate in the investigation as parties must file an entry of appearance with the Secretary
to the Commission, as provided in section 201.11 of the Commission's rules, not later than twenty-one (21) days after

Federal Register

. The Secretary will prepare a public service list containing the names and addresses of all persons, or their representatives,
who are parties to this investigation upon the expiration of the period for filing entries of appearance.

Federal Register

. A separate service list will be maintained by the Secretary for those parties authorized to receive BPI under the
APO.

The deadline for filing posthearing briefs is November 4, 1994; witness testimony must be filed no later than three
(3) days before the hearing. In addition, any person who has not entered an appearance as a party to the investigation
may submit a written statement of information pertinent to the subject of the investigation on or before November
4, 1994. All written submissions must conform with the provisions of section 201.8 of the Commission's rules; any
submissions that contain BPI must also conform with the requirements of sections 201.6, 207.3, and 207.7 of the Commission's
rules.

be served on all other parties to the investigation (as identified by either the public or BPI service list), and a certificate
of service must be timely filed. The Secretary will not accept a document for filing without a certificate of service.

Determination


On the basis of the record
 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines,
 pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.  1673d(b)) (the Act), that an industry in the United
States is materially injured by reason of imports from Italy of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel, provided
for in subheadings 7225.10.00, 7226.10.10, and 7226.10.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States,
that have been found by the Department of Commerce to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV).





Background


The Commission instituted this investigation effective January 28, 1994, following a preliminary determination
by the Department of Commerce that imports of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel from Italy were being sold
at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C.  1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the
Commission's investigation and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies
of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing
the notice in the 

Federal Register 

of February 23, 1994 (59 F.R. 8658). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on April 12, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.
The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on August 8, 1994.
The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2800 (August 1994), entitled ``Grain-Oriented Silicon
Electrical Steel from Italy: Investigation No. 731-TA-659 (Final).''




Issued: August 10, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Certain Seamless Carbon and Alloy Standard, Line, and Pressure Steel Pipe From Argentina, Brazil, Germany, and Italy</DOCTITLE>


Determinations


On the basis of the record
 developed in the subject investigations, the Commission unanimously determines,
 pursuant to sections 703(a) and 733(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, (19 U.S.C.  1671b(a)) and (19 U.S.C.  1673b(a)),
respectively, that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured by
reason of imports from Italy of certain seamless carbon and alloy standard, line, and pressure steel pipe
 that are alleged to be subsidized by the Government of Italy and by reason of imports from Argentina, Brazil, Italy,
and Germany of certain seamless carbon and alloy standard, line, and pressure steel pipe that are alleged to be sold
in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV).







Background


On June 23, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the Gulf States Tube Division
of Quanex Corp., Rosenberg, TX, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened
with material injury by reason of imports from Italy of certain seamless carbon and alloy standard, line, and pressure
steel pipe that are alleged to be subsidized by the Government of Italy and by reason of LTFV imports from Argentina,
Brazil, Germany, and Italy of such pipe. Accordingly, effective June 23, 1994, the Commission instituted countervailing
duty investigation No. 701-TA-362 (Preliminary) and antidumping investigations Nos. 731-TA-707-710
(Preliminary).
Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith
was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register 

of June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33780). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on July 14, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.
The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on August 8,
1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2801 (August 1994), entitled ``Certain Seamless
Carbon and Alloy Standard, Line, and Pressure Steel Pipe from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, and Italy: Investigations
Nos. 701-TA-362 and 731-TA-707 through 710 (Preliminary).''

to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, BC2901230, as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged
that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f).
Specifically, the Order to Show Cause alleged that between January 1992 and February 1993, Respondent allowed an
unauthorized person to order controlled substances by permitting this person to use Respondent's DEA number; this
person also used Respondent's DEA number to issue unauthorized prescriptions during this time period in question;
this person used the controlled substances obtained in this manner to perform unlawful abortions, one of which resulted
in the death of one of the patients; and Respondent dispensed controlled substances at an unregistered location during
the time period in question.
The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail. More than thirty days have passed since the Order
to Show Cause was received by Respondent and the DEA has received no response thereto. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d)
and 1301.54(e), Respondent is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator
now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based upon the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57.
In January of 1993, the Santa Ana Police Department discovered the body of a female in an alley, at or near a medical clinic,
the Clinica Femenina (clinic). Subsequent investigation revealed that the death of the female was caused by a failed
abortion attempt performed at the clinic by the owner who was not authorized to practice medicine (and thus not licensed
to perform abortions) in the State of California. An autopsy revealed that diazepam, a Schedule IV controlled substance,
was in the deceased's system.


A search warrant was served on the clinic by the Santa Ana Police Department on January 21, 1993. The search revealed
that the owner had ordered over 8,000 dosage units of controlled substances using Respondent's DEA number. The search
also revealed that the owner issued prescriptions for various controlled substances using Respondent's DEA number.
The clinic was not Respondent's DEA registered location and, in fact, did not have a DEA registration. The owner was
subsequently arrested by the Santa Ana police and charged with manslaughter and the matter is pending trial at this
time.


Shortly after the search warrant was served, Respondent was interviewed by the Santa Ana police and an investigator
of the California Medical Board. Respondent admitted to them that he allowed the clinic to use his DEA registration
number to order controlled substances to obtain drugs used in conjunction with abortions. Respondent explained
that he was hired to perform abortions on an as needed basis and was paid $80 for each abortion. He performed an abortion
about once a week or every other week. He was aware that the owner was not a licensed physician. He was not aware that the
owner had issued controlled substance prescriptions using his DEA number. Respondent also noted that there were
occasions that the owner called him to perform an abortion on short notice but that Respondent was unable to make the
appointment. When Respondent inquired of the owner how the operation had been performed, she simply explained that
the patient ``had been taken care of''. Respondent also explained that the owner had witnessed him perform abortions
on numerous occasions and that she could probably perform the operation, barring any unforeseen complications.


In evaluating whether Respondent's registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration would be inconsistent
with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator considers the factors enumerated in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). They are
as follows:

(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.

(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

<DOCNO> FR940817-2-00132 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940817-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances. 

(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. 

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. 

In determining whether a registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator
is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, he has the discretion to
give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. See David
E. Trawick, D.D.S., 

Docket No. 88-69, 53 FR 5326 (1988). 

In this proceeding factors, two, four and five apply. Respondent allowed an unauthorized person to use his DEA number
to order controlled substances for dispensing and administering controlled substances at an unregistered location.
Respondent allowed the clinic's owner to acquire and dispense controlled substances through the use of Respondent's
DEA registration number. Under the circumstances, Respondent knew or should have known that the clinic's owner would
use his DEA number, not only for ordering, dispensing and issuing prescriptions for controlled substances, but also
for administering during unauthorized abortions. 

By allowing an unregistered and unauthorized person to use his DEA number, Respondent was responsible for any use
and misuse of that number. Moreover, such a violation is aggravated by the fact that Respondent allowed a non-practitioner
to use his DEA number at an unregistered location. 



Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
BC2901230, previously issued to Anthony L. Cappelli, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and any pending applications
for the renewal of such registration, be, and they are, denied. This order is effective September 16, 1994.

to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale of shares of such Plans cannot be executed within one business
day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale; and 

(2) failure by the Second Fiduciary to return the Termination Form on behalf of a Plan will be deemed to be an approval
of the additional Secondary Service for which a fee is charged or increase in the rate of any fees, if such Termination
Form is supplied pursuant to paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section II, and will result in the continuation of the authorization,
as described in paragraph (h) of this section II, of the Bank to engage in the transactions on behalf of such Plan; 

(n) The Second Fiduciary is supplied with a Termination Form, annually during the first quarter of each calendar year,
beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year that begins after the date the grant of this proposed exemption
is published in the

Fiduciary, pursuant to paragraph (n) of this section II, sooner than six months after such Termination Form is supplied

Bank by such Fund;

(i) The term, ``Termination Form,'' means the form supplied to the Second Fiduciary, at the times specified in paragraphs
(k), (l), and (n) of section II above, which expressly provides an election to the Second Fiduciary to terminate on
behalf of the Plans the authorization, described in paragraph (h) of section II. Such Termination Form may be used
at will by the Second Fiduciary to terminate such authorization without penalty to the Plans and to notify the Bank
in writing to effect such termination by selling the shares of the Fund held by the Plans requesting termination within
one business day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile, or other available means
at the option of the Second Fiduciary, of written notice of such request for termination; provided that if, due to circumstances
beyond the control of the Bank, the sale cannot be executed within one business day, the Bank shall have one additional
business day to complete such sale.

2. The Plans involved in the transactions for which the Bank requests exemptive relief are numerous Plans for which
the Bank has acted or will act as fiduciary and has exercised or will exercise investment discretion with respect to
all or a portion of the assets of such Plans.

2

 For this reason, certain specific information relating to each individual involved Plan does not appear in the application.
However, it is anticipated that the Plans include or will include various employee benefit plans, as defined by section
3(3) of the Act, and certain plans or trusts, as described in section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. These Plans are sponsored
or maintained by parties unrelated to the Bank.

3

 Such Plans include, among others: (1) pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, and other retirement plans which are
qualified for tax purposes under section 401(a) of the Code, (2) voluntary employees' beneficiary associations
and other welfare benefit plans, and (3) individual retirement accounts and simplified employee pension plans,
as described in section 408 of the Code. The Bank serves as fiduciary to these Plans through the management of the CIFs
in which the Plans invest or through providing individual management or advice to the Plans. 






It is represented that the Bank, as of October 23, 1992, had under management approximately $760 million in assets
from approximately 400 Plans. The Bank receives compensation for serving as fiduciary with respect to these Plans
in accordance with standard published fee schedules or as otherwise agreed upon by the Bank and the sponsors of such
Plans.

4 







3. The Bank or its affiliates also provide services to numerous Funds. The Funds are open-end investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Because the Bank would like the exemption to apply prospectively
to any Fund to which the Bank or any of its affiliates may provide services, the Bank represents that it cannot supply
detailed information on each such future Fund. However, the Bank has provided a detailed description with respect
to a certain Fund, the HighMark Group (HighMark), which is currently operating and to which it provides services.
The Bank represents that all future Funds will assume similar structures and Plan investments therein will be subject
to the terms and conditions of this exemption. The structure of HighMark is summarized in paragraph 4 below. To the
extent Plans for which the Bank serves as fiduciary are currently invested in HighMark, the Bank represents that such
investments were made in compliance with Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77-4 (PTCE 77-4).

5 







4. HighMark, a Massachusetts business trust organized on March 10, 1987, is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 as a diversified, open-end, management investment company. HighMark is governed by a board of trustees
(the HighMark Trustees), all of whom are independent of the Bank. MERUS, a division of the Bank, acts as investment
adviser to HighMark. In the context of registered investment companies, the term ``investment adviser'' generally
refers to the entity that has investment management authority with respect to the assets of the investment company.
In this regard, subject to the general supervision of the HighMark Trustees, MERUS manages each of the separate investment
portfolios within HighMark in accordance with the investment objectives, and policies of each portfolio, makes
decisions with respect to and places orders for all purchases and sales of securities, and maintains records with
respect thereto. In addition, the Bank serves as custodian, sub-administrator, sub-transfer agent, and sub-accountant
to HighMark. It is represented that the Bank may in the future seek to serve in additional capacities for and to provide
additional services to HighMark. 

HighMark consists of separate investment portfolios with combined total net assets of approximately $1 billion.
It is represented that currently there are eight (8) portfolios in HighMark. Three of these portfolios are invested
in money market instruments (the Money Market Portfolios), and three are invested primarily in non-money market
debt or equity securities (the Non-Money Market Portfolios). The remaining two portfolios of HighMark are the California
Tax-Free Fund, and the Tax-Free Fund.

6 

In addition to these portfolios, HighMark is in the process of establishing two additional portfolios, the Balanced
Fund and the Growth Fund, and may establish other portfolios. 





In the future HighMark may modify, reorganize, or terminate any or all of its portfolios. All existing portfolios
and any portfolios established or modified in the future will be available for investment by the Plans, if deemed appropriate
under the circumstances, as authorized by the Second Fiduciary, and if based on criteria set forth in section 404 of
the Act. However, it is represented that the Bank does not expect the Plans ordinarily to be invested in tax-free funds.

Winsbury Company (Winsbury), located in Columbus, Ohio, serves as the general manager, administrator, and principal
underwriter of HighMark. For these administrative services, Winsbury receives fees computed daily at .20% of the
average net assets of each portfolio of HighMark. Winsbury also receives fees from HighMark for serving as the distributor
of shares in HighMark. Pursuant to a plan of distribution implemented only with respect to the Class A shares for the
Money Market Portfolios, HighMark pays out of the assets attributable to such shares monthly fees to Winsbury in accordance
with Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 12b-1 Fees) equal to .25% of the average daily
net assets attributable to such shares.

7

 An affiliate of Winsbury, the Winsbury Service Corporation (Winsbury Service), is the transfer agent, accountant,
and shareholder servicing agent of HighMark. Winsbury and Winsbury Service are unrelated to the Bank. 





5. Because the Bank recognizes that (1) in-kind transfers to Funds that the Bank services or advises of all or a 

pro rata 

portion of Plan assets in the CIFs or all or a 

pro rata 

portion of Plan assets that the Bank otherwise manages, and (2) the approval process for additional services for which
a fee is charged and fee increases by the Bank for these services may be outside the scope of PTCE 77-4, the Bank
has requested relief for the transactions described in section I and II. Each of these transactions is discussed more
fully in paragraphs 6, 7, 8, and 9 below. The exemption for each of the transactions involving HighMark is conditioned
on the satisfaction of certain requirements and compliance with various general conditions which are also discussed
below. It is the Bank's expressed intention that the description of these transactions and the conditions of the requested
exemption with respect to such transactions were and will be applicable uniformly to HighMark and to any of the other
Funds for which the Bank serves as the investment advisor and in which the Plans invest. 



In-Kind Transfers to Funds

6. It is represented that the Bank has maintained CIFs in which the Plans have invested in accordance with Regulation
9 promulgated by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Internal Revenue Service. The Bank has decided to terminate
certain CIFs and to offer to the Plans participating in such CIFs appropriate interests in certain Funds as alternative
investments. Because interests in CIFs generally must be liquidated or withdrawn to effect distributions, the Bank
believes that the interests of the Plans invested in CIFs would be better served by investment in shares of the Funds
which can be distributed in-kind. Also, the Bank believes that the Funds offer the Plans numerous advantages as pooled
investment vehicles. In this regard, the Plans, as shareholders of a Fund, have the opportunity to exercise voting
and other shareholder rights. 

The Plans, as shareholders of the Funds, as mandated by the SEC, periodically receive certain disclosures concerning
the Funds: (1) a copy of the prospectus which is updated annually; (2) an annual report containing audited financial
statements of the Funds and information regarding such Funds performance (unless such performance information
is included in the prospectus of such Funds); (3) a semi-annual report containing unaudited financial statements;
and (4) at the option of the Funds other pertinent information. With respect to the Plans, the Bank reports all transactions
in shares of the Funds in periodic account statements provided the Second Fiduciary of each of the Plans. Further,
the Bank maintains that the investment performance of the portfolios of the Funds can be monitored daily from information
available in newspapers of general circulation.

In order to avoid the potentially large brokerage expenses that would otherwise be incurred, the Bank proposes that
from time to time assets of the CIFs be transferred in-kind to corresponding portfolios of the Funds in exchange for
shares of such Funds. In this regard, some Funds may, as in the case of HighMark, be in existence and operating at the
time of the in-kind transfer of such assets. Some Funds may be created to assume the assets of the terminating CIF. Similarly,
the Bank proposes that from time to time it may be appropriate for an individual Plan for which the Bank serves as fiduciary
to transfer all or a 

pro rata

 share of its assets in-kind to any of the Funds in exchange for shares of such Funds. In this regard, for example, in the
case of an in-kind exchange between an individual Plan whose portfolio consists of common stock, money market securities,
and real estate, and a Fund that, under its investment policy, invests only in common stock and money market securities,
the exchange would involve all or a 

pro rata

 share of the common stock and money market securities held by the Plan, if such stock and securities are eligible for
purchase by the Fund,
 and would not involve the transfer or exchange of the real estate holdings of such Plan. No brokerage commission or
other fees or expenses (other than customary transfer charges paid to parties other than the Bank or its affiliates)
have been or will be charged to the Plans or the CIFs in connection with the in-kind transfers of assets into the Funds
and the acquisition of shares of the Funds by the Plans or the CIFs. Thus, in addition to retroactive relief, the Bank
has requested prospective relief for transactions which would involve: (1) the in-kind transfer by the CIFs of all
or a 

pro rata

 portion of the assets of any of the Plans held in such CIFs to the Funds in exchange for shares of the Fund which subsequently
are distributed to the Plans; or (2) the in-kind transfer of all or a 

pro rata

 portion of the assets of any of the Plans held by the Bank in any capacity as fiduciary on behalf of such Plans to the Funds
in exchange for shares of such Funds; provided that conditions described in section I above are satisfied. 





The Bank maintains that the transfers in-kind of assets in exchange for shares of the Funds are ministerial transactions
performed in accordance with pre-established objective procedures which are approved by the board of trustees of
each Fund. Such procedures require that assets transferred to a Fund: (1) are consistent with the investment objectives,
policies, and restrictions of the corresponding portfolios of such Fund, (2) satisfy the applicable requirements
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Code, (3) have a readily ascertainable market, (4) are liquid, and (5)
are not subject to restrictions on resale. It is represented that assets which do not meet these requirements will
be sold in the open market through an unaffiliated brokerage firm prior to any transfer in-kind. Further, as described
in section I, prior to entering into an in-kind transfer each affected Plan receives certain disclosures from the
Bank and approves such transaction in writing. 

The Bank represents that valuation of assets transferred in-kind to the Funds will be established by reference to
independent sources. In this regard, for purposes of the transaction, it is represented that all assets transferred
in-kind are valued in accordance with the valuation procedures described in Rule 17a-7(b) under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement. Further, the
Bank represents that within thirty (30) days of the completion of a transfer in-kind, it will provide to Plans written
confirmation of the identity of each security valued under Rule 17a-7(b)(4), the price of each security, and the identity
of each pricing service or market maker consulted in determining the value of the assets transferred. The securities
subject to valuation under Rule 17(a)-7(b)(4) include all securities other than ``reported securities,'' as the
term is defined in Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act), or those quoted on the
NASDAQ system or for which the principal market is an exchange. 

It is represented that the value of the assets transferred in-kind will be equal to the aggregate value of the corresponding
portfolios shares of the Fund at the close of business on the date of the transaction. In this regard, it is represented
that for all conversion transactions that occur after the date of this proposed exemption, the Bank, no later than
ninety (90) days after completion of each in-kind transfer of assets of the Plans or the CIFs in exchange for shares
of the Funds, will mail to the Second Fiduciary a written confirmation of the number of CIF units held by each affected
Plan immediately before the conversion (and the related per unit value or the aggregate dollar value of the units transferred),
and the number of shares in the Funds that are held by each affected Plan following the conversion (and the related per
share net asset value or the aggregate dollar value of the shares received).

7. The Bank has requested retroactive relief, for the in-kind transfer to HighMark that occurred over the weekend
of November 12, 1993. It is represented that on the weekend of November 12, 1993, all of the assets of five CIFs
, which were maintained by the Bank and in which the Plans held interests, were transferred to HighMark in exchange
for an appropriate number of shares of certain portfolios of HighMark which have investment objectives and policies
substantially identical to those of the CIFs. At the same time, the five CIFs were terminated and the assets of each,
then consisting of shares in portfolios of HighMark, were distributed in-kind to the Plans participating in such
CIFs based on each Plan's 

pro rata

 share of the assets of the CIFs on the date of the transaction. 





The Bank provided to the Second Fiduciary for each affected Plan disclosures that announced the termination of the
CIFs, summarized the transaction, and otherwise complied with provisions of Section I. It is represented that based
on these disclosures, the Second Fiduciary from each affected Plan approved in writing the transfer of the CIFs assets
to the corresponding portfolios of HighMark, the investment of the assets of the Plans in shares of HighMark, and the
receipt by the Bank of fees for services to HighMark and to the Plans. It is represented that the assets of Plans that
did not approve investment in HighMark were withdrawn from the CIFs and held or invested in appropriate alternative
investments in accordance with the terms of such Plans. 

Prior to the transaction, the assets of the five CIFs were reviewed to confirm that such were appropriate investments
for the corresponding portfolios of HighMark into which such assets were transferred. If any of the assets of the five
CIFs were not appropriate for HighMark, it is represented that the Bank sold such assets in the open market through
an unaffiliated brokerage firm prior to the transfer. 

It is represented that the assets transferred by the five CIFs to HighMark consisted entirely of cash and marketable
securities. For purposes of the transfer in-kind, the value of the securities in each of the five CIFs were determined
based on market values as of the close of business on November 12, 1993, the last business date prior to the transfer.
It is represented that the values were determined in a single valuation using the valuation procedures described
in Rule 17a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In this regard, it is represented that the ``current market
price'' for specific types of CIF securities involved in the transaction was determined as follows: 

(1) If the security was a ``reported security'' as the term is defined in Rule 11Aa3-1 under the 1934 Act, the last
sale price with respect to such security reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system (the Consolidated
System) for November 12, 1993; or if there were no reported transactions in the Consolidated System that day, the average
of the highest independent bid and the lowest independent offer for such security (reported pursuant to Rule 11Ac1-1
under the 1934 Act), as of the close of business on November 12, 1993; or 

(2) If the security was not a reported security, and the principal market for such security was an exchange, then the
last sale on such exchange on November 12, 1993; or if there were no reported transactions on such exchange that day,
the average of the highest independent bid and lowest independent offer on such exchange as of the close of business
on November 12, 1993; or 

(3) If the security was not a reported security and was quoted in the NASDAQ system, then the average of the highest independent
bid and lowest independent offer reported on Level 1 of NASDAQ as of the close of business on November 12, 1993; or 

(4) For all other securities, the average of the highest independent bid and lowest independent offer as of the close
of business on November 12, 1993, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry. For securities in this category,
the Bank represents that it obtained quotations from at least three sources that were either broker-dealers or pricing
services independent of and unrelated to the Bank and, where more than one valid quotation was available, used the
average of the quotations to value the securities, in conformance with interpretations by the SEC and practice under
Rule 17a-7. 

It is represented that the securities received by the corresponding portfolio of HighMark were valued by such portfolio
for purposes of the transfer in the same manner and on the same day as such securities were valued by the CIFs. The per
share 
value of the shares of each portfolio of HighMark issued to the CIFs were based on the corresponding portfolio's then
current net asset value. It is represented that the aggregate value of the shares of the corresponding portfolio of
HighMark issued to the CIFs were equal to the value of the assets (cash and marketable securities) transferred to such
portfolio as of the close of business on November 12, 1993. It is also represented that the value of a Plan's investment
in shares of a corresponding portfolio of HighMark as of the opening of business on the first business day after the
transaction (November 15, 1993) was equal to the value of such Plan's investment in the CIF as of the close of business
on the last business day prior to the transaction (November 12, 1993). 

It is represented that not later than thirty (30) days after completion of the transaction (December 15, 1993), the
Bank sent by regular mail a written confirmation of the transaction to each affected Plan. Such confirmation contained:
(1) the identity of each security that was valued in accordance with Rule 17a7(b)(4), as described in the paragraph
7(4) above; (2) the price of each such security for purposes of the transaction; and (3) the identity of each pricing
service or market maker consulted in determining the value of such securities. To reiterate the above discussion,
and in accordance with the conditions under section I, similar procedures will occur upon any future in-kind exchanges
between CIFs maintained by the Bank, Plans, and the Funds. 



Receipt of Fees From Funds 



8. It is represented that the Bank currently invests assets of the Plans it manages in shares of the Funds in accordance
with the conditions set forth in PTCE 77-4. Under certain conditions, PTCE 77-4 permits the Bank to receive
fees from the Funds under either of two circumstances: (a) where a Plan does not pay any investment management, investment
advisory, or similar fees with respect to the assets of such Plan invested in shares of a Fund for the entire period of
such investment; or (b) where a Plan pays investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees to the Bank
based on the total assets of such Plan from which a credit has been subtracted representing such Plan's 

pro rata

 share of such investment advisory fees paid to the Bank by the Fund. As such, it is represented that there are two levels
of fees_those fees which the Bank charges to the Plans for serving as trustee with investment discretion or as investment
manager (the Plan-level fees); and those fees the Bank charges to the Funds (the Fund-level fees) for serving as investment
advisor, custodian, or service provider.

It is represented that at present the vast majority of Plans for which the Bank acts as a fiduciary do not pay any separate
Plan-level investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees with respect to the assets of such Plans
invested in shares of the Funds. A few Plans, however, continue to pay Plan-level investment management, investment
advisory, and similar fees and receive credits which represent each of the Plans 

pro rata 

share of investment advisory fees paid to the Bank by the Funds. The Bank represents that Plan-level fees currently
charged are paid monthly and are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets of a Plan with respect to
which the Bank provides services. It is represented that Plan-level investment management, investment advisory
or similar fees for all of the services provided by the Bank, including services in connection with the automated cash
``sweep'' arrangement, are charged in the form of a single asset-based fee. It is represented that Plan-level fees
are subject to annual minimums for administration and management expressed as flat dollar amounts and are subject
to the application of certain ``break points.'' In addition to the Plan-level fees for investment management, investment
advisory, or similar services, a one-time fee (also a flat dollar amount) may be charged in connection with the establishment
of an account for a Plan, and separate transaction fees may be charged for various administrative transactions, such
as for example, a participant loan. It is represented that depending on the terms of the governing documents of the
Plan, Plan-level fees are paid to the Bank either by the sponsor of the Plan or from the assets of the Plan. 
As mentioned above, the Bank also receives Fund-level fees. Such Fund-level fees can be divided into: (1) fees paid
to the Bank by a Fund for investment management, investment advisory, or similar services provided to such Fund, and
(2) fees paid to the Bank for administrative, custodial, transfer, accounting, and other Secondary Services provided
either to such Fund or to the distributor of shares of such Funds and its affiliates. For example, with respect to investment
management/advisory services and Secondary Services, the current fee arrangements between the Bank and HighMark
provide for: (1) MERUS, a division of the Bank, to receive fees from HighMark for acting as investment advisor, (2)
the Bank to receive custodian fees from HighMark, (3) the Bank to receive fees from Winsbury for serving as sub-administrator
to HighMark, and (4) the Bank to receive fees from Winsbury Services for services as sub-accountant and sub-transfer
agent provided to HighMark. It is represented that this compensation paid to the Bank for investment advisory services
and Secondary Services is in accordance with various agreements between Winsbury, Winsbury Service, HighMark,
and the Bank. In this regard, it is represented that the HighMark Trustees and the shareholders of HighMark approve
the compensation that the Bank receives from HighMark. Also, the HighMark Trustees approve any changes in the compensation
paid to the Bank for services rendered to HighMark. 
It is represented that the Fund-level fees from HighMark are computed daily and billed monthly. The Bank represents
that at the end of each month and promptly upon receipt of the Fund-level fees from HighMark, for those Plans which pay
to the Bank Plan-level investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees, the Bank currently credits
to each Plan its 

pro rata

 share of all investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees charged by the Bank to HighMark. 
9. Under the fee structure proposed in this exemption, it is represented that the arrangement for Plan-level fees
where assets of the Plans managed by the Bank are invested in the Funds is different in several respects from that described
in paragraph 8 above. In this regard, a separate Plan-level fee will be charged to the Plans for basic administrative
services not including investment management.
 Such administrative services would include, among others, the Bank's acting as custodian of the assets of a Plan,
maintaining the records of a Plan, preparing periodic reports concerning the status of the Plan and its assets, and
accounting for contributions, benefit distributions, and other receipts and disbursements. It is represented
that these functions performed by the Bank on the Plan-level are separate and distinct from those performed on the
Fund-level by the Bank, by Winsbury, and by Winsbury Services. 




It is represented that the Bank will continue to receive compensation from the Plans for investment management services
provided with respect to assets of the Plans 

not 

invested in shares of any of the Funds. However, under the proposed fee structure, the Bank will no longer credit to
any of the Plans their 

pro rata 

share of the investment advisory fees, as described in paragraph 8 above, because the Plans will no longer pay Plan-level
fees to the Bank for investment advisory services with respect to any of the assets of the Plans invested in shares of
any of the Funds. Instead, the compensation received by the Bank for investment advisory services will be that which
is paid by the Funds to the Bank for such services rendered to such Funds. In addition, the Bank will continue to retain
fees for providing Secondary Services to the Funds.

The applicant maintains that this proposed fee arrangement complies with PTCE 77-4. However, there is one difference
from PTCE 77-4 requested by the Bank for which an exemption is required. In this regard, one of the requirements
of PTCE 77-4 has been that any change in any of the rates of fees would require prior written approval by the Second
Fiduciary of the Plans participating in the Funds. The applicant maintains that where many Plans participate in a
Fund, the addition of a service or any good faith increase in fees could not be implemented until written approval of
such change is obtained from every Second Fiduciary. The applicant proposes an alternative which the Bank maintains
provides the basic safeguards for the Plans and is more efficient, cost effective, and administratively feasible
than those contained in PTCE 77-4. 




It is represented that in the event of an increase in the rate of any investment management fees, investment advisory
fees, or similar fees, the addition of a Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or an increase in the fees for Secondary
Services paid by the Funds to the Bank over an existing rate that had been authorized by the Second Fiduciary, the Bank
will provide, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service or fee increase,
to the Second Fiduciary of all the Plans invested in such Fund a written notice of such additional service or fee increase,
(which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter, or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus
of the Fund and which explains the nature and amount of the additional service or the nature and amount of the increase
in fees). In this regard, such increase in fees for Secondary Services can result either from an increase in the rate
of such fee or from the decrease in the number or kind of services performed by the Bank for such fee over that which had
been authorized by the Second Fiduciary of a Plan. It is represented that providing notice in this way will give the
Second Fiduciary of each of the Plans adequate opportunity to decide whether or not to continue the authorization
of a Plan's investment in any of the portfolios of the Funds in light of the increase in investment management fees,
investment advisory fees, or similar fees, the additional Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or the increase
in fees for any Secondary Services. In addition, the Bank represents that such fee increase will be disclosed to the
Secondary Fiduciaries in a supplement to the Fund's prospectus in the case of an increase in fees for investment management,
investment advisory, or similar services and in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information in the case of an additional
Secondary Service for which a fee is charged or an increase in the fees for Secondary Services. 
10. It is represented that the written notice of an additional service for which a fee is charged or a fee increase, as
described in paragraph 9 above, will be accompanied by a Termination Form, as defined in paragraph (i) of section III,
and by instructions on the use of such form, as described in paragraph (m) of section II, which expressly provide an
election to the Second Fiduciaries to terminate at will any prior authorizations without penalty to the Plans. In
addition, it is represented that the Second Fiduciary will be supplied with a Termination Form annually during the
first quarter of each calendar year, beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year that begins after the date
the grant of this proposed exemption is published in the 

Federal Register

 and continuing for each calendar year thereafter, regardless of whether there have been any changes in the fees payable
to the Bank or changes in other matters in connection with services rendered to the Funds. However, if the Termination
Form has been provided to the Second Fiduciary in the event of an increase in the rate of any investment management fees,
investment advisory fees, or similar fees, an addition of a Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or an increase
in any fees for Secondary Services paid by the Fund to the Bank, then such Termination Form need not be provided again
to the Second Fiduciary until at least six months have elapsed, unless such Termination Form is required to be sent
sooner as a result of another increase in any investment management fees, investment advisory fees, or similar fees,
the addition of a Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or an increase in any fees for Secondary Services. 
The Termination Form will contain instructions regarding its use which will state expressly that the authorization
is terminable at will by a Second Fiduciary, without penalty to any Plan, and that failure to return the form will be
deemed to be an approval of the additional Secondary Service or the increase in the rate of any fees and will result in
the continuation of all authorizations previously given by such Second Fiduciary. It is represented that termination
by any Plan of authorization to invest in the Funds will be effected by the Bank selling the shares of the Fund held by
the affected Plan within one business day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile,
or other available means at the option of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written notice
of termination. If, due to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale cannot be executed within one business
day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale. 
11. It is represented that the rates paid by each of the portfolios of the Funds to the Bank for services rendered may
differ depending on the fee schedule for each portfolio and on the daily net assets in each portfolio. The investment
advisory fees paid to the Bank by the Funds will be based on the different fee rates of each of the portfolios into which
the assets of the Plans are allocated. For example, for services provided to the Money Market Portfolios, the California
Tax Free Fund, and the Tax Free Fund, the Bank receives the following fees from HighMark based on each portfolio's average
daily net assets: (a) .40% of the first $500 million; (b) .35% of the next $500 million; and (c) .30% of the remaining
average daily net assets. For services provided to the Non-Money Market Portfolios, the Bank receives the following
fees from HighMark based on each portfolio's average daily net assets: (a) 1.00% of the first $40 million; and (b) .60%
on the remaining average daily net assets. It is represented that the Bank currently allocates investments by the
Plans among the portfolios offered by HighMark, and proposes to continue to allocate the assets of the Plans among
the portfolios of HighMark and/or any of the Funds under the terms of this proposed exemption.

It is represented that the impact of the change in fee structures, described in paragraph 9 above, on aggregate fees
received by the Bank is difficult to determine, because various factors and variables are unique to each Plan. These
factors include the size of the Plan, the extent to which Plan assets are invested in the Funds, and the application
of certain ``break points'' in the schedule of Plan-level fees. Further, Fund size and the application of certain
``break points'' in the rate schedule of Fund-level fees, the identity of the particular investment portfolio of
the Fund into which the Plan assets are allocated, and voluntary waivers by the Bank of Fund-level fees are likely to
be different in each situation and may affect the aggregate amount of fees received by the Bank. In this regard, it is
represented that the combined total of all Plan-level and Fund-level fees received by the Bank for the provision of
services to the Plans and to the Funds, respectively, are not in excess of ``reasonable compensation'' within the
meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act. 
12. The exemption is subject to satisfaction of certain general conditions. Chief among such conditions is the requirement
that the proposed transactions are subject to the prior authorization of a Second Fiduciary, acting on behalf of each
of the Plans, who has been provided with full written disclosure by the Bank. It is represented that the Second Fiduciary
will generally be the administrator, sponsor, or a committee appointed by the sponsor to act as a named fiduciary for
a Plan. 
With respect to disclosure, the Second Fiduciary of such Plan will receive in writing in advance of the investment
by a Plan in any of the Funds: (1) a current prospectus for each portfolio of each of the Funds in which such Plan may invest,
(2) a statement describing the investment management fees, investment advisory fees, or similar fees, any fees for
Secondary Services, and all other fees to be charged to or paid by the Plan and by such Funds to the Bank, including the
nature and extent of any differential between the rates of such fees, (3) the reasons why the Bank may consider such
investment(s) to be appropriate for the Plan, (4) a statement describing whether there are any limitations applicable
to the Bank with respect to which assets of a Plan may be invested in the Funds, and, if so, the nature of such limitations,
and (5) upon request of the Second Fiduciary a copy of the proposed exemption and/or the final exemption, if granted.

In addition to the disclosures provided to the Plan prior to investment in any of the Funds, the Bank represents that
it will routinely provide at least annually to the Second Fiduciary updated prospectuses of the Funds in accordance
with the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the SEC rules promulgated thereunder. Further, the
Second Fiduciary will be supplied, upon request, with a report or statement (which may take the form of the most recent
financial report of such Funds, the current statement of additional information, or some other written statement)
which contains a description of all fees paid by the Fund. 
It is represented that the Bank does not now execute nor in the future intend to execute securities brokerage transactions
for the investment portfolios of any of the Funds, except as and to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the event the Bank ever performs brokerage
services for which a fee is paid to the Bank by the investment portfolio of any of the Funds, the Bank represents that
it will at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service provide a written notice
which explains the nature of such additional brokerage service and the amount of the fees. Further, the Bank represents
that it will provide at least annually to the Second fiduciary of any Plan that invests in such Funds with a written disclosure
indicating (a) the total, expressed in dollars, of brokerage commissions of each Fund's investment portfolio that
are paid to the Bank by such Fund; (b) the total, expressed in dollars, of brokerage commissions of each Fund's investment
portfolio that are paid by such Fund to brokerage firms unrelated to the Bank; (c) the average brokerage commissions
per share, expressed as cents per share, paid to the Bank by each portfolio of a Fund; and (d) the average brokerage commissions
per share, expressed as cents per share, paid by each portfolio of a Fund to brokerage firms unrelated to the Bank. 
On the basis of the information disclosed, it is represented that the Second Fiduciary will authorize in writing (i)
the investment of assets of the Plans in shares of the Fund in connection with the transactions set forth herein; (ii)
the investment portfolios of the Funds in which the assets of the Plans may be invested; and (iii) the compensation
received by the Bank in connection with its services to the Funds. It is represented that written authorization will
extend to only those investment portfolios of the Funds with respect to which the Second Fiduciary has received the
written disclosures referred to above and which are specifically mentioned in such authorization. Having obtained
the authorization of the Second Fiduciary, the Bank will be permitted to invest the assets of a Plan among the portfolios
and in the manner covered by the authorization, subject to satisfaction of the other terms and conditions of this proposed
exemption. However, the Bank will not be permitted to invest assets of a Plan in any portfolio not specifically mentioned
in the written authorization. For example, if the written authorization of the Second Fiduciary covered only three
of six portfolios then existing, the Bank could only invest the assets of such Plans in those three portfolios specifically
authorized. Further, if a new portfolio were established under any of the Funds, the Bank could invest assets of a Plan
in such new portfolio only after providing the required disclosures and obtaining from the Second Fiduciary a separate
written authorization which specifically mentions the new portfolio. 
13. The receipt of fees, as described above, are generated in connection with the investment in the Funds by the Plans.
These investments are the result of purchases of shares in the Funds and exchanges of assets of the Plans, including
those in CIFs, for shares in the Funds. 
It is represented: (1) that Plans and other investors will purchases or sell shares in the Funds in accordance with
standard procedures described in the prospectus for each portfolio of the Funds; (2) that the Plans will pay no sales
commissions or redemption fees in connection with purchase or sales of shares in the Funds by the Plans; (3) that the
Bank will not purchase from or sell to any of the Plans shares of any of the Funds; and (4) the price paid or received by
the Plans for shares of the Funds will be the net asset value per share at the time of such purchase or sale and will be the
same price as any other investor would have paid or received at that time.

11 






14. Purchases and sales of shares in any of the Funds by the Plans may also occur in connection with daily automated cash
``sweep'' arrangements. However, agreement to such arrangement is not a condition for the Plan otherwise choosing
to invest in shares of the Fund, nor will the reverse be required. 
It is represented that at the time the application was filed, all of the Plans served by the Bank had elected to participate
in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements with HighMark. Further, it is represented that the ``sweep'' procedures,
as described below with respect to HighMark, will remain in effect under the proposed exemption for any of the Funds.

<PARENT> FR940817-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement, a Plan may participate in the ``sweep'' program only with the initial
written approval of the Second Fiduciary and only after certain disclosures have been provided by the Bank. If such
approval is given, cash balances of the Plan held from time to time thereafter pending other investment or distribution
are invested automatically in shares of one or more of HighMark's Money Market Portfolios selected by the Second Fiduciary
on behalf of a Plan at the time of the initial authorization. It is represented that the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement
would not involve shares of HighMark's Non-Money Market Portfolios. 
After the Money Market Portfolios have been selected by the Second Fiduciary on behalf of the Plan, otherwise uninvested
cash down to the last $1.00 balance of the Plans may be invested automatically on a nightly basis. It is represented
that the Bank has no discretion with respect to the timing of the ``sweep'' either into or out of HighMark. Under the
automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement, the Bank's computerized cash management system automatically scans the
accounts of the Plans, as of the end of each business day to determine whether such accounts have positive or negative
net cash balances. Based on this information the system automatically invests the cash of the Plans having positive
balances in shares of the selected Money Market Portfolios. In the case of a Plan having a negative cash balance, the
system automatically liquidates HighMark shares as necessary to eliminate such negative balance. 
It is represented that Plans may terminate their participation in the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement and withdraw
at any time by notifying the Bank. Such termination will be affected by the Bank selling the shares of HighMark held
by the Plan requesting termination within one business day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery,
facsimile, or other available means at the option of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written
notice of termination. However, if due to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale of shares of such Plan
cannot be executed within one business day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale.

It is represented that no fee, charge, or penalty of any kind is charged in connections with a termination by a Plan of
participation in the automated cash ``sweep arrangement'' in HighMark or in any of the Funds. It is further represented
that the Bank does not charge separate or additional fees to Plans in order to participate in the daily automated cash
``sweep'' arrangement, nor is such additional compensation contemplated by the proposed exemption.

12 






15. In summary, the Bank represents that the proposed transactions meet the statutory criteria of section 408(a)
of the Act because: 
(a) Neither the Plans nor the CIFs have paid or will pay sales commissions or redemption fees in connection with the
in-kind transfer of assets to the Funds in exchange for shares of the Funds or in connection with purchases or sales
by the Plans of shares of the Funds, including purchases and sales handled through daily automated cash ``sweep''
arrangements; 
(b) The Plans or the CIFs have received and will receive shares of the Funds that are equal in value to the assets of the
Plans or the CIFs exchanged for such shares, as determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner and at
the close of business on the same day in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 17a-7 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement;

(c) Not later than thirty (30) days after completion of each in-kind transfer of assets in exchange for share of the
Funds, the Second Fiduciaries for affected Plans have received and will receive written confirmation of the assets
involved in the exchange, the price of such assets, and the identity of the pricing service or market maker consulted;


(d) For all conversion transactions that occur after the date of this proposed exemption, the Bank, no later than ninety
(90) days after completion of each in-kind transfer of assets of the Plans or the CIFs in exchange for shares of the Funds,
will mail to the Second Fiduciary a written confirmation of the number of CIF units held by each affected Plan immediately
before the conversion (and the related per unit value or the aggregate dollar value of the units transferred), and
the number of shares in the Funds that are held by each affected Plan following the conversion (and the related per share
net asset value or the aggregate dollar value of the shares received); 

(e) The price that has been or will be paid or received by the Plans for shares in the Funds is the net asset value per share
at the time of the transaction and is the same price for the shares which would have been paid or received by any other
investor at that time; 

(f) The Bank, its affiliates, and officers or directors have not and will not purchase from or sell to any of the Plans
shares of any of the Funds; 

(g) The combined total of all fees received by the Bank for the provision of services to the Plans, and in connection
with the provision of services to any of the Funds in which the Plans may invest, has not been and will not be in excess
of ``reasonable compensation'' within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act; 

(h) The Bank has not and will not receive any 12b-1 Fees in connection with the transactions; 

(i) Prior to investment by a Plan in any of the Funds, in connection with transactions, the Second Fiduciary has received
and will receive a full and detailed written disclosure of information concerning such Fund; 

(j) subsequent to the investment by a Plan in any of the Funds, the Bank will provide the Second Fiduciary of such Plan,
among other information, at least annually with an updated copy of the prospectus for each of the Funds in which the
Plan invests; 

(k) in the event such Fund places brokerage transactions with the Bank, the Bank will provide the Second Fiduciary
of such Plan at least annually with a statement specifying the total, expressed in dollars, of brokerage commissions
of each Fund's investment portfolio that are paid by such Fund to the Bank and to unrelated brokerage firms and the average
brokerage commissions per share, expressed as cents per share, by each portfolio of a Fund paid to the Bank and to brokerage
firms unrelated to the Bank; 

 (l) On the basis of the disclosures, the Second Fiduciary has authorized and will authorize the transactions; 

(m) The authorization by the Second Fiduciary has been and will be terminable at will without penalty to such Plans,
and has been and will be effected within one business day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery,
facsimile, or other available means at the option of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written
notice of termination, unless circumstances beyond the control of the Bank delay execution for no more than one additional
business day; 

(n) The Plans do not pay any investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees to the Bank with respect to
any of the assets of such Plans which are invested in shares of any of the Funds; 

(o) the Second Fiduciary has received and will receive a written notice accompanied by a Termination Form with instructions
regarding the use of such form, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of any increase in the rate
of any fees for investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees, any additional Secondary Service for
which a fee is charged, or any increase in fees for Secondary Services that the Bank provides to the Funds; and 

(p) All dealings between the Plans and any of the Funds have been and will on a basis no less favorable to such Plans than
dealings between the Funds and other shareholders holding the same class of shares as the Plans.

Notice to Interested Persons 



Those persons who may be interested in the pendency of the requested exemption include the fiduciaries of Plans which
have invested, as of the effective date of this exemption, in HighMark and/or in any of the Funds, where the Bank served
as investment adviser to such Funds and also served in any capacity as fiduciary for such Plans. In addition, it is represented
that many other Plans for which the Bank serves in any capacity as a fiduciary may from time to time invest in HighMark
and/or in any of the Funds to which the Bank may serve as investment adviser in the future. For this reason, the Bank does
not know the number of Plans which may therefore be affected by this proposed exemption. Accordingly, the Department
has determined that the only practical form of providing notice to interested persons is the distribution by the Bank
by first class mail of a copy of the notice of pendency of this proposed exemption (the Notice) within thirty (30) days
of the date of the publication of such Notice in the 

Federal Register

 to the fiduciaries of any of the Plans which are invested, on the date of the publication of the Notice in the 

Federal Register

, in HighMark and/or any the Funds to which the Bank serves as investment adviser. Such distribution to interested
persons shall include a copy of the Notice, as published in the 

Federal Register

, plus a copy of the supplemental statement, as required, pursuant to 29 CFR 2570.43(b)(2), which shall inform such
interested persons of their right to comment and to request a hearing. The Bank also represents that it will provide
a copy of the proposed exemption and/or a copy of the final exemption, if granted, to any Second Fiduciary of a Plan upon
request.

Marshall & Ilsley Trust Company Located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Proposed Exemption


[Application No. D-9257] 



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). 


Section I_Exemption for In-Kind Transfer of CIF Assets


If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of section 406(a) and 406(b) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from
the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (F) of the Code, shall not apply,
as of November 20, 1992, to the in-kind transfer of assets of plans for which Marshall & Ilsley Trust Company or
an affiliate (collectively, M&I) serves as a fiduciary (the Client Plans), other than plans established and
maintained by M&I, that are held in certain collective investment funds maintained by M&I (the CIFs), in
exchange for shares of the Marshall Funds, Inc. (the Funds), an open-end investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), for which M&I acts as investment adviser, custodian, and/or shareholder
servicing agent, in connection with the termination of such CIFs, provided that the following conditions and the
general conditions of Section III below are met: 
(a) No sales commissions or other fees are paid by the Client Plans in connection with the purchase of Fund shares through
the in-kind transfer of CIF assets and no redemption fees are paid in connection with the sale of such shares by the Client
Plans to the Funds. 
(b) Each Client Plan receives shares of a Fund which have a total net asset value that is equal to the value of the Client
Plan's pro rata share of the assets of the CIF on the date of the transfer, based on the current market value of the CIF's
assets, as determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner at the close of the same business day, using
independent sources in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b) of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1940 Act
and the procedures established by the Funds for the valuation of such assets. Such procedures must require that all
securities for which a current market price cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price for transactions
reported on a recognized securities exchange or NASDAQ be valued based on an average of the highest current independent
bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding the weekend of the CIF
transfers, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that are broker-dealers or pricing
services independent of M&I.

(c) A second fiduciary who is independent of and unrelated to M&I (the Second Fiduciary) receives advance written
notice of the in-kind transfer of assets of the CIFs and full written disclosure of information concerning the Funds
(including a current prospectus for each of the Funds and a statement describing the fee structure) and, on the basis
of such information, authorizes in writing the in-kind transfer of the Client Plan's CIF assets to a corresponding
Fund in exchange for shares of the Fund. 
(d) For all subsequent transfers of CIF assets to a Fund following the publication of this proposed exemption in the


Federal Register

, M&I sends by regular mail to each affected Client Plan a written confirmation, not later than 30 days after completion
of the transaction, containing the following information: 
(1) The identity of each security that was valued for purposes of the transaction in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b)(4);

(2) The price of each such security involved in the transaction; and 
(3) The identity of each pricing service or market maker consulted in determining the value of such securities. 
(e) For all subsequent transfers of CIF assets to a Fund following the publication of this proposed exemption in the


Federal Register

, M&I sends by regular mail to the Second Fiduciary no later than 90 days after completion of each transfer a written
confirmation that contains the following information: 
(1) The number of CIF units held by the Client Plan immediately before the transfer, the related per unit value, and
the total dollar amount of such CIF units; and 
(2) The number of shares in the Funds that are held by the Client Plan following the transfer, the related per share net
asset value, and the total dollar amount of such shares. 
(f) The conditions set forth in paragraphs (e), (f) and (l) of Section II below are satisfied. 


Section II_Exemption for Receipt of Fees


If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) of the Act and the sanctions resulting
from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (F) of the Code, shall
not apply as of November 20, 1992, to: (1) The receipt of fees by M&I from the Funds for acting as an investment adviser
to the Funds in connection with the investment by the Client Plans in shares of the Funds; and (2) the receipt and proposed
retention of fees by M&I from the Funds for acting as custodian and shareholder servicing agent to the Funds as
well as for any other services to the Funds which are not investment advisory services (i.e. ``secondary services'')
in connection with the investment by the Client Plans in shares of the Funds, provided that the following conditions
and the general conditions of Section III are met: 
(a) No sales commissions are paid by the Client Plans in connection with the purchase or sale of shares of the Funds and
no redemption fees are paid in connection with the sale of shares by the Client Plans to the Funds. 
(b) The price paid or received by a Client Plan for shares in a Fund is the net asset value per share at the time of the transaction,
as defined in Section IV(e), and is the same price which would have been paid or received for the shares by any other investor
at that time. 
(c) Neither M&I nor an affiliate, including any officer or director of M&I, purchases or sells shares of the
Funds to any Client Plan. 
(d) Each Client Plan receives a credit, either through cash or the purchase of additional shares of the Funds pursuant
to an annual election made by the Client Plan, of such Plan's proportionate share of all fees charged to the Funds by
M&I for investment advisory services, within no more than one business day of the receipt of such fees by M&I.

(e) The combined total of all fees received by M&I for the provision of services to a Client Plan, and in connection
with the provision of services to the Funds in which the Client Plan may invest, are not in excess of ``reasonable compensation''
within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act. 
(f) M&I does not receive any fees payable pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act in connection with the transactions.

(g) The Client Plans are not employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by M&I. 
(h) The Second Fiduciary receives full and detailed written disclosure of information concerning the Funds (including
a current prospectus for each of the Funds and statement describing the fee structure) in advance of any investment
by the Client Plan in a Fund. 
(i) On the basis of the information described above in paragraph (h), the Second Fiduciary authorizes in writing the
investment of assets of the Client Plan in each particular Fund, the fees to be paid by such Funds to M&I, and the
purchase of additional shares of a Fund by the Client Plan with the fees credited to the Client Plan by M&I. 
(j) All authorizations made by a Second Fiduciary regarding investments in a Fund and the fees paid to M&I are subject
to an annual reauthorization wherein any such prior authorization referred to in paragraph (i) shall be terminable
at will by the Client Plan, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by M&I of written notice of termination.
A form expressly providing an election to terminate the authorization described in paragraph (i) above (the Termination
Form) with instructions on the use of the form must be supplied to the Second Fiduciary no less than annually. The instructions
for the Termination Form must include the following information: 
(1) The authorization is terminable at will by the Client Plan, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by
M&I of written notice from the Second Fiduciary; and

(2) Failure to return the Termination Form will result in continued authorization of M&I to engage in the transactions
described in paragraph (i) on behalf of the Client Plan. 
(k) The Second Fiduciary of each Client Plan invested in a particular Fund receives full written disclosure, in a statement
separate from the Fund prospectus, of any proposed increases in the rates of fees charged by M&I to the Funds for
secondary services (as defined in Section IV(h) below) at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such increase,
accompanied by a copy of the Termination Form, and receives full written disclosure in a Fund prospectus or otherwise
of any increases in the rates of fees charged by M&I to the Funds for investment advisory services even though such
fees will be credited as required by paragraph (d) above. 
(l) All dealings between the Client Plans and the Funds are on a basis no less favorable to the Client Plans than dealings
with other shareholders of the Funds.

to the Second Fiduciary to terminate on behalf of a Client Plan the authorization described in paragraph (j) of Section
II. Such Termination Form may be used at will by the Second Fiduciary to terminate an authorization without penalty
to the Client Plan and to notify M&I in writing to effect a termination by selling the shares of the Funds held by
the Client Plan requesting such termination within one business day following receipt by M&I of the form; provided
that if, due to circumstances beyond the control of M&I, the sale cannot be executed within one business day, M&I
shall have one additional business day to complete such sale.

1. Marshall & Ilsley Trust Company (M&I Trust) is a Wisconsin corporation with its principal offices located
at 770 North Water Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and is a subsidiary of Marshall & Ilsley Corporation (M&I
Corp.), a bank holding company. M&I Corp. and various affiliates (referred to herein as ``M&I''), serve
as trustee, directed trustee, investment manager, or custodian for approximately 1,163 employee benefit plans.
As of September 30, 1992, M&I had total assets of approximately $25.3 million and total assets under management
of approximately $4.86 billion.
M&I represents that its status as a fiduciary with investment discretion for a Client Plan arises out of its relationship
as a trustee or investment manager for such Plan, but does not result from the rendering of any investment advice to
a Plan fiduciary that has investment discretion for the Client Plan. As a custodian or directed trustee of a Client
Plan, M&I has custody of Plan assets, collects all income, performs bookkeeping and accounting services, generates
periodic statements of account activity and other reports, and makes payments or distributions from the account
as directed. However, M&I has no duty as custodian or directed trustee to review investments or make recommendations,
acting only as directed by an authorized Second Fiduciary.
The Client Plans include various pension, profit sharing, and stock bonus plans as well as voluntary employees' beneficiary
associations, supplemental unemployment benefit plans, simplified employee benefit plans, retirement plans
for self-employed individuals (i.e., Keogh plans), and individual retirement accounts (IRAs).

13

 M&I, in its capacity as a fiduciary of the Client Plans, may exercise investment discretion for all or a portion
of he assets of such Client Plans.




2. M&I requests an exemption for investments in a Fund which occur through an in-kind transfer of a Client Plan's
pro rata share of assets from a terminating CIF to a corresponding Fund in exchange for shares of such Fund.

14

 M&I also requests an exemption for the receipt of fees from the Funds in connection with the investment of assets
of a Client Plan (including any assets of a Client Plan which were held in a terminating CIF) for which it acts as a trustee,
directed trustee, investment manager, or custodian, in shares of the Funds in instances where M&I is an investment
adviser, custodian, and shareholder servicing agent for the Funds. The exemption would include Client Plans for
which M&I exercises investment discretion as well as Client Plans where investment decisions are directed by
a Second Fiduciary.




The Client Plans' pro rata share of fees paid by the Funds to M&I for investment advisory services are credited
to the Client Plans, in accordance with the conditions of the proposed exemption (as discussed in Item 7 below), with
respect to the assets of the Client Plans involved in Fund investments. Any amounts received by M&I for serving
as a custodian and shareholder servicing agent of the Funds are also currently credited to the Client Plans to the extent
that such amounts exceed M&I's direct expenses for providing the service to the Funds. However, M&I proposes
to retain such fees in the future. All investments in the Funds are made by M&I pursuant to an initial written authorization
and an annual reauthorization of the investment by the Second Fiduciary. M&I invests assets of a Client Plan in
any of the Funds for which it has received prior written authorization for such investment from the Second Fiduciary
during the period that the authorization is effective.
3. The Funds are a Wisconsin corporation organized as an open-end investment company registered under the 1940 Act.
The Funds currently consist of five Funds or ``portfolios'', each having a separate prospectus and representing
a distinct investment vehicle. The shares of each Fund represent a proportionate interest in the assets of that Fund.
The existing Funds include the Marshall Money Market Fund, the Marshall Government Income Fund, the Marshall Intermediate
Bond Fund, the Marshall Short-Term Income Fund, and the Marshall Stock Fund. M&I states that additional Funds
may be established in the future. Shares of the Funds are offered and sold to eligible investors. Certain shares, identified
by each prospectus as Trust Shares, are offered to trust accounts of M&I as a means of acquiring an interest in a
diversified porfolio of investments. M&I states that the Trust Shares are offered to M&I's trust customers,
including the Client Plans, under terms and conditions which are at least as favorable to such customers as the terms
and conditions involved in any other class of Fund shares. If the proposed exemption is granted, the exemption would
cover only investments by Client Plans in Trust Shares. Thus, all references herein to the transactions involving
the Client Plans refer only to the Trust Shares described by the prospectus for each Fund.
Investments of Client Plan assets in the Funds occur either through a transfer of assets from a terminating CIF, the
direct purchase of shares of the Funds for a Client Plan by M&I, the transfer by M&I of Client Plan assets from
one Fund to another Fund, or a daily automated sweep of uninvested cash of a Client Plan by M&I into one or more Funds
previously designated by the Client Plan for sweeping such cash.

15

 All such investments for the Client Plans are made pursuant to the Second Fiduciary's prior written authorization
and annual reauthorization to M&I (as described in Item 8 below).

4. Federated Securities Corporation (FSC) is the principal distributor for all shares of the Funds including Trust
Shares which are sold to the Client Plans.

16

 There are no fees for distribution expenses, pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, paid to FSC with respect
to the Trust Shares. In addition, M&I does not and will not receive fees payable pursuant to Rule 12b-1 in
connection with transactions involving any shares of the Funds. The Trust Shares are charged for certain administrative
expenses of the Funds. FSC is a subsidiary of Federated Investors (Federated) which, through other subsidiaries,
acts as the transfer and dividend disbursing agent for the Funds and provides certain personnel and administrative
services for the Funds. Federated and its subsidiaries are unrelated to M&I. However, M&I Trust is the custodian
for the securities and cash of the Funds and Marshall Funds Investor Services (MFIS), another affiliate of M&I
Corp., is the shareholder servicing agent for the Funds.




5. M&I Investment Management Corp. (M&I Management), a wholly-owned subsidiary of M&I Corp., serves
as the investment adviser for the Funds pursuant to investment advisory agreements with the Funds (the Agreements)
which allow M&I Management to receive monthly investment advisory fees based on a percentage of the average daily
net assets of each of the Funds. The Agreements and the fees received by M&I Management are approved by the Board
of Directors of the Funds (the Funds' Directors), in accordance with the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act. Any
changes in the fees are approved by the Funds' Directors. All of the Funds' Directors are independent of M&I.
6. Prior to November 20, 1992, M&I generally invested assets of Client Plans for which it acted as a trustee with
investment discretion in a series of CIFs. In addition, certain Client Plans where investment decisions are directed
by a Second Fiduciary generally used an M&I CIF as an investment option for individual accounts in the Client Plans.
However, on Friday, November 20, 1992, M&I terminated three of its CIFs_the M&I Employee Benefit Money Market
Fund, the M&I Employee Benefit Bond Fund, and the M&I Employee Benefit Stock Fund. The assets in these CIFs
were transferred to the Marshall Money Market Fund, the Marshall Intermediate Bond Fund, and the Marshall Stock Fund,
respectively. Each CIF transferred its assets to the corresponding Fund in exchange for Trust Shares of that Fund
at the then current market value of the CIF assets, in accordance with Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act (as discussed
below).

17

 The CIFs were liquidated and the Trust Shares were distributed to the Client Plans, subject to the prior written consent
of the Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan. Any Client Plan that had not provided prior written approval for the transfer
of its CIF assets to the Funds, by the deadline set for such approvals, received a cash distribution of its pro rata share
of the CIF assets no later than Friday, November 20, 1992, preceding the transfers.




The assets of the CIFs were reviewed by M&I Management as investment adviser to the Funds, in coordination with
Federated Administrative Services (FAS), the Funds' third party administrator, to determine that the assets were
appropriate investments for the corresponding Funds. FAS created a portfolio accounting system to track the securities
to be acquired by the Funds. Prior to the transfer of CIF assets to the Funds, the Funds did not hold any securities or
other assets except cash or, as in the case of the Marshall Money Market Fund, U.S. Treasury Bills.

The transfer transactions occurred using market values as of the close of business on Friday, November 20, 1992. The
securities transferred from the CIFs were the same as the securities received by the Funds. The applicant states that
the value of the securities was determined in a single valuation by M&I as investment adviser for the Funds, in
accordance with the requirement of Rule 17a-7(b) that transactions be effected at the ``independent current market
price'' of the securities. The valuation of the securities was performed in the same manner for both the CIF and the
corresponding Fund at the close of the same business day. Specifically, as required by the Rule, securities listed
on exchanges were valued at their closing prices on Friday, November 20, and unlisted securities were valued based
on the average of bid and ask quotations at the close of the market on Friday, November 20, obtained from three brokers
independent of M&I. Any fees charged by the independent brokers for the bid and ask prices were paid by M&I.


Each Client Plan that approved the CIF asset transfers to the Funds received account statements describing the asset
transfers either in mid-December 1992, if such Plans were on a monthly account statement schedule, or mid-January
1993, if such Plans were on a quarterly account statement schedule. The statements showed the disposition of the CIF
units from the Client Plan account and the acquisition by the account of Fund shares, both posted as of Monday, November
23, 1992.
 This information provided the affected Client Plans with written confirmation of the number of CIF units held by the
Client Plan immediately before the transfer, the related per unit value and the total dollar amount of such CIF units
as well as the number of shares of the Funds held by the Client Plan following the transfer, the related per share net
asset value, and the total dollar amount of such shares. 





Thus, the applicant represents that as of November 23, 1992, Client Plans that were formerly invested in the terminated
CIFs held Trust Shares of the corresponding Funds which were of the same value, based on the Client Plans' pro rata share
of the underlying market value of the securities transferred to the Funds, as their assets in the CIF as of the close
of business on Friday, November 20, 1992. M&I represents that the other CIFs may be terminated in the future and
that all such terminations and subsequent transfers of CIF assets for Trust Shares of the Funds will comply with Rule
17a-7 as described above and the conditions of this proposed exemption.

19 







M&I states that for all subsequent transfers of CIF assets to a Fund following the publication of this proposed
exemption in the 

Federal Register

, M&I will send by regular mail to each affected Client Plan a written confirmation, not later than 30 days after
completion of the transaction, containing the following information: 

(1) The identity of each security that was valued for purposes of the transaction in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b)(4);


(2) The price of each such security involved in the transaction; and 

(3) The identity of each pricing service or market maker consulted in determining the value of such securities. 
Securities which are valued in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b)(4) are securities for which the current market price
cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price for transactions reported on a recognized securities exchange
or the NASDAQ system. M&I states that such securities are valued based on an average of the highest current independent
bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding the weekend of the CIF
transfers, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that are broker-dealers or pricing
services independent of M&I. 

In addition, for all in-kind transfers of CIF assets to a Fund that occur after the date this proposed exemption is published
in the 

Federal Register

, M&I will send by regular mail to the Second Fiduciary no later than 90 days after completion of each transfer a
written confirmation that contains the following information: 

(1) The number of CIF units held by the Client Plan immediately before the transfer, the related per unit value, and
the total dollar amount of such CIF units; and 

(2) The number of shares in the Funds that are held by the Client Plan following the transfer, the related per share net
asset value, and the total dollar amount of such shares. 

M&I believes that the interests of the Client Plans are better served by the collective investment of assets of
the Client Plans in the Funds rather than in the CIFs. The Funds are valued on a daily basis, whereas the majority of the
CIFs are valued monthly. The daily valuation permits: (i) Immediate investment of Client Plan contributions in various
types of investments; (ii) greater flexibility in transferring assets from one type of investment to another; and
(iii) daily redemption of investments for purposes of making distributions. In addition, information concerning
the investment performance of the Funds will be available in newspapers of general circulation which will allow Client
Plan fiduciaries to monitor the performance of investments on a daily basis and make more informed investment decisions.

7. For investments in the Funds on behalf of Client Plans subsequent to the transfer of the CIF assets to the Funds where
the assets involved were not previously invested in any CIFs, M&I currently offsets its investment management
or advisory fees for assets invested in the Funds in accordance with one of the methods for offsetting double investment
advisory fees described in Prohibited Transaction Exemption 77-4 (PTE 77-4, 42 FR 18732, April 8, 1977).
 Consequently, the applicant represents that the fee structure for these investments complies with the fee structure
under PTE 77-4, and that the other conditions of PTE 77-4 are met.
 However, for Client Plan investments in the Funds with respect to assets that were previously held in the CIFs prior
to the investment of such assets in the Funds, M&I uses the fee structure (the Fee Structure) described below.
M&I anticipates using the Fee Structure for future Client Plan investments in the Funds where the assets involved
were not previously invested in the CIFs if the Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan elects to use the Fee Structure
in lieu of the offset or credit methods prescribed by PTE 77-4. M&I states that the Fee Structure preserves
a Client Plan's existing fee rates for investment management services by M&I when such Plan invests in the Funds
or when such Plan's assets are transferred from the CIFs to the Funds. The Fee Structure is described as follows:






(a) M&I charges its standard fees to all the Client Plans for serving as a trustee, directed trustee, investment
manager, or custodian for the Client Plans.
 All fees are billed on a quarterly basis. The annual charges for a Client Plan account are based on fee schedules negotiated
with M&I. For example, if the fee is unbundled, the standard charge by M&I to a Client Plan for serving as a trustee
with solely custodial responsibilities varies from 17.5 basis points for account assets under $5 million to 5 basis
points for account assets over $75 million, subject to a base annual charge of $1,500 and additional charges for specific
services. Where M&I serves as investment manager to a Client Plan account, depending on the type of portfolio,
the charge may vary from 30 basis points up to 80 basis points. This charge is separate from, and would be in addition
to, the fee for custodial services described above. M&I provides services to the Client Plans for which it acts
as a trustee with investment discretion, including sweep services for uninvested cash balances in such Plans, under
a bundled or single fee arrangement which is calculated as a percentage of the market value of the Plan assets under
management. Thus, in such instances, there are no separate charges for the provision of particular services to the
Client Plans. However, for Client Plans where investment decisions are directed by a Second Fiduciary, a separate
charge is assessed for particular services, including sweep services, where the Second Fiduciary specifically
agrees to have M&I provide such services to the Client Plan.
 M&I states that in many cases fees charged by M&I to a Client Plan are paid by the Client Plan sponsor rather
than by the Client Plan. 






(b) M&I Management charges the Funds for its services to the Funds as investment adviser, in accordance with the
Agreements between M&I and the Funds. Under the Agreements, M&I Management charges fees at a different rate
for each Fund, computed based on the average daily net assets for the respective Fund. The fee differentials among
the Funds result from the particular level of services rendered by M&I Management to the Funds.

(c) The investment advisory and other fees paid by each of the existing Funds are accrued on a daily basis and billed
by M&I Management to the Funds at the beginning of the month following the month in which the fees accrued. The applicant
states that any additional Funds will follow the same monthly billing arrangement. 
(d) At the beginning of each month (pursuant to the terms of the applicable Agreements) and essentially simultaneously
with the billing described in (c) above, but in no event more than one business day following the receipt of such fees
by M&I Management, M&I credits to each Client Plan directly with cash such Plan's pro rata share of all investment
advisory fees charged by M&I Management to the Funds (the Credit Program). In addition, M&I currently credits
to each Client Plan any amounts it is paid for providing custody and shareholder services to the Funds in the same manner
as the investment advisory fees but only to the extent that these amounts exceed M&I's direct expenses for providing
such services. However, M&I proposes in the future to retain any fees received by M&I from the Funds for custody
and shareholder services or other secondary services.

24 






M&I represents that the credited fees are currently paid to the Client Plan only in cash, but that the credits may
be effectuated in the future through the purchase of additional shares of the Funds pursuant to an annual election
made by the Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan. The purchase of the shares will occur in lieu of a cash credit on the
same day that such credit would have been paid to the Client Plan. M&I states that the fee credits were initially
made in cash to the Client Plans so that no authorizations for crediting fees in the form of additional shares of the
Funds would be involved at the time of the transfers of the CIF assets to the Funds. All decisions regarding the use of
the credited fees to purchase additional shares of the Funds, including annual reauthorizations for such credits,
will be made by a Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan. 
The Credit Program ensures that M&I does not receive any additional investment management, advisory or similar
fees from the Funds as a result of investments in the Funds by the Client Plans. Thus, M&I represents that the Fee
Structure is at least as advantageous to the Client Plans as an arrangement pursuant to the conditions of PTE 77-4
whereby investment advisory fees paid by the Funds to M&I Management would be offset or credited against investment
management fees charged directly by M&I to the Client Plans. In this regard, M&I states that the Credit Program
essentially has the same effect in offsetting M&I Management's investment advisory fees as an arrangement under
PTE 77-4, section II(c), allowing for a credit by subtracting the amount of such fees from the investment management
fees charged directly by M&I to the Client Plans (the Subtraction Method). M&I states further that in many
instances the Credit Program is more advantageous to a Client Plan than an arrangement using the Subtraction Method
because under the Credit Program a Client Plan receives a credit in either cash or shares on the same day (or within one
business day after) the fees are received by M&I Management from the Funds. However, under the Subtraction Method,
a Client Plan would not receive a credit on the same day (or within one business day after) the fees are paid to M&I
Management from the Funds if the billing period for services to the Funds is different than the billing period for M&I's
fiduciary services to the Client Plan. The Fee Structure with the Credit Program allows M&I to maintain a fixed
fiduciary fee schedule for services to the Client Plans without any adjustments in billing for such services, as required
under the Subtraction Method. M&I notes that the Fee Structure also allows the Client Plan sponsor the option
to pay the Client Plan's fees to M&I for serving as a trustee, directed trustee, investment manager, or custodian
and have the Client Plan receive a credit of the Plan's pro rata share of the investment advisory fees paid to M&I.

25 






M&I is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls for the Credit
Program. In addition, M&I has retained the services of Arthur Anderson & Co. of Milwaukee, Wisconsin (the
Auditor), an independent accounting firm, to audit annually the crediting of fees to the Client Plans under the Credit
Program. M&I states that such audits provide independent verification of the proper crediting to the Client
Plans of fees charged by M&I to the Funds. M&I states further that information obtained from the audits is
used in the preparation of required financial disclosure reports to the Client Plans' fiduciaries.

By letter dated November 6, 1992, the Auditor describes the procedures that are used in the annual audit of the Credit
Program. The Auditor obtains: (i) A calculation of the daily actual balances for all the Funds and for the total Client
Plan shareholders of such Funds; (ii) a detailed list of the expenses charged to the Funds' shareholders by type of
expense; and (iii) calculations of the total expenses charged by M&I to each Fund which are reimbursable to the
Client Plans. On the basis of such information, the Auditor: (i) Reviews and tests compliance with the Credit Program's
operational controls and procedures established by M&I; (ii) verifies the daily credit factors transmitted
to M&I from the Funds, including the proper assignment of identification numbers to all Client Plan shareholders;
and (iii) verifies the credits paid in total to the sum of all credits paid to each Client Plan. The Auditor recomputes,
in total, the cash received in connection with the credit of each Client Plan's expenses to ensure that the proper amount
of cash was issued to the Client Plan. Finally, the Auditor recomputes on a test basis the amount of credits received
by selected Client Plan shareholders of the Funds to verify that such credits were properly made. In this regard, the
Auditor obtains a listing of the credits paid to each Client Plan regarding its shares in each of the Funds to determine
that the total credit paid to the Client Plan by M&I equals the total amount that was required to be credited. At
such time as M&I offers Client Plans the option to have the fees credited as additional Fund shares, the Auditor
will also recompute the number of Fund shares issued to the Client Plans to ensure that each Client Plan received the
proper number of shares. 
In the event either the internal audit by M&I or the independent audit by the Auditor identifies that an error has
been made in the crediting of fees to the Client Plans, M&I will correct the error. With respect to any shortfall
in credited fees to a Client Plan involving cash credits, M&I will make a cash payment to the Client Plan equal to
the amount of the error plus interest paid at money market rates offered by M&I for the period involved. With respect
to a shortfall in credited fees involving a Client Plan where the Second Fiduciary's election is to have credited fees
invested in shares of a particular Fund, M&I will make a cash payment equal to at least the amount of the error plus
interest based on the greater of either: (i) The money market rates offered by M&I for the period involved, or (ii)
the total rate of return for shares of the Fund that would have been acquired during such period. Any excess credits
made to a Client Plan will be corrected by an appropriate deduction and reallocation of cash during the next payment
period to reflect accurately the amount of total credits due to the Client Plan for the period involved. 
8. With respect to any transfer of a Client Plan's CIF assets to a Fund, M&I states that a Second Fiduciary for the
Client Plan receives advance written notice of the in-kind transfer of assets of the CIFs and full written disclosure
of information concerning the Fund. On the basis of such information, the Second Fiduciary authorizes in writing
the in-kind transfer of the Client Plan's CIF assets to a Fund in exchange for shares of the Fund. With respect to the
receipt of fees by M&I from a Fund in connection with any Client Plan's investment in the Fund, M&I states that
a Second Fiduciary receives full and detailed written disclosure of information concerning the Fund in advance of
any investment by the Client Plan in the Fund. On the basis of such information, the Second Fiduciary authorizes in
writing the investment of assets of the Client Plan in the Fund and the fees to be paid by the Fund to M&I. Such authorization
will include in the future an election for the Second Fiduciary to purchase additional shares of the Fund with the fees
credited to the Client Plan by M&I. In addition, M&I represents that the Second Fiduciary of each Client Plan
invested in a particular Fund will receive full written disclosure, in a statement separate from the Fund prospectus,
of any proposed increases in the rates of fees charged by M&I to the Funds for secondary services which are above
the rate reflected in the prospectus for the Fund, at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such increase. The
Second Fiduciary will also receive full written disclosure in a Fund prospectus or otherwise of any increases in the
rate of fees charged by M&I to the Funds for investment advisory services even though such fees will be credited,
as required by Section II(d) above. 
Any authorizations by a Second Fiduciary regarding the investment of a Client Plan's assets in a Fund and the fees to
be paid to M&I, including any future increases in rates of fees for secondary services, are or will be terminable
at will by the Second Fiduciary, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by M&I of written notice of termination.
A Termination Form expressly providing an election to terminate the authorization with instructions on the use of
the form is supplied to the Second Fiduciary no less than annually. The instructions for the Termination Form include
the following information: 
(a) The authorization is terminable at will by the Client Plan, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by
M&I of written notice from the Second Fiduciary; and 
(b) Failure to return the form will result in continued authorization of M&I to engage in the subject transactions
on behalf of the Client Plan. 
M&I states that the Termination Form may be used at will by the Second Fiduciary to terminate an authorization
without penalty to the Client Plan and to notify M&I in writing to effect a termination by selling the shares of
the Funds held by the Client Plan requesting such termination within one business day following receipt by M&I
of the form; provided that if, due to circumstances beyond the control of M&I, the sale cannot be executed within
one business day, M&I shall have one additional business day to complete such sale.

<TEXT>
 

Any disclosure of information regarding a proposed increase in the rate of any fees for secondary services will be
accompanied by an additional Termination Form with instructions on the use of the form as described above. Therefore,
the Second Fiduciary will have prior notice of the proposed increase and an opportunity to withdraw from the Funds
in advance of the date the increase becomes effective. Although the Second Fiduciary will also have notice of any increase
in the rates of fees charged by M&I to the Funds for investment advisory services, through an updated prospectus
or otherwise, such notice will not be accompanied by an additional Termination Form since all increases in investment
advisory fees will be credited by M&I to the Client Plans and will be subject to an annual reauthorization as described
above. 
 
M&I states that the Second Fiduciary always receives a current prospectus for each Fund and a written statement
giving full disclosure of the Fee Structure prior to any investment in the Funds. The disclosure statement explains
why M&I believes that the investment of assets of the Client Plan in the Funds is appropriate. The disclosure statement
also describes whether there are any limitations on M&I with respect to which Client Plan assets may be invested
in shares of the Funds and, if so, the nature of such limitations.

26 







M&I states further that the Second Fiduciary receives an updated prospectus for each Fund at least annually and
either annual or semi-annual reports for each Fund. M&I provides monthly reports to the Second Fiduciary of all
transactions engaged in by the Client Plan, including purchases and sales of Fund shares. 
 
9. No sales commissions are paid by the Client Plans in connection with the purchase or sale of shares of the Funds. In
addition, no redemption fees are paid in connection with the sale of shares by the Client Plans to the Funds. The applicant
states that all other dealings between the Client Plans and the Funds, M&I Management or any affiliate, are on
a basis no less favorable to the Client Plans than such dealings are with the other shareholders of the Funds. 
 
10. In summary, M&I represents that the transactions described herein satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (a) The Funds provide the Client Plans with a more effective investment vehicle than the
CIFs maintained by M&I without any increase in investment management, advisory or similar fees paid to M&I;
(b) with respect to the transfer of a Client Plan's CIF assets into a Fund in exchange for Fund shares, a Second Fiduciary
authorizes in writing such transfer prior to the transaction only after full written disclosure of information concerning
the Fund; (c) each Client Plan receives shares of a Fund in connection with the transfer of assets of a terminating CIF
which have a net asset value that is equal to the value of the Client Plan's pro rata share of the CIF assets on the date
of the transfer, based on the current market value of such assets as determined in a single valuation at the close of
the same business day using independent sources in accordance with procedures established by the Fund which comply
with Rule 17a-7 of the 1940 Act; (d) with respect to any investments in a Fund by the Client Plans and the payment of any
fees by the Fund to M&I, a Second Fiduciary receives full written disclosure of information concerning the Fund,
including a current prospectus and a statement describing the Fee Structure, and authorizes in writing the investment
of the Client Plan's assets in the particular Fund and the fees paid by such Fund to M&I; (e) any authorizations

New Standard Corporation Pension Plan (the Plan) Located in Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania; Proposed Exemption



[Application No. D-9698] 



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to the sale of a certain parcel of real property (the Property) from the Plan to New Standard
Corporation (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the following conditions
are met: 

1. The fair market value of the Property is established by a real estate appraiser independent of the Plan and the Employer;


2. The Employer pays the greater of $115,000 or the current fair market value of the Property (excluding site improvements)
with the enhancement value for an adjoining owner as of the date of sale; 

3. The sale is a one-time transaction for cash; 

4. The Plan pays no fees or commissions in regard to the sale; and 

5. The Employer pays any applicable excise taxes to the Internal Revenue Service under section 4975(a) of the Code
resulting from its use of the Property since October 1993. 



Summary of Facts and Representations



1. The Employer is a metal stampings manufacturing concern with offices in Mt. Joy and Hellam Township, Pennsylvania.
The Plan is a defined benefit plan which had approximately 66 participants and total assets of approximately $1,083,139
as of the time of filing of the exemption application. 

2. The Plan purchased the Property in April 1978 from unrelated parties for a purchase price of $22,689 in cash. The
Property is a vacant lot of about 2.51 acres located in Hellam Township adjacent to property of the Employer. The adjacent
property includes a one-story manufacturing and warehouse complex utilized by the Employer. 

The total cost to the Plan of acquiring and holding the Property since the time of purchase has been only the original
purchase price. All taxes and other costs related to the holding of the Property by the Plan have been paid by the Employer.
A small portion of the lot was recently paved at the expense of the Employer to provide an additional parking opportunity
to the Employer, and certain other improvements to the Property (including storm sewer installation and driveway
access) have been financed by the Employer. The Employer has expended a total of $72,260, including taxes, on the Property
since the time it was acquired by the Plan. 

3. The applicant obtained an appraisal on the Property dated April 14, 1994, from B. Daniel Wagner, MAI (Wagner) of
Associated Appraisers in York, Pennsylvania. The applicant represents that Wagner is independent of the Plan and
the Employer. Wagner states that he is aware that the Employer is the owner of contiguous property and is the prospective
buyer of the Property. In Wagner's opinion, the fair market value of the Property (excluding site improvements which
were constructed at the expense of the Employer) to an adjoining owner and including the enhancement value for such
adjoining owner was $115,000 as of the date of the appraisal. 

4. The Plan now proposes to sell the Property to the Employer. The Employer will pay the greater of the current fair market
value of the Property (excluding site improvements) for an adjoining owner, based on an updated independent appraisal,
or the total amount the Plan has expended on the Property as of the date of sale. The sale of the Property will be entirely
for cash, and the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction. 

The applicant represents that portion of the Property which was paved for parking has been utilized by employees of
the Employer. This parking area contains 48 spaces and was completed in October 1993. A supplement to the above described
appraisal, prepared by Wagner on June 20, 1994, estimates the total fair market rental for such usage to be approximately
$350 per month. The Employer will compensate the Plan in that amount for the period of time the Employer has utilized
the parking area from October 1993 to the date of sale of the Property.

27 







5. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (1) The fair market value of the Property will be established by a real estate appraiser independent
of the Plan and the Employer; (2) the Employer will pay the greater of the current fair market value of the Property (excluding
site improvements) for an adjoining owner or the total amount the Plan has expended on the Property; (3) the Plan will
pay no fees or commissions in connection with the sale; and (4) the sale of the Property will be an all cash transaction.

General Information
 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 

(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 

(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 

(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

ACTION:

 Grant of Individual Exemptions.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 


Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 
hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated,
were received by the Department. 
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 


Statutory Findings 


In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29

the following findings: 
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
their participants and beneficiaries; and 
(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

Batterymarch Financial Management (BFM) 
Located in Boston, Massachusetts; Exemption



[Prohibited Transaction Exemption 94-61; 
Application No. D-9230] 



The restrictions of section 406(b)(2) of the Act shall not apply to the proposed cross-trading of equity securities
between various accounts managed by BFM (the Accounts) where at least one Account involved in any cross-trade is an
employee benefit plan account (Plan Account) for which BFM acts as a fiduciary. 


Conditions and Definitions 


This exemption is subject to the following conditions: 
1. (a) Each Plan Account's participation in the cross-trade program is subject to BFM's receipt of a written authorization
executed in advance by a qualified Plan fiduciary, which is independent of BFM and its Affiliates (the Independent
Fiduciary). 
(b) The authorization referred to in paragraph (a) is terminable at will, without penalty to the Plan Account, upon
receipt by BFM of written notice of termination. 
(c) Before an authorization is made for any Account, an independent account representative, which must be an Independent
Fiduciary in the case of a Plan Account (collectively, an Independent Account Representative) must be furnished
with any reasonable available information necessary for the Independent Account Representative to determine whether
the authorization should be made, including (but not limited to) a copy of the proposed and final exemption issued
by the Department, an explanation of how the authorization may be terminated, a description of BFM's cross-trade
practices, and any other information requested by the Independent Account Representative. 
2. Each cross-trade transaction must satisfy the following: 
(a) The cross-trade opportunity must be triggered as a result of an Account participating in the program experiencing
a need to sell equity securities arising from one of the following three circumstances: 
(i) the Independent Account Representative specifically directs that all of the assets in the Account be liquidated;

(ii) the Independent Account Representative specifically directs that a portion of the Account be liquidated and
the selection of the particular equity securities to be sold is made either by the Independent Account Representative
or by an optimization program used by BFM (the Optimization Program) which operates, pursuant to certain prescribed
objective criteria, to automatically generate an optimal portfolio for such Accounts; or 
(iii) the application of the Optimization Program to the specific investment objectives and restrictions established
by the Independent Account Representative requires the sale of a security which is otherwise ranked by BFM as a buy
or a hold for all relevant Accounts under the Stock Evaluation Process. 
(b) With respect to each cross-trade opportunity triggered under paragraph 2(a), the Optimization Program used
by BFM must determine, in the ordinary course of its considering all available equity securities in the applicable
universe, that another Account or Accounts participating in the program should purchase some or all of the available
equity securities. 
(c) The cross-trade transaction must take place within three business days of the ``triggering event'' giving rise
to the cross-trade opportunity described in paragraph 2(a) above. 
(d) The cross-trade transaction must be effected through a broker which is unaffiliated with BFM and its Affiliates.

(e) The Independent Account Representative of each Account engaging in a cross-trade transaction must be provided
with a written confirmation of the cross-trade transaction within 10 days after the completion of the transaction.
The confirmation must set forth: 
(i) the particular equity securities involved; 
(ii) the number of shares involved; 
(iii) the price at which the transaction was executed; and 
(iv) the specific triggering event, identified above in paragraph 2(a), which caused the cross-trade transaction
to occur. 
3. (a) Each cross-trade must be effected at the closing price for the equity securities involved on the date of the transaction,
as quoted by the exchange on which such securities are principally traded or by the NASDAQ National Market System (NASDAQ).
In the case of domestic equity securities traded over-the-counter, other than those traded on NASDAQ, the price must
be the mean between the closing daily ``bid'' and ``asked'' prices on the date of the transactions, obtained from recognized
independent sources, unless such securities have actually traded within 24 hours of the cross-trade transaction
in which case the price must be the last sale price for the securities. If more than one source is used by BFM to price a
particular domestic equity security traded over-the-counter, then the price must be equal to the average of the highest
current independent bid and lowest current independent offer obtained from such sources. No foreign equity securities,
other than those traded on a recognized foreign securities exchange for which market quotations are readily available,
shall be cross-traded by the Accounts. 
(b) The equity securities involved in the cross-trade are those for which there is a generally recognized market with
adequate pricing information to enable BFM to use the Optimization Program for the Accounts in the transaction.

<TEXT>
 

(c) The cross-trade must involve less than 5 percent of the aggregate average daily trading volume of the equity securities
which are the subject of the transaction for the week immediately preceding the completion of the transaction. 

4. For any cross-trade opportunity where equity securities available for sale from a Selling Account may be sold to
more than one Buying Account, each cross-trade opportunity shall be allocated first to the Buying Account which is
ranked by the Optimization Program as being furthest from optimality, measured on a numerical basis at the time of
the transaction, until such Account is brought up to par with the Account which is next furthest from optimality. Such
Accounts shall then be allocated cross-trade opportunities on a pro rata basis until the Accounts are brought up to
the level of the next Account which is furthest from optimality. This allocation process shall continue until all
cross-trade opportunities involving the equity securities in question are exhausted. 

5. (a) BFM furnishes the Independent Fiduciary for each Plan Account participating in the cross-trade program at
least once every three months, and not later than 45 days following the period to which it related, a report disclosing:


(i) a list of all cross-trade transactions engaged in on behalf of the Plan Account during the period; and 

(ii) with respect to each cross-trade transaction, the actual price used to effect the transaction and the identity
of the pricing source, as well as the highest and lowest reported prices at which the equity securities involved in
the transaction were traded on the date of such transaction. 

(b) The authorizing Independent Fiduciary for each Plan Account participating in the program is furnished with a
summary report at least once per year. The summary must be furnished within 45 days after the end of the period to which
it relates, and must contain the following: 

(i) a description of the total amount of the Plan Account's assets, by type of equity security, involved in cross-trade
transactions during the period; 

(ii) a description of BFM's cross-trade practices, if such practices have changed materially during the period covered
by the summary; 

(iii) a statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization of cross-trade transactions may be terminated
upon receipt by BFM of the Independent Fiduciary's written notice to that effect; and 

(iv) a statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization of the Plan Account's participation in the cross-trade
program will continue in effect unless it is terminated. 

6. The cross-trade transaction does not involve assets of any employee benefit plan established or maintained by
BFM or any of its Affiliates (Batterymarch Plan). 

7. Each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account that participates in the cross-trading program must have
total assets equal to at least $25 million. In the case of multiple employee benefit plans maintained by a single employer
or controlled group of employers, the $25 million requirement may be met by aggregating the assets of such plans if
the assets are commingled for investment purposes in a single master trust. 

8. BFM receives no fee or other compensation (other than its agreed investment management fee) with respect to any
cross-trade transaction. 

9. BFM is a discretionary investment manager with respect to Plan Accounts participating in the cross-trade program
and does not cause any Plan Account to purchase or sell equity securities with another Account in order to merely track
or replicate the portfolio of an independently maintained third party index. 

10. For purposes of this exemption: 

(a) ``Account'' means a Plan Account or a Non-Plan Account; 

(b) ``Affiliate'' means any person directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with Batterymarch; 

(c) ``Buying Account'' means the Account which seeks to purchase equity securities in a cross-trade transaction;


(d) ``Cross-trade transaction'' means a purchase and sale of equity securities between Accounts for which BFM or
an Affiliate is acting as a trustee or investment manager; 

(e) ``Plan Account'' means an Account managed by BFM consisting of assets of one or more employee benefit plans which
are subject to the Act; 

(f) ``Independent Account Representative'' means the authorized representative of the Account. In the case of a
Plan Account, the Independent Account Representative must be an Independent Fiduciary authorized to act for the
Plan Account; 

(g) ``Non-Plan Account'' means an Account managed by BFM consisting of assets of clients which are not employee benefit
plans subject to the Act; 

(h) ``Selling Account'' means the Account which seeks to sell its equity securities in a cross-trade transaction;
and 

(i) The ``Optimization Program'' means a computer program developed by a third party, independent of BFM and its Affiliates,
which BFM uses pursuant to a license agreement and which utilizes objective mathematical formulas to construct ``optimal''
portfolios for each Account.

exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on May 25, 1994 at 59 FR 27042.

(A) Paragraph (1) of the Summary indicates that the BellSouth Master Trust hold assets of the BellSouth Plans, which
are sponsored by BellSouth. The Applicant states that it has become aware that one additional plan participates in
the BellSouth Master Trust: the Retirement Plan of Stevens Graphics, Inc., sponsored by Stevens Graphics, Inc.,
an affiliate of BellSouth Corporation. 

(B) In paragraph (6) of the Summary, it is stated that with the addition of the Southpark assets, Karsten commenced
to hold under management over 20 percent of the assets of TREET. The Applicant represents that this statement does
not accurately describe Karsten's position with respect to management of TREET assets. The Applicant represents
that with the addition of the Southpark assets, the TREET assets under management by Karsten constituted over twenty
percent of all assets managed by Karsten on behalf of all its clients. 

After consideration of the entire record, including the comment, the Department has determined to grant the exemption.

(3) The continued holding of certificates acquired by a plan pursuant to subsection I.B. (1) or (2). 
C. Effective December 22, 1993, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b) and 407(a) of the Act, and the taxes imposed
by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section 4975(c) of the Code, shall not apply to transactions in connection

Notwithstanding the foregoing, section I.C. does not provide an exemption from the restrictions of section 406(b)
of the Act or from the taxes imposed by reason of section 4975(c) of the Code for the receipt of a fee by a servicer of the
trust from a person other than the trustee or sponsor, unless such fee constitutes a ``qualified administrative fee''
as defined in section III.S. 
D. Effective December 22, 1993, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act, and the taxes imposed by
sections 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of sections 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to
any transactions to which those restrictions or taxes would otherwise apply merely because a person is deemed to be
a party in interest or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) with respect to a plan by virtue of providing services
to the plan (or by virtue of having a relationship to such service provider described in section 3(14) (F), (G), (H),
or (I) of the Act or section 4975(e)(2) (F), (G), (H), or (I) of the Code), solely because of the plan's ownership of certificates.


II. General Conditions 


A. The relief provided under Part I is available only if the following conditions are met: 
(1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable
to the plan as they would be in an arm's length transaction with an unrelated party; 
(2) The rights and interests evidenced by the 
certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced by other certificates of the same trust;

(3) The certificates acquired by the plan have received a rating at the time of such acquisition that is in one of the
three highest generic rating categories from either Standard & Poor's Corporation (S&P's), Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff & Phelps Inc. (D&P) or Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (Fitch); 
(4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered
to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the
servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence
of one or more events of default by the servicer; 
(5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement
of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates;
the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests
therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such 
obligations (or interests); and the sum of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than
reasonable compensation for the servicer's services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement
of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection therewith; and 
(6) The plan investing in such certificates is 
an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of 
Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. 
B. Neither any underwriter, placement agent, sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, or any obligor, unless it or any
of its affiliates has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the plan assets used by
a plan to acquire certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6)
above is not satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of such certificates, provided that (1) such
condition is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum; and (2) in the case of a private placement
of certificates, the trustee obtains a representation from each initial purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance
with such condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser to the effect that, so long as such initial
purchaser (or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates) is required to obtain from its transferee
a representation regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, any such transferees will be required to make
a written representation regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection II.A.(6) above.

in a trust which are of a class subordinated to certificates representing 
an interest in the same trust. 

J. ``Obligor'' means any person, other than the insurer, that is obligated to make payments with respect to any obligation
or receivable included in the trust. Where a trust contains qualified motor vehicle leases or qualified equipment

other person is an officer, director or partner. 

N. ``Control'' means the power to exercise a controlling 
influence over the management or policies of a person other than 
an individual.

person; and

(2) the other person, or an affiliate thereof, is not a fiduciary who has investment management authority or renders

investment advice with respect to any assets of such person. 

P. ``Sale'' includes the entrance into a forward delivery 
commitment (as defined in section Q below), provided: 

(1) The terms of the forward delivery commitment 
(including any fee paid to the investing plan) are no less favorable to the plan than they would be in an arm's length

Q. ``Forward delivery commitment'' means a contract for the 
purchase or sale of one or more certificates to be delivered at an agreed future settlement date. The term includes
both mandatory contracts (which contemplate obligatory delivery and acceptance of the certificates) and optional
contracts (which give one party the right but not the obligation to deliver certificates to, or demand delivery of
certificates from, the other party). 

R. ``Reasonable compensation'' has the same meaning as that 
term is defined in 29 CFR section 2550.408c-2. 

S. ``Qualified Administrative Fee'' means a fee which meets 
the following criteria: 

(1) the fee is triggered by an act or failure to act 
by the obligor other than the normal timely payment of amounts 
owing in respect of the obligations; 

(2) the servicer may not charge the fee absent the act 
or failure to act referred to in (1); 

(3) the ability to charge the fee, the circumstances 
in which the fee may be charged, and an explanation of how the fee is calculated are set forth in the pooling and servicing
agreement; and 

(4) the amount paid to investors in the trust will 
not be reduced by the amount of any such fee waived by the servicer. 

T. ``Qualified Equipment Note Secured By A Lease'' means an 
equipment note: 

(a) which is secured by equipment which is leased; 

(b) which is secured by the obligation of the lessee 
to pay rent under the equipment lease; and

interest in the equipment is at least as protective of the rights of the trust as the trust would have if the equipment
note were secured only by the equipment and not the lease. 

U. ``Qualified Motor Vehicle Lease'' means a lease of a motor vehicle where: 

(a) the trust holds a security interest in the lease; 

(b) the trust holds a security interest in the leased 
motor vehicle; and 

(c) the trust's security interest in the leased motor 
vehicle is at least as protective of the trust's rights as the trust would receive under a motor vehicle installment
loan contract. 

V. ``Pooling and Servicing Agreement'' means the agreement or agreements among a sponsor, a servicer and the trustee
establishing a trust. In the case of certificates which are denominated as debt instruments, ``Pooling and Servicing
Agreement'' also includes the indenture entered into by the trustee of the trust issuing such certificates and the
indenture trustee.

exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on June 10, 1994, at 59 FR 30049.

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

ACTION: 

Notice of amended routine uses for NLRB system of records NLRB-19, Telephone Call Detail Records.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice amends the language of three routine uses in the NLRB Privacy Act system of records NLRB-19, Telephone
Call Detail Records. The three amended routine uses narrow the existing routine uses to specify more exactly the information
that may be disclosed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to subsection (e)(11) of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the National Labor Relations Board is publishing
a notice revising existing routine uses Nos. 1, 3, and 8 in its system of records NLRB-19, Telephone Call Detail
Records. The system notice of NLRB-19 was last published in its entirety in 58 FR 50957 on September 29, 1993.



As amended, routine use No. 1 will specify that on disclosure to an inquiring congressional office, the subject individual
must be the constituent about whom the records are maintained. The other two amended routine uses Nos. 3 and 8 respectively
will narrow the existing routine uses to specify more exactly the information that may be disclosed to a court or an
adjudicative body in the course of presenting evidence or argument, including disclosure to opposing counsel or
witnesses in the course of civil discovery, and to an inquiring Federal authority for hiring or retention of an employee.


A report of this notice to amend the three routine uses in NLRB-19, Telephone Call Detail Records was filed pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) with the Office of Management and Budget and with Congress. The specific changes to the notice being
amended (58 FR 50957, September 29, 1993) are set forth below. 




By direction of the Board.

NLRB-19



System name:



Telephone Call Detail Records.



* * * * * 



Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and the purposes of such uses:



1. A Member of Congress or to a Congressional staff member in response to an inquiry of the Congressional office made
at the written request of the constituent about whom the record is maintained. 



* * * * * 



3. A court, a magistrate, administrative tribunal, or other adjudicatory body in the course of presenting evidence
or argument, including disclosure to opposing counsel or witnesses in the course of civil discovery, litigation,
or settlement negotiations, or in connection with criminal law proceedings, when: (a) The NLRB or any component thereof;
or (b) any employee of the NLRB in his or her official capacity; or (c) any employee of the NLRB in his or her individual
capacity where the NLRB has agreed to represent the employee; or (d) the United States Government, is a party to litigation
or has interest in such litigation, and determines that such disclosure is relevant and necessary to the litigation
and that the use of such records is therefore deemed by the NLRB to be for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose
for which the records were collected. 



* * * * * 



8. A Federal authority, in response to its request, that this system of records contains information relevant to the
hiring or retention of an employee, the issuance or retention of a security clearance, the letting of a contract, or
the issuance or retention of a license, grant, or other benefit. The other agency or licensing organization, however,
may then make a request supported by the written consent of the individual for the entire record if it so chooses. No
disclosure will be made unless the information has been determined to be sufficiently reliable to support a referral
to another office within the NLRB or to another Federal agency for criminal, civil, administrative, personnel, or
regulatory action.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating To
Disclosure of Pending Formal Exchange Disciplinary Proceedings to the Central Registration Depository</DOCTITLE>


August 10, 1994.


I. Introduction


On May 6, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to authorize the Exchange to provide information to the Central Registration Depository (``CDR'')
concerning pending formal, Exchange disciplinary proceedings for disclosure to the public.





The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34268 (June 28, 1994), 59 FR 34459 (July
5, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change.


II. Description of the Proposal


The CHX is adopting Rule 9 to Article XII of the Exchange's Rules to authorize the CHX to provide information to the CRD
 concerning pending formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings for disclosure to the public. According to the Exchange,
a formal disciplinary proceeding is considered to be pending from the time charges are issued
 until the proceeding is completed.
 Currently, the Exchange discloses information only on final Exchange disciplinary actions to the CRD.








Information on pending formal SRO disciplinary proceedings, among other events, is currently in the CRD, but only
to the extent that reports are made by members, member organizations and associated persons pursuant to their reporting
obligations on the Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (Form U-4) and Form
BD, the uniform application form for broker-dealer registration. The proposal would expand the information available
on pending disciplinary actions by requiring the Exchange to report such cases to the CRD.





The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments and to perfect the mechanisms of a free and
open market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.


III. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5)
 requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent
fraudulent and manipulative acts and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

In the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Penny Stock Reform Act''), Congress
mandated that the NASD establish a toll-free telephone number (`800 number service'') for the purpose of receiving
and responding to inquiries from the public regarding the background of NASD members and their associated persons.
The NASD began operating its 800 number service on October 1, 1991. Upon the request of a caller, the NASD may disclose,
in the form of a written report, the following information contained in the CRD: 
 past and present employment history of NASD members and their associated persons; all final disciplinary actions,
 taken by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs, that relate to securities or commodities transactions;
and all criminal convictions reported on Form BD or Form U-4.





In 1993, the Commission approved a rule change by the NASD to expand the scope of information that is reportable through
its 800 number service.
 Thus, in addition to the information set forth above, the NASD may disclose to the public such events as pending formal
disciplinary actions initiated by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs; criminal indictments or informations;
civil judgments; and certain arbitration awards in securities and commodities disputes involving public customers.
Currently, the NASD relies on members and associated persons to report these events to the CRD on Form BD or Form U-4,
respectively. Because this represents the only means by which the NASD can obtain data about pending disciplinary
actions (other than its own), the quality of the CRD database, and thus of the 800 number service, depends on complete
and timely reporting by members and associated persons.




In the Commission's opinion, Rule 9 to Article XII should help fill a potential gap in the NASD's 800 number service,
by authorizing the Exchange to report the initiation of a formal CHX disciplinary proceeding
 involving an Exchange member, member organization or associated person, and significant changes in the status thereof,
 directly to the CRD. As a result, that information will be available to the public whether or not it is voluntarily reported
by the member or associated person. The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rule change should enhance the
fairness and accuracy of the CRD database and, accordingly, of information released to the public through the 800
number service.





The Commission has long believed that investors need access to reliable information in order to protect themselves
against potential fraud and abuse. In this respect, Rule 9 to Article XII should help customers make an informed decision
about whether they should conduct or continue to conduct business with particular securities professionals. In
sum, the Commission has concluded that the rule change should increase the flow of information to the public and thus
should ultimately strengthen investor protection.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CHX-94-12) is hereby approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Government Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule
Change Modifying the Trade Reporting Requirements for Category 2 Inter-Dealer Broker Netting Members</DOCTITLE>



August 10, 1994. 



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on July 5, 1994, the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with
the Securities and exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-GSCC-94-06)
as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by the self-regulatory organization.
The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change will modify GSCC's rules concerning the trade reporting requirements for category 2 inter-dealer
broker netting members (``IDBs'').



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The classification of category 2 IDBs was established by GSCC in 1993 in order to permit qualifying IDBs to engage in
up to ten percent of their trading activity in eligible securities with non-netting members.
 Each category 2 IDB must act exclusively as a broker and at least ninety percent of its business, measured based on the
overall dollar volume of next day and forward settlement activity in eligible netting securities over the most recent
twenty day period, must be with netting members.
 In addition, Category 2 IDBs have clearing fund and margin requirements essentially the same as those of a category
1 dealer netting members.






In order to monitor compliance with their scope of business requirements, each category 2 IDB is obligated to provide
GSCC in writing with a list of all of the legal entities that it acts on behalf of and must promptly inform GSCC of any change
to such list. Each IDB also is required to submit daily to GSCC all of its next day and forward settling trades in eligible
netting securities, including trades with non-grandfathered non-members and must indicate the buy and sell side
of each transaction.




GSCC's rule do not, however, expressly require that a category 2 IDB provide to GSCC for every trade done involving
an eligible netting security the identity of each buy side and sell side counterparty. This information is significant
to GSCC for risk monitoring and surveillance purposes. In particular, it is important for GSCC to understand and to
be able to assess the volume of and degree of concentration of trading done by a category 2 IDB with one or more specific
non-members.


The proposed rule change, therefore, will expressly require each category 2 IDB to disclose to GSCC for every trade
done involving an eligible netting security, including trades done with non-members, the identity of each buy side
and sell side counterparty.

GSCC believes that because the proposed rule change allows GSCC to ensure that it can appropriately monitory its existing
netting members, it is consistent with Section 17A of the Act
 and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to GSCC.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


GSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others


Comments on the proposed rule change have not yet been solicited or received. GSCC members will be notified of the rule
filing and comments will be solicited by a GSCC Important Notice. GSCC will then notify the Commission of any written
comments received by GSCC regarding the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:
(A) by order approve such proposed rule change or
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of GSCC. All submissions should refer to file number SR-GSCC-94-06
and should be submitted by September 7, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; MBS Clearing Corporation; Notice of Amendments and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Proposed Rule Change Relating to Corporate Governance Changes</DOCTITLE>


August 10, 1994.


On June 21, 1994, MBS Clearing Corporation (``MBSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 on July 18, 1994.
 On July 15, July 22, August 4, and August 9, 1994, MBSCC filed amendments to the proposed rule change.
 No comments have been received on the filing. As discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change,
including the amendemnts, on an accelerated basis.






I. Description


MBSCC is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated (``CHX''). CHX has agreed
to sell all of CHX's ownership interest in MBSCC to MBSCC participants and the National Securities Clearing Corporation
(``NSCC'').
 After the transaction is completed, participants of MBSCC will own 100% of Class A common shares of MBSCC, and NSCC
will own 100% of Class B common shares of MBSCC.






The proposed rule change adopts corporate governance changes for MBSCC consistent with the transaction described
above. The proposed rule change amends Article FOURTH of MBSCC's Certificate of Incorporation, amends various provisions
of MBSCC's By-Laws and Rules, and authorizes MBSCC to enter into a Shareholders Agreement.
Article FOURTH of MBSCC's Certificate of Incorporation is amended to increase the number of shares of stock that MBSCC
is authorized to issue and to divide the common stock into Class A and Class B shares. The increased number of authorized
shares permits MBSCC participants to hold MBSCC shares in proportion to their usage of MBSCC without creating fractional
shares. The division of the common stock into Class A and Class B shares provides a mechanism whereby NSCC, which will
purchase 100% of Class B shares, is assured one seat on the board of directors of MBSCC.
The amendments to the By-Laws and the Shareholders Agreement set forth, among other things, the number of directors,
their eligibility, and the manner in which directors will be elected. Specifically, the amendment to Article 3, Section
3.1 of the By-Laws increases the size of the MBSCC board to thirteen from its present size of eleven directors.
 In addition, Article 3, Section 3.1 of the By-Laws and Section 2 of the Shareholders Agreement require that each director,
other than the NSCC director and one director that represents the management of MBSCC, must be an officer or general
partner of or hold a similar management position with a participant of MBSCC (``Participant Director'') and that
no more than one officer, partner, director, or employee of a participant may serve as director at any given time.

<DOCNO> FR940817-2-00185 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940817-2-00090 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed rule change also amends provisions of the By-Laws to lower the number of votes required to call a special
meeting from 75% to 25% of the outstanding voting power (Article 2, Section 2.3), to provide for waiver of notice of
a stockholders' meeting (Article 2, Section 2.4), and to authorize the board of directors to establish the salaries
of MBSCC's officers (Article 5, Section 5.2).

Section 2 of the Shareholders Agreement specifies how Participant Directors and members of the nominating committee
 are elected. As is currently the practice, the nominating committee will nominate candidates for Participant Directors
and members of the following year's nominating committee.
 Participants are given the opportunity to petition for additional candidates.
 If no petitions are filed, the participant shareholders must elect the candidates nominated by the nominating committee.







If there are competing candidates due to a petition or petitions being filed, ballots will be mailed to all participants.
Pursuant to Section 2(A)(iii) of the Shareholders Agreement, each participant of MBSCC is entitled to the number
of votes determined by multiplying the number of persons to be elected Participant Directors at the annual meeting
by one vote for each $1,000 of average monthly volume-related fees (rounded down to the nearest one thousand dollars)
payable or paid by the participant to MBSCC during the preceding year (``Voting Entitlement'').
 Every participant shall have at least one vote. Each participant may cast all of its votes for a single nominee or distribute
its votes among several nominees. Participants Owners of Class A stock must vote their shares as determined by the
vote of all of the participants whether or not the voting participants are shareholders. In the event of a tie vote,
the nominating committee selects the person who is to be elected director.

The Shareholders Agreement also contains provisions relating to shareholder votes for other than the election of
directors.
 In addition, the Shareholders Agreement contains provisions relating to required transfers of MBSCC's stock
 and permitted transfers of MBSCC's Class A and Class B stock.
 The Shareholders Agreement also provides that the provisions governing the voting of shares shall continue in force
for ten years and shall be automatically renewed for a subsequent ten year period.
 Finally, MBSCC is amending Article V, Rule 6, Section 3 of its Rules to delete references to the CHX.







II. Discussion


The Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and, therefore, is approving
the proposal. Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(C)
 of the Act in that it assures the fair representation of its shareholders and participants in the selection of its directors
and administration of its affairs.




The Act does not define fair representation or set up particular standards of representation. Instead it provides
that the Commission must determine whether the rules of the clearing agency assure adequate representation of participants
and shareholders in the selection of the board of directors and the administration of the clearing agency's affairs.
In its release setting forth the standards for registration of clearing agencies (``Standards Release''), the Commission
stated that rather than prescribing a single method for providing fair representation, the Commission would evaluate
each clearing agency's procedures on a case-by-case basis.
 With respect to providing participants with a meaningful opportunity to be represented in the selection of the board
of directors and the administration of the clearing agency's affairs, the Standards Release suggests a number of
methods can be used to comply with the fair representation standard. Among others, these include the allocation of
voting stock to all participants based on their usage of the clearing agency or the selection by participants of a slate
of nominees for which the stockholders of the clearing agency will be required to vote their shares.






MBSCC's proposal initially allows all participants to purchase voting stock based on their usage of MBSCC. Rather
than reallocating the voting shares each year in proportion to participants' usage of MBSCC, the Shareholders Agreement
requires the participant shareholders to elect directors selected by all participants. If the voting provisions
of the Shareholders Agreement expire, the participants' voting stock will be reallocated each year in accordance
with each participant's usage of MBSCC. Both methods of electing directors appear to be consistent with the methods
outlined in the Standards Release.
The Shareholders Agreement should ensure that the candidates for the board and the nominating committee represent
the entire MBSCC participant base. The nominating committee is directed to select candidates with a view toward providing
fair representation for the interests of a cross section of the participants. Other candidates may be nominated if
the nominating committee is petitioned by participants.
Other aspects to the proposed rule change serve to enhance the ability of small participants to have a voice in the administration
of MBSCC's affairs. By limiting each participant's representation on the board to only one director, MBSCC's board
should represent a cross-section of MBSCC's participant base and should not be dominated by one or two large participants.
To counter the potential for a few large participants to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote, certain provisions
of the Shareholders Agreement limit the shareholders' authority in favor of board power. For example, the shareholders
must vote as directed by the board regarding removal of directors and the amendment of certain provisions of the Certificate
of Incorporation. In addition, by requiring a 2/3 vote to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws, a
greater consensus among shareholders must be obtained before making substantial changes to MBSCC's administration.
The Commission believes that the provisions enhancing the authority of the board of directors, who represent all
the participants, are consistent with a clearing agency's obligations of fair representation.
The Commission also believes that the limitation on the voting entitlement of BHC participants is permissible under
the fair representation requirements. During 1993, the BHCs' usage of MBSCC was less than 20% of the total usage of
MBSCC, and therefore, no reduction in the BHCs' voting entitlement would have been required. MBSCC has agreed to notify
the Commission if the BHCs' usage of MBSCC exceeds 24%. However, the Commission believes that even if a reduction of
the BHCs' voting entitlement occurs, the fair representation requirements are not violated because the provision
was adopted at the request of the BHCs, whose voting entitlements are being reduced, because of the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956.
MBSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of the notice of filing. The parties to the merger have agreed to close the transaction
during the first two weeks of August 1994. To permit an efficient transfer of ownership from the CHX to MBSCC participants,
it is necessary that the appropriate governance changes are in place. Therefore, the Commission finds sufficient
cause to accelerate approval of this proposal.

the Act.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MBSCC-94-03)
be, and hereby is, approved.

Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC); Engine Harmonization Working Group



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of new task assignments for the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is given of new task assignments for the Engine Harmonization Working Group of the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory
Committee (ARAC). This notice informs the public of the activities of the ARAC.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On January 22, 1991 (56 FR 2190), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established the Aviation Rulemaking
Advisory Committee (ARAC). The committee provides advice and recommendations to the FAA Administrator, through
the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification, on the full range of the FAA's rulemaking activities
with respect to aviation-related issues.





In order to develop such advice and recommendations, the ARAC may choose to establish working groups to which specific
tasks are assigned. Such working groups are comprised of experts from those organizations having an interest in the
assigned tasks. A working group member need not be a representative of a member of the full committee. One of the working
groups established by the ARAC is the Engine Harmonization Working Group.

The FAA announced at the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA)_Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Harmonization
Conference in Toronto, Canada, (June 2-5, 1992), that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing
objective to ``harmonize'' the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) and the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).


Tasks



The Engine Harmonization Working Group new tasks are as follows:



Task 1, Fire Pervention_

Review FAR and JAR requirements and create one set of common requirements (FAR 33.17; JAR-E-530).



Task 2, FAR 35_

Conduct a comparison of FAR Park 35 and JAR-P requirements and advisory material and identify significant differences.
This comparison should clarify and redefine existing requirements to include new standards to reflect recent advancements
in design and construction of composite material propellers, propeller control systems (such as dual acting control
systems) and electronic controls.



Reports




For each task listed, the Engine Harmonization Working Group should develop and present to the ARAC:

1. A recommended work plan for completion of the tasks, including the rationale supporting such as a plan, for consideration
at the meeting of the ARAC to consider transport airplane and engine issues held following publication of this notice;

2. A detailed conceptual presentation on the proposed recommendation(s), prior to proceeding with the work stated
in item 3. below;

3. A draft Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, with supporting economic and other required analyses, and/or any other
related guidance material or collateral documents the working group determines to be appropriate; or, if new or revised
requirements or compliance methods are not recommended, a draft report stating the rationale for not making such
recommendations; and

4. A status report at each meeting of the ARAC held to consider transport airplane and engine issues.



Participation in Working Group Task



An individual who has expertise in the subject matter and wishes to become a member of the working group should write
to the person listed under the caption 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

expressing that desire, describing his or her interest in the task(s), and stating the expertise he or she would bring
to the working group. The request will be reviewed with the assistant chair and working group chair, and the individual
will be advised whether or not the request can be accommodated.


The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee
are necessary in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the FAA by law.

Meetings of the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee will be open to the public, except as authorized by section
10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Meetings of the working group will not be open to the public, except to
the extent that individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement of
working group meetings will be made.

Applicable Rate of Interest on Nonqualified Withdrawals From a Capital Construction Fund



Under the authority in Section 607(h)(4)(B) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1177(h)(4)(B)),
we hereby determine and announce that the applicable rate of interest on the amount of additional tax attributable
to any nonqualified withdrawals from a Capital Construction Fund established under Section 607 of the Act shall be
5.62 percent, with respect to nonqualified withdrawals made in the taxable year beginning in 1994.

The determination of the applicable rate of interest with respect to nonqualified withdrawals was computed, according
to the joint regulations issued under the Act (46 CFR 391.7(e)(2)(ii)), by multiplying eight percent by the ratio
which (a) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning
of such taxable year bears to (b) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year 1970. The applicable
rate so determined was computed to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent.

Child Seating Systems Manufactured by Fisher-Price, Inc.; Cancellation of Public Meeting and Termination of Proceeding



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Cancellation of public meeting and termination of proceeding.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 By notice published on August 1, 1994, NHTSA scheduled a public meeting for August 17, 1994 regarding an appeal by Fisher-Price,
Inc., of NHTSA's denial of its petition for an exemption from the recall requirements of the National Traffic and Motor
Vehicle Safety Act. Fisher-Price recently advised the agency that it is now taking the position that it has not determined
that its child safety seats failed to comply with the flammability requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
No. 213. Under the agency's regulations, a manufacturer may not seek an exemption from the recall requirements in
the absence of such a determination. Therefore, this proceeding is hereby terminated, and the public meeting is hereby
cancelled.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 11, 1993, a contractor for NHTSA's Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance (OVSC) tested certain child safety
seats manufactured by Fisher-Price to ascertain whether those seats complied with the requirements of Federal Motor
Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems.'' The results of those tests indicated that
the seats failed the flammability requirements of that standard, which are incorporated by reference from FMVSS
No. 302, ``Flammability of Interior Materials,'' in that the shoulder belt webbing of the seats burned at a rate above
the limit established by the standard. Upon receipt of the test results, OVSC opened a noncompliance investigation,
NCI 3270.



Although Fisher-Price initially resisted OVSC's suggestion that the company should make a formal determination
that the seats failed to comply, on September 16, 1993, Fisher-Price, submitted a letter, pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573,
``Defect and Noncompliance Reports,'' notifying the agency that it had ``become aware of information suggesting
that the molded shoulder belt webbing on its Model AO9191, DO9101, 9103, 9149, 9173, 9179, and 9180 car seats may not
comply with the requirements of FMVSS 302.''

Concurrently, Fisher-Price filed a petition asking NHTSA for ``an exemption from the notification and remedy requirements
* * * based on an inconsequential noncompliance with the requirements * * * as related
to motor vehicle safety.'' This petition was filed pursuant to former section 157 of the Act (now 49 U.S.C. 30118(d)
and 30120(h)) and 49 CFR Part 556, ``Exemption for Inconsequential Defect or Noncompliance.''

Pursuant to 49 CFR 556.4(a), inconsequentiality petitions may only be filed by a manufacturer following a determination
that a vehicle or item of equipment produced by the manufacturer contains a defect or fails to comply with an applicable
FMVSS. In its September 16, 1993 letter, Fisher-Price stated that ``[i]n order to comply with the requirements of
49 CFR 556.4(b)(6) [sic] that a report in accordance with 49 CFR Part 573 be submitted with its Petition for exemption,''
it was providing the information required by Part 573.

Under the circumstances, including the fact that the results of the compliance tests conducted both by OVSC and by
Fisher-Price clearly indicated that the seats in question did not satisfy the flammability requirements of the standard,
NHTSA interpreted Fisher-Price's statement as a notification of the company's noncompliance determination. Therefore,
the agency accepted the inconsequentiality petition for processing. It published a notice that the petition had
been filed on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59511), and denied the petition on March 22, 1994. Notice of the denial was published
on May 5, 1994 (59 FR 23253). On May 6, Fisher-Price appealed the denial and asked for a public meeting. Notice of the
appeal was published on June 16, 1994 (59 FR 30957), and the public meeting requested by the company was scheduled for
August 17, 1994 (59 FR 39015).

Upon reviewing the documents that Fisher-Price submitted with its appeal, NHTSA noted that Fisher-Price seemed
to be taking the position that its child safety seats did not fail to comply with FMVSS No. 213. Therefore, the agency
requested Fisher-Price to clarify whether it had in fact made a noncompliance determination. On August 10, 1994,
Fisher-Price advised NHTSA that it would not concede that its seats failed to comply with the standard and that its
September 16, 1993 letter should not be construed as a determination of noncompliance.

Because 49 CFR 556.4(a) precludes consideration of Fisher-Price's petition for an inconsequentiality exemption
in the absence of such a determination, NHTSA is terminating this proceeding (Docket 93-79) and is cancelling the
public meeting scheduled for August 17, 1994. The agency plans to take further action with respect to the noncompliance
investigation in the near future.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission





Operating Licenses, Amendments; No Significant Hazards Considerations; Biweekly Notices











Federal Register

  Vol. 59, No. 158  Wednesday, 
August 17, 1994  Notices 










<USDEPT>UNITED STATES NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



Biweekly Notice



Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses
Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.


This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from July 25, 1994, through
August 5, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on August 3, 1994.




Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing




The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By September 16, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a
hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on
the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice
of a hearing or an appropriate order. 

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved. 




Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket Nos. STN 50-528, STN 50-529, and STN 50-530, Palo Verde Nuclear Generating
Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, 
and 3, Maricopa County, Arizona





Date of amendment requests: 

May 4, 1994



Description of amendment requests: 

These amendment requests would revise Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.8.3 and Surveillance Requirement
4.4.8.3.1, ``Overpressure Protection Systems.'' Specifically, the LCO and surveillance requirements are revised
to clarify that both shutdown cooling system (SCS) suction line relief valves shall be OPERABLE and aligned to provide
overpressure protection not only during reactor (RCS) cooldown or heatup evolutions, but also during any steady
state temperature periods maintained in the course of RCS cooldown or heatup evolutions.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below: 




Standard 1 -- Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated.


The proposed amendments provide further clarification of the Technical Specifications and represent an additional
operating limitation. Incorporating the noted clarification will not change the bases or assumptions contained
in the safety analysis for this system. The most limiting low-temperature overpressure protection (LTOP) transients,
the starting of an idle reactor coolant pump (RCP) and the inadvertent actuation of two high pressure safety injection
(HPSI) pumps into a solid RCS, are not affected by the proposed clarification. Therefore, the proposed amendments
do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


Standard 2 -- Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.


Clarifying the applicability of the LCO's and surveillance for steady state periods achieved and maintained during
either a heatup or cooldown evolution does not modify the design or operation of plant equipment. No new or different
failure modes will be introduced by incorporating this clarification into the LCO and surveillance requirement.
Therefore, the proposed amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
accident previously evaluated.


Standard 3 -- Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


The clarification will enhance LCO 3.4.8.3 and Surveillance Requirement 4.4.8.3.1 for heatup and cooldown evolutions
by ensuring operators are aware of this applicability during periods of steady state conditions. This clarification
does not involve a change to safety limits, setpoints, or design margins. As such, the proposed amendments will not
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety at PVNGS.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, 
and 3, Maricopa County, Arizona





Date of amendment requests: 

June 17, 1994



Description of amendment requests: 

The proposed amendments would increase the minimum nitrogen accumulator pressure for the atmospheric dump valves
(ADVs), as stated in the surveillance requirements of Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.1.6. The change to the
Bases increases the minimum time the ADV accumulators must be operable.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below: 




Standard 1 -- Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


The proposed Technical Specification change in the nitrogen accumulator supply minimum pressure will not increase
the probability or consequences of any accident previously analyzed. The nitrogen accumulator pressure is normally
maintained between 650-680 psig. Nitrogen pressure from the accumulator is reduced to 105 psig prior to use in the
operation of the ADVs. The pressure reduction will remain the same with the higher minimum accumulator pressure.


Standard 2 -- Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.


Increasing the nitrogen accumulator minimum pressure does not create any new or different accidents than those previously
evaluated. The normal air supply (the Instrument Air System) to the ADV is maintained between 105 to 125 psig. Currently,
nitrogen from the accumulator is reduced to 105 psig prior to use in the ADV. The increased minimum pressure in the accumulator
will still be reduced to 105 psig prior to use in the ADV.


Standard 3 -- Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


The limitation on maintaining the nitrogen accumulator at a certain pressure is to ensure that a sufficient volume
of nitrogen is in the accumulator to operate the associated ADV. Maintaining a higher minimum pressure ensures that
sufficient nitrogen will be available to maintain the unit at HOT STANDBY for four hours and an additional 9.3 hours
to reach COLD SHUTDOWN under natural circulation conditions in the event of failure of the normal control air system.
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment requests: 

July 12, 1994



Description of amendment requests: 

The proposed amendment would enhance the PVNGS Technical Specifications (TS) by adding a limiting condition for
operation (LCO) action statement to Entry VIII B of Table 3.3-3, ``Engineered Safety Features Actuation System Instrumentation.''
The proposed action statement would enhance safe plant operation by requiring timely plant shutdown if more than
one of the new solid state degraded voltage relays in either train of 4.16kV are inoperable or not energized.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below:




Standard 1--Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated:


The proposed amendment will add an action statement to TS Table 3.3-3 entry VIII B which would allow eight hours to effect
repairs. This action statement would be entered if more than one of the required four degraded voltage relays on either
4.16 kv bus is inoperable or not energized. If the eight hour allowed outage time is not met, the unit is placed in Hot
Standby within six hours and in Cold Shutdown within the next thirty hours. Technical Specification 3.8.3.1 currently
allows eight hours to restore a 4.16 kv bus in the event of a loss of power to that bus. The loss of degraded voltage relays
on that bus does not impact plant nuclear safety any more than the loss of the bus itself. Furthermore, even with the
loss of all four degraded voltage relays monitoring one 4.16 kv bus (for example, due to a blown 125 vdc circuit fuse),
the loss-of-voltage relays on that bus, and the degraded voltage relays, as well as the loss-of-voltage relays monitoring
the other bus would be unaffected. None of the UFSAR chapter 15 accident analyses are affected by this proposed amendment.
The existing TS requirements and those components to which they apply are not altered by this TS amendment. There are
no changes to the maintenance, surveillance, and/or qualification of any component/function in Table 3.3-3. Therefore,
the addition of this proposed eight hour action statement to Table 3.3-3 entry VIII B does not increase the probability
of occurrence or the consequences of any previously evaluated accident.


Standard 2--Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated:


The TS requirements and the components to which they apply are not altered by this amendment. The new solid state degraded
voltage relays in each 4.16 kv bus were installed under the 10 CFR 50.59 change process. APS [Arizona Public Service
Company] determined that the installation created no unreviewed safety question. This amendment has no impact on
plant maintenance, testing, shutdown equipment, or component qualification. Plant operational safety is enhanced
by this amendment. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created by this amendment.


Standard 3--Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety:


The TS does not alter existing TS requirements or those components to which they apply. More specifically, there is
no impact on safe plant shutdown, maintenance, containment isolation capability, containment leakage rate, or
the operability of safety related valves. Therefore, the addition of the proposed action statement to the TS will
not involve reduction in a margin of safety for fission product release to the atmosphere. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-317 and 50-318, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos.
1 and 2, Calvert County, Maryland





Date of amendments request: 

June 8, 1994



Description of amendments request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant (CCNPP) Units 1 and 2 Technical Specification
(TS) Section 4.7.1.2.c to extend the interval for three Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) surveillance requirements from
18 to 24 months. Specifically, TS Section 4.7.2.c.1 requires the verification of each automatic valve in the flowpath
actuate to its correct position and each AFW pump automatically start upon receipt of each AFW actuation system test
signal; TS Section 4.7.2.c.2 requires verification that the AFW system is capable of providing a minimum 300 gallons
per minute nominal flow to each leg. This request is one of a series of proposed license amendments that would eliminate
the need for mid-cycle surveillance outages by extending 18-month frequency surveillances to every refueling outage
(nominally each 24 months). 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


The Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System provides a safety-related source of feedwater to the steam generators to mitigate
design basis accidents involving loss of Main Feedwater. Failure of the AFW System is not an initiator for any previously
analyzed accident. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident
previously evaluated.


A historical review of surveillance test results and system performance indicates that the AFW System is very reliable.
In addition, monthly surveillances of the AFW System will continue to verify proper pump and valve operation. The
AFW System reliability and monthly surveillances provide assurance that undetected system degradation will not
occur between 24-month surveillances. Therefore, the AFW System will continue to perform its safety function and
there will be no significant increase in the consequences of accidents. Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification
changes do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated?


This requested revision to increase the interval for some AFW surveillances from 18 to 24 months does not involve a
significant change in the design or operation of the plant. No hardware is being added to the plant as part of the proposed
change. The proposed change will not introduce any new accident initiators. Therefore, this change would not create
the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.


3. Does operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety?


The AFW System provides a margin of safety by providing a safety-related alternate supply of feedwater to the steam
generator for removal of decay heat and cooldown of the Reactor Coolant System. The proposed changes do not affect
the operation or design of the AFW System. Monthly surveillances and historical data provide assurance that the reduction
in surveillance frequency will not adversely affect our ability to detect degradation in the system. Therefore,
the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied.
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendments request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester
County, New York





Date of amendment request: 

April 29, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

This amendment is an additional followup to the amendment request of May 29, 1992, published in the 

Federal Register 

on July 8, 1992 (57FR30242), which changed the Technical Specifications Section 1.0, Definitions, to accommodate
a 24-month fuel cycle and which proposed the extension of the test intervals for specific surveillance tests. This
amendment proposes extending the surveillance intervals to 24 months for the following additional surveillance
tests:
(1) Calibrate and test channels for Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) initiation on steam generator water level (low-low).
(2) Test channels for Auxiliary Feedwater initiation on trip of main feedwater pumps.
The licensee's amendment proposal of November 25, 1992, requested approval for extending the surveillance interval
of the Auxiliary Feedwater System to accommodate a 24-month fuel cycle and the approved change was issued in License
Amendment No. 166. Subsequently, the licensee determined that two additional surveillances associated with this
system had not been identified in the November 25, 1992, request. This amendment proposal requests approval of the
additional surveillances. The changes requested by the licensee are in accordance with Generic Letter 91-04, ``Changes
in Technical Specification Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle.''



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 



The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:


1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.


The test results over the last four refuelings confirmed system operability with only one failure. This failure would
not have impaired the ability of the auxiliary feedwater system to perform its intended safety function. The auxiliary
feedwater system is redundant and diverse. The failure in the turbine driven pump did not impact the motor driven pumps.


Based on the historical test data, it is concluded that no significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident would be incurred by extending the operating cycle due to an increased surveillance interval.


2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.


The failure noted from the past test data appears random in nature and would not have defeated the redundancy in design
that exists in the AFW system. The AFW system would have been capable of performing its intended safety function and
therefore a new or different kind of accident would not have been created.


3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.


Past historical data demonstrates that the AFW systems would perform their safety function for an extended operating
cycle should the surveillance period be extended by several months.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

County, New York





Date of amendment request: 

June 16, 1994 



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise License Condition 2.K of the license issued August 24, 1981, to provide for compliance
with the NRC-approved fire protection program as described in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report and for making
changes to the 
NRC-approved fire protection program; would delete fire protection Technical Specification (TS) Sections 3.13
and 4.14 which contain limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements, respectively, for the
high-pressure water fire protection system, fire protection spray systems, penetration fire barriers, fire detection
systems, fire hose stations and hydrants, and the cable spreading room halon system; would delete Section 6.2.2.f
which contains fire brigade staffing requirements; would delete Section 6.4.2 which contains fire brigade training
requirements; would add Section 6.5.1.6.1 to add fire protection program responsibilities to the Station Nuclear
Committee; would add Section 6.8.1.e to require written procedures and administrative policies for the fire protection
program; would delete Section 6.9.2.b which requires a Special Report for inoperable fire protection and detection
equipment; and would make corresponding changes to the Table of Contents and List of Tables.

Generic Letter (GL) 86-10, dated April 24, 1986, and GL 88-12, dated August 2, 1988, from the NRC provided guidance
to licensees to request removal of the fire protection TS. The licensee's proposed amendment is in response to these
GLs.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of the standards for determining whether a ``Significant
Hazards Consideration'' exists by providing certain examples in 51 FR 7744 (dated March 6, 1986). Example (vii) of
those involving no significant hazards considerations relates to ``a change to conform a license to changes in the
regulations, where the license change results in very minor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with
the regulations.''


In this case, NRC Generic Letters 86-10 and 88-12, although not regulations, provide pertinent guidance relative
to the above described proposed changes and implementation of the NRC fire protection regulations of 10 CFR 50.48(a).
Specifically, the generic letters allow licensees to delete fire protection related technical specifications,
provided that administrative requirements are added to technical specifications and a license condition is provided
that requires the implementation and maintenance in effect of the approved fire protection program. Further, the
generic letters provide for inclusion of the fire protection program into the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report] and permits future changes to the fire protection program without prior NRC approval, all as provided by the
license condition and in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59. Therefore, since the actions required by
the generic letters have been taken and conform the license to the current interpretation of NRC fire protection regulations
as described in Generic Letters 86-10 and 88-12, with no changes to facility operations, these proposed changes are
in accordance with Example (vii) above.


In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications are deemed
not to involve any ``Significant Hazards Considerations'' because operation of Indian Point Unit No. 2 in accordance
with these changes would not:


(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


The fire protection program requirements are not affected in that the function, operation or surveillance requirements
for any fire protection system or component are not being altered. The proposed changes simply relocate these requirements
from the Technical Specifications to the UFSAR, are administrative in nature, and do not affect any other current
plant equipment or practices. Therefore, the conclusions of current accident analyses are not affected. Further,
as permitted by the proposed License Condition 2.K, changes in the NRC-approved fire protection program will require
an evaluation per the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59 to determine that the proposed change will not involve an unreviewed
safety question. Therefore, future changes to the fire protection program will be evaluated in accordance with appropriate
criteria.


(2) Create the possibility for a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.


The proposed changes introduce no new mode of plant operation, do not involve physical modification to any structure,
system or component, do not affect the function, operation or surveillance requirements for any equipment necessary
for safe operation or shutdown of the plant or of fire protection equipment which protects such equipment, and do not
involve any changes to setpoints or operating parameters. The changes are administrative only and all existing fire
protection requirements are maintained. Therefore, the changes can not result in an unanalyzed accident. Further,
as permitted by the proposed License Condition 2.K, changes in the NRC-approved fire protection program will require
an evaluation per the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59 to determine that the proposed change will not involve an unreviewed
safety question. Therefore, future changes to the fire protection program will be evaluated in accordance with appropriate
criteria.


(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.


The existing fire protection program operability and surveillance requirements are retained as they are contained
in the FPPP [Fire Protection Program Plan], and compliance will continue through proposed License Condition 2.K.
Therefore, no margins of safety established by design or verified by testing to ensure operability of fire protection
systems or components are affected. Further, as permitted by the proposed License Condition 2.K, changes in the NRC-approved
fire protection program will require an evaluation per the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59 to determine that the proposed
change will not involve an unreviewed safety question. Therefore, future changes to the fire protection program
will be evaluated in accordance with appropriate criteria.


Based on the above discussion, since these proposed changes to the Indian Point Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
satisfy the criteria specified in 10 CFR 50.92, are similar to an example provided by the Commission of a change which
involves ``No Significant Hazards Considerations'', and are not similar to any examples that involve a ``Significant
Hazards Consideration'', Con Edison has determined that this amendment application does not involve any ``Significant
Hazards Considerations.''


The proposed Technical Specification changes have been reviewed by the Station Nuclear Safety Committee and the
Con Edison Nuclear Facilities Safety Committee. Both committees concur that these proposed changes do not represent
any ``Significant Hazards Considerations.''




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

July 8, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification Section 3.7, Auxiliary Electrical Systems to clarify
offsite power availability requirements and to revise emergency diesel generator fuel oil availability requirements.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




Consistent with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application involves no significant hazards based
on the following information:


1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?


Response:


Neither the probability nor the consequence of an accident previously analyzed is increased due to the proposed changes.
There are no changes on the existing offsite power supply configuration or on the existing diesel fuel oil supply system
or inventory requirements. This proposed amendment will allow for three diesel operation when a fuel oil storage
tank or transfer pump is unavailable. In the event of an accident at this time, the three diesel operation would allow
for more than minimum safeguards to be available, with maximum safeguards available for the first part of the event.


2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated?


Response:


The existing 138 kV and 13.8 kV offsite power reliability is maintained with this change. There is no impact on availability
of the alternate AC system, the three gas turbines, with this change. This change is consistent with the original licensing
basis that the AEC accepted for the diesel fuel oil supply system.


3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety?


Response:


The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed amendment maintains
the reliability of the preferred 138 kV and 13.8 kV offsite power and is consistent with the original licensing basis
for diesel fuel oil inventory.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Duquesne Light Company, et al., Docket No. 50-334, Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 1, Shippingport, Pennsylvania





Date of amendment request: 

July 29, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications (TSs) 3/4.4.5 and 3/4.4.6.2 and associated bases
to allow the implementation of interim steam generator tube plugging criteria for the tube support elevations during
cycle 11. The allowed primary-to-secondary operational leakage from any one steam generator is proposed to be reduced
from 500 gallons per day (gpd) to 150 gpd. The total allowed primary-to-secondary operational leakage from all steam
generators would be reduced from one gallon per minute (1440 gpd) to 
450 gpd.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?


Testing of model boiler specimens for free span tubing (no tube support plate [TSP] restraint) at room temperature
conditions show[s] burst pressures in excess of 5000 psi for indications of outer diameter stress corrosion cracking
with voltage measurement as high as 19 volts. Burst testing performed on intersections pulled from BVPS [Beaver Valley
Power Station] with up to a 2.7 volt indication shows measured burst pressure in excess of 6600 psi at room temperature.
Burst testing performed on pulled tubes from other plants with up to 7.5 volt indications show[s] burst pressures
in excess of 6300 psi at room temperatures. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material properties and minimum
strength levels (as the burst testing was done at room temperature), tube burst capability significantly exceeds
the safety factor requirements of RG [Regulatory Guide] 1.121. As stated earlier, tube burst criteria are inherently
satisfied during normal operating conditions due to the proximity of the TSP. Test data indicates that tube burst
cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes which have 100 percent through wall electric discharge machining (EDM)
notches, 0.75 inch long, provided that the TSP is adjacent to the notched area. Since tube to TSP proximity precludes
tube burst during normal operating conditions, use of the criteria must retain tube integrity characteristics which
maintain a margin of safety of 1.43 times the bounding faulted condition steam line break (SLB) pressure differential.
As previously stated, the RG 1.121 criterion requiring maintenance of a safety factor of 1.43 times the SLB pressure
differential on tube burst is satisfied by 7/8 inch diameter tubing with bobbin coil indications with signal amplitudes
less than 8.82 volts regardless of the indicated depth measurement. The plugging criteria (resulting in a projected
end-of-cycle [EOC] voltage) compares favorably with the 8.82 volt structural limit considering the extremely slow
apparent voltage growth rate of indications at BVPS. Using the established methodology of RG 1.121, the structural
limit is reduced by allowances for uncertainty and growth to develop a beginning-of-cycle (BOC) repair limit which
should preclude indications at EOC conditions which exceed the structural limit. The non-destructive examination
(NDE) uncertainty component is 20.5 percent and is based on the EPRI [Electric Power Research Institute] Alternate
Repair Criteria (ARC). A bounding growth allowance of 40 percent will be applied. This value is conservative for BVPS
Unit 1. The BOC maximum allowable repair limit should not permit the existence of EOC indications (when the 40 percent
growth and 20.5 percent uncertainty allowances are applied) which exceed the 8.82 volt structural limit. By adding
NDE uncertainty allowances and an allowance for crack growth to the repair limit, the structural limit can be validated.
Therefore, the maximum allowable BOC repair limit (RL) based on the structural limit of 8.82 volts can be represented
by the expression:


RL + (0.205 X RL) + (0.40 x RL) = 8.82 volts, or the maximum allowable BOC repair limit can be expressed as:


RL = 8.82 volt structural limit/1.605 = 5.5 volts.


It is reasonable that this repair limit (5.5 volts) could be applied for IPC [interim plugging criterion] implementation
to repair bobbin indications greater than 1.0 or 2.0 volts independent of RPC [rotating pancake coil] confirmation
of the indication. The analyses were performed based on a 1.0 or 2.0 volt repair limit. Duquesne Light Company has chosen
to use a steam generator tube repair limit of 1.0 volt. Conservatively, an upper limit of 3.6 volts will be used to assess
tube integrity for those bobbin indications which are above 1.0 volt but do not have confirming RPC calls. This 3.6
volt upper limit for non-confirmed RPC calls is consistent with other recently approved IPC programs for the two other
plants with 7/8 inch tubing that currently implement IPCs. Since the upper bound for repair of non-confirmed RPC is
limited to a value far less than the limit associated with a full alternate criteria, the establishment of the repair
limits are [is] judged to be independent of the pulled tube data base used.


The conservatism of the growth allowance used to develop the repair limit is shown by the most recent BVPS eddy current
data. The average voltage growth for all indications was 16 percent while the average voltage growth for indications
greater than 0.75 volts at BOC was 6 percent. The largest overall voltage growth in a particular steam generator was
found in the ``A'' steam generator, which had an overall average growth of 25 percent. Only two tubes had an absolute
voltage growth which exceeded 1.0 volt for Cycle 9. The maximum absolute voltage growth in the 1993 inspection was
recorded to be 1.18 volts. Each of the last three inspections, which included 100 percent of all hot leg tubes, showed
decreasing voltage growth trends in each successive inspection for all categories; overall voltage growth, growth
of BOC indications less than 0.75 volts, and growth of indications greater than 0.75 volts. The decreasing voltage
growth rate trend data indicates that DLC has good control of the ODSCC [outer diameter stress corrosion cracking]
occurring in the BVPS Unit 1 steam generators and also implies that atypical voltage growth of a few indications is
unlikely.


Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, it has been previously established that a postulated
main SLB [steam line break] outside of containment but upstream of the main steam isolation valve (MSIV) represents
the most limiting radiological condition relative to the IPC. In support of implementation of the interim plugging
criteria, it will be determined whether the distribution of cracking indications at the TSP intersections at the
end of Cycle 11 are [is] projected to be such that primary-to-secondary leakage would result in site boundary doses
within a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 guidelines. A separate calculation has determined this allowable SLB leakage
limit to be 6.6 gpm in the faulted loop. This limit was calculated using the Technical Specification RCS [reactor coolant
system] Iodine-131 activity level of 1.0 micro Curies per gram dose equivalent Iodine-131 and the recommended Iodine-131
transient spiking values consistent with NUREG-0800. The projected SLB leakage rate calculation methodology prescribed
in Section 3.3 of draft NUREG-1477 will be used to calculate EOC leakage. The log-logistic probability of leakage
correlation will be used to establish the SLB leak rate used for comparison with the 6.6 gpm faulted loop allowable
limit. Due to the relatively low voltage levels of indications at BVPS and low voltage growth rates, it is expected
that the actual calculated leakage values will be far less than this limit. Additionally, the current Iodine-131
levels as of May 1994 at BVPS are about 1000 times less than the Technical Specification limit of 1.0.


Application of the criteria requires the projection of postulated SLB leakage, based on the projected EOC voltage
distribution for the upcoming cycle. Projected EOC voltage distribution is developed using the most recent EOC eddy
current results and a voltage measurement uncertainty. Data indicate that a threshold voltage of 2.8 volts would
result in through wall cracks long enough to leak at steam line break conditions. Draft NUREG-1477 requires that all
indications to which the IPC are applied must be included in the leakage projection. Tube pull results from another
plant with 7/8 inch tubing with a substantial voltage growth data base have shown that tube wall degradation of greater
than 40 percent through wall was readily detectable either by the bobbin or RPC probe. The tube with maximum through
wall penetration of 56 percent (42 percent average) had a voltage of 2.02 volts. This indication also was the largest
recorded bobbin voltage from the EOC eddy current data. Based on the BVPS pulled tube and industry pulled tube data
supporting a lower threshold for SLB leakage of 2.8 volts, inclusion of all IPC intersections in the leakage model
is quite conservative. The ODSCC occurring at BVPS has historically resulted in relatively low voltage levels and
has exhibited decreasing voltage growth trends over the last three inspections. BVPS has not identified ODSCC as
a contributor to operational leakage. The current leakage levels at BVPS are negligible (less than 1 gpd). In order
to satisfy the requirements of draft NUREG-1477, EOC 10 eddy current data will be used to calculate the projected SLB
leakage according to draft NUREG-1477 methodology. Leakage calculated using the recommended EPRI leakage correlation
will also be provided. Duquesne Light Company is requesting that the NRC review and approve the EPRI SLB leakage calculation
methodology. Sufficient justification is included to establish acceptability of the EPRI leakage correlation
based on criteria provided by the NRC in the February 8, 1994, Industry/NRC working meeting on the voltage based criteria.


In order to assess the sensitivity of application of the voltage based criteria upon SLB leakage, the EOC 9 eddy current
results were used to calculate postulated EOC 10 leakage using both the NUREG-1477 methodology and EPRI correlation
assuming that a 1.0 or 2.0 volt plugging limit were implemented at the BOC 10. 


Results indicate SLB leakage of 0.46 gpm and 0.044 gpm using the NUREG and EPRI methodologies with an assumed probability
of detection (POD) of 0.6 for a 2.0 volt repair limit. Since Duquesne Light Company has chosen to limit the voltage based
plugging limit at 1.0 volt, EOC 11 SLB leakage is analyzed to be approximately 5 percent lower than the calculated SLB
leakage with a 2.0 volt repair limit.


Therefore, implementation of the interim plugging criteria does not adversely affect steam generator tube integrity
and implementation will be shown to result in acceptable dose consequences, therefore, the proposed amendment does
not result in any increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?


Implementation of the proposed steam generator tube interim TSP plugging criteria does not introduce any significant
changes to the plant design basis. Use of the criteria does not provide a mechanism which could result in an accident
outside of the region of the TSP elevations; no ODSCC that has been identified at the TSP has been detected outside the
thickness of the TSPs. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a steam generator in which
the plugging criteria has been applied (during all plant conditions).


Specifically, Duquesne Light Company will implement a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gpd per steam generator to
help preclude the potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The technical specification limits
on primary-to-secondary leakage at operating conditions are to be a maximum of 450 gpd for all steam generators, or,
a maximum of 150 gpd for any one steam generator. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing operational leakage rate
limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leak-before-break considerations to detect a free span crack before
potential tube rupture during faulted plant conditions. The 150 gpd limit should provide for leakage detection and
plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated
with the longest permissible crack length. RG 1.121 acceptance criteria for establishing operating leakage limits
are based on leak-before-break considerations such that plant shutdown is initiated if the leakage associated with
the longest permissible crack is exceeded.


The single through wall crack lengths that result in tube burst at 1.43 times the steam line break pressure differential
and SLB pressure differential alone are approximately 0.57 inch and 0.84 inch, respectively. A leak rate of 150 gpd
will provide for detection of 0.41 inch long cracks at nominal leak rates and 0.62 inch long cracks at the lower 95 percent
confidence level leak rates. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation due to the proximity of the TSP
to the tube and the potential exists for the crevice to become uncovered during SLB conditions, the leakage from the
maximum permissible crack must preclude tube burst at SLB conditions. Thus, the 150 gpd limit provides for plant shutdown
prior to reaching critical crack lengths for SLB conditions using the lower 95 percent leakage data. Additionally,
this leak-before-break evaluation assumes that the entire crevice area is uncovered during blowdown. Partial uncovery
will provide benefit to the burst capacity of the intersection. Analyses have shown that only a small percentage of
the TSPs are deflected greater than the TSP thickness during a postulated SLB.
 

Steam generator tube integrity continues to be maintained through inservice inspection and primary-to-secondary
leakage monitoring, therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
developed is not created.


3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?


The use of the voltage based bobbin probe interim TSP elevation plugging criteria is demonstrated to maintain steam
generator tube integrity commensurate with the requirements of RG 1.121. RG 1.121 describes a method acceptable
to the NRC staff for meeting GDCs 14, 15, 31, and 32 by reducing the probability or the consequences of steam generator
tube rupture. This is accomplished by determining the limiting conditions of degradation of steam generator tubing,
as established by inservice inspection, for which tubes with unacceptable cracking should be removed from service.
Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the worst case conditions, the occurrence of ODSCC at the TSP elevations
is not expected to lead to a steam generator tube rupture event during normal or faulted plant conditions. The EOC distribution
of crack indications at the TSP elevations will be confirmed to result in acceptable primary-to-secondary leakage
during all plant conditions and that radiological consequences are not adversely impacted.


In addressing the combined effects of loss of coolant accident (LOCA) and safe shutdown earthquake (SSE) on the steam
generator component (as required by GDC 2), it has been determined that tube collapse may occur in the steam generators
at some plants. This is the case as the TSP may become deformed as a result oflateral loads at the wedge supports at the
periphery of the plate due to the combined effects of the LOCA rarefaction wave and SSE loadings. Then, the resulting
pressure differential on the deformed tubes may cause some of the tubes to collapse.
 

There are two issues associated with steam generator tube collapse. First, the collapse of steam generator tubing
reduces the RCS flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow area increases the resistance to flow of steam from
the core during a LOCA which, in turn, may potentially increase peak clad temperature (PCT). Second, there is a potential
that partial through wall cracks in tubes could progress to through wall cracks during tube deformation or collapse.


Consequently, since the leak-before-break methodology is applicable to the BVPS reactor coolant loop piping, the
probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered in the structural
design of the plant. The limiting LOCA event becomes either the accumulator line break or the pressurizer surge line
break. LOCA loads for the primary pipe breaks were used to bound the conditions at BVPS for smaller breaks. The results
of the analysis using the larger break inputs show that the LOCA loads were found to be of insufficient magnitude to
result in steam generator tube collapse or significant deformation. The LOCA and SSE tube collapse evaluation performed
for another plant with Series 51 steam generators using bounding input conditions (large break loadings) is considered
applicable to BVPS.


Addressing RG 1.83 considerations, implementation of the bobbin probe voltage based interim tube plugging criteria
is supplemented by: enhanced eddy current inspection guidelines to provide consistency in voltage normalization,
a 100 percent eddy current inspection sample size at the TSP elevations, and RPC inspection requirements for the larger
indications left inservice to characterize the principal degradation as ODSCC.


As noted previously, implementation of the TSP elevation plugging criteria will decrease the number of tubes which
must be repaired. The installation of steam generator tube plugs reduces the RCS flow margin. Thus, the implementation
of the alternate plugging criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of
increased tube plugging.


Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed license amendment request does not result in a significant reduction
in margin with respect to plant safety as defined in the Final Safety Analysis Report or any Bases of the Technical Specifications.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Entergy Operations, Inc., Docket Nos. 50-313, Arkansas Nuclear One, 
Unit 1, Pope County, Arkansas





Date of amendment request: 

June 22, 1994 



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises technical specifications (TSs) related to the emergency feedwater system (EFW).
The proposed changes extend the allowable outage time when one EFW train is inoperable from 36 hours to 72 hours and
adapt other EFW sections from the ``Restructured Standard Technical Specifications for B&W Plants'' to the
Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO-1) format. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




Criterion 1 - Does Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences of an Accident Previously
Evaluated.


The Emergency Feedwater (EFW) system mitigates the consequences of any event with a loss of normal feedwater. This
system is not the initiator of any previously analyzed accident, and therefore, changes to the specifications applicable
to the EFW system present no significant increase in the probability of any previously evaluated accident.


The changes that revise the required Actions and Allowable Outage Times associated with the EFW system have been evaluated
for their effect on the Core Damage Frequency (CDF) previously calculated in the ANO-1 Probabilistic Risk Assessment
(PRA). The new ANO-1 CDF values, incorporating the proposed AOT extension, are 4.73E-05 (for the turbine-driven
EFW pump) and 4.70E-05 (for the motor-driven pump). These values do not exceed the NRC Safety Goal of 1.0E-04 per reactor
year, as stated in the 

Federal Register 

50FR32138. The delta CDF associated with these changes (6.16E-07 for the turbine-driven EFW pump and 3.04E-07 for
the motor-driven EFW pump) have been evaluated with respect to criteria contained in SECY-91-270, dated August 27,
1991, and NUMARC 91-04, dated January 1992, and fall within the category of events of low risk significance requiring
no compensatory measures. This evaluation has shown the risk associated with the proposed changes to pose no undue
risk to public health and safety, to be categorized as having low risk significance, and involve no significant increase
in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


The changes revising the Limiting Conditions for Operation result in more restrictive controls on the operability
of the motor-driven EFW pump. The previous specification required operability of both EFW pumps when the reactor
was heated above 280
 F. The proposed change requires the operability of the motor-driven EFW pump whenever the unit is above the cold
shutdown condition and any steam generator is relied upon for heat removal. With this change, the motor-driven EFW
pump is now required to be operable in a condition not previously specified, constituting an additional requirement
not previously specified. This change does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.


The changes revising the Limiting Conditions for Operation also incorporate an Allowable Outage Time for the turbine-driven
EFW pump steam supply valves which was not previously specified. The 7 day AOT is reasonable based on:


1. The redundant steam supply (from the opposite steam generator) to the turbine-driven EFW pump is operable,

2. The motor-driven EFW pump is operable, and

3. The probability of an event occurring that would require the inoperable steam supply valve to actuate is relatively
low.


The changes to the surveillance specifications clarify the proper conditions required for the operability test
of the turbine-driven EFW pump, and revise the requirement for the verification of proper EFW flow path valve alignment.
The change clarifying the test conditions is required to ensure a sufficient steam supply to the turbine-driven EFW
pump to perform the test. During plant startup, from an RCS temperature of 280
 F to an RCS temperature of approximately 525
 F (corresponding to a steam generator pressure of approximately 830 psig) the turbine-driven EFW pump is classified
as available until operability is proven by successful completion of the surveillance 
requirement. The proposed changes state that the EFW pumps and their associated flow paths shall be operable when
the RCS is above the cold shutdown condition with any steam generator relied upon for heat removal (motor-driven EFW
pump) and when RCS temperature is greater than or equal to 280
 F (turbine-driven EFW pump). This specification requires that the flow paths be properly aligned to maintain
operability and is as restrictive as the current TS 4.8.1.c. The revised specification incorporates a new requirement
to verify operator flexibility in determining the method of verification. Some methods that could be considered
as fulfilling this requirement would include valve alignment checks, or a flow test verifying a level decrease in
the `Q' condensate storage tank with a corresponding level increase in both steam generators. These changes result
in no significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


The other proposed changes included in this submittal, including the Bases changes, are considered to be administrative
in nature and have no effect on the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Relocation of the Emergency
Feedwater Initiation and Control (EFIC) requirements from Section 3.4 to Section 3.5 places the requirements for
this instrumentation system with the requirements for other instrumentation systems, resulting in greater consistency
throughout the ANO-1 TS. Information in the Bases associated with the EFIC system has been corrected to reflect the
actual plant condition and resolve a conflict with the ANO-1 Safety Analysis Report. The Bases changes add clarifying
information to aid the operator in determining the applicability of the various EFW specifications.


Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.


Criterion 2 - Does Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident from any Previously Evaluated.


The proposed changes introduce no new mode of plant operation. The EFW system is not an event initiator. It functions
to mitigate the consequences of any event with a loss of normal feedwater.


Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.


Criterion 3 - Does Not Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety.


The changes proposed to the Limiting Conditions for Operation associated with the EFW system are more conservative
than the current specification, thus resulting in an increase in the margin of safety. The proposed changes to the
actions required when both of the EFW trains are inoperable and the auxiliary feedwater pump is unavailable no longer
require an immediate plant runback, that is currently required, which could introduce a plant transient, thus resulting
in an increase in the margin of safety.


The changes revising the Limiting Conditions for Operations also incorporate and Allowable Outage Time for the turbine-driven
EFW pump steam supply valves which was not previously specified. The 7 day AOT is reasonable based on:


1. The redundant steam supply (from the opposite steam generator) to the turbine-driven EFW pump is operable,

2. The motor-driven EFW pump is operable, and

3. The probability of an event occurring that would require the inoperable steam supply valve to actuate is relatively
low.


The changes to the surveillance specifications clarify the proper conditions required for the operability test
of the turbine-driven EFW pump, and revise the requirement for the verification of proper EFW flow path valve alignment.
The change clarifying the test conditions is required to ensure a sufficient steam supply to the turbine-driven EFW
pump to perform the test. During plant startup, from an RCS temperature of 280
 F to an RCS temperature of approximately 525
 F (corresponding to a steam generator pressure of approximately 830 psig) the turbine-driven EFW pump is classified
as available until operability is proven by successful completion of the surveillance requirement. The proposed
changes state that the EFW pumps and their associated flow paths shall be operable when the RCS is above the cold shutdown
condition with any steam generator relied upon for heat removal (motor-driven EFW pump) and when RCS temperature
is greater than or equal to 280
 F (turbine-driven EFW pump). This specification requires that the flow paths be properly aligned to maintain
operability and is as restrictive as the current TS 4.8.1.c. The revised specification incorporates a new requirement
to verify proper alignment prior to relying upon any steam generator for heat removal. This allows the operator flexibility
in determining the method of verification. Some methods that could be considered as fulfilling this requirement
would include manual valve alignment checks, or a flow test verifying a level decrease in the `Q' condensate storage
tank with a corresponding level increase in both steam generators.


This change does involve an incremental reduction in the margin of safety since the extension of the EFW Allowable
Outage Time from 36 hours to 72 hours does result in a slight increase in the Core Damage Frequency (CDF) as calculated
in the ANO-1 Probabilistic Risk Assessment. The new ANO-1 CDF values, incorporating the proposed AOT extension,
are 4.73E-05 (for the turbine-driven EFW pump) and 4.70E-05 (for the motor-driven EFW pump). These values do not exceed
the NRC Safety Goal of 1.0E-04 per reactor year, as stated in the 

Federal Register 

50FR32138. The CDF associated with these changes (6.16E-07 for the turbine-driven EFW pump and 3.04E-07 for the motor-driven
EFW pump) have been evaluated with respect to criteria contained in SECY-91-270, dated August 27, 1991, and NUMARC
91-04, dated 
January 1992, and fall within the category of events of low risk significance requiring no compensatory measures.
This reduction is not considered significant in that the increase in CDF has been evaluated as posing no undue risk
to the public health and safety and is categorized as having low risk significance.


The other proposed changes included in this submittal, including the Bases changes, are considered to be administrative
in nature. Relocation of the Emergency Feedwater Initiation and Control (EFIC) requirements from Section 3.4 to
Section 3.5 places the requirements for this instrumentation system with the requirements for other instrumentation
systems, resulting in greater consistency throughout the ANO-1 TS. Information in the Bases associated with the
EFIC system has been corrected to reflect the actual plant condition and resolve a conflict with the ANO-1 Safety Analysis
Report. The Bases changes add clarifying information to aid the operator in determining the applicability of the
various EFW specifications.


Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in the 
margin of safety.

10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 20, 1994 



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments revise the administrative and control sections of the technical specifications (TSs) for
Arkansas Nuclear One, Units 1 and 2. The proposed changes relocate controls associated with the ``Review and Audit''
functions from the TSs to the Quality Assurance Program and relocate requirements for the audit of emergency and security
plans and implementing procedures from the TSs to the respective emergency and security plans.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




Criterion 1 - Does Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences of an Accident Previously
Evaluated.


The proposed changes do not affect reactor operations or accident analyses, have no radiological consequences,
and are considered to be purely administrative in nature. All requirements relocated from the TSs have been evaluated
with respect to the four criteria of the NRC "Final Policy Statement On Technical Specifications Improvements''
as presented in SECY-93-067, and found to meet none of the criteria for inclusion in the TS.


Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.


Criterion 2 - Does Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident from any Previously Evaluated.


The proposed changes introduce no new mode of plant operation and do not affect the operability of safety-related
equipment. All requirements relocated or deleted from the TSs have been evaluated with respect to the four criteria
of the NRC ``Final Policy Statement On Technical Specifications Improvements'' as presented in SECY-93-067, and
found to meet none of the criteria for inclusion in the TS.


Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.


Criterion 3 - Does Not Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety.


Existing TS operability and surveillance requirements are not reduced by the proposed change, thus no margins of
safety are reduced. All requirements relocated or deleted from the TSs have been evaluated with respect to the four
criteria of the NRC ``Final Policy Statement On Technical Specifications Improvements'' as presented in SECY-93-067,
and found to meet none of the criteria for inclusion in the TS.


Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Station, Unit 3, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana





Date of amendment request: 

February 9, 1993 as supplemented by letter dated July 22, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Section 3.0 and 4.0 of the Technical Specifications (TSs) consistent with the
provision and intent of Generic Letter (GL) 87-09 dated June 4, 1987.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




TS 3.0.4 prevents entry into an operational mode or other specified condition unless Limiting Conditions for Operations
(LCOs) are met without reliance on Action Requirements. The intent of this TS is to ensure that a higher mode of operation
is not entered when equipment is inoperable or when parameters exceed their specified limits.


The proposed change clarifies TS 3.0.4 such that LCOs with Action Statements that permit continued operation for
an unlimited period of time are exempt from the restrictions of TS 3.0.4. This provision is modified to require an additional
plant safety review prior to implementing additional exceptions to 3.0.4 other than those currently stated in the
individual specifications. This proposed change is consistent with existing NRC regulatory requirements for LCOs.


The proposed change to TS 4.0.3 incorporates a 24-hour delay in implementing the Action Statements due to a missed
surveillance requirement when the Action Statements provide a restoration time that is less than 24 hours. As reflected
in GL 87-09, this change is justified in that it is overly conservative to assume that systems or components are immediately
inoperable when a surveillance requirement has not been performed. The NRC concludes in Generic Letter 87-09 that
a 24-hour time limit balances the risks associated with an allowance for completing the surveillance within this
period against the risks associated with the potential for a plant upset and challenge to safety systems when the alternative
is a shutdown to comply with Action Statements before the surveillance can be completed. The NRC further states that
the potential for a plant upset and challenge to safety systems is increased if surveillances are performed during
actions to initiate a shutdown to comply with Action Requirements.


TS 4.0.4 has been modified to note that its provisions shall not prevent passage through or to operational modes as
required to comply with Action Requirements. This change is consistent with the intent of the existing TS and represents
a clarification.


No previously analyzed accident scenario is changed by the proposed TS changes described above. Initiating conditions
and assumptions remain as previously analyzed.
 

Therefore, the proposed changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated.


The proposed change to TS 3.0.4 is administrative in nature. Entry into an operational mode or other specified condition
will be allowed for those specifications not currently stating an exception to 3.0.4 when 1) the applicable LCOs Action
Requirement permits continued operation for an unlimited period of time and 2) the PORC [plant operations review
committee] has reviewed and approved the exception.


The proposed change to TS 4.0.3 will allow continued operation for an additional 24-hours after discovery of a missed
surveillance. As reflected in GL 87-09, missing a surveillance does not mean that a component or system is inoperable.
In most cases, surveillances provide positive verification of operability.


The proposed change to TS 4.0.4 will alleviate conflict within the TS. The change is necessary to allow the plant to
proceed through or to required operational modes to comply with Action Statements even if applicable Surveillance
Requirements may not have been performed.


These changes do not affect the operation of the plant or the manner in which it is operated.


Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.


The proposed change to TS 3.0.4 is administrative in nature and will have no impact on any margin of safety.


The proposed change to TS 4.0.3 will allow up to 24-hours to perform a missed surveillance. In some cases this will eliminate
the need for a plant shutdown. As reflected in GL 87-09, the overall effect is an increase in plant safety by avoiding
unnecessary shutdowns and associated system transients due to missed surveillances.


The proposed change to TS 4.0.4 will eliminate an internal conflict within the TS and allow the plant to proceed through
or to required operational modes to comply with Action Statements even if applicable Surveillance Requirements
for that mode may not have been performed.

The NRC staff has previously evaluated these change in Generic Letter 87-09 and determined that the TS modifications
will result in improved TS.


Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

Description of amendment request: 

The amendment will revise Technical Specifications (TS) 3/4.4.13 to incorporate Low Temperature Overpressure
Protection (LTOP) requirements similar to those recommended by the NRC staff via Generic Letter 90-06. The proposed
changes are in accordance with the resolution of Generic Issue 94 for St. Lucie Units 1 and 2.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, a determination may be made that a proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows:


(1)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a signifiant increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


The changes proposed for St. Lucie Unit 1 Technical Specifications (TS) 3/4.4.13 are similar to those recommended
by the NRC staff via Generic Letter 90-06 for Low Temperature Overpressure Protection (LTOP) systems. On the basis
of technical studies performed for Generic Issue 94, the staff concluded that LTOP system unavailability is a contributor
to the risk associated with overpressure transients during the shutdown modes of plant operation. Revisions to the
actions required and the time for completion of such actions, in the event that one or more Power Operated Relief Valves
(PORV) become inoperable, provide more rigor than the existing specifications and are designed to increase LTOP
system availability. The administrative restrictions do not change the results of existing analyses performed
to evaluate postulated accidents but will improve the availability of systems designed to mitigate pressure transients
that could occur within the LTOP range. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment
will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


(2)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.


The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license.
The changes do not involve the addition of new equipment or the modification of existing equipment, nor do they alter
the design of St. Lucie plant systems. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment
would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
 

(3)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.


The proposed amendment provides additional administrative restrictions for the operation of LTOP equipment. The
applicability of Limiting Conditions of Operation (LCO) involving the PORVs will be extended to include Operational
MODE 6 when the head is on the reactor vessel, and the rigor of required actions and action compleiton times in the event
that one or more PORVs become inoperable will be increased. Consequently, the risk of low temperature operations
will be reduced and safety during the shutdown modes of operation will be enhanced. Therefore, operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

Based on the discussion presented above and on the supporting Evaluation of Proposed TS Changes, FPL has concluded
that this proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

County, Connecticut





Date of amendment request: 

July 1, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment to the Technical Specification (TS) would:
1. Modify the facility by providing an auctioneered power supply for the engineered safety feature actuation system
(ESFAS) sensor cabinets;
2 Reinstate the 2-out-of-4 sump recirculation system (SRAS) logic;
3. Change Table 3.3 of the (Safety Feature Actuation System Instrumentation) by adding Manual main steam isolation
(MSI) (Trip Buttons); by removing note (f) which describes the SRAS logic as a modified 2-out-of-4 logic; and by replacing
Action Statement 4 with an Action Statement that allows operation with a second inoperable channel, provided both
channels are placed in the bypassed condition. 
4. Add to the TS new limiting conditions for operation and new surveillance requirements together with BASES (TS 3.3.2.2
and 4.3.2.2.1 and 4.3.2.2.2) for the ESFAS sensor cabinet power supply drawers. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




...The proposed changes do not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would not:



1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. 


SRAS Logic Modification
 

Implementation of the auctioneered power supply for the sensor cabinets will permit the reinstatement of the original
2-out-of-4 (six possible combinations) logic for SRAS initiation. The current logic only has four possible combinations.
Changing the minimum number of SRAS channels required to be operable from four to three does not significantly reduce
the available actuation combinations. Operation with one channel inoperable will still provide a 2-out-of-3 logic
(three possible trip combinations). With the current SRAS logic, operation with one channel in bypass does not meet
the single failure criterion for proper SRAS operation. Amendment No. 168 prevents that condition. 

Allowing continued operation with three operable channels is consistent with the original Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical
Specifications (prior to Amendment No. 168).


Note (f), which describes the current logic, will no longer apply after the auctioneering circuit is installed. This
note is for information only and has no associated action or surveillance requirements. Therefore, removal of note
(f) cannot affect either the probability or consequences of a postulated accident. 

In addition to the change in the minimum number of channels required to be operable, Action statement 4 will be revised
to allow a limited period of two hours when a second channel may be placed in bypass for performance of surveillance
testing. This is acceptable due to the installation of the auctioneering circuit and restoration of the full SRAS
logic. Prior to the implementation of the short term modifications and Amendment No. 168, Action Statement 2 also
applied to the SRAS. That Action Statement allows two hours of operation with two channels out of service. However,
Action Statement 2 requires one of the two channels to be placed in the tripped position.


Postulating a LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] and an additional failure, while in an action statement that specifies
a maximum allowed outage time, is beyond the design basis of Millstone Unit No. 2. However, with one SRAS channel in
bypass and one in the tripped position, an additional failure (such as the loss of a DC vital bus) following the onset
of a LOCA could result in a false SRAS signal.


From an overall safety perspective, the potential consequences from a false SRAS at the onset of a LOCA are more severe
than those from the failure to automatically generate an actuation signal. Proposed Action Statement 4 would require
actuation of the remaining channel (following a LOCA and a loss of DC bus as a second failure) to initiate the SRAS. The
existing operation procedures instruct the operator to ensure that the SRAS actuation occurs when the refueling
water storage tank level decreases to a predetermined value. In the unlikely event that a LOCA occurred while a Action
Statement 4 and no SRAS was generated at the appropriate time due to an additional failure which prevents one channel
from tripping, the SRAS would be manually initiated by the operator. 


The amount of time that Millstone Unit No. 2 would operate under Action Statement 4 (with two SRAS channels in bypass)
is approximately 6 hours per month. This is based on the requirement to conduct monthly channel functional tests for
the three operable channels. The probability of a LOCA occurring during these surveillance, while in Action Statement
4, with a subsequent failure of the remaining 2-out-of-2 SRAS logic, is very low.


Sensor Cabinet Auctioneering
 

The proposed new Technical Specification 3.3.2.2, which establishes the requirements for the ESFAS sensor cabinets
power supply drawers, permits 48 hours to restore an inoperable sensor cabinet power supply drawer to operable status.
A power supply drawer renders it inoperable, or if either its normal or backup power is not available.


Existing Technical Specification 3.8.2.1 contains an 8-hour action statement for restoring the power sources (VA-10,
20, 30, and 40) if they become inoperable. The proposed 48-hour action statement for the power supply drawers is appropriate
since the sensor cabinet would remain functional if either normal or alternate power was not available. However,
a LOCA and an additional failure while in the action statement could result in a false SRAS, since two channels would
supplied from a single DC power supply. 


Prior to Amendment No. 168, operation with an inoperable power supply drawer could continue indefinitely, provided
the provisions of Technical Specification 3/4.3.2 were followed. Operation with a power supply inoperable for an
indefinite period of time places all the signals associated with that sensor cabinet in the tripped condition. This
creates a 1-out-of-4 tripped condition for SRAS. In this condition, the single failure required to be postulated
could result in a false SRAS actuation.


This 48-hour action statement is consistent with other action statements for ESFAS such as Action Statement 1 of Table
3.3-3. Also, this is consistent with the current wording of Action Statement 4 which allows 48 hours to restore an inoperable
channel to operable while operating with the modified 2-out-of-4 logic. 


MSI Trip Button Addition


The manual trip buttons provide a mechanism for the control room operator to initiate an MSI trip. The proposed Technical
Specification change will require that a plant shutdown be initiated if either channel is out of service for more than
48 hours, and establishes a requirement for surveillance testing every refueling outage. Including the trip buttons
in the Technical Specifications and establishing operation and surveillance requirements ensures their operability
commensurate with their safety significance. 


Based on the above, the changes to Technical Specification 3/4.3 do not increase the probability or consequence of
an accident previously evaluated.


2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.


SRAS Logic Modification


Changing the number of channels required to be operable from four to three is acceptable since the original 2-out-of-4
logic will be restored. This change only affects the number and combinations of actuation channels necessary to initiate
a SRAS. There is no change to the source or types of initiators, nor is there a change to the automatic response resulting
from a SRAS.


Note (f), which described the modified logic, will no longer apply after the auctioneering circuit is installed.
This note is for information only and has no associated action or surveillance requirements. Therefore, removal
of note (f) cannot create a new or different kind of accident.


New Action Statement 4 restores the ability to operate for an indefinite period of time with one channel in bypass and
for a limited period of time while two channels are out of service. The change from the original action statement to
require that both channels be in bypass will prevent a false SRAS in the unlikely (and beyond design basis) event of
a LOCA with an additional failure of a DC bus while in an LCO [limiting condition for operation].


Sensor Cabinet Auctioneering


The addition of a Technical Specification for the sensor cabinet power supply drawers does not create a potential
for a new or different kind of accident. This new specification implements more restrictive operating requirements
for the sensor cabinets. These are necessary to ensure that the sensor cabinets are energized from their primary power
supply. The new specification does not affect the initiation of a SRAS signal nor the type of signal produced. 


The auctioneering modification does bring two vital AC facilities together via isolation devices. This introduces
a potential for a new type of failure mechanism. As described in Attachment 1, adequate isolation ensures that a failure
on one side of an isolation transformer does not adversely degrade the other side.


MSI Trip Button Addition


The manual trip buttons provide a mechanism for the control room operation to initiate an MSI trip. The Technical Specification
change will require that a plant shutdown be initiated if either manual trip channel is out of service for more than
48 hours, and establishes a requirement for surveillance testing every refueling outage. The trip buttons were installed
during the 1992 outage. Establishing operability requirements and surveillance frequency cannot create a new or
different kind of accident.


Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed. 


3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.


The net effect of the proposed modifications is to improve the reliability of the ESFAS and restore the design 2-out-of-4
logic for the SRAS. The proposed modifications improve the availability of the ESFAS, and do not affect the vital AC
instrument panels.


The Technical Specification changes establish controls for the used of the SRAS with the restored logic configuration.
The combination of the auctioneering of the power supplies, the restoration of the 2-out-of-4 logic, and the revised
Technical Specifications restores the margin of safety and operational flexibility originally designed for the
sensor cabinets. 


Based on the above, there is no reduction in the margin of safety.

PECO Energy Company, Docket No. 50-353, Limerick Generating Station, Unit 2, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania





Date of amendment request: 

June 30, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

This amendment would remove certain remote shutdown system control valves and primary containment isolation valves
from Technical Specifications Tables 3.3.7.4-1 and 3.6.3-1 respectively, as a result of eliminating the steam condensing
mode of the Residual Heat Removal system.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


These proposed changes will result in abandoning in place certain remote shutdown system control valves and removing
from service and abandoning in place certain Primary Containment Isolation Valves (PCIVs) associated with the Residual
Heat Removal (RHR) system steam condensing mode, and will remove the interface between the High Pressure Coolant
Injection (HPCI) and RHR systems, therefore changing the primary containment pressure boundary.


The RHR system steam condensing mode is a non-safety related function of the RHR system; however, the pressure and
structural integrity of the associated piping and valves are safety-related. These proposed changes will not affect
any components required to perform the safety-related function of the RHR or HPCI systems.


The ability of the RHR or HPCI systems to respond to an accident will not be degraded. Only valves specifically dedicated
for use for the RHR system steam condensing mode will be abandoned in-place, or removed from the plant. The valves'
handswitches which are part of the remote shutdown panel (RSP) controls, will be physically removed from the RSP,
since they will not perform any function (i.e., the associated valves will have the electrical power removed). The
flanges and penetration caps that will become part of the primary containment boundary will be periodically tested
for leakage as required by TS and 10CFR50, Appendix J. All piping and components that will remain operable will meet
the original design requirements. The other modes of operation of the RHR system (e.g., Low Pressure Coolant Injection
(LPCI), Shutdown [C]ooling (SDC)) will not be affected by these changes. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not
involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
 

2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.


No new failure modes of RHR or HPCI systems are created by the proposed TS changes. The proposed changes will have no
impact on the existing High Energy Line Break (HELB) analysis for Limerick Generating Station (LGS). All valves or
piping removed and/or abandoned in place, are dedicated specifically for the RHR system steam condensing mode, and
will not affect the operation of any components or piping required for other modes of operation of the RHR or HPCI systems.
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.


3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


The steam condensing mode is a non-safety related function of the RHR system and, therefore, is not addressed in the
TS. This mode will be physically separated from the other modes of operation of RHR and HPCI systems, and consequently,
will not preclude them from performing their safety-related functions. The remote shutdown system control valves
to be abandoned in place are not being used presently, and the proposed changes will not impact the safety operation
of LGS Unit 2. The primary containment penetration caps, safety-related pipe caps and the flanges replacing the removed
PCIVs will be designed, fabricated and installed in accordance with the original design requirements, i.e., American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel (B&PV) Code, Section III, 1971 Edition with
Addenda through Winter 1971. The added penetration caps and flanges will be capable of maintaining the primary containment
pressure boundary and isolation capabilities that were required of the PCIVs and will be tested for leakage periodically,
as required by TS and 10 CFR 50, Appendix J. Additionally, all piping and components that will remain operable will
meet original design requirements. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

and 2, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania





Date of amendment requests: 

July 19, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

This amendment will change the Technical Specification 3.1.5 for each unit for the standby liquid control system
(SLCS) to remove the operability requirement for the SLCS while in Operational Condition 5 (refueling) with any control
rod withdrawn, and to delete the 18-month system surveillance requirement (Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.d.3).




Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.


The proposed Technical Specification change to delete the operability requirement for the SLC System in OPCON 5*
(OPERATIONAL CONDITION 5 with any control rod withdrawn) does not affect the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Design basis accident mitigation scenarios for SSES in OPCON 5 do not depend on, or require,
SLC operability; therefore, the proposed change to delete SLC operability in OPCON 5* does not affect the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


The proposed Technical Specification change to delete Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.d.3, 18 month SLC heater
operability check, does not affect the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Regarding
the SLC heater function, the operability of the SLC system depends on maintaining the temperature of the sodium pentaborate
solution above 70
 F to prevent the boric acid from precipitating out of solution. SLC heater 'A' is used to maintain tank temperature
between 85
  F and 95
 F, thus ensuring that the boric acid remains in solution. The operability of the heater 'A' is verified through
the daily performance of Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.a.1, which checks SLC solution
temperature, and a control room alarm. Heater 'B' functions to raise SLC solution temperature prior to the mixing
of SLC chemicals - the mixing of sodium pentaborate and water is an endothermic (heat consuming) reaction. The operability
of heater 'B' is verified at the time when chemicals are added to the SLC tank, since a precondition for adding the chemicals
is using heater 'B' to increase tank temperature to 100
 F. Heater 'B' does not function to maintain tank temperature during normal operation. Therefore, the proposed
change does not impact Susquehanna's ability to maintain SLC solution temperature and thus does not increase the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


2. This proposal does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or [sic] from any accident previously
evaluated.


The proposed Technical Specification change to delete the operability requirement for the SLC System in OPCON 5*
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or [sic] from any accident previously evaluated.
The purpose of the SLC System is to provide backup capability for bringing the reactor from full power to a cold, Xenon-free
shutdown, assuming that none of the withdrawn control rods can be inserted. This bases is consistent with the required
operability of the SLC System in OPCONs 1 & 2. The proposed change does not affect the ability of SLC to meet its design
basis. No credit is taken for SLC in OPCON 5 to mitigate the effects of reactivity transients, and the SLC system is not
designed to terminate an inadvertent criticality event during core alterations (OPCON 5) with vessel water level
at least 22 feet above top of vessel flange. Therefore, no new or different accident scenarios are created by the proposed
change.


The proposed Technical Specification change to delete Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.d.3, 18 month SLC heater
operability check, does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or [sic] from any accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change does not affect systems, structures, or components (SSCs) or the operation
of these [SSCs]. The heating and heater control subsystems of the SLC system will continue to function as they were
designed. The proposed change does not alter the heating limits or the method for maintaining SLC solution temperature.
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or [sic] from
any accident previously evaluated.

3. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


The proposed Technical Specification change to delete the operability requirement for the SLC System in OPCON 5*
does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The potential for a decrease in the margin of safety,
under this proposed change, would be associated with periods during OPCON 5* when the SLC system was not operable.
Allowing the SLC system to be inoperable during OPCON 5* with the vessel level at least 22 feet above top of vessel flange,
represents no reduction in the margin of safety since the SLC System is not designed to terminate an inadvertent criticality
event with a greater volume of water in the reactor. Having the SLC system inoperable in OPCON 5* with reactor water
levels at normal operating volumes, does not significantly reduce the margin of safety because of the number of other
design and operating features which act to prevent inadvertent criticality events. Adequate shutdown margin is
maintained through design and administrative controls; including, Shutdown Margin Demonstration, Technical
Specification 3.1.1, defueling and refueling procedures, and refueling interlocks. In addition, the Reactor Protection
System monitors for recriticality and actuates the Control Rod Scram function if a significant reactivity addition
is sensed.


The proposed Technical Specification change to delete Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.d.3, 18 month SLC heater
operability check, does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Adequate controls are in place,
independent of the 18 month heater operability check, to ensure that the temperature of the sodium pentaborate solution
is maintained above 70
  F. These controls include Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.a.1, which checks SLC solution temperature daily,
a control room alarm on low and high temperature, and the ambient temperature conditions in the SLC area which prevent
rapid changes in SLC solution temperature. Operability of the 'B' heater is not needed to maintain SLC solution temperature,
and the operability of this heater is verified at the time when chemicals are added to the SLC tank.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 13, 1994 



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify the Facility Operating License by removing License Condition 2.E. This condition
applies to the construction cleanup, restoration, and maintenance of transmission lines. It incorporated into
the Facility Operating License the requirements of U.S. Department of Interior publication ``Environmental Criteria
for Electric Transmission Systems'' - 1970. The proposed amendment was requested to eliminate duplication of regulatory
authority by government agencies of the same activity.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:


1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.


The proposed change will remove a license condition unrelated to nuclear safety. License condition 2.E incorporated
into the Operating License the requirements of U.S. Department of Interior publication ``Environmental Criteria
for Electric Transmission Systems'' - 1970. The goal of this standard is to ``safeguard aesthetic and environmental
values within the constraints imposed by the current state of high-voltage transmission technology.'' License
condition 2.E addresses the preservation of the environment and natural resources. Removing this condition from
the Facility Operating License has no bearing on plant safety or the health and safety of the public considering its
non-nuclear safety nature. The transmission line right-of-ways maintained by the Authority are subject to regulation
by other State and Federal agencies. Removal of this license condition will not affect operation of safety related
structures, systems or components nor affect the quality assurance program at the FitzPatrick plant. Therefore,
the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.


2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.


License condition 2.E of the James A. FitzPatrick Plant Operating License applies to the construction cleanup, restoration,
and maintenance of transmission lines. The Authority's transmission lines are managed under guidelines based on
the ``Generic Transmission Line Right-of-Way Management'' plan requirements. The requirements imposed by the
plan on the FitzPatrick transmission line right-of-ways exceed those of the U.S. Department of Interior publication
referenced in license condition 2.E in both scope and details. Therefore, implementing the proposed change will
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.


3. involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


License condition 2.E of the James A. FitzPatrick Operating License applies to the construction cleanup, restoration,
and maintenance of transmission lines. The requirements imposed by this license condition are unrelated to nuclear
safety. 


Continued operation of the plant without Condition 2.E does not involve a significant reduction in any margin of safety.

Date of amendment request: 

July 21, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes would modify paragraph 2.C.(3) of the Facility Operating License and relocate fire protection
requirements from the Technical Specifications to an administrative procedure. These changes are based on the guidance
contained in NRC Generic Letter 86-10, ``Implementation of Fire Protection Requirements,'' and Generic Letter
88-12, ``Removal of Fire Protection Requirements from Technical Specifications.'' 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment will not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, because:


(1) This change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because no modifications, no changes to operating procedure requirements, no reduction in administrative
controls and no reduction in equipment reliability are being made as a result of these changes. This proposed amendment
relocates the fire protection LCOs [Limiting Conditions for Operation] and Surveillance Requirements from the
Technical Specifications to an Administrative Procedure. No significant changes in content are being made to the
Technical Specification requirements that are being relocated. Operating limitations will continue to be in effect,
and required surveillances will continue to be performed in accordance with written procedures and instructions
auditable by the NRC.


Although future proposed changes to the fire protection program elements previously located in the Technical Specifications
will no longer be controlled by 10 CFR 50.36, proposed changes to the Fire Protection requirements will be controlled
by the License Condition and plant procedures. Programmatic controls will continue to assure that fire protection
program changes do not reduce the effectiveness of the program to achieve and maintain safe shutdown in the event of
a fire.


(2) The possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than evaluated previously in the safety analysis
report is not created because no reduction to the fire protection requirements, no modifications, no changes to operating
procedure requirements, no reduction in administrative controls and no reduction in equipment reliability are
being made as a result of these changes. Programmatic controls will continue to assure that fire protection program
changes do not reduce the effectiveness of the program to achieve and maintain safe shutdown in the event of a fire.


(3) This proposed amendment does not involve a reduction to the approved fire protection program or Fire Protection
Technical Specification requirements because the Technical Specification fire protection requirements are being
relocated, with no significant change in content, to an administrative procedure. Since there is no reduction in
the requirements, no modifications, no changes to operating procedure requirements, no reduction in administrative
controls and no reduction in equipment reliability are being made as a result of these changes, there is no reduction
in the margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3, Westchester County, New York 





Date of amendment request: 

July 25, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The licensee has requested an amendment to the Technical Specifications (TS) to revise Table 3.6-1 (Non-Automatic
Containment Isolation Valves Open Continuously or Intermittently for Plant Operation) and Table 4.4-1 (Containment
Isolation Valves) to delete valves SI-1833A(B) and add valves SI-MOV-1835A(B). The valves being deleted no longer
perform a containment isolation function as a result of a modification which removed the boron injection tank. The
valves being added are needed for testing the safety injection pumps.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information:


(1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated?


Response:


The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated. The change permits the removal of the two containment isolation valves on the Boron
Injection Tank (BIT) bypass line. A previous amendment [Amendment No. 139, issued on October 15, 1993] to the Operating
License removed the functional requirement for the BIT. Consequently, the function of the BIT bypass line to provide
a Safety Injection [SI] pump test flow path has been rendered obsolete, permitting removal of the bypass line and associated
valves. The bypass line will be cut and capped to assure containment integrity, therefore eliminating the need for
containment isolation valves SI-1833A and SI-1833B. Opening the BIT outlet valve [SI-MOV-1835A or B] permits operability
testing of the SI pumps, and is consistent with the current provision permitting opening of the BIT bypass valves.
The changes do not impact the current operability and surveillance requirements for the Safety Injection System.


(2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated?


Response:


The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated. The change proposes to eliminate two containment isolation valves on the BIT bypass line whose function
has been rendered obsolete by a previous amendment to the Operating License. The bypass line will be cut and capped
to assure containment integrity, therefore eliminating the need for these containment isolation valves. Intermittent
opening of the BIT outlet valve is consistent with the current provision permitting opening of the BIT bypass valves,
thereby allowing operability testing of the SI pumps. The changes do not impact the operability or surveillance requirements
for the Safety Injection System.

(3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?


Response:


The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety for the following reasons.
Currently, an orientation deficiency with the inboard BIT bypass isolation valve exposes its stem packing to the
non-isolable side of the valve. The modification corrects this problem by removing both isolation valves and capping
the pipes to assure integrity of the Containment and Safety Injection System. Additionally, removal of the isolation
valves removes the potential for containment leakage resulting from valve degradation. Finally, removal of the
BIT bypass line and its associated isolation valves does not inhibit the ability to test the SI pumps since a previous
modification approved in an Amendment to the Operating License removed the functional requirement for the BIT. Consequently,
the SI pumps may be flow tested with the BIT inservice, rendering obsolete the function of the BIT bypass line. Intermittent
opening the BIT outlet valve is consistent with the current provision permitting opening of the BIT bypass valves,
thereby allowing operability testing of the SI pumps.

Nos. 1 and 2, Salem County, New Jersey 




Date of amendment request: 

June 29, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

These proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications to increase the minimum volume of oil contained
in the Diesel Fuel Oil Storage Tanks (DFOSTs) at the Salem Generating Station (SGS). It would also revise the Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) description of the fuel oil storage system capability.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




(1) [This proposal does] not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 


Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) fuel oil is used to support mitigation of design basis events involving loss of the
preferred (offsite) source of A.C. power. Fuel oil storage capacity has no effect on the probability of any accident
previously evaluated.


Onsite fuel oil storage capability is designed to provide assurance of long term diesel operation to mitigate the
consequences of a design basis accident. The proposed change would increase the minimum required volume in the Seismic
Class I Diesel Fuel Oil Storage Tanks (DFOSTs), and would revise the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR),
as part of an effort to reconstitute the basis for SGS fuel oil storage capacity. The DFOST inventory at the proposed
minimum Technical Specification (TS) limit, combined with the emergency fill connection and Seismic Class III Fuel
Oil Storage Tank and transfer capability, would continue to provide a long term onsite fuel oil supply to the EDGs.
Operations and Emergency Preparedness procedures would facilitate the transfer of fuel oil, and procurement from
offsite sources as a contingency measure. Therefore, the ability to provide a long term supply of fuel oil to the EDG's
is maintained, and the proposed change would not result in any significant increase in consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.


(2) [This proposal does] not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.


The proposed change would increase the minimum DFOST level required by TS, and redefines the fuel oil storage and transfer
systems' capability based on plant specific fuel oil consumption rate and EDG load profiles. These changes would
not result in operation in any configuration prohibited by the present TS, and do not introduce the possibility of
any new type of accident.


(3) [This change does] not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


The EDG fuel oil storage and transfer capability would continue to support reliable, long term EDG operation, thereby
maintaining an acceptable margin of safety relative to the ability of onsite A.C. power to support operation of equipment
important to safety. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Alabama 





Date of amendment request: 

March 31, 1994 (TS 319)



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises the setpoints for instrumentation used to isolate high energy line breaks in the high
pressure coolant injection (HPCI) and reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) systems. The proposed amendment also
defines specific areas where steam line space temperatures are monitored.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 




1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.


The proposed changes to the HPCI and RCIC steam line space isolation setpoints do not affect any precursor for any design
basis events or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry Final Safety Analysis Report. Therefore, the
probability of an accident previously evaluated is not increased.


The HPCI and RCIC steam line space high temperature isolations are provided to ensure automatic closure of each system's
primary containment isolation valves for a HPCI or RCIC steam line break. The isolation occurs when a very small leak
has occurred. If the small leak is allowed to continue without isolation, offsite dose limits may be reached. As a result
of the environmental qualification program, the environmental responses of the reactor building to high energy
line breaks were analyzed. TVA used computer modeling techniques to predict the temperature response of various
reactor building zones to high energy line breaks. The results indicate that the setpoints for the HPCI and RCIC temperatures
switches should be lowered. The lower setpoints assure the timely initiation of a closure signal to the primary containment
isolation valves. Therefore, assuring the maximum allowable temperatures are not exceeded.


The proposed change to the HPCI and RCIC steam line space isolation setpoints are in the conservative direction and
provides the same or earlier detection and isolation of HPCI and RCIC steam line breaks.


The proposed trip level settings are high enough to ensure that spurious trips do not occur from normal or transient
system operation and low enough to ensure that line breaks are detected and isolated before design conditions are
exceeded. Therefore, the proposed changes will not significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.


2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

The proposed change to the HPCI/RCIC steam line space high temperature isolations does not involve any modification
to plant equipment or changes in operating procedures. No new failure modes are introduced. There is no effect on the
function or operation of any other plant system. No new system interactions have been introduced by the change. The
results of a break in the HPCI or RCIC steam lines remain as before. The HPCI or RCIC steam line area temperature switches
will still detect a break due to an increase in area temperature and provide an initiation signal to close the system
primary containment isolation valves to prevent reactor coolant loss. The proposed change will conservatively
serve to detect and mitigate HPCI and RCIC line breaks more expeditiously. 


Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.


3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


The proposed change will not reduce the margin of safety. The proposed change ensure that HPCI and RCIC steam line breaks
are isolated at the same or lower steam line area temperatures. Computer modeling techniques were utilized to predict
the temperature response in various areas through which the HPCI and RCIC steam lines pass. The revised setpoints
are established above the maximum expected normal room temperatures to avoid spurious actions due to ambient conditions
and below the analytical limits to ensure timely pipe break detection and isolation. Substantial margin exist between
the maximum temperature expected in each area and the minimum actuation temperature determined for each temperature
switch. With the substantial margin between maximum temperatures for the areas and the minimum actuation temperature
of the switches, the maximum temperatures cannot result in actuation of the switches. The design and function of the
affected components has not been changed. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.




The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket No. 50-260, Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Unit 2, Limestone County, Alabama 





Date of amendment request: 

May 11, 1994 (TS 347T)



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment extends the allowed outage time for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Unit 2 
250 volt DC (direct current) control power supplies from 5 to 45 days. The amendment is a temporary revision to the BFN
Unit 2 Technical Specifications (TS) to permit replacement of batteries and other hardware.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
 



1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.


The proposed change involves temporarily (one-year period) extending the 5-day AOT [allowed outage time] for the
250-volt shutdown board control power supplies to 45 days. As such, this change does not increase the probability
of any accident previously analyzed. 


The 250-volt DC Power System is required to function to mitigate the consequences of design basis accidents. The loss
of a single 250-volt DC shutdown board control power supply will result in a loss of control power for the 480-volt and
the 4160-volt shutdown board that it serves. Loss of control power results in loss of only those engineered safeguards
supplied by its respective shutdown boards. Redundant safe shutdown equipment exists to mitigate the consequences
of design basis accidents. As discussed in Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) subsection 8.6.4.3, a single failure
of a shutdown board control power supply is acceptable.


Loss of a single 250-volt plant DC power supply will not prevent Unit 2 safe shutdown. The 250-volt plant DC power supply
system is designed so that any two out of the three power supplies carry the entire load needed for safe shutdown. As
discussed in FSAR subsection 8.6.4.2 a single failure of a 250-volt plant DC power supply is acceptable.


At no time will control power be unavailable to the shutdown boards during the system upgrades. The proposed change
will only increase the time allowed to operate the plant while a 250-volt DC shutdown board control power supply is
out of service.


The proposed TS change allows an additional 40 days to perform system upgrades and results in a small increase in risk.
This small increase in risk is associated with the probability and consequences of a 250-volt plant DC power supply
malfunction while it is supplying shutdown board control power. The increase in risk associated with extending the
AOT was analyzed in a Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) and determined to be approximately 0.3 percent. This
small increase in risk is determined to be insignificant and well within the uncertainty bounds of the PSA.


The proposed TS change does not change the function of any plant structure, system or component. The proposed change
allows for improvements to the 250-volt DC shutdown board control power supply system. The improvements will increase
the capability and reliability of the system. Qualified backup power will be utilized at all times during system modifications.
Only one power supply will be out of service at a time during the modifications.


The small increase in risk is more than offset by the increased capability, capacity, and reliability of the new power
supplies. Therefore, the power supply modifications will result in a net overall safety benefit.


[The licensee has also committed to implement compensatory measures while performing the power supply modifications.
These measures provide additional confidence that potential accident consequences are not increased.]


2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.


Extending the 5-day AOT for the 250-volt shutdown board control power supplies to 45 days does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident, nor does it increase the probability that an accident will occur. The AOT extension
does not involve plant modifications that could create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from
any of those discussed in the FSAR.


The 250-volt DC shutdown board control power supply modifications involve replacement of the existing components
with more reliable, increased capacity equipment having the same functions as before.


3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


The proposed TS change involves a risk increase of approximately 0.3 percent. TVA [the Tennessee Valley Authority,
the licensee] considers this small increase to be insignificant. TVA also considers that the small increase in risk
is offset by the benefits associated with replacing the control power supplies with new, upgraded equipment. Therefore,
the proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


[The licensee has also committed to implement compensatory measures while performing the power supply modifications.
These measures provide additional capability to mitigate an accident, minimizing any effect on safety margin.]




The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-266 and 50-301, Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Town
of Two Creeks, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin





Date of amendment request: 

July 18, 1994



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify Point Beach Nuclear Plant Technical Specification (TS) 15.3.7, ``Auxiliary
Electrical Systems,'' by including an allowed outage time for one of the four connected station battery chargers
and subsequent shutdown requirements. The basis for Section 15.3.7 would also be revised to support the above changes.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:




In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.91(a), Wisconsin Electric Power Company (Licensee) has evaluated
the proposed changes against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined that the operation of Point Beach Nuclear
Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendments, does not present a significant hazards consideration.
A proposed facility operating license amendment does not present a significant hazards consideration if operation
of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:


1. Create a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or


2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or


3. Will not create a significant reduction in a margin of safety.


The proposed amendment allows operation for up to two hours with one out of the four connected station battery chargers
out of service. The 2-hour outage time is based on Regulatory Guide 1.93 and reflects a reasonable time to assess plant
status and either connect an operable battery charger to the affected DC bus or prepare to effect an orderly and safe
shutdown of the operating unit(s). Since the batteries, chargers, and their associated vital instrument buses provide
sufficient redundancy to assure the initiation of proper protective actions during degraded system conditions,
operation of PBNP in accordance with these proposed amendments cannot create an increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated, create a new or different kind of accident, or result in a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Therefore, the proposed changes do not present a significant hazards consideration.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)




During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 

Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 

For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 

Federal Register 

notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.

In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.

Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 

The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 

Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.

For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 

The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By September
16, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

 Final Document.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is publishing a document entitled 

Final Report: Principles of Neurotoxicity Risk Assessment

, which was prepared by the Working Party on Neurotoxicology under the auspices of the Subcommittee on Risk Assessment
of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology (FCCSET). The purpose of this report
is to articulate a view of neurotoxicology that scientists generally hold in common today and to draw on this understanding
to generate a series of general principles that can be used to establish guidelines for assessing neurotoxicity risk.
It is not the intent of this report to provide specific directives for how neurotoxicity risk assessment should be
performed. The intent of this document is to provide the scientific basis for the development of a cogent strategy
for neurotoxicity risk assessment. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This document is the result of the combined efforts of senior scientists of 13 Federal agencies comprising the ad hoc
Interagency Committee on Neurotoxicology, including the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Center
for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Environmental
Protection Agency, National Center for Toxicological Research, National Institutes of Health, National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health, and National Toxicology Program. Discussions were held under the auspices of
the Working Party on Neurotoxicology of the Subcommittee on Risk Assessment of the Federal Coordinating Council
for Science, Engineering, and Technology. The draft report, a product of the Working Party on Neurotoxicology, contains
six chapters: an introduction, an overview of the discipline of neurotoxicology, a review of methods for assessing
human neurotoxicity, a review of methods for assessing animal neurotoxicity, an overview of principles of neurotoxicity
risk assessment, and a general summary. 



The draft report was prepared in view of the decision-making processes currently used by many regulatory agencies
relating to neurotoxicity risk assessment. It is intended that the principles reviewed in this document will serve
as the basis for consistent regulatory neurotoxicity guidelines to be used by Federal agencies to meet their respective
legislative mandates. This document is not meant to be used to perform risk assessment nor does it recommend one approach
or strategy. The document reviews the science of neurotoxicology and attempts to formulate general assumptions
and principles that could lead to such approaches or strategies. 

The draft report has undergone interagency review under the auspices of the Subcommittee on Risk Assessment of FCCSET.
Public comments received were used in the preparation of the final report by the Working Party on Neurotoxicology.

1. Introduction


1.1. Background 





Over the years, agencies and programs have been established to deal with hazardous 
substances, with a focus on deleterious long-term effects, including noncancer endpoints such 
as neurotoxicity (Reiter, 1987). Recent evidence indicates that exposure to neurotoxic agents 
may constitute a significant health problem (WHO, 1986; OTA, 1990; chapter 2). Table 1-1 
lists the four Federal regulatory agencies with authority to regulate either exposure to or use 
of chemicals and that require data reporting on assessment of hazards. Regulatory bodies 
vary greatly in their mandate to require approval of chemicals prior to entering the 
marketplace and to regulate subsequent exposure (Fisher, 1980) (Table 1-2). The 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) cannot require chemical testing by 
the manufacturer whereas all other agencies can. Only the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have authority for premarketing 
testing of chemicals (i.e., FDA for drugs and food additives and EPA for pesticides). EPA 
can, under some circumstances, require premarket testing of industrial and agricultural 
chemicals. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) regulates a number of 
consumer products including household chemicals and fabric treatments. Laws administered 
by CPSC require cautionary labeling on all hazardous household products whether the hazard 
is based on acute or chronic effects. These laws also provide the authority to ban hazardous 
products and to ask for data in support of product labeling.

1.2. Purpose of This Report 



The purpose of this document is to: (1) articulate a view of neurotoxicity that 
scientists generally hold in common today and (2) draw upon this understanding to compose, 
as was done here by senior scientists from a number of Federal agencies, a series of general 
principles that can be used to establish general guidelines for assessing neurotoxicity risk. It 
is not the intent of this report to provide specific directives to agencies with respect to their 
own approach for neurotoxicity risk assessment. This document is intended to provide the 
scientific basis for the development of a cogent strategy for neurotoxicology risk assessment 
as needed by each agency. 

Because of present gaps in understanding, the principles contained in this document 
are based on the best judgment of those involved in writing this document, as well as 
statements of what is generally accepted as fact. There has been, however, an attempt to 
distinguish where possible between the different types of information presented. 

The principles contained in this document can serve as the basis for consistent 
regulatory neurotoxicology guidelines that the Federal agencies can tailor to meet the 
requirements of the legislative acts they are charged to implement. This document should be 
viewed broadly as part of an ongoing process within the Federal Government to periodically 
update and review the current scientific understanding and regulatory utility of neurotoxicity 
risk assessment. 

This document is the result of the combined efforts of senior scientists from the 
following Federal health-related units, operating under the direction of the Office of Science 
and Technology Policy (OSTP): 



Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) 

Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), FDA 

Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), FDA 

Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), FDA 

Consumer Product Safety Commission 

Department of Agriculture (USDA) 

Department of Defense (DoD) 

Environmental Protection Agency 

National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), FDA 

National Institutes of Health (NIH) 

National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 

National Toxicology Program (NTP) 


1.3. Context of This Report 



This document was prepared in light of a decision-making process used by many 
regulatory agencies pertaining to the assessment of neurotoxicity risks posed by chemical 
agents. The scientific basis for such assessment can be best understood by examining the 
decision-making process in some detail. 

Risk can be thought of as being composed of two aspects, each of which can be 
addressed by science, i.e., hazard and exposure assessment. Although other definitions have 
been used historically, this document conforms to present usage. Hazard generally refers to 
the toxicity of a substance and is deduced from a wide array of data, including those from 
epidemiological studies or controlled clinical trials in humans, short- and long-term 
toxicological studies in animals, and studies of mechanistic information and structure-activity 
relationships. Exposure generally refers to the amount of a substance with which people 
come in contact. The risk in a quantitative risk assessment is estimated by considering the 
results of the exposure and hazard assessments. As either the hazard or exposure approaches 
zero, the risk also approaches zero. 

As a first step in assessing the neurotoxic risk associated with the use of a particular 
chemical substance, the qualitative evidence that a given chemical substance is likely to be a 
human neurotoxicant must be evaluated. In this step, as in the whole process, a number of 
assumptions and approximations must be made in order to deal with inherent limitations 
found in the existing data bases. Then, estimates of human exposure and distribution of 
exposures likely to be encountered in the population are made. In the absence of dose-
response relationships in humans, one or more methods for estimating the dose-response 
relationship including doses below those generally used experimentally must also be 
evaluated. Finally, the exposure assessment is combined with the dose-response relationship 
to generate an estimate of risk. The various ways in which these steps are conducted and 
combined and their attendant uncertainties constitute what is generally referred to as 
``neurotoxicity risk assessment.'' 

Some legislation calls for action in the presence of any risk. Other forms of 
legislation use the concept of unreasonable risk, defined in some acts as a condition in which 
the risks outweigh the benefits. A spectrum of regulatory responses, from simply informing 
the public of a risk through restricted use to a complete ban, may be available to bring the 
risks and benefits into appropriate balance. 

This document does not perform a risk assessment nor does it suggest that one 
method of neurotoxicology risk assessment is better than another. Rather, it attempts to 
review the science of chemical neurotoxicology and develops from this review a set of 
general principles. It is not a comprehensive review nor a document written for the lay 
public; this document is a semitechnical review that evaluates the impact of scientific findings 
of the last decade on general assumptions or principles important to risk assessment. This is 
based on the belief that elucidation of the basic mechanisms underlying neurotoxicity and the 
identification of neurotoxic agents and conditions, when coupled to research aimed at 
identifying and characterizing the problems caused by such agents, should provide the best 
scientific bases for making sound and reasonable judgments. These overlapping approaches 
to evaluating the problems of neurotoxicology should form a strong foundation for decision-making. 


1.4. Content of This Report 



Including the Introduction (chapter 1), this document contains six chapters. Chapter 2 
provides an overview of the discipline of neurotoxicology. It is important to understand the 
scope of the problem as it relates to neurotoxicology, including: (1) Definitions of 
neurotoxicity and adverse effect, (2) examples of neurotoxicity and incidents of exposure, 
and (3) Federal response to neurotoxicology. Chapter 2 also discusses the basic principles of 
toxicology that apply generally to the evaluation of neurotoxicity. Issues such as dose, 
exposure, target site, and the intended use of the chemical are discussed, as are principles of 
pharmacodynamics, chemical interactions, and the concept of threshold. Chapter 2 also lays 
the neurobiological basis for understanding how and where chemicals can affect the nervous 
system and provides examples of such chemical types. Finally, chapter 2 discusses special 
considerations for neurotoxicology including the issue of susceptible populations, the blood 
brain barrier, and the limited capability of the nervous system to repair following chemical 
insult. 

Chapter 3 examines methods for assessing human neurotoxicity. Neurologic 
evaluations, neuropsychological testing, and applicability of methods used in clinical 
evaluations and case studies are discussed in this chapter. Epidemiologic study designs, 
endpoints, and methods are also discussed, as well as problems of causal inference and 
applications and limitations of epidemiologic and field study methods for risk assessment. 
Chapter 3 also describes human laboratory exposure studies, including methods for assessing 
neurobehavioral function, self-report methods for assessing subjective states, and a number of 
other methodological issues. This chapter also discusses the comparability of human and 
animal laboratory methods and special considerations in human neurotoxicity assessments. 

Chapter 4 assesses methods for evaluating animal neurotoxicity. Discussed in this 
chapter is the role that animal models play in the assessment of chemicals for neurotoxicity, 
the validity of animal models, and experimental design considerations in animal 
neurotoxicological studies. Also included in this chapter is a discussion of tier-testing 
approaches in chemical evaluations. Specific endpoints used in animal neurotoxicological 
studies are also discussed, including methods for neurobehavioral, neurophysiological, 
neuroanatomical, and neurochemical assessments. Developmental neurotoxicology and in 
vitro neurotoxicology are also described in this chapter. 

Chapter 5 of this document discusses principles of neurotoxicity risk assessment. 
This chapter evaluates the generic assumptions in neurotoxicity risk assessment, ending with 
a discussion of uncertainty reduction and identification of knowledge gaps. 

Chapter 6 is a general summary of the material presented in the first five chapters.

2. Overview of Neurotoxicology 


2.1. Scope of the Problem 


2.1.1. Introduction 



Chemicals are an integral part of our lives, with the capacity to both improve as well 
as endanger our health. The general population is exposed to chemicals with neurotoxic 
properties in air, water, foods, cosmetics, household products, and drugs used therapeutically 
or illicitly. Naturally occurring neurotoxins, such as fish and plant toxins, present other 
hazards. During the daily life of an ordinary person, there is a multitude of exposures, both 
voluntary and unintentional, to neuroactive substances. Under conditions of multiple 
exposures, identifying the substance responsible for an adverse response may be difficult. 
The EPA's inventory of toxic chemicals is greater than 65,000 and increasing yearly. 
Concerns have been raised about the toxicological data available for many compounds used 
commercially (NRC, 1984). 

It is not known how many chemicals are neurotoxic to humans. However, estimates 
have been made for subsets of substances. A large percentage of the more than 500 
registered active pesticide ingredients are neurotoxic to varying degrees. Of 588 chemicals 
listed by the American Conference of Government and Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), 167 
affected the nervous system or behavior (Anger, 1984; CDC, 1986). Using a generally 
broad definition of neurotoxicity, Anger (1990a) estimated that of the approximately 200 
chemicals to which 1 million or more American workers are exposed, more than one-third 
may have adverse effects on the nervous system at some level of exposure. Anger (1984) 
also recognized neurotoxic effects as one of the ten leading workplace disorders. In addition, 
a number of therapeutic substances, including some anticancer and antiviral agents and 
abused drugs, can cause adverse or neurotoxicological side effects (OTA, 1990). It has been 
estimated that there is inadequate toxicological information available for more than three-
fourths of the 12,860 chemicals with a production volume of 1 million pounds or more 
(NRC, 1984). It should be noted, however, that estimates concerning the number of 
neurotoxicants vary widely. O'Donoghue (1989), for example, reported that of 488 
compounds assessed in his chemical evaluation process, only 2.7% had effects on the 
nervous sytem. 


2.1.2. Examples of Neurotoxicity and Incidents of Exposure 



There is a long-standing history associating certain neurological and psychiatric 
disorders to exposure to a toxin or chemical of an environmental origin (OTA, 1990) (Table 
2-1). Lead is one of the earliest examples of a neurotoxic chemical with widespread 
exposure. This metal is widely distributed with major sources of inorganic lead including 
industrial emissions, lead-based paints, food, beverages, and the burning of leaded gasolines. 
Organic lead compounds such as tetraethyl lead have been reported to produce a toxic 
psychosis (Cassells and Dodds, 1946). If exposure occurs at relatively low levels during 
development, lead can cause a variety of neurobehavioral problems, learning disorders, and 
altered mental development (Bellinger et al., 1987; Needleman, 1990). Over the years, 
Federal Government regulations have been developed to decrease human exposure to lead, 
and as a goal an intervention level of 10 

m

g/dcl whole blood has been recommended (CDC, 
1991). Lead exposure in the United States has decreased significantly during the last several years.

Mercury compounds are potent neurotoxic substances and have caused a number of 
human poisonings, with symptoms of vision, speech, and coordination impairments (Chang, 
1980). Erethism, a syndrome with such neurologic features as tremor and behavioral 
symptoms as anxiety, irritability, and pathologic shyness, is seen in people exposed to 
elemental mercury (Bidstrup, 1964). One major incidence of human exposure occurred in 
the mid-1950's when a chemical plant near Minamata Bay, Japan, discharged mercury as 
part of waste sludge. An epidemic of mercury poisoning developed when the local 
inhabitants consumed contaminated fish and shellfish. Congenitally affected children 
displayed a progressive neurological disturbance resembling cerebral palsy and manifested 
other neurological problems as well. In 1971, an epidemic occurred in Iraq from 
methylmercury used as a fungicide to treat grain (OTA, 1990). 
Manganese is used in metal alloys and has been proposed to replace lead in gasoline. 
It is an essential dietary substance for normal body functioning yet parenteral exposure to 
manganese can be neurotoxic, producing a dyskinetic motor syndrome similar to Parkinson's 
disease (Cook et al., 1974). Exposed miners in several countries have suffered from 
``manganese madness'' characterized by hallucinations, emotional instability, and numerous 
neurological problems. Long-term manganese toxicity produces muscle rigidity and 
staggering gait similar to that seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (Politis et al., 1980). 
A Parkinsonian-like syndrome was also observed in people who accidentally ingested 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (Langston et al., 1983). MPTP was a 
byproduct of a meperidine derivative sold illicitly as ``synthetic heroin.'' 
Organic solvents are encountered frequently in occupational settings. Most solvents 
are volatile, i.e., they can be converted from a liquid to a gaseous state and readily inhaled 
by the worker. They are also lipid soluble and readily accumulate in the fat deposits of the 
exposed organism. An example of a solvent exposure in humans is carbon disulfide. 
Workers exposed to high levels of this solvent were found to have an increased frequency of 
depression and suicide (Seppalainen and Haltia, 1980). Furthermore, repeated exposure to 
organic solvents is suspected of producing chronic encephalopathy. Workers exposed to 
methyl-n-butyl ketone, a dye solvent and cleaning agent, displayed peripheral nervous system 
neuropathy involving degeneration of nerve fibers (Spencer and Schaumburg, 1980). 
Solvents including ether, ketones, alcohols, and various combinations are commonly used in 
glues, cements, and paints and when inhaled can be neurotoxic. Repeated abuse of such 
solvents can lead to permanent neurological effects due to severe and permanent loss of nerve 
cells (OTA, 1990). 
Pesticides are one of the most commonly encountered classes of neurotoxic 
substances. These can include insecticides (used to control insects), fungicides (for blight 
and mildew), rodenticides (for rodents such as rats, mice, and gophers), and herbicides (to 
control weeds). Active ingredients are combined with so-called inert substances to make 
thousands of different pesticide formulations. Workers who are overexposed to pesticides 
may display obvious signs of poisoning, including tremors, weakness, ataxia, visual 
disturbances, and short-term memory loss (Ecobichon and Joy, 1982). Chlordecone exposure 
results in nervousness and tremors (Cannon et al., 1978). The organophosphorous 
insecticides have neurotoxic properties and account for approximately 40 percent of 
registered pesticides. A delayed neurotoxicity can be seen as a result of exposure to certain 
organophosphate pesticides, producing irreversible loss of motor function and an associated 
neuropathology (Ecobichon and Joy, 1982). Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are 
known to interfere with a specific enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Davis and 
Richardson, 1980). Paralysis has also been reported following consumption of nonpesticide 
organophosphate products such as tri-o-cresylphosphate (TOCP). 
Neurotoxicities in humans, domestic livestock, and poultry associated with fungal 
toxins (mycotoxins) have been well documented (Kurata, 1990; Aibara, 1986; Wyllie and 
Morehouse, 1978). Mycotoxins not only have a negative economic effect on animal 
production, but they also represent a definite threat to human health. Mycotoxins occur in 
forages, field crops, and grains used for livestock; they also are incorporated into cereals, 
grains, and grain-based products used for human consumption. Therefore, human exposure 
may occur either through direct consumption of these products or secondarily through 
consumption of meat, milk, or eggs. An example of human exposure to fungal toxins is 


Claviceps purpurea

- or 

C. paspali

-infected wheat, barley, and oats used for bread and as a 
dietary supplement for livestock. These fungal toxins are notorious for producing the 
gangrenous and convulsive forms of the disease known as ``ergotism'' (Bove, 1970). These 
fungi are in the family 

Clavicipitaceae

 and produce a group of compounds known as ergot 
alkaloids, which have neurotropic, uterotonic, and vasoconstrictive activities. They may act 
as dopamine agonists or serotonin antagonists, and also block alpha-adrenergic receptors. 
Since there are numerous naturally occurring ergot alkaloids, this represents only part of 
their pharmacopoeia (Berde and Schield, 1978). These alkaloids are highly toxic and cause 
both acute and chronic poisonings. Although guidelines now limit the amount of 

Claviceps

-contaminated, or ``ergot''-contaminated, grains, these compounds may enter human food 
sources through secondary mechanisms. Other fungi associated with ergot-like syndromes in 
livestock include 

Acremonium lolii 

(Gallagher et al., 1984) and 

A. coenophialum 

(Thompson 
and Porter, 1990). 
Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) is an indole tetramic acid produced by 

Aspergillus flavus, 
A. oryzae, Penicillium cyclopium

, and 

P. camemberti. 

This mycotoxin is suspected of 
causing ``kodua poisoning'' in humans who consumed kodo millet seed in India (Rao and 
Husain, 1985). 

Fusarium moniliforme

 is a common fungal infection in corn (Bacon et al., 
1992) and directly related to neurotoxic syndrome in horses known as equine 
leukoencephalomalaisia (ELEM). 
Natural plant toxins also represent a health risk to both livestock and humans. 
Movement toward limited uses of herbicides, fungicides, and no-till agricultural practices 
increases the possibility of noxious weeds and weed seeds being incorporated into food 
products. Ergot alkaloids also are produced by morning glories 

(Ipomea violacea)

 and may 
be incorporated into soybeans, corn, peas, etc., during harvest. Export regulations limit 
morning glory-contaminated soybeans because of the hallucinogenic and other effects 
produced by ergot alkaloids. Jimson weed 

(Datura stramonium)

, another weed incorporated 
into agricultural commodities, produced scopolamine, hyocyamine, and stropine, all of which 
have parasympatholytic (anticholinergic) activities. 
Recently, an outbreak of toxic encephalopathy caused by eating mussels contaminated 
with domoic acid, an excitotoxin, was reported (Perl et al., 1990).

2.1.3. Federal Response 


In the United States, several agencies, including EPA, FDA, OSHA, CPSC, NIOSH, 
and ATSDR, have been given the mandate to regulate or evaluate public exposure to toxic 
chemicals (Tilson, 1989). 


2.1.3.1. Food and Drug Administration. 


The FDA has the authority to regulate the use of 
food and color additives as well as to determine whether or not various foods are unsafe for 
human consumption because of adulteration by environmental contaminants. The 
manufacturer must supply adequate data to establish the safety of the food additives. Before 
marketing approval, the potential toxicity of proposed food and color additives is established 
in a battery of animal toxicity studies. During all of these studies, clinical signs of toxicity, 
including abnormal behavior, are monitored and abnormalities recorded. At the termination 
of these studies, tissues from all organs, including the brain, are sectioned and evaluated for 
both gross and histopathological changes, in addition to being evaluated for their clinical 
chemistry and hematology. None of the routinely required tests is specifically designed to 
assess neurotoxicity. If neurotoxic effects are detected during any of the standard toxicity 
tests, however, they must be reported. Specific neurotoxicity testing may then be required. 
The FDA is currently revising its guidelines for the safety assessment of direct food and 
color additives to include neurotoxicity as a routine element in toxicological testing. 
The FDA is also authorized to regulate substances in food considered to be poisonous 
or deleterious. Unavoidable environmental contaminants in food fall into this category. The 
FDA determines a level at which the risks from realistically possible intakes are negligible or 
acceptable. Based on this risk assessment, an action level or tolerance is established. Once 
the action level or tolerance is formally established, the FDA may take appropriate action to 
restrict adulterated food from the market if these standards are exceeded. 
The FDA is responsible for assessing the toxicity of human therapeutic products. 
Many products have been shown to produce adverse effects on the nervous system at 
standard therapeutic doses as well as at higher doses. Before marketing approval is given, 
the toxicity of potential new products is assessed. A battery of animal toxicity study 
parameters relevant to the nervous system, including gross behavioral observation and gross 
and histopathological examination of the nervous tissue, are evaluated. This information is 
used to help guide the surveillance of human subjects for adverse effects that are assessed 
during clinical trials. 


2.1.3.2. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 


OSHA has been given the 
responsibility to ensure that the working environment is a safe and healthy place of 
employment. In the early 1970's, OSHA adopted the existing Federal standards, most of 
which were developed under the Walsh-Healy Act (including the 1968 ACGIH Threshold 
Limit Values), and approximately 20 consensus standards of the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) as Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs). Of the 393 remaining 
original PELs, 145 were set in part to protect the individual from neurotoxic effects. 
Since the adoption of the initial standards, OSHA has issued new or revised health 
standards or work practices for 23 substances. Of these, the one concerning lead was based 
in part on nervous system effects. Four other compounds, inorganic arsenic, acrylonitrile, 
ethylene oxide, and 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane, were cited as causing various disturbances 
in the nervous system, but the standards for these were based primarily on carcinogenic 
effects. 
In 1989, OSHA updated 428 exposure limits for air contaminants. Of these, 25 
substances were categorized by OSHA as ``substances for which limits are based on 
avoidance of neuropathic effects.'' In addition, 24 substances were included in the category 
``substances for which limits are based on avoidance of narcosis.'' However, OSHA stated 
that the categorization was intended as a tool to manage the large number of substances being 
regulated and not to imply that the category selected identified the most sensitive or the 
exclusive adverse health effects of that substance. 


2.1.3.3. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 


The Occupational Safety 
and Health Act established NIOSH as a Public Health Service (PHS) agency to develop and 
recommend criteria for prevention of disease and hazardous conditions in the workplace. 
NIOSH also performs research on occupational health issues and conducts worksite 
evaluations of suspected hazards. OSHA and the Mine Safety and Health Administration 
(MSHA) use NIOSH recommendations in the promulgation of new or revised health and 
safety standards. 
In establishing recommended exposure limits (RELs) for chemicals, NIOSH examines 
all relevant scientific information about a given compound and attempts to identify exposure 
limits that will protect all workers from adverse effects. NIOSH has recommended standards 
for approximately 644 chemicals or classes of chemicals. For 214 (33 percent) of these, 
neurotoxicity was cited as a health effect considered when formulating the REL (NIOSH, 
1992). 


2.1.3.4. Environmental Protection Agency. 


The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and 
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) provide the legislative 
authority for EPA to require data collection for premarket approval of chemicals. Under 
section 5 of TSCA, after a manufacturer has notified EPA of its plans to produce a ``new'' 
chemical that has not yet been listed on the inventory, EPA has the responsibility to assess 
possible health hazards. Potential neurotoxicity is included in the health hazards assessment. 
If there are reasons to suspect neurotoxicologic effects (e.g., from structure-activity analysis, 
information in the literature, or data submitted by the manufacturer), EPA can issue a test 
rule requiring the manufacturer to develop data directed toward these effects. At the same 
time, EPA can restrict the chemical or prohibit it entirely from entering commerce until the 
required data are submitted and reviewed. In addition, for ``old'' chemicals (under section 4 
of TSCA), if EPA suspects neurotoxicity, a test rule would be the mechanism used for 
obtaining the data. Many other statutes provide authority to regulate chemicals through the 
setting of standards, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water 
Act. 
Neurotoxicity is recognized as a health effect of concern under FIFRA, and there are 
neurotoxicity testing requirements for premarketing submission of data to EPA for 
registration of a pesticide under FIFRA.

2.1.3.5. Consumer Product Safety Commission.


The CPSC is an independent Federal 
regulatory agency with jurisdiction over most consumer products. Most chemical hazards are 
regulated under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) administered by CPSC. The 
FHSA requires appropriate cautionary labeling on all hazardous household products (hazards 
include chronic toxicity such as neurotoxicity). While the FHSA does not require premarket 
registration, a manufacturer is required to assess the hazards of a product prior to marketing 
and assure that it is labeled with all necessary cautionary information. The FHSA also bans 
children's products that are hazardous and provides the CPSC with the authority to ban other 
hazardous products. 


2.1.3.6. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.


ATSDR has a mission to 
prevent or mitigate adverse effects to both human health and the quality of life resulting from 
exposure to hazardous substances in the environment. The ATSDR publishes a National 
Priority List (NPL) of hazardous substances that are found at National Priority Waste Sites. 
The order of priority is based on an algorithm, taking into consideration frequency with 
which substances are found at NPL sites, toxicity, and potential for human exposure; this list 
is reranked on a yearly basis. So far, 129 toxicological profiles have been developed for the 
priority hazardous substances, and 92 substances have a profile with a neurological health 
effect endpoint (HAZDAT, 1992). Neurotoxicity has been selected by the ATSDR to be one 
of the seven high-priority health conditions resulting from exposure to environmental 
toxicants. 


2.2. Basic Toxicological Considerations for Neurotoxicity 


2.2.1. Basic Toxicological Principles 


A chemical must enter the body, reach the tissue target site(s), and be maintained at a 
sufficient concentration for a period of time in order for an adverse effect to occur. Not all 
chemicals have the same level of toxicity; some may be very toxic in small amounts while 
others may have little effect even at extremely high amounts. Thus, the dose-response 
relationship is a major concept in determining the toxicity of a specific substance. Other 
factors in determining toxicity include the physical and chemical properties of the substance, 
the route and level of exposure, the susceptibility of the target tissue, and the health, gender, 
and age of the exposed individual. 
Once the toxic substance has entered the body, usually through the lungs (inhalation), 
the skin (absorption), or the gastrointestinal tract (ingestion), it is partitioned into various 
body tissues where it can act on its target sites. The substance is eliminated from the 
bloodstream by the process of accumulation into the various sites in the body, with the liver 
and kidney being major sites of accumulation of toxic substances. This is thought to be 
associated with these organs' large blood capacity and major role in elimination of substances 
from the body. Lipophilic chemicals accumulate in lipid-rich areas of the body and present a 
significant potential problem for the nervous system. The nervous system is unique in its 
high percentage content of lipid (50 percent of dry weight) and may be particularly 
vulnerable to such chemicals. The site or sites of accumulation for a specific toxic substance 
may or may not be the primary sites of action. Examples include two known neurotoxicants, 
carbon monoxide in the red blood cells and lead in the bone. It must be noted that some 
substances are not distributed throughout the body, partially as a function of their 
insolubility, polarity, or molecular weight. 
The effect that a substance has will generally depend on the body burden or level in 
the tissue and duration of exposure. The time course of the levels is determined by several 
factors, including the amount at time of exposure, duration of exposure, and metabolic fate 
of the chemical. The study of such metabolic processes, pharmacokinetics, has demonstrated 
complex patterns in the absorption, distribution, possible biotransformation, and elimination 
of various substances (Klaassen, 1980). 
Many substances are removed by the kidney and excreted through the urine. The 
liver can detoxify substances like organic lead, which are excreted from the liver into the bile 
and then the small intestines, bypassing the blood and kidney. Lipophilic toxic substances 
are primarily removed from the body through feces and bile, and water-soluble metabolites 
are removed in the urine, through the skin, and through expiration into the air. 
Biotransformation is a biochemical process that converts a substance into a different chemical 
compound, allowing it to be excreted more easily. Substances are more easily removed if 
they are biotransformed into a more hydrophilic compound. Biotransformation can either aid 
in the detoxification of a substance or produce a more toxic metabolite. Therefore, the 
original substance may not be the substance that is producing the toxicity on the nervous 
system or any other system. Thus, several factors must be taken into consideration when 
evaluating the potential neurotoxicity of a chemical. They include the pharmacokinetics of 
the parent compound, the target tissue concentrations of the parent chemical or its 
bioactivated proximate toxicant, the uptake kinetics of the parent chemical or metabolite into 
the cell and/or membrane interactions, and the interaction of the chemical or metabolite with 
presumed receptor sites. 


2.2.2. Basic Neurotoxicological Principles 


Neurotoxicity can be manifest as a structural or functional adverse response of the 
nervous system to a chemical, biological, or physical agent (Tilson, 1990b). It is a function 
of both the property of the agent and a property of the nervous system itself. Neurotoxicity 
refers broadly to the adverse neural responses following exposure to chemical or physical 
agents (e.g., radiation) (Tilson, 1990b). Adverse effects include any change that diminishes 
the ability to survive, reproduce, or adapt to the environment. Neuroactive substances may 
also impair health indirectly by altering behavior in such a way that safety is decreased in the 
performance of numerous activities. Toxicity can occur at any time in the life cycle, from 
conception through senescence, and its manifestations can change with age. The range of 
responses can vary from temporary responses following acute exposures to delayed responses 
following acute or chronic exposure to persistent responses. Neurotoxicity may or may not 
be reversible following cessation of exposure. The responses may be graded from transient 
to fatal and there may be different responses to the same neurotoxicant at different dose 
levels but similar responses to exposure to different agents. Displays of a neurotoxic 
response may be progressive in nature, with small deficits occurring early in exposure and 
developing to become more severe over time. Expression of neurotoxicity can encompass 
multiple levels of organization and complexity including structural, biochemical, 
physiological, and behavioral measurements.

Caution must be exercised in labeling a substance neurotoxic. The intended use and 
effect of the chemical, the dose, exposure scenario and whether or not the chemical acts 
directly or indirectly on the nervous system, must be taken into consideration. A substance 
that may be neurotoxic at a high concentration may be safe and beneficial at a lower 
concentration. For example, vitamin A, vitamin B6, are required in the diet in trace 
amounts, yet all result in neurotoxicity when consumed in large quantities. Pharmaceutical 
agents may also have adverse effects at high dose levels or where the beneficial effects 
outweigh the adverse side effects. For example, antipsychotic drugs have allowed many 
people suffering from schizophrenia to lead relatively normal lives; however, chronic 
prescribed use of some of these drugs may result in severe tardive dyskinesia characterized 
by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, and limbs. Other examples include toxic 
neuropathies induced by chemotherapeutic agents like cis-platinum, toxic anticholinergic 
effects of high doses of tricyclic antidepressants, disabling movement disorders in patients 
treated with anti-Parkinsonian agents and major tranquilizers, and hearing loss and balance 
disruption triggered by certain antibacterials (Sterman and Schaumburg, 1980). Drugs of 
abuse such as ethanol also have neurotoxic potential. Opiates such as heroin may lead to 
dependence, which is considered to be a long-term adverse alteration of nervous system 
functioning. Simultaneous exposure to drugs or toxic agents may produce toxic interactions 
either in the environment or occupational settings. For example, exposure to noise and 
certain antibiotics can exacerbate the loss of hearing function (Boettcher et al., 1987; Lim, 
1986; Bhattacharyya and Dayal, 1984). 
The nervous system is a highly complex and integrated organ. It is possible that 
nonlinear dose-response relationships or a threshold effect could exist for some agents. It 
has been hypothesized that the nervous system has a reserve capacity that masks subtle 
damage and any exposure that does not overcome this reserve capacity may not reach the 
threshold and no observable impairment will be evident (Tilson and Mitchell, 1983). 
However, the functional reserve may be depleted over time and the manifestations of toxicity 
may be delayed in relationship to the exposure. The reserve may be depleted by a number of 
factors including aging, stress, or chronic exposure to an environmental insult, in which case 
functioning will eventually be impaired and toxicity will become apparent. If a number of 
events occur simultaneously, the response is progressive in nature, or there is a long latency 
between exposure and manifestation of toxicity, the identification of a single cause of the 
functional impairment may not be possible. 


2.3. Basic Neurobiological Principles 


2.3.1. Structure of the Nervous System 


The nervous system is composed of two parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and 
the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Spencer and Schaumburg, 1980). Within the nervous 
system, there exist predominantly two general types of cells_nerve cells (neurons) and glial 
cells. Neurons have many of the same structures found in every cell of the body; they are 
unique, however, in that they have axons and dendrites, extensions of the neuron along 
which nerve impulses travel. The structure of the neuron consists of a cell body, 10 to 100 


m

m in diameter, containing a nucleus and organelles for the synthesis of various components 
necessary for the cell's functioning, e.g., proteins and lipids. There are numerous branch 
patterns of elongated processes, the dendrites, that emanate from the cell body and increase 
the neuronal surface area available to receive inputs from other sources. Neurons 
communicate with each other by releasing chemical signals onto specific surface regions, 
receptors, of the other neuron. The axon is a process specialized for the conduction of nerve 
impulses away from the cell toward the terminal synapses and eventually toward other cells 
(neurons, muscle cells, or gland cells). 
Neurons are responsible for the reception, integration, transmission, and storage of 
information (Raine, 1989). Certain nerve cells are specialized to respond to particular 
stimuli. For example, chemoreceptors in the mouth and nose send information about taste 
and smell to the brain. Cutaneous receptors in the skin are involved in the sensation of 
pressure, pain, heat, cold, and touch. In the retina, the rods and cones sense light. In 
general, the length of the axon is tens to thousands of times greater than the cell body 
diameter. For example, the cell body whose processes innervate the muscles in the human 
foot is found in the spinal cord at the level of the middle back. The axons of these cells are 
more than a meter in length. Many, but not all, axons are surrounded by the layers of 
membrane from the cytoplasmic process of glial cells. These layers are called myelin 
sheaths and are composed mostly of lipid. In the PNS, the myelin sheaths are formed by 
Schwann cells, while in the CNS the sheaths are formed by the oligodendroglia. The myelin 
sheath formed by one glial cell covers only a short length of the axon. The entire length of 
the axon is ensheathed in myelin by numerous glial cells. Between adjacent glial sheaths, a 
very short length of bare axon exists called the node of Ranvier. In unmyelinated axons, a 
nerve impulse must travel in a continuous fashion down the entire length of the nerve. The 
presence of myelin accelerates the nerve impulse by up to 100 times by allowing the impulse 
to jump from one node to the next in a process called ``saltatory conduction.'' 
The nerve cells of the PNS are generally found in aggregates called ganglia. The 
brain and spinal cord make up the CNS and the neurons are segregated into functionally 
related aggregates called nuclei. They synthesize and secrete neurotransmitters, which are 
specialized chemical messengers that interact with receptors of other neurons in the 
communication process. Various nuclei together with the interconnecting bundles of axonal 
fibers are functionally related to one another to form higher levels of organization called 
systems. For example, there is the motor system, the visual system, and the limbic system. 
At the base of the brain, several small nuclei in the hypothalamus form the neuroendocrine 
system, which plays a critical role in the control of the body's endocrine (hormone-secreting) 
glands. Nerve cells in the hypothalamus secrete chemical messengers into a short loop of 
blood vessels that carries the messengers to the pituitary gland which, in turn, releases 
chemical messengers into the general circulation. These pituitary messengers regulate other 
glands (e.g., the thymus and the gonads). The entire system maintains a state of optimal 
physiological function for all of the body's organ systems.

2.3.2. Transport Processes 


All types of cells must transport proteins and other molecular components from their site of production near the nucleus
to the other sites in the cell (Hammerschlag and Brady, 1989). Neurons are unique in that the neuronal cell body must
maintain not only the functions normally associated with its own support, but it must also provide support to its various
processes. This support may require transport of material over relatively vast distances. Delivery of necessary
substances by intracellular transport down the axon (axonal transport) represents a supply line that is highly vulnerable
to interruption by toxic chemicals. In addition, the integrity of the function of the neuronal cell body is often dependent
on a supply of trophic factors from the cells that it innervates. These factors are continually supplied to the neural
cells by the process of retrograde axonal transport, often as a process of normal exchange between two or more cells.
They play a significant factor in the normal growth and maintenance of the neural cells, and a continual supply of certain
trophic factors is necessary for cell functioning. 
The majority of axonal transport occurs along longitudinally arranged fiber tracks called neurofilaments. This
movement along neurofilaments requires energy in the form of oxidative metabolism. Toxicants that interfere with
this metabolism or that disrupt the spatial arrangement or production of neurofilaments may block axonal transport
and can produce neuropathy (Lowndes and Baker, 1980). This can be seen following exposure to many substances, such
as n-hexane and methyl n-butyl ketone as well as the drugs vincristine, vinblastine, and taxol. Acrylamide produces
a dying-back axonopathy but by an alternative mechanism involving altered axonal transport. 


2.3.3. Ionic Balance 


The axonal membrane is semipermeable to positively and negatively charged ions (mostly potassium, sodium, and chloride)
within and outside of the axon. There are several enzyme systems that maintain an ionic balance that changes following
depolarization of the membrane (Davies, 1968). This is maintained only by the continual active transport of ions
across the membrane, which requires an expenditure of energy. The nerve impulse is a traveling wave of depolarization
normally originating from the cell body; however, in sensory neurons it originates at the terminal receptive end
of specialized axons (Davies, 1968). The wave is continued by openings in the membrane that allow ions to rush into
the axon. This sudden change in the charge across the axon's membrane is the nerve impulse. It is an amplified depolarization
that reaches the threshold value and spreads down the axon from one length to another until the next length of membrane
reaches the threshold value. It continues in this fashion until it reaches the synaptic terminal regions. There are
a number of varieties of membrane channels (e.g., calcium) that rapidly open and close during impulse generation;
the common ones are the sodium and potassium channels. They are very small and allow only ions of a certain size to pass.
Several classes of drugs (e.g., local anesthetics) and natural toxins (e.g., tetrodotoxin) inhibit nerve impulse
conduction by blocking these channels. 


2.3.4. Neurotransmission 


The terminal branches of the axon end in small enlargements called synaptic ``boutons.'' It is from these boutons
that chemical messengers will be released in order to communicate with the target cell at the point of interaction,
the synapse (Hammerschlag and Brady, 1989). When the nerve impulse reaches the terminal branches of the axon, it depolarizes
the synaptic boutons. This depolarization causes the release of the chemical messengers (neurotransmitters and
neuromodulators) stored in vesicles in the axon terminal (Willis and Grossman, 1973). Classical neurotransmitters
include serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine and are typically secreted by one neuron into the
synaptic cleft where they are on the postsynaptic membrane. Neuropeptides, however, may travel long distances through
the bloodstream to receptors on distant nerve cells or in other tissues. Following depolarization, the amount of
secretion is dependent on the number of nerve impulses that reach the synaptic bouton, i.e., the degree of depolarization.
The chemical messengers diffuse across the synaptic cleft or into the intraneuronal space and bind to receptors on
adjacent nerve cells or effector organs, thus triggering biochemical events that lead to electrical excitation
or inhibition. 
When information is transmitted from nerves to muscle fibers, the point of interaction is called the neuromuscular
junction and the interaction leads to contraction or relaxation of the muscle. When the target is a gland cell, the
interaction leads to secretion. Synaptic transmission between neurons is slightly more complicated, but still
dependent on the opening and closing of ion channels in the membrane. The binding of the messenger to the receptor of
the receiving cell can lead to either the excitation or inhibition of the target cell. At an excitatory synapse, the
neurotransmitter-receptor interaction leads to an opening in certain ion-specific channels. The charged ions
that move through these opened chambers carry a current that serves to depolarize the cell membranes. At inhibitory
synapses, the interaction leads to an opening in a different type of ion-specific channel that produces an increase
in the level of polarization (hyperpolarization). The sum of all the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents
determines the transmembrane potential and when a threshold level of depolarization is reached at the axon's initial
segment, a nerve impulse is generated and begins to travel down the axon.

The duration of neurotransmitter action is primarily a function of the length of time it remains in the synaptic cleft.
This duration is very short due to specialized enzymes that quickly remove the transmitter either by degrading it
or by reuptake systems that transport it back into the synaptic bouton. A toxic substance may disrupt this process
in several different ways. It is important that the duration of the effect of synaptically released chemical messengers
be limited. Some neurotoxicants, e.g., cholinesterase-inhibiting organophosphorous pesticides, inhibit the
enzyme (AChE), which serves to terminate the effect of the neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) on its target. The result
is an overstimulation of the target cell. Other substances, particularly biological toxins, are able to interact
with the receptor molecule and mimic the action of the neurotransmitter. Some toxic substances, like neuroactive
pharmaceuticals, may interfere with the synthesis of a particular neurotransmitter, while others may block the
neurotransmitter's access to its receptor molecule. 


2.4. Types of Effects on the Nervous System 


The normal activity of the nervous system can be altered by many toxic substances. A variety of adverse health effects
can be seen ranging from impairment of muscular movement to disruption of vision and hearing to memory loss and hallucinations
(WHO, 1986; Anger, 1984, 1990). Toxic substances can alter both the structure and the function of cells in the nervous
system. Structural alterations include changes in the morphology of the cell and its subcellular structures. In
some cases, agents produce neuropathic conditions that resemble naturally occurring neurodegenerative disorders
in humans (Calne et al., 1986). Cellular alterations can include the accumulation, proliferation, or rearrangement
of structural elements (e.g., intermediate filaments, microtubules) or organelles (mitochondria) as well as the
breakdown of cells. By affecting the biochemistry and/or physiology of a cell, a toxic substance can alter the internal
environment of any neural cell. Intracellular changes can result from oxygen deprivation (anoxia) because neurons
require relatively large quantities of oxygen due to their high metabolic rate. 
Many times the response of the nervous system to a toxic substance can be a slow degeneration of the nerve cell body or
axon that may result in permanent neuronal damage. Substances can act as a cytotoxicant after having been transported
into the nerve terminal. A complete loss of nerve cells can occur following exposure to a number of toxic substances.
Sensory nerve cells may be lost following treatment with megavitamin doses of vitamin B6; hippocampal neurons undergo
degeneration with trimethyltin and trimethyl lead poisoning; motor nerve cells are affected in cycad toxicity,
which has been loosely linked to Guam-ALS-Parkinsonism dementia. Acute carbon monoxide poisoning can produce a
delayed, progressive deterioration over a period of weeks of portions of the nervous system that may lead to psychosis
and death. Substances such as mercury and lead can cause central nervous system dysfunction. In children, mercury
intoxication can cause degeneration of neurons in the cerebellum and can lead to tremors, difficulty in walking,
visual impairment, and even blindness. Lead affects the cortex of the immature brain, resulting in mental retardation.

At the cellular level, a substance might interfere with cellular processes like protein 
synthesis, leading to a reduced production of neurotransmitters and brain dysfunction (Bondy, 
1985). Nicotine and some insecticides mimic the effects of the neurotransmitter 
acetylcholine. Organophosphorous compounds, carbamate insecticides, and nerve gases act 
by inhibiting AChE, the enzyme that inactivates the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This 
results in a buildup of acetylcholine and can lead to loss of appetite, anxiety, muscle 
twitching, and paralysis. Amphetamines stimulate the nervous system by releasing and 
blocking reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from nerve cells. 
Cocaine affects the release and reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Both 
drugs can cause paranoia, hyperactivity, aggression, high blood pressure, and abnormal heart 
rhythms. Opium-related drugs such as morphine and heroin act at specific opioid receptors 
in the brain, producing sedation, euphoria, and analgesia. They also tend to slow the heart 
rate and cause nausea, convulsions, and slow breathing patterns. Other substances can alter 
the synthesis and release of specific neurotransmitters and activate their receptors in specific 
neuronal pathways. They may perturb the system by overstimulating receptors, blocking 
transmitter release and/or inhibiting transmitter degradation, or blocking reuptake of 
neurotransmitter precursors. 
Also at the cellular level, the flow of ions such as calcium, sodium, and potassium 
across the cell membrane may be changed and the transmission of information between nerve 
cells altered. A substance may interfere with the ionic balance of a neuron. 
Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides produce autonomic dysfunction and 
organochlorine insecticides increase sensorimotor sensitivity, produce tremors and in some 
cases cause seizures and convulsions (Ecobichon and Joy, 1982). Lindane, DDT, 
pyrethroids, and trimethyltin also produce convulsions. Conversely, solvents act to raise the 
threshold for eliciting seizures or act to reduce the severity or duration of the elicited 
convulsions. 
The role of excitatory amino acid (EAA)-mediated synaptic activation is critical for 
normal function of the CNS. Because endogenous EAA-mediated synaptic transmission is a 
widespread excitatory system in the brain and is involved in the process of learning and 
memory, the issue of the effects of endogenous and exogenous EAA-related toxicity has 
broad implications for both CNS morbidity and mortality in humans. Much of the injury and 
neuronal death associated with toxicity is mediated by receptors for excitatory amino acids, 
especially glutamic acid. When applied in sufficient excess from either endogenous or 
exogenous sources, EAAs have profound neurotoxic effects that can result in the destruction 
of neurons and, as a consequence, lead to acute phase confusion, seizures, and generalized 
weakness or to persistent impairments such as memory loss (Choi, 1988). 
A final common path in the activation of these receptor classes is an increase in free 
cytosolic Ca


'
'

 that can result in the release and activation of intracellular enzymes (which 
break down the cytoskeleton) and in further release of glutamate, both of which can be 
cytotoxic (Choi, 1988). Critical to an understanding of the etiopathology associated with at 
least some of the neurotoxic degeneration may be the link that impaired energy metabolism 
could have with excitotoxic neuronal death. It is likely that reduced oxidative metabolism 
results in the partial depolarization of resting membrane potential, the activation of ionotropic 
membrane receptor/channels, and the influx of Ca


'
'

 or its release from intracellular stores.

The nervous system is dependent on an extensive system of blood vessels and 
capillaries to deliver large quantities of oxygen and nutrients as well as to remove toxic waste 
products. Damage to the capillaries in the brain can lead to the swelling characteristic of 
encephalopathy. This can be seen following exposure to higher concentrations of lead. 
Other metals (e.g., cadmium, thallium, and mercury) and organotin (e.g., trimethyltin) cause 
rupturing of vessels that can also result in encephalopathy. 
One large aspect of function that may be affected by neurotoxicants is behavior, 
which is the product of various sensory, motor, and associative functions of the nervous 
system. Neurotoxic substances can adversely affect sensory or motor functions, disrupt 
learning and memory processes, or cause detrimental behavioral effects; however, the 
underlying mechanisms for these effects have yet to be determined. Although changes may 
be subtle, the assessment of behavior may serve as a robust means of monitoring the well-being of the organism (Tilson
and Cabe, 1978). 


2.5. Special Considerations 


2.5.1. Susceptible Populations 


Everyone is at a certain level of risk of being adversely affected by neurotoxic 
substances. Individuals of certain age groups, health states, and occupations, however, may 
be at a greater level of risk. Fetuses, children, the elderly, workers in occupations involving 
exposure to relatively high levels of toxic chemicals, and persons who abuse drugs are 
among those in high-risk groups. Neurotoxic substances may exacerbate existing 
neurological or psychiatric disorders in a population. Although controversial (Waddell, 
1993), recent evidence suggests that there may be a subpopulation of people who have 
become sensitive to chemicals and experience adverse reactions to low-level exposures to 
environmental chemicals (Bell, et al., 1992). Confounded in all of these groups is the role 
that nutrition plays in the response of the organism to exposure. Both general nutritional 
status and specific nutritional deficiencies (for example, protein, iron, and calcium) can 
significantly influence the response to a toxic substance. 
It is widely accepted that during development adverse effects can result from exposure 
to some chemicals at lower levels than would be necessary for the average adult (Suzuki, 
1980). The developing nervous system appears to be differentially sensitive to some kinds of 
damage (Cushner, 1981; Pearson and Dietrich, 1985; Annau and Eccles, 1986; Hill and 
Tennyson, 1986; Silbergeld, 1986). During the developmental period, the nervous system is 
actively growing and establishing intricate cellular networks. Both the blood-brain and 
blood-nerve barriers that will eventually protect much of the adult brain, spinal cord, and 
peripheral nerves are incomplete. The protective mechanisms by which the organism deals 
with toxic substances, such as the detoxification systems, are not fully developed. Exposure 
to chemicals during development can result in a range of effects. At the highest exposure, 
effects include death, gross structural abnormalities, or altered growth. Larger populations 
are generally exposed to more moderate levels resulting in more subtle functional 
impairments. The qualitative nature of some injuries during development may differ from 
those seen in the adult, such as changes in tissue volume, misplaced or misoriented neurons, 
or delays or acceleration of the appearance of functional or structural endpoints (Rodier, 
1986). In many cases, the results of early injuries may become evident only as the nervous 
system matures and ages (Rodier, 1990). There are several instances in which functional 
alterations have resulted from exposure during the period between conception and sexual 
maturity (Riley and Vorhees, 1986; Vorhees, 1987). 
Early exposure to relatively low levels of lead can result in reduced scores on tests of 
mental development (Bellinger et al., 1987; Needleman, 1990). Early gestational exposure 
to neurotoxicants such as cocaine can produce long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities 
(Anderson-Brown et al., 1990; Hutchings et al., 1989); heavy alcohol exposure produces 
craniofacial abnormalities and mental retardation (Jones and Smith, 1973), while moderate 
levels of alcohol consumption during gestation can delay motor development (Little et al., 
1989). 
With aging, the level of risk for a number of health-related factors increases; it has 
been hypothesized that the risk for toxic perturbations to the nervous system also increases 
with age (Weiss, 1990). It is generally believed that with increasing age comes a decreased 
ability of the nervous system to respond to adverse events or to compensate for either 
biological, physical, or toxic effects. At the tissue and cellular level, the aging process can 
result in nerve cell loss, formation of neurofibrillary tangles (abnormal accumulation of 
certain filamentous proteins) and neuritic plaques (abnormal clusters of proteins and other 
substances near synapses). As cells die, the complex neuronal circuitry of the brain becomes 
impaired. Neurotransmitter concentrations and the enzymes involved in their synthesis may 
be altered. Some axons can gradually lose their myelin sheath, resulting in a slowed 
conduction of nerve impulses along the axon. It has been postulated that with age, not only 
might the nervous system become more susceptible to new insults, but the effects of previous 
exposures also may become evident, with a diminished capacity for compensation (Weiss, 
1990). The increased incidence of multiple drug-taking in the elderly population might also 
lead to interactions, either drug/drug or drug/chemical, which can adversely affect the 
nervous system. Nutritionally, the aged experience increased incidences of both general 
undernutrition and deficits of specific nutrients such as iron or calcium, which might 
influence the response to toxic substances. 
In the geriatric population, the clinical manifestation of neurodegenerative disorders 
may have a contributing component of past exposures to environmental chemical agents. 
Calne et al. (1986) hypothesized that various agents contribute to Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, motoneurone disease, or Lou 
Gehrig's disease) by depleting neuronal reserves to an extent that perturbations become 
observable in the context of the natural aging process. B-N-methylamino-L-alanine, from the 
seed of the false sago palm (

Cycas circinalis 

L.), has been reported to induce a form of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Spencer et al., 1987). Alzheimer-type syndromes have been 
reported in individuals occupationally exposed to organic solvents or metal vapors (Freed and 
Kandel, 1988). Severe cognitive dysfunction has been noted in Alzheimer's disease and 
aluminum intoxication (Yokel et al., 1988).

At any age, preexisting physical as well as mental disorders of the individual may play a significant role in the manifestation
of a toxic response following exposure to a potentially toxic substance. Both types of disorders compromise the system
in some way so that either the defense mechanisms of the organism are not able to deal with the toxic substance or are
not able to repair themselves quickly. In addition to the basic altered biology, for individuals with a physical or
mental disorder who are under some form of medical intervention, the combination of therapeutic drugs and toxic substances
may have an interactive effect on the nervous system. For example, due to the delicate electrochemical balance of
the nervous system, mental disorders may be exacerbated by exposure to a toxic substance. 


2.5.2. Blood-Brain and Blood-Nerve Barriers 


The bioavailability of a specific chemical to the nervous system is a function of both the target tissue and the chemical.
The brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves are surrounded by a series of semipermeable tissues referred to as the
blood-brain and blood-nerve barriers (Katzman, 1976; Peters et al., 1991). In the central nervous system, the blood-brain
barrier is composed of tight junctions formed by endothelial cells and astrocytes. These tight junctions and cellular
interactions forming the barrier restrict the free passage of most bloodborne substances. By doing this, they create
a finely controlled extracellular environment for the nerve cells. Certain regions of the brain and nerves are directly
exposed to chemicals in the blood because the barrier is not present in some areas of the nervous system. For example,
it is absent in the circumventricular area, around the dorsal root ganglion in the peripheral nervous system, and
around the olfactory nerve, which may allow chemicals to penetrate directly from the nasal region to the frontal cortex.

The existence of these blood-brain and blood-nerve barriers suggests that proper functioning of the nervous system
is dependent on control of the substances to which nerve cells are exposed. The term ``barrier,'' however, is somewhat
of a misnomer. Although water-soluble and polar compounds enter the brain poorly, lipophilic substances readily
cross the barrier. In addition, a series of specific transport mechanisms exist through which required nutrients
(hormones, amino acids, peptides, proteins, fatty acids, etc.) reach the brain (Pardridge, 1988). If toxicants
are lipid soluble or if they are structurally similar to substances that are normally transported into the brain,
they can achieve high concentrations in brain tissue. It has been proposed that one reason why the developing nervous
system may be differentially sensitive to some toxicants is that the blood-brain barrier is less effective than in
an adult. The effectiveness of the blood-brain barrier may also be changed by chemical-induced physiological events
such as metabolic acidosis and nutritional deprivation. 


2.5.3. Metabolism 


The central nervous system has a very high metabolic rate and, unlike other organs, the brain depends almost entirely
on glucose as a source of energy and raw material for the synthesis of other molecules (Damstra and Bondy, 1980). The
absence of an alternative energy source makes the CNS critically dependent on an uninterrupted supply of oxygen as
well as the proper functioning of enzymes that metabolize glucose. Substances can be toxic to the nervous system if
they perturb neuronal metabolism. Without glucose, nerve cells usually begin to die within minutes. Despite its
relatively small size, the energy demands of the brain require 14 percent of the heart's output and consumes about
18 percent of the oxygen absorbed by the lungs. 


2.5.4. Limited Regenerative Ability 


The nervous system has a combination of special features not found in other organ systems. It is composed of a variety
of metabolically active neurons and supporting cell types that interact through a multitude of complex chemical
mechanisms. Each cell type has its own functions and vulnerabilities. At the time of puberty, the system is fully developed
and neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons from cell division of precursor cells called neuroblasts) ceases. This
is in marked and significant contrast to almost all other tissues, where cell replacement is continual. 
It is this loss of neurogenesis that limits the nervous system's ability to recover from damage and influences the
plasticity of the system. Neurons are unable to regenerate following damage; therefore, they are no longer able to
perform their normal functions. Toxic damage to the brain or spinal cord that results in cell loss is usually permanent.
If nerve cell loss is concentrated in one of the CNS's functional subsystems, the outcome could be debilitating; for
example, a relatively small loss of neurons that use acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter may produce a profound
disturbance of memory. A relatively minor insult concentrated in a subsystem that relies on dopamine as its neurotransmitter
may drastically impair motor coordination. However, in response to injury, neurons are able to show considerable
plasticity both during development and after maturation. Damage to the nervous system alters connectivity between
the surviving neurons, permitting functional adjustments to occur to compensate for the damage. Such responsiveness
may, in and of itself, have profound consequences for neurological, behavioral, and related body functions. 
After damage to axons in the peripheral nerves, if the neurons are not damaged, the axons have the ability to regenerate
and to attempt to reach their original target site. This is the basis, for example, of the eventual return of sensation
and muscle control in a surgically reattached limb. Neurons in the CNS also have the ability to regenerate interrupted
axons; however, they have a much more difficult task in reaching their original targets due to both the presence of
scar tissue formed by proliferating glia and to the increased complexity of the connectivity in the CNS.

3. Methods for Assessing Human Neurotoxicity 



3.1. Introduction 



This chapter outlines and discusses current methods for detecting neurotoxicity in humans. In contrast to studies
of neurotoxicity in animals where functional changes readily can be correlated with neuroanatomic and neurochemical
alterations, there are ethical and technical barriers to the direct observation of neuronal damage in humans. Neurotoxicity
in humans is most commonly measured by relatively noninvasive neurophysiologic and neurobehavioral methods that
assess cognitive, affective, sensory, and motor function. The evaluation of human neurotoxicity and the relevance
to risk assessment will be discussed within the context of clinical evaluation, epidemiologic/worksite studies,
and human laboratory exposure studies. 



3.2. Clinical Evaluation 



Neurobehavioral assessment methods are used extensively in clinical neurology and neuropsychology to evaluate
patients suspected of having neurologic disease. An extensive array of examiner-administered and paper and pencil
tasks are used to assess sensory, motor, cognitive, and affective functions and personality states/traits. Neurobehavioral
data are synthesized with information from neurophysiologic studies, imaging techniques, medical history, etc.,
to derive a working diagnosis. Clinical diagnostic approaches have provided a rich conceptual framework for understanding
the functions (and malfunctions) of the central and peripheral nervous systems and have formed the basis for the development
of methods for measuring the behavioral expression of nervous system disorders. Human neurobehavioral toxicology
has borrowed heavily from neurology and neuropsychology for concepts of nervous system impairment and functional
assessment methods. Neurobehavioral toxicology has adopted the neurologic/neuropsychologic model, using adverse
changes in behavioral function to assist in identifying chemically or drug-induced changes in nervous system processes.




3.2.1. Neurologic Evaluation 



Assessment of neurobehavioral function by the clinical examination of a patient has long been used as a primary tool
in neurologic diagnosis. The domains of cognitive function, motor function, sensation, reflexes, and cranial nerve
function are a standard part of the clinical neurologic exam. Movement and gait, speech fluency and content, verbal
memory, deep tendon reflexes, muscle strength, symmetry of movement and strength, ocular movements, sensory function
(pressure, vibration, visual, auditory), motor coordination, and logical reasoning are only a few of the functions
assessed by neurologists (Denny-Brown et al., 1982). 

Trained and experienced clinicians gather these data by observation, verbal exchange, and direct examination.
Neurologic exams are sensitive indicators of neurologic disease; the data have predictive value for the diagnosis
of underlying nervous system disease, and the methods have been extensively validated against other diagnostic
procedures (e.g., imaging, neurophysiologic testing), the course of the illness, and autopsy findings. Examination
of the patient in a semistructured procedure can yield a wealth of information and insights about functional impairment
and the underlying neuropathology.

3.2.2. Neuropsychological Testing 



Neuropsychologists have developed quantitative methods to supplement clinical neurologic exam and laboratory
data for the diagnosis of neurologic disease. Currently, two assessment batteries, the Luria-Nebraska and the Halstead-Reitan,
and shorter versions are used in clinical practice. The batteries consist of subtests that quantify a wide spectrum
of cognitive, motor, sensory, intellectual, affective, and personality functions. The pattern of relative performance
on the subtests can be interpreted along with historical and medical data to suggest the presence or absence of neurologic
disease and the possible anatomic location of any focal lesions or degeneration. Clinical interpretation of the
data is enhanced by data on age-related population norms for many subtests and by the systematic observation of the
patient during testing. 

Several neurotoxicity assessment batteries use components of neuropsychological tests and have adapted and shortened
analogs of some subtests. Tests derived from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale_Revised (WAIS-R) have
been used frequently to assess neurobehavioral impairment from chemical agents, and other abbreviated variations
of neuropsychological battery subtests have been incorporated into neurobehavioral toxicity batteries and used
in field and laboratory studies. 



3.2.3. Applicability of Clinical Methods to Neurotoxicology Risk Assessment 



Neurologic and neuropsychologic methods have long been employed to identify the adverse health effects of environmental
workplace exposures. Peripheral neuropathies (with sensory and motor disturbances), encephalopathies, organic
brain syndromes, extrapyramidal syndromes, demyelination, autonomic changes, and dementia are well-characterized
consequences of acute and chronic exposure to chemical agents. The range of exposure conditions that produce clinical
signs of neurotoxicity also has been defined by using these clinical methods. It is very important to make external/internal
dose measurements in humans in order to determine the actual dose(s) which can cause unwanted effects. 

Aspects of the clinical neurologic examination approach limit its usefulness for neurotoxicologic risk assessment.
Information obtained from the neurologic exam is mostly qualitative and descriptive rather than quantitative.
Estimates of the severity of functional impairment can be reliably placed into only three or four categories (for
example, mild, moderate, severe). Much of the assessment depends on the subjective judgment of the examiner; the
magnitude and symmetry of muscle strength are often judged by having the patient push against the resistance of the
examiner's hands. The datum is therefore the absolute and relative amount of muscle load sensed by the examiner in
his or her arms. 

Compared with other methods, the clinical neurologic exam may be less sensitive in detecting early neurotoxicity
in peripheral sensory and motor nerves. While clinicians' judgments are equal in sensitivity to quantitative methods
in assessing the amplitude of tremor, tremor frequency is poorly quantified by clinicians. Thus, important aspects
of the clinical neurologic exam may be insufficiently quantified and lack sufficient sensitivity for detecting
early neurobehavioral toxicity produced by environmental or workplace exposure conditions. However, a neurologic
evaluation of persons with documented neurobehavioral impairment would be helpful for identifying nonchemical
causes, such as diabetes and cardiovascular insufficiency. 

Administration of a neuropsychological battery also requires a trained technician, and interpretation requires
a trained and experienced neuropsychologist. Depending on the capabilities of the patient, 2 to 4 hours may be needed
to administer a full battery; 1 hour may be needed for the shorter screening versions. These practical considerations
may limit the usefulness of neuropsychological assessment in large field studies of suspected neurotoxicity. 

In addition to logistical problems in administration and interpretation, neuropsychological batteries and neurologic
exams share two disadvantages with respect to neurotoxicity risk assessment. First, neurologic exams and neuropsychological
test batteries are designed to confirm and classify functional problems in individuals selected on the basis of signs
and symptoms identified by the patient, family, or other health professionals. Their usefulness in detecting low-base
rate impairment in workers or the general population maybe generally thought to be limited, decreasing the usefulness
of clinical assessment approaches for epidemiologic risk assessment. 

Second, neurologic exams and neuropsychologic test batteries were largely developed to assess the functional correlates
of the most common forms of nervous system dysfunction: brain trauma, focal lesions, and degenerative conditions.
The clinical tests were primarily validated against these neurologic disease states. There has been insufficient
research to demonstrate which tests designed to assess functional expression of neurologic disease are most useful
in characterizing the modes of CNS impairment produced by chemical agents and drugs. More research is needed to validate
the usefulness of neuropsychologic test methods in neurotoxicology. 



3.3. Current Neurotoxicity Testing Methods 



3.3.1. Neurobehavioral Methods 



Chemical agents directly or indirectly affect a wide range of nervous system activities. Many of these chemical actions
are expressed as alterations of behavior; Anger (1990a) lists 35 neurobehavioral effects of chemical exposure that
illustrate alterations in sensory, motor, cognitive, affective, and personality function. Professional judgment
is important in the interpretation of data from studies using neurobehavioral methods since some endpoints can be
subjective. 

Dozens of tests of neurobehavioral function have been proposed or used in field or laboratory studies to assess the
neurotoxicity of chemical agents. Table 3-1 lists some frequently used tests of motor, sensory, cognitive,
and affective neurobehavioral function.

In contrast to the individual focus in clinical evaluation, neurobehavioral tests primarily have been used to evaluate
differences between groups, comparing unexposed groups with persons environmentally or occupationally exposed
to a suspected neurotoxic agent. An ideal evaluation of groups for quantitative evidence of chemically induced neurobehavioral
impairment would involve the assessment of a wide variety of functions, but testing all possible neurobehavioral
functions that might be affected in a group of exposed workers, for example, would be impossible. Therefore, a testing
strategy has been to use limited number tests that sample representative neurobehavioral functional domains such
as 
dexterity, visual memory, and reaction time. 



3.3.1.1. Test batteries. 



Many field and laboratory studies have selected neurobehavioral methods according to available information about
the spectrum of effects of the suspected neurotoxic agent(s). This focused strategy is useful for answering specific
questions about known neurotoxins. To identify unspecified neurotoxic effects in groups of workers or to characterize
the effects of less well-studied chemicals or mixtures of chemicals, several tests that sample a representative
range of functional domains have been grouped into test batteries. The advantage of a standardized battery is that
data from different study populations and chemical classes can be compared, and similarities in effects observed
(Johnson, 1987). Standardized batteries can be categorized into investigator-administered and computer-administered
types. 



3.3.1.2. Investigator-administered test batteries. 



The WHO-recommended Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery (NCTB) (Johnson, 1987), the Finnish Institute of Occupational
Health (FIOH) (Hanninen, 1990), and the Pittsburgh Occupational Exposures Test Battery (POET) (Ryan et al., 1987)
are three commonly used batteries. The NCTB is frequently used in field 
studies worldwide and can be fit inside a medium-sized suitcase for transport. The NCTB consists of the following
tests: simple reaction time task, digit-symbol coding task, timed motor coordination test (Santa Ana pegboard),
digit span memory test, Benton Visual Retention test, pursuit aiming test, and the Profile of Mood States (POMS).
Based on factor-analytic studies (Hooisma et al., 1990), these tests are believed to measure the functional domains
of immediate memory, attention, dexterity/hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and mood. Long-term memory,
verbal and language functions, auditory sensation, judgment, and so forth are not assessed. 



3.3.1.3. Computerized test batteries. 



Computerized tests and batteries have been developed for field and laboratory use. The Neurobehavioral Evaluation
System (NES) (Baker et al., 1985), MicroTox (Eckerman et al., 1985), the SPES (Iregren et al., 1985), and the NCTR Operant
Battery (Paule et al., 1990) are computerized systems developed for neurotoxicity assessment. Current versions
of the NES, for example, consist of about 15 different neurobehavioral tests, and the battery has been used in epidemiologic
studies of groups exposed to solvent, pesticide, and mercury, and in laboratory studies of NO

2

, ethanol, and toluene (Letz, 1990).

Although many computerized tests appear to tap similar neurobehavioral domains as 
noncomputerized batteries, the visual mode of presentation, the manual mode of response, and the emphasis on speed
of responding are believed to have led to significant differences in results obtained from computerized versus noncomputerized
forms of similar tests. Attempts to clarify the differences between computerized and noncomputerized test batteries
have met with difficulty. Although some tests are similar in each type of battery, size and duration of stimuli, presentation
and response modality, number of trials, and scoring vary arbitrarily, preventing direct comparison. An example
is the digit-symbol test on the NCTB and the symbol-digit test on the NES. Although almost identical in task requirements,
procedural and scoring differences prevent direct comparison of the results from these two tests. 

Postural stability is an aspect of integrated sensory and motor function that increasingly is being evaluated in
clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory investigations of effects of pesticides and solvents, and would be useful
for assessing therapeutic drug-induced movement disorders such as neuroleptics. Measurement of postural stability
requires a computer, special software, monitor, and a force transduction platform on which the subjects 
must stand (Dick et al., 1990). Mechanical and capacitive field methods for assessing the amplitude and frequency
of tremor also are seeing more frequent use. 

An advantage of computerized testing is the standardization of test presentation, but a disadvantage is the need
for delicate, expensive computers and measurement devices that require transport for field studies. Noncomputerized
test batteries may be less costly to purchase and easier to transport, enhancing their desirability in field studies,
but test administrators require training and small differences in test administration may affect the data.
 


3.3.2. Neurophysiologic Methods 



With improvements in the capabilities and size of equipment, quantitative 
neurophysiologic measurement of sensory and motor function will be increasingly useful in human neurotoxicity
evaluations. A major advantage of these methods for risk assessment is that they can be assessed in both human and animal
subjects and the data can be interpreted in an homologous manner. 

Electromyographic responses (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) have been used in the assessment of peripheral
nerve neurotoxicity. Some techniques require that needle electrodes be placed beneath the skin for stimulation
and recording and are therefore somewhat uncomfortable for the subject. However, the methods are quantitative,
provide multiple endpoints of PNS function, and have clinical relevance. 

The adverse effects of solvents, pesticides, and metals have been identified with EMG/NCV neurophysiologic measures.
Although not reduced as a function of duration of employment, maximum nerve conduction velocity (MCV) has been reported
to vary systematically with cumulative exposure to carbon disulfide (Johnson et al., 1983), suggesting that this
measure may be particularly valuable for quantitative risk assessment of some types of peripheral motor nerve toxicity.


Noninvasive neurophysiologic test methods used in neurotoxicity evaluations include the electroencephalogram
(EEG), visually evoked response (VER), somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), and the brainstem auditory evoked
response (BAER). The EEG is the summed electrical activity of neurons measured with scalp electrodes; voltage and
frequency are primary measures. Evoked methods employ specific eliciting stimuli applied to the sense organs to
measure nervous system electrical response. Visual patterns, sounds, and cutaneous stimuli are presented to the
subject, and ``evoked'' voltage changes in the nervous system are measured with skin electrodes. 

While EEGs were developed as a tool in the neurologic diagnosis of seizure disorders and other brain diseases, dose-related
EEG changes in chemically exposed (especially solvents and styrene) individuals have been noted (Seppalainen and
Harkonen, 1976). EEG measurement requires large recording devices that can be used in the laboratory or clinic, but
are difficult to use in field studies. However, compact computerized recording equipment 
has been developed, and automated spectral analyses of EEGs have recently been applied to neurotoxicity evaluation
(Piikivi and Tolonen, 1989). 

In contrast to EEGs, evoked response technology is improving, and equipment, while expensive, is becoming more portable.
VERs have been used to detect the sensory toxicity of solvents and carbon monoxide in human subjects, and a relationship
has been suggested between BAER and blood lead levels in children exposed to lead-containing dust in the environment
(Otto and Hudnell, 1990). Evoked potentials also may be conditioned, allowing the use of sensory methods to investigate
associative processes. 

Dose-response functions have been found with evoked methods. A curvilinear relationship was found between BAER
and blood lead concentrations in children (Otto and Hudnell, 1990), and a biphasic function described visual evoked
potential (VEP) latency and visual contrast sensitivity and perchloroethylene exposure concentration in a laboratory
study (Altmann et al., 1991). In the latter study, the direction of the response was jointly dependent on dose and stimulus
parameters. In addition, changes over time in the effect of the solvent on VEP were dose and stimulus parameter dependent.


Two important methodologic considerations are illustrated by BAER and VEP data. One is that low concentrations of
some chemical agents may produce effects (shorter latencies in these examples) that could be inaccurately interpreted
as facilitation rather than impairment. Changes in neuronal latencies in either direction could be a result of a neurotoxic
process. The second is that the detection of neurotoxic effects is dependent on dose-time-testing parameter interactions.
A thorough understanding of the effects of testing parameters on the dose-response relationship and the time course
of chemical effect will be necessary for interpreting neurotoxicity studies. 

The development of neurophysiologic methods, such as evoked and conditioned potentials, for neurotoxicity risk
assessment should be encouraged. These methods provide relatively unambiguous quantitative data on sensory function
that may have clear implications for health, are influenced by fewer extraneous variables than are self-report and
neurobehavioral performance tests, and allow relatively direct extrapolation of effects between animals and humans.

3.3.3. Neurochemical Methods 


One of the major difficulties in risk assessment is estimating exposure parameters and 
the dose or body burden actually absorbed by the individual. In epidemiologic studies, the 
actual absorption and bioavailability of a chemical from an exposure are frequently unknown. 
Measurement of chemical concentrations in biologic fluids or tissues is one way to 
measure more precisely the concentration at the site(s) of toxic effect. In epidemiologic 
studies, this has been possible only for chronic exposure and for acute exposure to chemicals 
with long biologic half-lives in the body, such as lead, other metals, and bromides. Blood 
lead levels show correlations with neurobehavioral impairment, but blood lead levels are 
representative correlates of toxicity only for relatively acute doses. In children, for example, 
the majority of lead-related impairment is the result of chronic, rather than acute, absorption. 
The cumulative amount of lead sequestered in tissues (such as deciduous teeth) may be a 
more representative indicator of the area under the time-concentration curve. 
For chemicals with half-lives in the body too short for estimating absorbed dose, the 
biochemical products from the chemical or from the physiologic effects of the chemical may 
serve as an index of exposure. Serum enzyme concentrations (cholinesterase) and esterases 
in other tissues (lymphocyte target esterase) have been employed in field studies to detect 
pesticide exposure, while vanillylmandelic acid (product of catecholamine neurotransmitter 
biotransformation) and erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations have been used with 
varying success in differentiating between lead-exposed and control workers. The addition of 
similar ``exposure biomarker'' measures to laboratory studies may allow the development of 
quantitative estimates of absorbed dose under various exposure conditions. 
The measurement of metabolic products of neurotoxic agents may be extremely useful 
in risk assessment; an example comes from cancer risk assessment. Human data from the 
early 1970s on saturation of microsomal methylene chloride biotransformation to carbon 
monoxide (Stewart et al., 1972), along with subsequent animal carcinogenesis data garnered 
in the 1980s, provided a quantitative basis for a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model 
of methylene chloride cancer risk assessment (Andersen et al., 1991). The information on 
human CO pathway kinetics provided the homologous key that allowed extrapolation of risk 
from animals to humans on a comparative physiologic basis rather than using default 
assumptions. 


3.3.4. Imaging Techniques 


A number of recently developed computerized imaging techniques for evaluating brain 
activity and cerebral/peripheral blood flow have added valuable information to the neurologic 
diagnostic process. These imaging methods include thermography, positron emission 
tomography, passive neuromagnetic imaging (magnetoencephalography), magnetic resonance 
imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, computerized tomography, doppler 
ultrasonography, and computerized EEG recording/analysis (brain electrical activity 
mapping). The research application of these invasive and noninvasive quantitative methods 
has primarily been in neurology, schizophrenia research, drug abuse, AIDS research and 
toxic encephalopathy (Hagstadius et al., 1989). Although the equipment for brain imaging is 
expensive and not portable, neuroimaging techniques promise to be valuable clinical and 
laboratory research tools in human neurotoxicology. 


3.3.5. Neuropathologic Methods 


Neuropathologic examination of nervous system tissue has been used to confirm data 
from clinical testing and to contribute to the understanding of mechanisms of action of 
neurotoxicity. Peripheral nerve biopsies have confirmed chemically induced peripheral 
neuropathies and evaluated rates of recovery (Fullerton, 1969). Postmortem examination of 
nervous tissue also has elucidated the neuropathological effects of carbon disulfide, 
clioquinol, and doxorubicin (Spencer and Schaumburg, 1980). 


3.3.6. Self-Report Assessment Methods 


Self-report measures relevant to neurotoxicity risk assessment consist of histories of 
symptoms, events, behaviors, and environmental conditions. Information is obtained by 
face-to-face interviews, structured interviews (often conducted for diagnostic purposes), 
medical histories, questionnaires, and survey instruments. 
Self-report instruments are the only means for measuring some symptoms and all 
interoceptive states, such as pain and nausea. Self-reports also are used to obtain information 
on behaviors and events (e.g., exposure conditions) especially when practical, legal, or 
ethical limitations prevent direct observation. 
Subjective symptoms elucidated from self-report instruments are responsive to dose. 
Hanninen et al. (1979) found that subjective symptoms were positively correlated with blood 
lead levels in exposed workers. Subjective pain estimations are correlated with dose and 
type of centrally and peripherally acting analgesics, and anxiety scores on a variety of scales 
are responsive to the size of the anxiolytic dose.

<TEXT>
 

Symptom checklists are used in epidemiologic research to identify the pattern of 
subjective complaints, which can be used to guide the selection of objective assessment 
methods. The distribution of symptoms can be correlated with indices of exposure to 
determine if particular symptoms are more prevalent in exposed persons (Sjogren et al., 
1990). 
Self-report data are notable for biases that may influence them; these biases are well 
known in epidemiology, clinical practice, and social science. Even in the most superficial of 
questions, respondents may consciously or unknowingly bias the answer to fit what they 
believe to be the examiner's expectations. Details of objective events or subjective states are 
subject to alteration; recall and reporting of remembered occurrences may be biased to fit 
interpretations and expectations. The socioeconomic status, gender, and affiliation of the 
tester also have been identified as biasing variables. Bias occurs when information is 
requested about behaviors, beliefs, or feelings believed by the respondent to be socially 
undesirable or when reinforcement contingencies (e.g., litigation) strongly favor selective 
reporting. 
Biases in self-report data can be reduced by making the questionnaire anonymous or 
highly confidential; objective data can be used to validate self-reports. Ethnographic 
observations, objective measurement of behavior, biologic samples, and the observations of 
significant others are employed to validate self-report data. Consistent descriptions of events 
by several persons lend credence to the reliability of the report. Many clinical interviews 
and self-report assessment instruments include some mechanisms for detecting self-report 
bias, either by looking for endorsement of improbable behaviors, or by examining the 
consistency of information gathered in several ways or from several sources. Concordance 
among biologic indices, observations, and physical examinations increases the judged validity 
of self-reports. 


3.3.6.1. Mood scales. 


Changes in mood and emotionality can be consequences of 
neurotoxicity. For example, case reports have identified mood changes from exposure to 
mercury, lead, solvents, and organophosphate insecticides. The Taylor Manifest Anxiety 
Scale and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) are standardized self-report assessment 
instruments for which there is some evidence of sensitivity to chemical insult. 
The POMS, a component of the Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery, is a self-report 
measure that asks respondents to use a 5-point scale to rate the magnitude of 65 subjective 
states, such as ``tense,'' ``relaxed,'' ``hopeless,'' ``guilty,'' etc., that they have experienced 
within the past week. The responses are scored according to six mood factors, and a Total 
Mood Disturbance Score also may be calculated. Liang et al. (1990) used the POMS to 
evaluate lead-exposed workers (mean blood lead concentration of 41 

m

g/dL) from a battery 
plant and a control group from a fabric-weaving manufacturer. Exposed workers were 
significantly higher on tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion scales. 
Mood scales were developed to aid in assessment of psychological disorders, such as 
depression, and to track treatment response. In addition, mood is modulated by metabolic 
and endocrine variables in health and disease and can change rapidly in response to 
interpersonal, workplace, and environmental events. The large number of nonchemical 
variables and the lability of mood make inclusion of carefully selected controls essential in 
using affect as an endpoint in neurotoxicity research. 
The validity of mood scales may be limited to the specific populations in which the 
validity studies were performed. As characterizations of internal states, the meaning of the 
descriptors in the POMS established for one culture may not be the same as the meaning of 
that concept or term in other cultures or in other language systems. There may be variations 
in interpretation of the terms by respondents across English-speaking subcultures, perhaps as 
a function of education or the size of the verbal community. While these differences may 
not impede a global clinical interpretation, the reduction in generalizability across study 
populations may be sufficient to decrease the usefulness of subjective scales in quantitative 
neurotoxicity risk assessment. 


3.3.6.2. Personality scales. 


The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the 
Cattell 16 PF, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory have occasionally been used in 
neurotoxicity research. Exposed and nonexposed groups have differed on several scales 
derived from these standardized questionnaires. The diagnostic power of the MMPI, for 
example, is not in the individual scales but in the pattern of scores on the 10 clinical and 3 
validity scales. Because interpretation of the MMPI requires a trained diagnostician with 
experience in the population of interest, it is less likely to be useful in quantitative 
neurotoxicity assessment.

3.4.1. Epidemiologic Studies 


Epidemiology has been defined as ``the study of the distributions and determinants of 
disease and injuries in human populations'' (Mausner and Kramer, 1985). Knowing the 
frequency of illness in groups and the factors that influence the distribution is the tool of 
epidemiology that allows the evaluation of causal inference with the goal of prevention and 
cure of disease. Epidemiologic studies are a means of evaluating the effects of neurotoxic 
substances in human populations, but such studies are limited because they must be 
performed shortly after exposure if the effect is acute. Most often these effects are suspected 
to be a result of occupational exposures due to the increased opportunity for exposure to 
industrial and other chemicals. 


3.4.1.1. Case reports. 


The first type of human study undertaken is the case report or case 
series, which can identify cases of a disease and are reported by clinicians or discerned 
through active or passive surveillance, usually in the workplace. For example, the 
neurological hazards of exposure to Kepone, dimethylaminopropionitrile, and methyl-n-butyl 
ketone were first reported as case studies by physicians who noted an unusual cluster of 
diseases in persons later found to have been exposed to these chemicals (Cone et al., 1987). 
However, case histories where exposure involved a single neurotoxic agent, though 
informative, are rare in the literature; for example, farmers are exposed to a wide variety of 
potentially neurotoxic pesticides. Careful case histories assist in identifying common risk 
factors, especially when the association between the exposure and disease is strong, the mode 
of action of the agent is biologically plausible, and clusters occur in a limited period of time. 
Case reports are inexpensive compared with other types of epidemiologic studies and 
can be obtained more quickly than more complex studies. They provide little information 
about disease frequency or population at risk, but their importance has been clearly 
demonstrated, particularly in accidental poisoning or acute exposure to high levels of 
toxicant. They remain an important source of index cases of new diseases and for 
surveillance in occupational settings. These studies require confirmation by additional 
epidemiologic research employing other study design. 


3.4.1.2. Cross-sectional studies. 


In cross-sectional studies or surveys, both the disease and 
suspected risk factors are ascertained at the same time and the findings are useful in 
generating hypotheses. A group of people is interviewed, examined, and tested at a single 
point in time to ascertain a relationship between a disease and a neurotoxic exposure. This 
study design does not allow the investigator to determine whether the disease or the exposure 
came first, rendering it less useful in estimating risk. These studies are intermediate in cost 
and time required to complete compared with case reports and more complex analytical 
studies. 


3.4.1.3. Case-control (retrospective) studies. 


Last (1986) defines a case-control study as 
one that ``starts with the identification of persons with the disease (or other outcome variable) 
of interest, and a suitable control population (comparison, reference) group of persons 
without the disease.'' He states that the relationship of an ``attribute'' to the disease is 
measured by comparing the diseased with the nondiseased with regard to how frequently the 
attribute is present in each of the groups. The cases are assembled from a population of 
persons with and without exposure and the comparison group is selected from the same 
population; the relative distribution of the potential risk factor (exposure) in both groups is 
evaluated by computing an odds ratio that serves as an estimate of the strength of the 
association between the disease and the potential risk factor. The statistical significance of 
the ratio is determined by calculating a p-value and is used to approximate relative risk. 
The case-control approach to the study of potential neurotoxins in the environment has 
provided a great deal of information. In his recent text, Valciukas (1991) notes that the 
case-control approach is the strategy of choice when no other environmental or biological 
indicator of neurotoxic exposure is available. He further states: ``Considering the fact that 
for the vast majority of neurotoxic chemical compounds, no objective biological indicators of 
exposure are available (or if they are, their half-life is too short to be of any practical value), 
the case-control paradigm is a widely accepted strategy for the assessment of toxic 
causation.'' The case-control study design, however, can be very susceptible to bias. The 
potential sources of bias are numerous and can be specific to a particular study, and will be 
discussed only briefly here. Many of these biases also can be present in cross-sectional 
studies. For example, recall bias or faulty recall of information by study subjects in a 
questionnaire-based study can distort the results of the study. Analysis of the 
case-comparison study design assumes that the selected cases are representative persons with 
the disease_either all cases with the disease or a representative sample of them have been 
ascertained. It further assumes that the control or comparison group is representative of the 
nondiseased population (or that the prevalence of the characteristic under study is the same in 
the control group as in general population). Failure to satisfy these assumptions may result 
in selection bias, but violation of assumptions does not necessarily invalidate the study 
results. 
An additional source of bias in case-control studies is the presence of confounding 
variables, i.e., factors known to be associated with the exposure and causally related to the 
disease under study. These must be controlled either in the design of the study by matching 
cases to controls on the basis of the confounding factor or in the analysis of the data by using 
statistical techniques such as stratification or regression. Matching requires time to identify 
an adequate number of potential controls to distinguish those with the proper characteristics, 
while statistical control of confounding requires a larger study. 
The definition of exposure is critical in epidemiologic studies. In occupational 
settings, exposure assessment is based on the job assignment of the study subjects, but can be 
more precise if detailed company records allow the development of exposure profiles.

3.4.1.4. Prospective (cohort, followup) studies.



In a prospective study design, a healthy 
group of people is assembled and followed forward in time and observed for the development 
of disease. Such studies are invaluable for determining the time course for development of 
disease (e.g., followup studies performed in various cities on the effects of lead on child 
development). This approach allows the direct estimate of risks attributed to a particular 
exposure since disease incidence rates in the cohort are determined and allows the study of 
chronic effects of exposure. One major strength of the cohort design is that it allows the 
calculation of rates to determine the excess risk associated with an exposure. Also, biases 
are reduced by obtaining information before the disease develops. This approach, however, 
can be very time-consuming and costly. 

In cohort studies information bias can be introduced when individuals provide 
distorted information about their health because they know their exposure status and may 
have been told of the expected health effects of the exposure under study. 

A special type of cohort study is the retrospective cohort study in which the 
investigator goes back in time to select the study groups and traces them over time, often to 
the present. The studies usually involve specially exposed groups and have provided much 
assistance in estimating risks due to occupational exposures. Occupational retrospective 
cohort studies rely on company records of past and current employees that include 
information on the dates of employment, age at employment, date of departure, and whether 
diseased (or dead in the case of mortality studies). Workers can then be classified by 
duration and degree of exposure. A retrospective cohort study was performed in which a 
cohort of 1,790 bricklayers and 2,601 men exposed to paint solvents was retrospectively 
identified and, if a disability pension had been awarded, the subjects were examined for 
evidence of presenile dementia. This study found a rate ratio of 3.4 for presenile dementia 
among the painters as compared with the bricklayers (Johnson, 1987). 



3.4.2. Human Laboratory Exposure Studies 



Neurotoxicity assessment has an advantage not afforded the evaluation of other toxic 
endpoints, such as cancer or reproductive toxicity, in that the effects of some chemicals are 
short in duration and reversible. Under certain circumstances, it is ethically possible to 
perform human laboratory exposure studies and obtain data relevant to the risk assessment 
process. Information from experimental human exposure studies has been used to set 
occupational exposure limits, mostly for organic solvents that can be inhaled. 

Laboratory exposure studies have contributed to risk assessment and the setting of 
exposure limits for several solvents and other chemicals with acute reversible effects. These 
chemicals include methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and p-xylene 
(Dick and Johnson, 1986). 

Human exposure studies offer advantages over epidemiologic field studies. Combined 
with appropriate biological sampling (breath or blood), it is possible to calculate body 
concentrations, to examine toxicokinetics, and identify metabolites. Bioavailability, 
elimination, dose-related changes in metabolic pathways, individual variability, time course 
of effects, interactions between chemicals, interactions between chemical and 
environmental/biobehavioral factors (stressors, workload/respiratory rate) are some processes 
that can be evaluated in laboratory studies. 

Other goals of laboratory studies include the indepth characterization of effects, the 
development of new assessment methods, and the examination of the sensitivity, specificity, 
and reliability of neurobehavioral assessment methods across chemical classes. 

The laboratory is the most appropriate setting for the study of environmental and 
biobehavioral variables that affect the action of chemical agents. The effects of ambient 
temperature, task difficulty, the rate of ongoing behavior, conditioning variables, 
tolerance/sensitization, sleep deprivation, motivation, etc., can be studied.

3.4.2.1. Methodologic aspects.



From a methodologic standpoint, human laboratory studies 
can be divided into two categories_between-subjects and within-subjects designs. In the 
former, the neurobehavioral performance of exposed volunteers is compared with that of 
nonexposed participants. In the latter, preexposure performance is compared with 
neurobehavioral function under the influence of the chemical or drug. Within-subjects 
designs have the advantage of requiring fewer participants, eliminating individual differences 
as a source of variability, and controlling for chronic mediating variables, such as caffeine 
use and educational achievement. A disadvantage of the within-subjects design is that 
neurobehavioral tests must be administered more than once. Practice on many 
neurobehavioral tests often leads to improved performance that may confound the effect of 
the chemical/drug. It is important to allow a sufficient number of test sessions in the 
preexposure phase of the study to allow performance on all tests to achieve a relatively stable 
baseline level. 



3.4.2.2. Human subject selection factors.



Participants in laboratory exposure studies may 
be recruited from populations of persons already exposed to the chemical/drug or from naive 
populations. Although the use of exposed volunteers has ethical advantages, can militate 
against novelty effects, and allows evaluation of tolerance/sensitization, finding an accessible 
exposed population in reasonable proximity to the laboratory is difficult. Naive participants 
are more easily recruited, but may differ significantly in important characteristics from a 
representative sample of exposed persons. Naive volunteers are often younger, healthier, 
and better educated than the populations exposed environmentally, in the workplace, or 
pharmacotherapeutically. For example, phase I drug trial data from relatively young and 
healthy volunteers may not adequately predict the incidence of neurotoxic side effects in 
older persons with chronic health problems. 



3.4.2.3. Exposure conditions and chemical classes.



Compared with workplace and 
environmental exposures, laboratory exposure conditions can be controlled more precisely, 
but exposure periods are much shorter. Generally only one or two relatively pure chemicals 
are studied for several hours while the population of interest may be exposed to multiple 
chemicals containing impurities for months or years. Laboratory studies are therefore better 
at identifying and characterizing effects with acute onset and the selective effects of pure 
agents. 

Most laboratory studies of neurobehavioral function have employed individual 
solvents, combinations of two solvents, or very low concentrations of chemicals released 
from household and office materials (volatile organic compounds). This selection is 
primarily because solvent effects are reversible, because there are wide margins of safety for 
acute effects of solvents, because solvents can be administered via inhalation methods that 
allow calculation of body concentrations by breath sampling methods that do not require 
needle sticks, because over 1 million workers may have occupational solvent exposure, and 
because of the extensive use of solvents in household products. Chemicals studied in the 
laboratory over the past 40 years have included ozone, NO

2

, CO, styrene, lead, anesthetic 
gases, pesticides, irritants, chlorofluorocarbon compounds, and propylene glycol dinitrite. 
Caffeine, diazepam, and ethanol have been used in laboratory studies as positive control 
substances. 



3.4.2.4. Test methods.



Neurobehavioral test methods may be selected according to several 
strategies. A test battery that examines multiple neurobehavioral functions may be more 
useful for screening and the initial characterization of acute effects. Selected neurobehavioral 
tests that measure a more limited number of functions in multiple ways may be more useful 
for elucidating mechanisms or validating specific effects. 



3.4.2.5. Controls.



Both chemical and behavioral control procedures are valuable for 
examining the specificity of the effects. A concordant effect among different measures of the 
same neurobehavioral function (e.g., reaction time) and a lack of effect on some other 
measures of psychomotor function (e.g., untimed manual dexterity) would increase the 
confidence in a selective effect on motor speed and not on attention or on nonspecific motor 
function. Likewise, finding concordant effects among similar chemical or drug classes along 
with different effects from dissimilar classes would support the specificity of chemical effect. 
For example, finding that the effects of a solvent were similar to those of ethanol but not 
caffeine would support the specificity of solvent effects on a given measure of neurotoxicity. 



3.4.2.6. Ethical issues.



Most human exposure studies in the laboratory have been justified 
on the basis of data indicating that the chemical or drug exposure produces only temporary 
and reversible functional effects. The use of occupationally, environmentally, or 
therapeutically exposed populations as a source of participants also makes the risks from 
research exposure small relative to nonlaboratory sources of risk. Protection of human 
subjects is also provided by the informed consent process; the health risks (known and 
unknown) and benefits of the research are thoroughly explained to each participant, who may 
terminate participation in the study at any time. 

Despite safeguards, several chemicals and drugs thought at the time of the exposure 
study to produce only temporary neurobehavioral effects are now (20 years later) suspected 
of being potential human carcinogens on the basis of animal and human data (e.g., methylene 
chloride, perchloroethylene). Other chemicals, however, are now thought to be less 
carcinogenic or otherwise less toxic in humans than once believed. Rapid advances in all 
areas of toxicology make it difficult to communicate, to potential subjects, reliable 
information about the likelihood of long-term, latent, or delayed adverse effects on health 
subsequent to the study. The communication of uncertainty about potential long-term effects 
to research participants is essential if human exposure studies are to be conducted ethically 
and are to continue their contributions to neurotoxicology and risk assessment. 



3.5. Assessment of Developmental Neurotoxicity 



3.5.1. Developmental Deficits 



While adult neurotoxicology evaluates the effects of chemical exposure on relatively 
stable nervous system structure and function, developmental neurotoxicology addresses the 
special vulnerabilities of the young and the old. Neurobehavioral assessment of chemical 
neurotoxicity is complicated by having to measure functional impairment within a sequential 
progression of emergence, maturation, and gradual decline of nervous system capabilities. 
Methods in developmental neurotoxicity assessment must reflect the diversity of 
neurobehavioral functions, from neonates to the elderly. 

Exposure of pregnant women to alcohol, drugs of abuse, therapeutic drugs, nicotine, 
and environmental chemicals may result in the immediate or delayed appearance of 
neurobehavioral impairment in children (Kimmel, 1988; Nelson, 1991a). Postnatal exposure 
of children to chemical agents in the environment, such as lead, also may impair IQ and 
other indices of neurobehavioral function (Needleman et al., 1979). Neurotoxic effects may 
impair speech and language, attention, general intelligence, ``state'' regulation and 
responsiveness to external stimulation, learning and memory, sensory and motor skills, 
visuospatial processing, affect and temperament, and responsiveness to nonverbal social 
stimuli. Chemical neurotoxicity may be manifested as decreases in functional capabilities or 
delays in normative developmental progression. 

Neurotoxic effects are not limited to direct exposure of the fetus or child to the 
chemical. Animal studies suggest that altered neurobehavioral development in offspring may 
result from exposure of males (Joffe and Soyka, 1981) and females to chemical substances 
prior to conception. In this case, altered postnatal development may reflect chemical 
influences on mechanisms of inheritance, copulatory behavior, nutritional status, hormonal 
status, or the uterine environment. In animals and humans, chemical exposure of parents 
may indirectly impair postnatal development through changes in milk composition, parenting 
behaviors, and other aspects of the environment.

In older adults the normal aging process alters the response to neurotoxicants. Both 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes may underlie altered sensitivities to the 
neurotoxic effects of drugs and chemicals. An example well known in geriatric medicine is 
the apparent increase in sensitivity of the elderly to the toxic effects of anxiolytics (Salzman, 
1981). Decreases in biotransformation rate and renal elimination of parent drug and active 
metabolites, not related to disease processes, may partially account for the increased 
vulnerability (Friedel, 1978). Chronic disease states in older persons may result in decreased 
functional capabilities and increased vulnerability to neurotoxic effects. Chronic diseases 
also may prompt pharmacotherapy that may impair neurobehavioral function. 
Cardiovascular, psychopharmacologic, and antineoplastic medications may result in patterns 
of neurobehavioral impairment not typically seen in younger individuals.

 


3.5.2. Methodologic Considerations 



Standardized methods are being developed for pediatric neurotoxicity assessment. 
Neurobehavioral functions emerge during developmental phases from neonatal stage through 
secondary school, and nervous system insult may be reflected not only in impairment of 
emergent functions, but also as delays in the appearance of new functions. Both the severity 
and type of deficit are affected by the dose and duration of exposure (Nelson, 1991b), and 
different sensitivities to chemical effects may be exhibited at different stages of nervous 
system development. Early episodes of exposure may produce structural damage to the 
nervous system that may not be developmentally expressed in behavior for several months or 
years. 

The selection of appropriate testing methods and conditions is more important when 
assessing children because of shorter attention spans and increased dependence on parental 
and environmental supports. In addition, because of the increasing complexity of functional 
capabilities during early development, only a few tests appropriate for infants can be validly 
readministered to older children. Given the complexity of these variables, the task of 
devising sensitive, reliable, and valid assessment instruments or batteries for pediatric 
populations will be challenging. 

Assessment methods in older adults must be capable of distinguishing chemical and 
drug effects from the effects of aging processes and chronic disease states (Crook et al., 
1983). Assessment methods must be valid and reliable with repeated administration across a 
significant portion of the lifespan, and take into consideration the time (days, months, or 
years) that may intervene between exposure/insult and the expression of neurotoxicity as 
functional impairment. Research on nonexposed populations to develop age-appropriate 
normative scores for neurobehavioral functions will be important for the interpretation of 
assessment instruments. 

Environmental exposure to neurotoxic chemicals and drugs is correlated with 
socioeconomic and ethnic status. Assessment methods will therefore have to be adapted to 
diverse ethnic, cultural, and language groups. While gender differences in early 
development have been noted, differential responses of males and females to neurotoxicants 
have been less well explored and should receive attention. 



3.6. Issues in Human Neurotoxicology Test Methods 



3.6.1. Risk Assessment Criteria for Neurobehavioral Test Methods 



The value of human neurobehavioral test methods for quantitative risk assessment is 
related to the number of the following criteria that can be met: 

a. Demonstrate sensitivity to the kinds of neurobehavioral impairment produced by 
chemicals; that is, able to detect a difference between exposed and nonexposed populations in 
field studies or between exposure and nonexposure periods in human laboratory research or 
within exposed populations over time. 

b. Show specificity for neurotoxic chemical effects and not be unduly responsive to a 
host of other nonchemical factors, and show specificity for the neurobehavioral function 
believed to be measured by the test method. 
c. Demonstrate adequate reliability (consistency of measurement over time) and 
validity (concordance with other behavioral, physiologic, biochemical, or anatomic measures 
of neurotoxicity). 
d. Show graded amounts of neurobehavioral change as a function of exposure 
parameter, absorbed dose, or body burden along some ordinal or continuous metric (dose 
response). 
e. For representative classes or subclasses of CNS/PNS-active chemicals, identify 
single effects or patterns of impairment across several tests or functional domains that are 
reasonably consistent from study to study (structure-activity). 
f. Be amenable to the development of a procedurally similar counterpart that can be 
used to assess homologous behaviors in animals.

<TEXT>
 

g. Whenever it is relevant, care must be taken to insure to the extent possible that 
subjects are blind to the variate of interest (Benignus, 1993). 



3.6.1.1. Sensitivity. 



Individual neurobehavioral tests and test batteries have detected 
differences between exposed and nonexposed populations in epidemiologic studies and in 
laboratory studies. Effects have been detected by neurobehavioral methods at concentrations 
thought by other kinds of evaluation not to produce neurotoxicity. Workplace exposure 
limits to many chemicals have been set on the basis of neurobehavioral studies. While the 
overall sensitivity of neurobehavioral methods is sufficient to be useful in neurotoxicology 
risk assessment, some methods are notably insensitive across several chemical classes while 
the sensitivity of other neurobehavioral tests varies according to the spectrum of neurotoxic 
effects of the chemical or drug. 

Sensitivity is sometimes negatively correlated with reliability; selecting for tests that 
show little change over time may also select for tests that are not sensitive to neurotoxic 
insult. 

Having more control over the testing environment and using a repeated measures 
design may decrease variability and increase statistical power, but these tactics may introduce 
other problems. There is some suggestion that experience in highly structured laboratory 
environments with explicit stimulus conditions may reduce the sensitivity of humans and 
animals to the effects of drugs and chemicals, and the sensitivity of neurobehavioral 
measures to impairment by a chemical or drug may depend on neurobehavioral training 
history (Terrace, 1963; Brady and Barrett, 1986). Sensitivity may also be decreased if 
baseline behaviors are stable and well practiced or an escape/avoidance procedure is 
employed. 

The systematic introduction of stimulus or response changes to induce transitional 
behaviors, such as in a transitional state or repeated learning paradigms, may be one way to 
retain the advantage of a stable baseline, have sufficient sensitivity, and avoid practice effects 
(Anger and Setzer, 1979). 



3.6.1.2. Specificity. 



There are two kinds of specificity in neurobehavioral assessment of 
chemical or drug neurotoxicity. Chemical specificity refers to the ability of a test to reflect 
chemical or drug effects and to be relatively resistant to the influence of nonchemical 
variables. The second type of specificity refers to the ability of a test method to measure 
changes in a single neurobehavioral function (e.g., dexterity) or a restricted number of 
functions, rather than a broad range of functions (attention, reasoning, dexterity, and vision). 

The neurobehavioral expression of neurotoxic chemical or drug effects is a function of 
the joint interaction of ongoing nervous system processes with the chemical substance and 
with biopsychosocial variables that also influence nervous system activity. In laboratory 
exposure studies numerous environmental, behavioral, and biologic variables can influence 
the type or magnitude of neurotoxic effects of chemical agents and drugs (MacPhail, 1990). 
These variables include ambient temperature, physical workload, task difficulty, the social 
and tangible reward characteristics of the laboratory setting, redundancy of stimuli, the rate 
and form of the behavioral response, conditioning factors, and the interoceptive stimulus 
properties of the chemicals. 

The laboratory research participant's history and habits outside the laboratory also 
may affect chemical-neurobehavioral interactions by influencing the baseline level of 
performance on neurobehavioral tests or directly affecting the response of the CNS to the 
exposure. Age, gender, educational level, intellectual functioning, economic status, acute 
and chronic health conditions (including developmental or current neurologic conditions), 
alcohol/drug/tobacco effects or withdrawal, emotional status or significant life events, sleep 
deprivation, fatigue, and cultural factors are only a few of the variables that may affect 
performance in laboratory studies (Williamson, 1991; Cassitto et al., 1990). 

The influence of these selection and biopsychosocial variables on the neurobehavioral 
effects of workplace chemicals is poorly understood, although their effects on drug-behavior 
interactions have been more thoroughly explored. Controlling or understanding chemical and 
nonchemical variables will be important for ensuring adequate specificity for risk assessment 
purposes. 



3.6.1.3. Reliability and validity. 



Reliability refers to the ability of a given test to produce 
closely similar results when administered more than once over a period of time or in similar 
populations. Reliability is meaningful only with respect to the measurement of functions that 
would not be expected to change significantly over the time period. Test-retest reliability 
coefficients are between 0.6 and 0.9 (Beaumont, 1990) for most of the tests in the NCTB. 
With notable exceptions, other neurobehavioral tests have similar reliabilities. Reliabilities in 
the 0.8 to 0.9 range are usually thought acceptable. As reliability decreases, measurement 
error is more likely to mask neurotoxic chemical effects.

<TEXT>
 

The validity of a given neurotoxicity test relies on evidence that it adequately 
measures the domain of interest and is not highly correlated with tests that are believed to 
measure unrelated functions. These convergent and divergent aspects of validity are 
frequently divided into construct, content, and criterion subcategories. Construct validity 
refers to the ability of a given test to measure the intended function or construct (e.g., 
attention), content to how well the test measures the major aspects of the function, and 
criterion to how highly the test correlates with other tests of the same function or predicts 
neurotoxic impairment after similar insult. 
Many neurobehavioral tests purport to measure the same or similar cognitive, 
sensory, or motor functions, but correlations between these tests under chemical exposure or 
control conditions can be disappointingly low. This is not surprising given the procedural 
differences that exist among neurobehavioral tests. Tests intended to measure the same 
function often have different presentation and response modalities (visual, verbal, manual), 
have differing numbers of trials or a different time limit, and have different methods for 
scoring the results. Many tests have such large procedural differences that direct comparison 
is difficult. Assessment of validity for neurobehavioral tests of specific constructs, such as 
attention, is further complicated in that sensory input, other cognitive processes, and motor 
responses are unavoidable contributors to the test result. 


3.6.1.4. Dose response. 


Dose in this discussion refers to the measurement of chemical or 
metabolite concentrations in the body and to estimations of exposure. Both exposure 
assessment and biologic concentrations should be measured whenever possible. 
Dose-response relationships have been observed both in field and laboratory studies. Two 
recent human solvent exposure studies used lower exposure concentration that resulted in 
mucosal membrane effects reported by subjects as odors or irritation (Dick et al., 1992; 
Hjelm et al., 1990). Neurobehavioral impairment was not detected in these studies. A 
review of over 50 organic solvent human exposure experiments found that neurobehavioral 
impairment generally occurred at mean concentrations higher than those associated with 
irritation, although there was often overlap among the irritant and impairment concentration 
ranges (Dick, 1988). Defining neurotoxic dose-response relationships in humans decreases 
the uncertainties of extrapolation from animal data and allows a more accurate risk 
assessment. 
Recent human solvent exposure studies have employed low concentrations under 
which neurobehavioral impairment was not observed. Rather, these studies have primarily 
detected the effects of solvents on mucosal membranes reported by subjects as odors or 
irritation (Dick, unpublished observation). While these data may be relevant to setting 
workplace and environmental exposure limits, they can be expected to provide little 
information about the neurobehavioral impairment that occurs at higher concentrations. The 
relationship between irritant/odor concentration-effect functions and neurobehavioral 
impairment concentration-effect functions is not known, but it is probably not linear. 
Dose-dependent mechanisms of toxic effect can be expected to complicate risk extrapolation 
across the dose-response range in humans. 
A further complication in dose-response extrapolation is that low concentrations of 
chemicals may appear to improve performance as measured by neurobehavioral tests, while 
higher doses are more likely to impair performance. Improved performance does not 
necessarily indicate the absence of neurotoxicity; both increases and decreases in 
neurobehavioral performance may result from deleterious chemical interactions with neurons. 
Dose-response extrapolation is further complicated by the observation that facilitative or 
impairment effects within a given dosage range may occur at some parameters of the test 
stimulus or aspects of the response (response rate-dependent) but not at others (Altmann et 
al., 1991). Therefore, dose extrapolations are more difficult when there is uncertainty about 
the shape of the dose-response function (biphasic, linear, etc.) at the relevant test stimulus 
and response parameters. 
The risk assessment process with animal data involves extrapolation from the effects 
of high doses in animals to predict the effects of chronic low-dose exposure in humans. 
With data from laboratory studies of humans in a risk assessment, however, the extrapolation 
is in the other direction, from very low-dose laboratory exposure to predict the effects of 
chronic exposure at higher (but still low) concentrations in the environment and workplace. 
Low- to high-dose extrapolation within the same species may require different assumptions 
and risk assessment procedures. Although high-dose human exposures have occurred in 
accidents, those data are primarily descriptive in nature and cannot easily be plugged into a 
quantitative risk extrapolation process. Low dose laboratory data may be combined with data 
from epidemiologic studies of persons exposed to higher concentrations. 


3.6.1.5. Structure-activity. 


Structure-activity relationships for well-known chemicals have 
largely been established by clinical methods (and animal studies) and verified by 
neurobehavioral and neurophysiologic testing. Although an area of active research, 
neurobehavioral testing of humans has not yet been able to identify reliable patterns of 
impairment among chemical classes. This endeavor has been hampered by most laboratory 
research having been limited to the evaluation of low concentrations of solvents and a few 
other reversible toxicants and by the exposure uncertainties, biases, and confounding 
variables found in cross-sectional or cohort field studies. 


3.6.2. Other Considerations in Risk Assessment 
3.6.2.1. Mechanisms of action 



Uncovering behavioral and neurophysiologic mechanisms 
of action is a potential contribution of human laboratory exposure studies to neurotoxicity 
risk assessment. For example, Stewart et al. (1972) demonstrated that methylene chloride 
was metabolized to carbon monoxide in humans, and further studies (Putz et al., 1979) found 
that CO production could account for some of the neurobehavioral impairment observed with 
that chemical. Recent human laboratory studies of solvents employed low concentrations that 
produced mucosal irritation and strong odor, but little neurobehavioral impairment (Dick, 
unpublished observation). The mechanisms of action that produce mucosal irritation and the 
neurotoxic mechanisms that are expressed in neurobehavioral impairment may be quite 
different. Data on mucosal irritation and odor may therefore provide limited information for 
a neurotoxicity risk assessment. 


3.6.2.2. Exposure duration 

A criticism of extrapolation from animal studies to human 
exposure conditions is that the effects of short-term exposure (months to 1-2 years) in 
animals may not accurately predict the effects of chronic exposure (

>

10 years) in humans. 
Laboratory studies rarely expose human subjects to solvents for more than 4-6 hours per day 
for 2-5 days while environmental and workplace exposures of concern involve 6-8 hours of 
exposure per day for years. The uncertainties of extrapolating from relatively acute 
exposures to predict the risks from chronic exposure will not be eliminated by using human 
laboratory exposure data in risk assessment. 


3.6.2.3. Time-dependent effects 

The acute exposures that are possible in human laboratory 
studies may provide little information on chronic time-dependent neurobehavioral effects. 
The effects of initial exposure may remain the same, decrease (tolerance), or increase 
(sensitization) with continued or repeated exposure to the chemical. All effects will not 
change in unison; tolerance and sensitization may be observed simultaneously on different 
measures of neurobehavioral function. The multiple toxicodynamic effects of chemical 
exposure (neurobehavioral and other) seem to follow individual time courses suggestive of 
multiple mechanisms of action. In addition, the processes of tolerance and sensitization can 
be influenced by testing conditions and the nature of the behavioral task. 
One also must be concerned about latent effects that do not appear for some time after 
a brief exposure and ``silent'' cumulative neurotoxic effects that are not observable in acute 
human studies. Latent and silent effects not only bring up the possibility of unknown risks 
for human subjects, but also make more difficult the extrapolation of chronic neurotoxic risks 
on the basis of acute exposures.

<TEXT>
 

Therefore, the acute exposure conditions possible in human laboratory studies may 
provide us with very limited information about the long-term effects of chronic exposure. 


3.6.2.4. Multiple exposures 

In the environment and the workplace, persons are seldom 
exposed to only a single chemical. Rather, they are most often exposed to complex mixtures 
of chemicals, the relative concentrations of which may vary over time. For example, one 
farmer had more than 50 different chemical products (pesticides, herbicides, solvents, metals, 
gases) with nervous system effects that he used, prepared, or stored in his work shed. 
Chemicals used in industrial processes may also contain impurities or contaminants that may 
produce neurotoxic effects or alter the neurotoxicity of the more abundant chemical species. 
Chemical mixtures may have additive or potentiating effects not predictable from studies of 
single chemicals (Strong and Garruto, 1991). Human laboratory exposure studies 
traditionally have employed one highly purified chemical or combinations of two chemicals 
(usually solvents) and thus may produce a spectrum of neurotoxic effects different from 
environmental and occupational exposures. 
Recently volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been used in human exposure 
studies (Otto and Hudnell, 1991). VOCs consist of multiple volatile compounds administered 
at concentrations commonly found in indoor air from emissions by laminates, carpet, 
plastics, and other building and decorating materials. Although VOCs are thought to produce 
primarily mucosal irritation and odors, reports of ``sick building syndrome'' and individual 
sensitivity to indoor air contaminants suggest that other neurobehavioral mechanisms also 
may be operating.
 


3.6.2.5. Generalizability and individual differences 

The results of field studies and 
laboratory exposure studies are most valuable when they can be extrapolated to the general 
population. Studies conducted in male workers or in young, healthy volunteers may have 
limited applicability to women or to people in other age ranges. It therefore is important to 
conduct studies that include males and females of different ages and ethnic heritage. 
Culture-sensitive neurobehavioral test methods are being developed and validated in the 
United States and other countries. 

While it is important to increase the generalizability of results, it is equally important 
to know when results cannot be generalized. Studies should be specifically directed toward 
identifying subsets of individuals who are more or less sensitive to neurotoxic insult or differ 
in mode of expression. There are many examples of individual differences that alter 
response to chemicals and drugs: phenylketonurics are more sensitive to dietary tyramine 
and persons with variants of plasma pseudocholinesterase are more affected by some 
neuromuscular blocking agents. 


3.6.2.6. Veracity of neurobehavioral test results 

In most epidemiologic and human 
laboratory studies, research volunteers are highly motivated to perform well on tests of 
neurobehavioral function. Under voluntary conditions, actual neurobehavioral performance 
may serve as a reasonable index of nervous system capabilities. Some studies, however, are 
conducted in response to complaints of symptoms thought to be related to workplace, 
environmental, or therapeutic exposure to chemicals and drugs. The performance of research 
participants with symptoms and complaints may be significantly affected (consciously or 
unconsciously) by monetary rewards, emotional relief, or social gains from the validation of 
their complaints. Under these conditions, performance may or may not accurately reflect the 
capabilities of the nervous system and may lead to inaccurate conclusions about the 
magnitude of nervous system dysfunction or about putative chemical or drug etiologies. 
In addition to suboptimal performance engendered by potential reinforcers or rewards, 
research participants involved in disputes over suspected neurotoxic exposures or in litigation 
for monetary damages are likely to be experiencing significant emotional and behavioral 
reactions from situational sources that can alter the outcome of neurobehavioral assessment. 
Anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, worry, obsessive thoughts, and 
distractibility may contribute to less than optimal performance on motor and cognitive 
neurobehavioral tasks, especially where speed and sustained concentration are important. 
Under stressful conditions, it may be extremely difficult to differentiate between neurotoxic 
and situational sources of observed functional impairment. Functional neurobehavioral tests 
are not well equipped to distinguish between impairment from neurotoxicity and from 
nonchemical variables. The use of functional tests in symptomatic populations requires great 
care in interpretation. The development of validity scales and other control procedures for 
assessing nonchemical influences on performance is greatly needed. 


3.6.3. Cross-Species Extrapolation 


Many neurobehavioral tests were developed according to constructs of human 
cognitive processes. The diverse measures of cognitive, sensory, and motor performance in 
humans are therefore not easily compared with neurobehavioral function in animals. While it 
may be possible to conceptually relate some animal and human neurobehavioral tests (e.g., 
grip strength or signal detection), many procedural differences prevent direct comparison 
between species. 
A more direct extrapolation from animals to man might be possible if the tests were 
chosen on the basis of procedural similarity rather than on a conceptual basis (Anger, 1991). 
Stebbins and colleagues (1975) were successful in developing homologous procedures in 
nonhuman primates for the psychophysical evaluation of antibiotic ototoxicity. Efforts to 
develop comparable tests of memory and other neurobehavioral functions in animals and 
humans are under way (Stanton and Spear, 1990, Paule et al., 1990), and such efforts may 
aid in cross-species extrapolation. Other procedurally defined methods, such as Pavlovian 
conditioning (Solomon and Pendlebury, 1988), operant conditioning (Cory-Slechta, 1990), 
signal detection, and psychophysical scaling techniques (Stebbins and Coombs, 1975), could 
also be used to facilitate interspecies risk extrapolation. Deriving comparable 
neurobehavioral assessment methods in animals and humans that will allow a more 
straightforward extrapolation across species is of paramount importance for neurotoxicity risk 
assessment.

4. Methods to Assess Animal Neurotoxicity 





4.1. Introduction 



4.1.1. Role of Animal Models 



Determining the risk posed to human health from chemicals requires information about the potential toxicological
hazards and the expected levels of exposure. Some toxicological data can be derived directly from humans. Sources
of such information include accidental exposures to industrial chemicals, cases of food-related poisoning, epidemiological
studies, as well as clinical investigations. While human data are available from clinical trials for therapeutics
and they provide the most direct means of determining effects of potentially toxic substances, for other categories
of substances, it is generally difficult, expensive, and, in some cases, unethical to develop this type of information.
Quite often, the nature and extent of available human toxicological data are too incomplete to serve as the basis for
an adequate assessment of potential health hazards. Furthermore, for a majority of chemical substances human toxicological
data are simply not available. Consequently, for most toxicological assessments it is necessary to rely on information
derived from animal models, usually rats or mice. One of the primary functions of animal studies is to predict human
toxicity prior to human exposure. In some cases, species phylogenetically more similar to human, such as monkeys
or baboons, are used in neurotoxicological studies. 

Biologically, animals resemble humans in many ways and can serve as adequate models for toxicity studies (Russell,
1991). This is particularly true with regard to the assessment of adverse effects to the nervous system, whereby animal
models provide a variety of useful information that helps minimize exposure of humans to the risk of neurotoxicity.
There are many approaches to testing for neurotoxicity, including whole animal (in vivo) testing and tissue/cell
culture (in vitro) testing. 

At present, in vivo animal studies currently serve as the principal approach to detect and characterize neurotoxic
hazard and to help identify factors affecting susceptibility to neurotoxicity. Data from animal studies are used
to supplement or clarify limited information obtained from clinical or epidemiological studies in humans, as well
as provide specific types of information not readily obtainable from humans due to ethical considerations. Frequently,
results from animal studies are used to guide the design of toxicological studies in humans. 

In vitro tests have been proposed as a means of complementing whole animal tests, which could ultimately reduce the
number of animals used in routine toxicity testing. It also has been proposed that in vitro testing, when properly
developed, may be less time-consuming and more cost-effective than in vivo assessments (Goldberg and Frazier, 1989;
Atterwill and Walum, 1989). By understanding the biological structures or functions affected by toxic substances
in vitro, it also may be possible to predict neurotoxicological effects in the whole animal. An added advantage of
in vitro testing is the growing availability of human cell lines that could be used for directly assessing potential
neurotoxic effects on human tissue. The currently available strategies for in vitro testing have certain limitations,
including the inability to model neurobehavioral effects such as loss of memory or sensory dysfunction or to evaluate
effectively the influence of organ system interactions (e.g., neuronal, endocrinological, and immunological)
on the development and expression of neurotoxicity.

In using animal models to predict neurotoxic risk in humans, it is important to understand that the biochemical and
physiological mechanisms that underlie human biological processes, particularly those involving neurological
and psychological functions, are very complex and are sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to model exactly in
a lower species. While this caveat does not preclude extrapolating the results of animal studies to humans, it does
highlight the importance of using valid animal models in well-designed experimental studies. 



4.1.2. Validity of Animal Models 



Whether animal tests or methods actually measure what they are intended to measure, whether the data from such tests
can be obtained reliably, and whether such data can be logically extrapolated to humans are problems for most disciplines
in toxicology. Various proposals have been made for the standardization and validation of methods used in neurotoxicological
research. It is generally agreed that validation is an ongoing process that establishes the credibility of a test,
building an increasing level of confidence in the effective utility of any model of evaluation. The credibility of
a method, as it applies to testing, is usually discussed within several different contexts, including construct
validity, criterion validity, predictive validity, and detection accuracy. 

Construct validity concerns the ability of a method to measure selectively a particular biological function and
not other dimensions. Construct validity is frequently established empirically. For example, sensory dysfunction
such as hearing loss is reported by humans exposed to some chemicals, and tests are designed to detect and quantify
those changes. Such tests are designed to measure changes in auditory function, while other sensations are unaffected
(Tilson, 1987; Moser, 1990). 

Criterion validity refers to the ability of a method to measure a characteristic relative to some standard. For example,
Horvath and Frantik (1973) noted that the significance of a test measurement as an index of an actual treatment effect
should be validated relative to the effects of a defined reference substance or positive control. Furthermore, each
specific test or type of effect may require an appropriate reference substance for which the given type of effect is
a determining factor of the toxicity. Use of reference agents has obvious advantages in the assessment of unknown
chemicals. 

Predictive validity refers to the ability of a method to predict effects from an incomplete or partial data set. An
animal model of neurotoxicity with good predictive validity would reliably predict neurotoxicity in humans, i.e.,
the animal to human extrapolation would be good. There are several examples in neurotoxicology where animal models
have been developed based on neurotoxicological reports from humans. Presumably, the predictive validity of such
models would enable detecting similar kinds of effects produced by uncharacterized chemicals having a similar mechanism
of action. 

It has been proposed (Tilson and Cabe, 1978) that the most logical approach to validate animal methods in neurotoxicology
is to evaluate chemicals with and without known neurotoxicity in humans in tests designed for animals (predictive
validity). By using such an approach, it is possible to generate a profile of effects characteristic of each type of
neurotoxicant (criterion validity). This profile could then be used to assess the construct validity of various
tests. That is, procedures assumed to measure the same neurobiological dimension should show similar effects; measures
designed to detect changes in other functions should not be affected. This approach to test validation has been described
as the multitrait-multimethod process of validation (Campbell and Fiske, 1959). 

Of particular importance in establishing the credibility of a method is the accuracy of detecting a treatment-related
effect (Gad, 1989). Accuracy is a function of two interacting elements, specificity and sensitivity. Specificity
is the ability of a test to respond positively only when the toxic endpoint of interest is present. Sensitivity is the
ability to detect a change when present. This aspect depends on the inherent design of the procedure and experiment.
Increasing the specificity of a test may reduce the possibility of classifying a chemical as neurotoxic when, in fact,
it is not (false positive), but it may increase the probability of missing a true neurotoxicant (false negative).
Increasing sensitivity of a test may reduce the possibility of false negatives, but may increase the probability
of false positives. 



4.1.3. Special Considerations in Animal Models 

4.1.3.1. Susceptible populations. 



Like most other measures of toxicological effect, neurotoxic endpoints are subject to a number of experimental variables
that may affect susceptibility to the biological effects of toxicants. In this regard, genetic variation (Festing,
1991) is a particularly important issue in neurotoxicology. For example, most neurotoxicological assessments
are carried out with only one or two species. This may pose problems, however, since species may differ in sensitivity
to neurotoxicants. For example, nonhuman primates are more sensitive than rats (Boyce et al., 1984) or mice (Heikkila
et al., 1984) to the neurodegenerative effects of MPTP, a byproduct in the illicit synthesis of a meperidine analog
(Langston et al., 1983). In the assessment of delayed neuropathology produced by some cholinesterase inhibitors,
it is well known that hens are much more sensitive than rodents (Cavanagh, 1954; Abou-Donia, 1981, 1983). In addition,
rat strains also may be differentially sensitive to some neurotoxicants (Moser et al., 1991). Although it is preferred
that more than one species be tested, the cost required for routine multispecies testing must be considered. Whenever
possible, the choice of animal models should take into account differences in species with regard to pharmacodynamic,
genetic composition and sensitivity to neurotoxic agents. 

In addition to species, other factors such as gender of the test animal must be taken into consideration. Some toxic
substances may have a greater neurotoxicological effect in one gender (Squibb et al., 1981; Matthews et al., 1990).
Thus, screening evaluations frequently require both male and female animals. Another important variable is the
age of the animal (Veronesi et al., 1990). Whether a chemical produces neurotoxicity may depend on the maturational
stage of the organism (Rodier, 1986). Most preliminary assessments are designed to provide information on adults,
which have the greatest probability of being exposed. However, populations undergoing rapid maturation or aged
individuals may be especially vulnerable to neurotoxic agents. Longitudinal studies that assess both genders at
any stage of development address many of the problems associated with differentially sensitive populations.

4.1.3.2. Dosing scenario. 


The dosing strategy used in experimental studies is an important 
variable in the development and expression of neurotoxicity (WHO, 1986). Some 
neurotoxicants can produce neurotoxicity following a single exposure, while others require 
repeated dosing. Repeated dosing represents the typical pattern of human exposure to many 
chemical substances. Significant differences in response may occur when an acutely toxic 
quantity of material is administered over different exposure periods. For some 
neurotoxicants the onset of neurotoxicity can occur immediately after dosing, while others 
may require time after exposure for the toxicity to develop. Effects of repeated exposure 
may result in a progressive alteration in nervous system function or structure, while latent or 
residual effects may be discovered only in association with age-related changes or after 
suitable environmental or pharmacological challenge (Zenick, 1983; MacPhail et al., 1983). 
To ensure adequate assessment of neurotoxicity, study designs should include multiple dosing 
regimens, e.g., repeated exposure, with appropriate dose-to-response intervals of testing. 
Conduct of neurotoxicological evaluations in studies utilizing excessively toxic doses should 
be avoided. 


4.1.3.3. Other factors. 


There are a number of other factors that should be considered in the 
design and interpretation of studies using animal models (WHO, 1986). Design factors 
include such issues as using properly trained personnel to conduct the studies, the use of 
appropriate numbers of animals per group to achieve reliable statistical significance, and 
controlling the time-of-day variability. Time of testing relative to exposure is also important 
for assessing neurotoxic endpoints such as behavior, and experiments should be designed to 
generate a time course of effects, including recovery of function, if any. Housing is an 
important environmental design factor, because animals housed individually and animals 
housed in groups can respond differently to toxic agents. Temperature, as an experimental 
variable, may also affect the outcome of neurotoxicological studies. The responsiveness to 
some chemicals (e.g., triethyltin, methamphetamine) varies with ambient temperature (Dyer 
and Howell, 1982; Bowyer et al., 1992). Some neurobiological endpoints, such as sensory 
evoked potentials, can be influenced by the endogenous temperature of the animal (Dyer, 
1987). Therefore, changes in body temperature, whether due to fluctuations in ambient 
temperature or to some chemically induced effect such as inhibition of sweating, can 
confound the interpretation of measures such as evoked responses unless proper controls are 
included in the experimental design.
 
Because a variety of other physiological changes can influence neuronal functions, it 
is important to recognize that chemical-related neurotoxicity could result from treatment-induced physiological
changes, such as altered nutritional state (WHO, 1986). As part of a 
neurotoxicological profile, correlative measures, such as relative and absolute organ weights, 
food and water consumption, and body weight and weight gain, may be signs of 
physiological change associated with systemic toxicity and may be useful in determining the 
relative contribution of general toxicity. 


4.1.3.4. Statistical considerations. 


Experimental designs for neurotoxicological studies are 
frequently complex, with two or more major variables (e.g., gender, time of testing) varying 
in any single experiment. In addition, such studies typically generate varying types of data, 
including continuous, dichotomous, and rank-order data. Knowledge and experience in 
experimental design and statistical analyses are important. There are several key statistical 
concepts that should be understood in neurotoxicological studies (WHO, 1986; Gad, 1989). 
The power, or probability, of a study to detect a true effect is dependent on the size of the 
study group, the frequency of the outcome variable in the general population, and the 
magnitude of effect to be identified. Statistical evaluation of a treatment-related effect 
involves the consideration of two factors or types of errors to be avoided. A Type I error 
refers to the attribution of an exposure-related neurotoxicological effect when none has 
occurred (false positive), while a Type II error refers to the failure to attribute an effect 
when an exposure-related effect has actually occurred (false negative). In general, the 
probability of a Type I error should not exceed 5 percent and the probability of a Type II 
error should not exceed 20 percent. Power is defined as one minus the probability of a Type 
II error.
 
Determination of power also requires knowledge of the difference in magnitude of 
outcome measures observed between exposed and control groups and the variability of the 
outcome measure among subjects. The sample size required to achieve a given level of 
statistical power increases as variability increases or the difference between groups decreases. 
Continuous data (i.e., magnitude, rate, amplitude), if found to be normally 
distributed, can be analyzed with a general linear model using a grouping factor of dose and, 
if necessary, repeated measures across time. Post hoc comparisons between control and 
other treatment groups can be made following tests for overall significance. In the case of 
multiple endpoints within a series of evaluations, correction for multiple observations (e.g., 
Bonferroni's) might be necessary. 
Descriptive data (categorical) and rank data can be analyzed using standard 
nonparametric techniques. In some cases, if it is believed that the data fit the linear model, 
the categorical data modeling procedure can be used for weighted least-squares estimation of 
parameters for a wide range of general linear models, including repeated measures analyses. 
The weighted least-squares approach to categorical and rank data allows computation of 
statistics for testing the significance of sources of variation as reflected by the model. 


4.2. Tiered Testing in Neurotoxicology 


The utility of tiered testing as an efficient and cost-effective approach to evaluate 
chemical toxicity, including neurotoxicity, has been recognized (NRC, 1975). Briefly, first-tier tests are designed
to determine the presence or absence of neurotoxicity, while second- 
tier tests characterize the neurotoxic effect (NRC, 1992). There are at least two aspects of 
tiered testing, one involving the type of test used (Tilson, 1990a) and the other involving the 
dosing regimen (Goldberg and Frazier, 1989).

4.2.1. Type of Test 


Tests designed to measure the presence or absence of an effect are usually different 
from those used to assess the degree of toxicity or the lowest exposure level required to 
produce an effect (Tilson, 1990a). Screening procedures are first-tier tests that typically permit the testing
of many groups of animals. Such procedures may not require extensive 
resources and are usually simple to perform. However, these techniques may be labor 
intensive, provide subjective measures, yield semiquantitative data, and may not be as 
sensitive to subtle effects as those designed to characterize neurotoxic effects or second-tier 
tests. Specialized tests are usually more sensitive and employed in studies concerning 
mechanisms of action or the estimation of the lowest effective dose. Such testing procedures 
are usually referred to as secondary tests and may require special equipment and more 
extensive resources. Secondary tests are usually quantitative and yield graded or continuous 
data amenable to routine parametric statistical analyses.
 
Testing at the first tier is used to determine if a chemical might produce neurotoxicity 
following exposure, i.e., hazard detection. In this case, there may be little existing 
information concerning the neurotoxic potential of an agent. Examples of first-tier tests 
include functional observational batteries (FOB), including an evaluation of motor activity 
and routine neurohistopathology. For some chemicals or types of chemicals, there may be a 
specific interest in screening for a particular presumed mechanism of toxicity (e.g., inhibition 
of cholinesterase or neurotoxic esterase) or neurobiological response (e.g., a site-specific 
neuronal degeneration). In these cases, specific neurochemical or neuropathological 
endpoints can be used in conjunction with first-tier tests. It is desirable that tests selected for 
use in hazard detection provide a suitable level of sensitivity using the smallest number of 
animals necessary. 
A decision to test at the next tier is based on data suggesting that an agent produces 
neurotoxicity. The information used to make a decision to test a chemical at the secondary 
level can come from a variety of sources, including neurotoxicological data already in the 
literature, structure-activity relationships, data from first-tier testing, or following reports of 
specific neurotoxic effects in humans exposed to the agent. Testing at the secondary level 
includes detailed neuropathological evaluation as well as specific behavioral tests, e.g., 
procedures to assess learning and memory, or sensory function. Tests at the second tier 
usually measure the most sensitive endpoints of neurotoxicity, and are the most suitable for 
determining the no observable adverse effect level or benchmark dose. At this stage of 
testing, the use of a second species is considered to address the issue of cross-species 
extrapolation. At the present time, tiered testing approaches in neurotoxicology rely heavily 
on functional endpoints. It is possible that future testing protocols will employ a different 
strategy as more information concerning neurotoxic mechanisms of action become available 
and biologically based dose-response models are developed. 


4.2.2. Dosing Regimen 


Goldberg and Frazier (1989) have indicated that first-tier evaluations identify effects 
of substances following acute or repeated exposure over a wide range of doses. Measures 
are simple, focused on detection of effects, and results are used to help establish parameters 
for the second tier of testing. The subsequent stage(s) of tier testing are designed to 
characterize more fully the toxicity of repeated dosing. In this case, animals are exposed 
repeatedly or continuously to define the scope of toxicity, including latent or delayed effects, 
development of tolerance, and the reversibility of adverse effects. The subsequent stage(s) of 
testing also provide information about specific effects or study mechanisms of neurotoxicity. 
This tier uses methods appropriate to characterize the effects observed in the first tier of 
testing. 


4.3. Endpoints of Neurotoxicity 


4.3.1. Introduction 


As applied to the safety assessment of chemical substances, neurotoxicity is any 
adverse change in the development, structure, or function of the central and peripheral 
nervous system following exposure to a chemical agent (Tilson, 1990b). Measures used in 
animal neurotoxicological studies are designed to assess these changes. Neurotoxicity can be 
described at multiple levels of organization, including chemical, anatomical, physiological, or 
behavioral levels. At the chemical level, for example, a neurotoxic substance might inhibit protein 
or transmitter synthesis, alter the flow of ions across cellular membranes, or prevent release 
of neurotransmitter from nerve terminals. Anatomical changes may include destruction of 
the neuron, axon, or myelin sheath. At the physiological level, neuronal responsiveness to 
stimulation might be enhanced by a decrease of inhibitory thresholds in the nervous system. 
Chemical-induced effects at the behavioral level can involve a variety of alterations in motor, 
sensory, or cognitive function, including increases or decreases in frequency or accuracy of 
responding. Although behavioral and neurophysiological endpoints may be very sensitive 
indicators of neurotoxicity, they can be influenced by other factors. The uncertainties 
associated with data from functional endpoints can be reduced if interpreted within the 
context of other neurotoxicological measures (neurochemical or neuropathological) and 
systemic toxicity endpoints, particularly if such measures are taken concurrently. Behavioral 
effects that reflect an indirect effect secondary to systemic toxicities may also be considered 
adverse. Table 4-1 provides examples of potential endpoints of neurotoxicity at the 
behavioral, physiological, chemical, and structural levels.

4.3.2. Behavioral Endpoints



Neurotoxicants produce a wide array of functional deficits, including motor, sensory, and learning or memory dysfunction
(WHO, 1986; Tilson and Mitchell, 1984). Many procedures have been devised to assess overt as well as relatively subtle
changes in those functions; hence their applicability to the detection of neurotoxicity and to hazard characterization.
Many of the behavioral tests have been developed and validated with well-characterized neurotoxicants. Behavioral
tests and agents that affect them have been reviewed recently (WHO, 1986; Cory-Slechta, 1989). Examples of such tests,
the nervous system function being measured, and neurotoxicants known to affect these measures are listed in Table
4-2.

4.3.2.1. Functional observational batteries.



 Functional observational batteries are first-tier 
tests designed to detect and quantify major overt behavioral, physiological, and other 
neurotoxic effects (Moser, 1989). A number of batteries have been used (Tilson and Moser, 
1992), each consisting of tests generally intended to evaluate various aspects of sensorimotor 
function. Most FOB are similar to clinical neurological examinations that rate presence or 
absence and, in some cases, the relative degree of neurological signs. A typical FOB, as 
summarized in Table 4-3, evaluates several functional domains, including neuromuscular 
(i.e., weakness, incoordination, gait, and tremor), sensory (i.e., audition, vision, and 
somatosensory), and autonomic (i.e., pupil response and salivation) function.

<TEXT>
 

The major advantages of FOB tests are that they can be administered within the 
context of other ongoing toxicological tests and provide some indication of the possible 
neurological alterations produced by exposure. Potential problems include insufficient 
interobserver reliability, difficulty in defining certain endpoints, and the tendency toward 
observer bias. The latter can be controlled by using observers unaware of the actual 
treatment of the subjects. Some FOB tests may not be very sensitive to agent-induced 
sensory loss (i.e., vision, audition) or alterations in cognitive or integrative processes such as 
learning and memory. FOB data may be used to trigger experiments performed at the next 
tier of testing. 
FOB data may be interval, ordinal, or continuous (Creason, 1989). The relevance of 
statistically significant test results from an FOB is judged according to the number of signs 
affected, the dose(s) at which neurotoxic signs are observed, and the nature, severity, and 
persistence of the effects. Data from the FOB may provide presumptive evidence of adverse 
effects and neurotoxicity. If only a few unrelated measures in the FOB are affected or the 
effects are unrelated to dose, there is less concern about neurotoxic potentials of a chemical. 
If dose is associated with other overt signs of toxicity, including systemic toxicity, large 
decreases in body weight, or debilitation, the data must be interpreted carefully. In cases 
where several related measures in a battery of tests are affected and the effects appear to be 
dose dependent, the level of concern about the potential of a chemical is higher. 


4.3.2.2. Motor activity. 


Movement within a defined environment is a naturally occurring 
response and can be affected by environmental agents. Motor activity represents a broad 
class of behaviors involving coordinated participation of sensory, motor, and integrative 
processes. Motor activity measurements are noninvasive and can be used to evaluate the 
effects of acute and repeated exposure to chemicals (MacPhail et al., 1989). Motor activity 
measurements have also been used in humans to evaluate disease states, including disorders 
of the nervous system (Goldstein and Stein, 1985). The assessment of motor activity is often 
included in first-tier evaluations, either as part of the FOB or as a separate quantitated 
measurement. 
There are many different types of activity measurement devices, differing in size, 
shape, and method of movement detection (MacPhail et al., 1989). Because of the accuracy 
and ease of calibration, devices with photocells are widely used. In general, situating the 
apparatus to minimize extraneous noise, movements, or lights usually requires that the 
recording devices be placed in light- and sound-attenuating chambers during the testing 
period. A number of different factors, including age, gender, and time of day, can affect 
motor activity, and should be controlled or counterbalanced. Different strains of animals 
may have significantly different basal levels of activity, making comparisons across studies 
difficult. A major factor in activity studies is the duration of the testing session. Motor 
activity levels are generally highest at the beginning of the session and decrease to a low 
level throughout the session. The rate of decline during the test session is frequently termed 
``habituation.'' 
Motor activity measurements are typically included as part of a battery of tests to 
detect or characterize neurotoxicity. Agent-induced alterations in motor activity associated 
with overt signs of toxicity (e.g., loss of body weight, systemic toxicity) or occurring in non-dose-related fashion
are of less concern than changes that are dose dependent, related to 
structural or other functional changes in the nervous system, or occur in the absence of life-threatening toxicity
and are generally convincing evidence of neurotoxicity. 


4.3.2.3. Neuromotor function. 


Motor dysfunction is a common neurotoxic effect, and 
many different types of tests have been devised to measure time- and dose-dependent effects. 
Anger (1984) reported 14 motor effects of 89 substances, which could be classified into four 
categories: weakness, incoordination, tremor, and myoclonia or spasms. Chemical-induced 
changes in motor function can be determined with relatively simple techniques such as the 
FOB. More specialized tests to assess weakness include measures of grip strength, 
swimming endurance, suspension from a hanging rod, discriminitive motor function, and 
hindlimb splay. Rotarod and gait assessments measure incoordination, while rating scales 
and spectral analysis techniques quantify tremor and other abnormal movements (Tilson and 
Mitchell, 1984). 
An example of a second-tier procedure to assess motor function has been described by 
Newland (1988), who trained squirrel monkeys to hold a bar within specified limits (i.e., 
displacement) to receive positive reinforcement. The bar was also attached to a rotary 
device, which allowed measurement of chemical-induced tremor. Spectral analysis was used 
to characterize the tremor, which was found to be similar to that seen in humans exposed to 
neurotoxicants or with such neurologic diseases as Parkinson's disease. 
Incoordination and performance changes can be assessed with procedures that measure 
chemical-induced alterations in force (Fowler, 1987). The accuracy of performance may 
reflect neuromotor function and is sensitive to the debilitating effects of many psychoactive 
drugs (Walker et al., 1981; Newland, 1988). Gait, an index of coordination, has been 
measured in rats under standardized conditions and can be a sensitive indication of specific 
damage to the basal ganglia and motor cortex (Hruska et al., 1979) as well as damage to the 
spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. 
Procedures to characterize chemical-induced motor dysfunction have been used 
extensively in neurotoxicology. Most require preexposure training (including alterations of 
motivational state) of experimental animals, but such tests might be useful, in as much as 
similar procedures are often used in assessing humans. 


4.3.2.4. Sensory function. 


Alterations in sensory processes (e.g., paresthesias and visual or 
auditory impairments) are frequently reported signs or symptoms in humans exposed to 
toxicants (Anger, 1984). Several approaches have been devised to measure sensory deficits. 
Data from tests of sensory function must be interpreted within the context of changes in body 
weight, body temperature, and other physiological endpoints. Furthermore, many tests 
assess the behavioral response of an animal to a specific sensory stimulus; such responses are 
usually motor movements that could be directly affected by chemical exposure. Thus, care 
must be taken to determine whether proper controls were included to eliminate the possibility 
that changes in response to a sensory stimulus may have been related to agent-induced motor 
dysfunction.

<TEXT>
 

Several first-tier testing procedures have been devised to screen for overt sensory 
deficits. Many rely on orientation or the response of an animal to a stimulus. Such tests are 
usually included in the FOB used in screening (e.g., tail-pinch or click responses). 
Responses are usually recorded as being either present, absent, or changed in magnitude 
(Moser, 1989; O'Donoghue, 1989). Screening tests for sensory deficits are typically not 
suitable to characterize chemical-induced changes in acuity or fields of perception. The 
characterization of sensory deficits usually necessitates psychophysical methods that study the 
relationship between the physical dimensions of a stimulus and the behavioral response it 
generates (Maurissen, 1988). 
One second-tier approach to the characterization of sensory function involves the use 
of reflex-modification techniques (Crofton, 1990). Chemical-induced changes in the stimulus 
frequency or threshold required to inhibit a reflex are taken as possible changes in sensory 
function. Prepulse inhibition has been used only recently in neurotoxicology (Fechter and 
Young, 1983) and can be used to assess sensory function in humans as well as in 
experimental animals. 
Various behavioral procedures require that a learned response occur only in the 
presence of a specific stimulus (i.e., discriminated or conditioned responding). Chemical-induced changes in
sensory function are determined by altering the physical characteristics of 
the stimulus (e.g., magnitude or frequency) and measuring the alteration in response rate or 
accuracy. In an example of the use of a discriminated conditional response to assess 
chemical-induced sensory dysfunction, Maurissen et al. (1983) trained monkeys to respond to 
the presence of a vibratory or electric stimulus applied to the fingertip. Repeated dosing 
with acrylamide produced a persistent decrease in vibration sensitivity; sensitivity to electric 
stimulation was unimpaired. That pattern of sensory dysfunction corresponded well to 
known sensory deficits in humans. Discriminated conditional response procedures have been 
used to assess the ototoxicity produced by toluene (Pryor et al., 1983) and the visual toxicity 
produced by methylmercury (Merigan, 1979). 
Procedures to characterize chemical-induced sensory dysfunction have been used often 
in neurotoxicology. As in the case of most procedures designed to characterize nervous 
system dysfunction, training and motivational factors can be confounding factors. Many tests 
designed to assess sensory function for laboratory animals can also be applied with some 
adaptation to humans. 


4.3.2.5. Learning and memory.



Learning and memory disorders are neurotoxic effects of 
particular importance. Impairment of memory is reported fairly often by adult humans as a 
consequence of toxic exposure. Behavioral deficits in children have been caused by lead 
exposure (Smith et al., 1989), and it is hypothesized (Calne et al., 1986) that chronic low-level exposure to toxic
agents may have a role in the pathogenesis of senile dementia. 
Learning can be defined as an enduring change in the mechanisms of behavior that 
results from experience with environmental events (Domjan and Burkhard, 1986). Memory 
is a change that can be either short-lasting or long-lasting (Eckerman and Bushnell, 1992). 
Alterations in learning and memory must be inferred from changes in behavior. However, 
changes in learning and memory must be separated from other changes in behavior that do 
not involve cognitive or associative processes (e.g., motor function, sensory capabilities, and 
motivational factors), and an apparent toxicant-induced change in learning or memory should 
be demonstrated over a range of stimuli and conditions. Before it is concluded that a 
toxicant alters learning and memory, effects should be confirmed in a second learning 
procedure. It is well known that lesions in the brain can inhibit learning. It is also known 
that some brain lesions can facilitate some types of learning by removing behavioral 
tendencies (e.g., inhibitory responses due to stress) that moderate the rate of learning under 
normal circumstances. A discussion of learning procedures and examples of chemicals that 
can affect learning and memory have appeared in recent reviews (Heise, 1984; WHO, 1986; 
Peele and Vincent, 1989). 
One simple index of learning and memory, which can be measured as a first-tier 
endpoint, is habituation. Habituation is defined as a gradual decrease in the magnitude or 
frequency of a response after repeated presentations of a stimulus. A toxicant can affect 
habituation by increasing or decreasing the number of stimulus presentations needed to 
produce response decrements (Overstreet, 1977). Although habituation is a very simple form 
of learning, it can also be perturbed by a number of chemical effects not related to learning. 
A more complicated approach to studying the effects of a chemical on learning and 
memory involves the pairing of a novel stimulus with a second stimulus that produces a 
known, observable, and quantifiable response (i.e., classical ``Pavlovian'' conditioning). The 
novel stimulus is known as the conditioned stimulus, and the second, eliciting stimulus is the 
unconditioned stimulus. With repeated pairings of the two stimuli, the conditioned stimulus 
comes to elicit a response similar to the response elicited by the unconditioned stimulus. The 
procedure has been used in behavioral pharmacology and, to a lesser extent, in 
neurotoxicology. Neurotoxicants that interfere with learning and memory would alter the 
number of presentations of the pair of stimuli required to produce conditioning or learning. 
Memory would be tested by determining how long after the last presentation of the two 
stimuli the conditioned stimulus would still elicit a response (Yokel, 1983). Other classically 
conditioned responses known to be affected by psychoactive or neurotoxic agents are 
conditioned taste aversion (Riley and Tuck, 1985) and conditioned suppression (Chiba and 
Ando, 1976). 
Second-tier procedures to assess learning or memory typically involve the pairing of a 
response with a stimulus that increases the probability of future response through 
reinforcement. Response rate can be increased by using positive reinforcement or removing 
negative reinforcement. Learning is usually assessed by determining the number of 
presentations or trials needed to produce a defined frequency of response. Memory can be 
defined specifically as the maintenance of a stated frequency of response after initial training. 
Neurotoxicants may adversely affect learning by increasing or decreasing the number of 
presentations required to achieve the designated criterion. Decrements in memory may be 
indicated by a decrease in the probability or frequency of a response at some time after initial 
training. Toxicant-induced changes in learning and memory should be interpreted within the 
context of possible toxicant-induced changes in sensory, motor, and motivational factors. 
Examples of instrumental learning procedures used in neurotoxicology are repeated 
acquisition (Schrot et al., 1984), passive and active avoidance, Y-maze avoidance, spatial 
mazes (radial-arm maze), and delayed matching to sample (Heise, 1984; WHO, 1986; Tilson 
and Mitchell, 1984).

4.3.2.6. Schedule-controlled behavior.



Another type of second-tier procedure is schedule-controlled operant behavior (SCOB), which involves the maintenance
of behavior 
(performance) by response-dependent reinforcement (Rice, 1988). Different patterns of 
behavior and response rates are controlled by the relationship between response and later 
reinforcement. SCOB affords a measure of learned behavior and with appropriate 
experimental design may be useful for studying chemical-induced effects on motor, sensory, 
and cognitive function. 
The primary endpoints for evaluation are agent-induced changes in response rate or 
frequency and the temporal pattern of responding. Response rate is usually related to an 
objective response, such as lever press or key peck, and differs according to the schedule of 
reinforcement. Response rates are expressed per unit of time. For some classes of 
chemicals, the direction of an effect on response rate can differ between low and high doses. 
Agent-induced changes in temporal pattern of responding can occur independently of changes 
in the rate and require analysis of the distribution of responses relative to reinforcement 
schedule. 
SCOB has been used to study the effects of psychoactive drugs on behavior and is 
sensitive to many neurotoxicants, including methylmercury, solvents, pesticides, acrylamides, 
carbon monoxide, and organic and inorganic lead (Paule and McMillan, 1984; MacPhail 
1985; Cory-Slechta, 1989; Rice, 1988). The experimental animal often serves as its own 
control, and the procedure provides an opportunity to study a few animals extensively over a 
relatively long period. SCOB typically requires motivational procedures, such as food 
deprivation, and training sessions are usually required to establish a stable baseline of 
responding. Because of its sensitivity to neuroactive chemicals, SCOB has great potential for 
use in second-tier assessments. 


4.3.3. Neurophysiological Endpoints of Neurotoxicity 


Neurophysiological studies are those that assess function either directly through 
measurements of the electrical activity of the nervous system (electrophysiology) or indirectly 
through measurements of peripheral organ functions controlled or modulated by the nervous 
system (general physiology) (Dyer, 1987). When performed properly, neurophysiological 
techniques provide information on the integrity of defined portions of the nervous system. 
Many of the endpoints used in animals have also been used in humans to determine chemical-induced alterations in neurophysiological
function. 
The term ``electrophysiology'' refers to the set of neurophysiological procedures that 
study neural function through the direct measurement of the electrical activity generated by 
the nervous system (Dyer, 1987). A variety of electrophysiological procedures are available 
for application to neurotoxicological problems, which range in scale from procedures that 
employ microelectrodes to study the function of single nerve cells or restricted portions of 
them, to procedures that employ macroelectrodes to perform simultaneous recordings of the 
summed activity of many cells. The latter types of procedures have historically been used in 
studies to detect or characterize the potential neurotoxicity of agents of regulatory interest. 
Several macroelectrode procedures are discussed below.

4.3.3.1. Nerve conduction studies. 



Nerve conduction studies are generally performed on peripheral nerves and can be useful in investigations of possible
peripheral neuropathy. Most peripheral nerves contain mixtures of both individual sensory and motor nerve fibers,
which may or may not be differentially sensitive to neurotoxicants. It is possible to distinguish sensory from motor
effects in peripheral nerve studies by measuring activity in purely sensory nerves such as the sural to study sensory
effects or by measuring the muscle response evoked by nerve stimulation to measure motor effects. While a number of
endpoints can be recorded, the most commonly used variables are (1) Nerve conduction velocity, and (2) response amplitude.
In well-controlled studies, decreases in nerve conduction velocity typically are evidence of neurotoxicity (Dyer,
1987). While a decrease in nerve conduction velocity is a reliable measure of demyelination, it frequently occurs
rather late in the course of axonal degradation because normal conduction velocity may be maintained for some time
in the face of axonal degeneration. For this reason, a measurement of normal nerve conduction velocity does not necessarily
rule out peripheral axonal degeneration if other signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction are present. Increases in
conduction velocity of adult organisms following treatment with neurotoxic compounds, in the absence of hypothermia,
are atypical responses and may, in fact, reflect experimental or statistical errors. Decreases in response amplitude
reflect a loss of active nerve fibers, and may occur prior to decreases in conduction velocity in the course of peripheral
neuropathy. Hence changes in response amplitude may be more sensitive measurements of axonal degeneration than
conduction velocity. Measurements of response amplitude, however, are more variable and require careful experimental
techniques, a larger sample size, and greater statistical power than measurements of velocity to detect changes.
Alterations in peripheral nerve function are associated with abnormal peripheral sensations such as numbness,
tingling, or burning or with motor impairments such as weakness. Examples of compounds that alter peripheral nerve
function in humans or experimental animals at some level of exposure include acrylamide, carbon disulfide, hexacarbons,
lead, and some organophosphates. 



4.3.3.2. Sensory evoked potentials. 



Sensory evoked potentials are electrophysiological procedures that involve measuring the response elicited by
the presentation of a defined sensory stimulus such as a tone, a light, or a brief electrical pulse to the skin. Sensory
evoked potentials reflect sensory function, and can be used to investigate visual, auditory, or somatosensory (body
sensation) systems (Rebert, 1983; Mattsson and Albee, 1988). The data are in the form of a voltage record over time,
which can be quantified in several ways. Commonly, the positive and negative voltage peaks are identified and measured
as to their latency (time from stimulus onset) and amplitude (voltage). 

Changes in peak amplitudes or equivalent measures reflect changes in the magnitude of the neural population that
is responsive to stimulation. Both increases and decreases in amplitude are possible following exposure to neurotoxicants
because (1) The brain normally operates in a careful balance between excitatory and inhibitory systems, and disruption
of this balance can produce either positive or negative shifts in the voltages recorded in evoked potential experiments,
and (2) excitatory or inhibitory neural activity is translated into a positive or negative deflection in the sensory
evoked potential depending on the physical orientation of the electrode with respect to the tissue generating the
response, which is frequently unknown. Within any given sensory system, the neural circuits that generate the different
evoked potential peaks differ as a function of peak latency. In general, early latency peaks reflect the transmission
of afferent sensory information, and changes in either the latency or amplitude of these peaks generally indicate
a neurotoxic change that is likely to be reflected in deficits in sensory perception. The later latency peaks, in general,
reflect not only the sensory input, but also the more nonspecific factors such as the behavioral state of the subject
including such factors as arousal level, habituation, or sensitization. Thus, the neurotoxicological significance
of changes in later latency evoked potential peaks must be interpreted in light of the behavioral status of the subject.




4.3.3.3. Convulsions. 



Observable behavioral convulsions in animals may be indicative of central nervous system seizure activity. However,
behavioral convulsions that occur only at lethal or near lethal dose levels may reflect an indirect effect secondary
to systemic toxicity and not directly on the nervous system. Convulsions occurring at dose levels that are clearly
sublethal, and in the absence of apparent systemic toxicity, are more likely due to a direct effect on the nervous system.
In such cases, neurophysiological recordings of electrical activity in the brain that are indicative of seizures
may provide additional evidence of direct neurotoxicity. In addition to producing seizures, chemicals may also
affect seizure susceptibility, altering the frequency, severity, duration, or threshold for eliciting seizures
produced through other means. Such changes can occur after acute exposure or after repeated exposure to dose levels
below the acute threshold, and are considered neurotoxic. Agents that produce convulsions include lindane, DDT,
pyrethroids, and trimethyltin (WHO, 1986). Some agents, including many solvents, act to raise the threshold for
eliciting seizures through other means or otherwise act to reduce the severity or duration of the elicited convulsions.
These agents are difficult to classify as neurotoxic based on such data, but frequently have other effects on which
a determination of neurotoxic potential can be based. 



4.3.3.4. Electroencephalography (EEG) 



EEG analysis is used widely in clinical settings for the diagnosis of neurological disorders and less often for the
detection of subtle toxicant-induced dysfunction (WHO, 1986; Eccles, 1988). The basis for the use of EEG in either
setting is the relationship between specific patterns of EEG waveforms and specific behavioral states. Because
states of alertness and the stages of sleep are associated with distinct patterns of electrical activity in the brain,
it is generally thought that arousal level can be evaluated by monitoring the EEG. Dissociation of EEG activity and
behavior can, however, occur after exposure to certain chemicals. Normal patterns of transition between sleep stages
or between sleeping and waking states are known to remain disturbed for prolonged periods of time following exposure
to certain chemical classes (e.g., organophosphates). Changes in the pattern of the EEG can be elicited by stimuli
producing arousal (e.g., lights, sounds) and neuroactive drugs. In studies with toxicants, changes in EEG pattern
can sometimes precede alterations in other objective signs of neurotoxicity. EEG experiments must be done under
highly controlled conditions, and the neurotoxicological significance of chemical-induced changes in the EEG
in the absence of other signs of neurotoxicity must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Many chemicals, including
metals, solvents, and pesticides, would be expected to affect the EEG.

4.3.3.5. Electromyography (EMG). 



EMG involves making electrical recordings from muscle and has been used extensively in human clinical studies in
the diagnosis of certain diseases of the muscle (WHO, 1986). Changes in the EMG include amplitude and firing frequency
of spontaneous firing; evoked muscle responses to nerve stimulation can be used to study alterations in the neuromuscular
junction. EMG has been used to study toxicant-induced changes in neuromuscular function, including organophosphate
insecticides, methyl


 n-butyl ketone, and botulinum and tetanus toxin. 



4.3.3.6. Spinal reflex excitability. 



Segmental spinal monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes are relatively simple functions in the central nervous
system that can be evaluated by quantitative techniques (WHO, 1986). Many of the procedures used in animals are similar
to procedures used clinically to perform neurological tests in humans. One approach infers the functional state
of a reflex arc from either the latency and magnitude of the reflex response evoked by stimuli of predetermined intensity
or from the stimulus intensity required to elicit a detectable response (i.e., the threshold). This approach is used
best in a screening context and the significance of effects in this test should be considered on a case-by-case basis.


A second more involved approach records electrophysiologically the time required for a stimulus applied to a peripheral
nerve to reach the spinal cord and return to the site of the original stimulation. Data from this procedure can indicate
the excitability of the motoneuron pool, an effect seen with many volatile solvents. Although this approach is more
invasive and time-consuming than the noninvasive procedure, it provides better data concerning the possible site
of action. In addition, the manner in which the invasive procedure is carried out (i.e., in decerebrated animals)
precludes repeated testing on the same animal. The significance of effects in this procedure should also be considered
on a case-by-case basis. 



4.3.4. Neurochemical Endpoints of Neurotoxicity 



Neuronal function within the nervous system is dependent on synthesis and release of specific neurotransmitters
and activation of their receptors in specific neuronal pathways. With few exceptions, neurochemical measurements
are invasive and therefore used infrequently in human risk assessment. There are many different neurochemical endpoints
that could be measured in neurotoxicological studies (Bondy, 1986; Mailman, 1987; Morell and Mailman, 1987). Neurotoxicants
can interfere with the ionic balance of a neuron, act as a cytotoxicant after being transported into a nerve terminal,
block uptake of neurotransmitter precursors, act as a metabolic poison, overstimulate receptors, block transmitter
release, and inhibit transmitter degradation. Table 4-4 lists several chemicals with known neurochemical
effects. Many neuroactive agents can increase or decrease neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Dose-related changes
on these endpoints may indicate a chemical effect on the nervous system, but the neurotoxicological significance
of such changes must be interpreted in the context of other signs of neurotoxicity.

Some chemicals, such as the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, are known to interfere with a specific enzyme,
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Costa, 1988). Inhibition of this enzyme in brain may be considered evidence of neurotoxicity,
whereas decreases in AChE in the blood, which can be easily determined in humans, are only suggestive of a neurotoxic
effect. A subset of organophosphate agents produces organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) after
acute or repeated exposure. Neurotoxic esterase (or neuropathy target enzyme, NTE) has been associated with agents
that produce OPIDN (Johnson, 1990).

The ultimate functional significance of many biochemical changes is not known; therefore it may be difficult to determine
if a specific biochemical change can be considered adverse or convincing evidence of neurotoxicity. Any such change,
however, is potentially adverse and each determination of adversity requires a judgment to be made. Likewise, the
absence of specific biochemical testing protocols does not mean biochemical changes are of no concern, but instead
reflects a lack of understanding of the significance of changes at the biochemical level.



4.3.5. Structural Endpoints of Neurotoxicity 



The central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) comprises nerve cells or neurons, which consist of a neuronal body,
axon, and dendritic processes. Various types of neuropathological lesions may be classified according to their
nature or the site where they are found (WHO, 1986; Krinke, 1989; Griffin, 1990). Lesions may be classified as neuropathy
(changes in the neuronal body), axonopathy (changes in the axons), myelinopathy (changes in the myelin sheaths),
neurodegeneration (changes in the nerve terminals), and peripheral neuropathy (changes in the peripheral nerves).
For axonopathies, a more precise location of the changes should be described (i.e., proximal, central, or distal
axonopathy). In some cases, agents produce neuropathic conditions that resemble naturally occurring neurodegenerative
disorders in humans (WHO, 1986). Table 4-5 lists examples of such chemicals, their known site of action, the
type of neuropathology produced, and the disease or condition that each typifies.

In general, chemical effects lead to two types of primary cellular alteration: (l) the accumulation, proliferation,
or rearrangement of structural elements (e.g., intermediate filaments, microtubules) or organelles (mitochondria)
and (2) the breakdown of cells, in whole or in part. The latter can be associated with regenerative processes that may
occur during chemical exposure. Such changes are considered to be neurotoxic. 
While most neurotoxic damage is evident at the microscopic level, gross changes in morphology can be reflected by
a significant change in the weight of the brain. Weight changes (absolute or relative to body weight), discoloration,
discrete or massive cerebral hemorrhage, or obvious lesions in nerve tissue are generally considered neurotoxic
effects. 
Chemical-induced injury to the central nervous system is associated with astrocytic hypertrophy at the site of damage.
Assays of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the major intermediate filament protein of astrocytes, has been
proposed as a biomarker of this response (O'Callaghan, 1988). A number of chemicals known to injure the central nervous
system, including trimethyltin, methylmercury, cadmium, 3-acetylpyridine, and MPTP, have been shown to increase
GFAP. In addition, increases in GFAP may be seen at dosages below those necessary to produce cytopathology as determined
by Nissl-based stains used in standard neuropathological examinations. Because increases in GFAP may be an early
indicator of neuronal injury in the adult, exposure level-dependent increases in GFAP should be viewed with concern.

Chemical-induced alterations in the structure of the nervous system are generally considered neurotoxic effects.
To ensure reliable data, it is important that neuropathological studies minimize fixation artifacts and potential
differences in the section(s) of the nervous system sampled and control for variability due to the age, sex, and body
weight of the subject (WHO, 1986). 


4.3.6. Developmental Neurotoxicity 


Exposure to chemicals during development can result in effects other than death, gross structural abnormality,
or altered growth. There are several instances in which functional alterations have resulted from exposure during
the period between conception and sexual maturity (Riley and Vorhees, 1986; Vorhees, 1987). Table 4-6 lists
several examples of chemicals known to produce developmental neurotoxicity in experimental animals. Animal models
of developmental neurotoxicity have been shown to be sensitive to several environmental chemicals known to produce
developmental toxicity in humans, including lead, ethanol, methylmercury, and PCBs (Kimmel et al., 1990).

Sometimes functional defects are observed at dose levels below those at which other 
indicators of developmental toxicity are evident (Rodier, 1986). Such effects may be 
transient or reversible in nature, but generally are considered adverse effects. Data from 
postnatal studies, when available, are considered useful for further assessment of the relative 
importance and severity of findings in the fetus and neonate. Often, the long-term 
consequences of adverse developmental outcomes noted at birth are unknown and further data 
on postnatal development and function are necessary to determine the full spectrum of 
potential developmental effects. Useful data also can be derived from well-conducted 
multigeneration studies, although the dose levels used in these studies may be much lower 
than those in studies with shorter-term exposure. 
Much of the early work in developmental neurotoxicology was related to behavioral 
evaluations. Recent advances in this area have been reviewed in several publications (Riley 
and Vorhees, 1986; Kimmel et al., 1990). Several expert groups have focused on the 
functions that should be included in a behavioral testing battery, including sensory systems, 
neuromotor development, locomotor activity, learning and memory, reactivity and 
habituation, and reproductive behavior. No testing battery has fully addressed all of these 
functions, but it is important to include as many as possible, and several testing batteries 
have been developed and evaluated for use in testing. 
Direct extrapolation of functional developmental effects to humans is limited in the 
same way as for other endpoints of developmental toxicity, i.e., by the lack of knowledge 
about underlying toxicological mechanisms and their significance. It can be assumed that 
functional effects in animal studies indicate the potential for altered development in humans, 
although the types of developmental effects seen in experimental animal studies will not 
necessarily be the same as those that may be produced in humans. Thus, when data from 
functional developmental toxicity studies are encountered for particular agents, they should 
be considered in the risk assessment process. 
Agents that produce developmental neurotoxicity at a dose that is not toxic to the 
maternal animal are of special concern because the developing organism is affected but 
toxicity is not apparent in the adult. More commonly, however, adverse developmental 
effects are produced only at doses that cause minimal maternal toxicity; in these cases, the 
developmental effects are still considered to represent developmental toxicity and should not 
be discounted as secondary to maternal toxicity. At doses causing excessive maternal 
toxicity (that is, significantly greater than the minimal toxic dose), information on 
developmental effects may be difficult to interpret and of limited value. Current information 
is inadequate to assume that developmental effects at maternally toxic doses result only from 
maternal toxicity; it may be that the mother and developing organism are sensitive to that 
dose level. Moreover, whether developmental effects are secondary to maternal toxicity or 
not, the maternal effects may be reversible while effects on the offspring may be permanent. 
These are important considerations for agents to which humans may be exposed at minimally 
toxic levels either voluntarily or involuntarily, because several agents are known to produce 
adverse developmental effects at minimally toxic doses in adult humans (e.g., smoking, 
alcohol). 
Although interpretation of functional developmental neurotoxicity data may be limited 
at present, it is clear that functional effects must be evaluated in light of other toxicity data, 
including other forms of developmental toxicity (e.g., structural abnormalities, perinatal 
death, and growth retardation). The level of confidence in an adverse effect may be as 
important as the type of change seen, and confidence may be increased by such factors as 
replicability of the effect either in another study of the same function or by convergence of 
data from tests that purport to measure similar functions. A dose-response relationship is 
considered an important measure of chemical effect; in the case of functional effects, both 
monotonic and biphasic dose-response curves are likely, depending on the function being 
tested. 


4.3.7. Physiological and Neuroendocrine Endpoints 


One of the key roles played by the nervous system is to orchestrate the general 
physiological functions of the body to help maintain homeostasis. To this end, the nervous 
system and many of the peripheral organ systems are integrated and functionally 
interdependent. For example, specific neuronal processes are intimately involved in 
maintaining or modulating respiration, cardiovascular function, body temperature, and 
gastrointestinal function. Because many peripheral organ functions involve neuronal 
components, changes in such physiological endpoints as blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, 
body temperature, respiration, lacrimation, or salivation may indirectly reflect possible 
treatment-related effects on the functional integrity of the nervous system. However, since 
physiological endpoints also depend on the integrity of the related peripheral organ itself, 
changes in physiological function also may reflect a systemic toxicity involving that organ. 
Consequently, the neurotoxicological significance of a physiological change must be 
interpreted within the context of other signs of toxicity. A variety of general physiological 
procedures can be applied to neurotoxicological problems. These procedures range in scale 
from simple measurements, for example, of body temperature, respiration, lacrimation, 
salivation, urination, and defecation, which may be included in routine functional 
observational batteries used for chemical screening, to more involved procedures involving 
measurements of blood pressure, endocrine responses, cardiac function, gastrointestinal 
function, etc. The latter would be more appropriate for second-level tests to characterize the 
scope of chemically related toxicity. 
The central nervous system also regulates the outflow of the endocrine system, which 
together with the influence of the autonomic nervous system, can affect immunologic 
function (WHO, 1986). Hormonal balance results from the integrated action of the 
hypothalamus, located in the central nervous system, and the pituitary, which regulates 
activities of endocrine target organs. Each site is susceptible to disruption by neurotoxic 
agents. Neuroendocrine dysfunction may occur because of a disturbance in the regulation 
and modulation of the neuroendocrine feedback systems. One major indicator of 
neuroendocrine function is secretions of hormones from the pituitary. Hormones from the 
anterior pituitary are important for reproduction (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing 
hormone), growth (thyroid-stimulating hormone), and response to stress (adrenocorticotropic 
hormone). Hypothalamic control of anterior pituitary secretions occurs through the release 
of hypothalamic-hypophysiotropic hormones. Hormones from the posterior hypothalamus 
(prolactin, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and growth hormone) are also involved in a 
number of important bodily functions.

<TEXT>
 

Many types of behaviors (e.g., reproductive behaviors, sexually dimorphic behaviors) 
are dependent on the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary system, which could represent an 
important site for neurotoxic action. Pituitary secretions arise from a number of different 
cell types in this gland and neurotoxicants could affect these cells either directly or 
indirectly. Morphological changes in follicular cells, chromophobe cells, somatotropic cells, 
prolactin cells, gonadotropic cells, follicle-stimulating hormone secreting cells, luteinizing 
hormone-containing cells, thyrotropic cells, and cortico cells might be associated with 
adverse effects on the pituitary, which could ultimately affect behavior and the functioning of 
the nervous system. 
Biochemical changes in the hypothalamus also may be used as indices of potential 
changes in neuroendocrine function. However, the neuroendocrine significance of changes in 
hypothalamic neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is usually only inferential and data must be 
considered on a case-by-case basis. 
Most anterior pituitary hormones are subject to negative feedback control by 
peripheral endocrine glands and, if neurotoxicants modify peripheral secretions, 
neuroendocrine changes can result from this altered feedback. Modifications in the 
functioning of these endocrine secretions could occur after toxic exposure; a number of 
agents have been shown to alter blood levels of glucocorticoids, thyroxine, estrogen, 
corticosterone, and testosterone. Although such changes are not necessarily due to direct 
neuroendocrine effects, target organ changes often can be a first indication of neuroendocrine 
changes. 


4.3.8. Other Considerations 
4.3.8.1. Structure-activity relationship. 


Because of a general lack of epidemiologic or 
toxicologic data on most chemical substances, attempts have been made in toxicology to 
predict activities based on chemical structure. The basis for inference from structure-activity 
relationships (SARs) can be either comparison with structures known to have biologic activity 
or knowledge of structural requirements of a receptor or macromolecular site of action. 
However, given the complexity of the nervous system and the lack of information on biologic 
mechanisms of neurotoxic action, there are relatively few well-characterized SARs in 
neurotoxicology. Since SARs cannot be used to rule out all neurotoxic activity, it is not 
acceptable to use them as a basis for excluding potential neurotoxicity. Caution is warranted 
in interpreting SARs in anything other than the most preliminary analyses. Use of SARs 
requires detailed knowledge not only of structure, but also of each critical step in the 
pathogenetic mechanism of neurotoxic injury. Such knowledge is still generally unavailable. 
SAR approaches are more successful when the range of possible sites of action or 
mechanisms of action is narrow. Thus, SARs have had more use in relation to 
carcinogenicity and mutagenicity than in other kinds of toxicity. The SAR approaches used 
in the development of novel neuropharmacologic structures deserve consideration in 
neurotoxicology, but their utility depends on a better understanding of neurotoxic mechanisms. 


4.3.8.2. In vitro methods. 


In vitro procedures for testing have practical advantages, but 
studies must be done to correlate the results with responses in whole animals. One 
advantage of validated in vitro tests is that they minimize the use of live animals. Some of 
the more developed in vitro tests might be simple and might not have to be conducted by 
highly trained personnel, but, as with many in vivo tests, the analysis and interpretation of 
results are likely to require expertise. Experience with the Ames test for mutagenesis 
confirms the advantages of in vitro procedures, but also illustrates the problems that arise 
when an assay is used to predict an endpoint that is not exactly what it measures (e.g., 
carcinogenicity rather than specific aspects of genotoxicity). In vitro changes can be markers 
for toxicity, even when the structural or functional consequences are not known or predicted. 
In addition, in vitro methods can examine the more evolutionarily conserved elements of the 
nervous system and improve neurotoxicity detection and could also provide suitable systems 
for studying developmental neurotoxicity. 
A broad range of tissue-culture systems are available for assessing the neurologic 
impact of environmental agents, including cell lines, dissociated cell cultures, reaggregate 
cultures, explant cultures, and organ cultures (Veronesi, 1991). 
Neuronal and glial cell lines are used extensively in neurobiology and have potential 
for neurotoxicological studies. They consist of populations of continuously dividing cells 
that, when treated appropriately, stop dividing and exhibit differentiated neuronal or glial 
properties. Neuronal lines can develop electric excitability, chemosensitivity, axon 
formation, neurotransmitter synthesis and secretion, and synapse formation. Large quantities 
of cells can be generated routinely to develop extensive dose-response or other quantitative 
data.

When neural tissue, typically from fetal animals, is dissociated into a suspension of 
single cells, and the suspension is inoculated into tissue-culture dishes, the neurons and glia 
survive, grow, and establish functional neuronal networks. Such preparations have been 
made from most regions of the CNS and exhibit highly differentiated, site-specific properties 
that constitute an in vitro model of different portions of the CNS. Most of the neuronal 
transmitter and receptor phenotypes can be demonstrated, and a variety of synaptic 
interactions can be studied. Glial cells are also present, and neuroglial interactions are a 
prominent feature of the cultures. A substantial battery of assays (neurochemical and 
neurophysiologic) is now available to assess the development of the cultures and to indicate 
toxic effects of test agents added to the culture medium. Relatively pure populations of 
different cell types can be isolated and cultured, so that effects on specific cell types can be 
assessed independently. Pure glial cells or neurons, or even specific neural categories, can 
be prepared in this way and studied separately, or interaction between neurons and glial cells 
can be studied at high resolution. The neurobiologic measures used to assess the effect of 
any agent can be very specific (for example, activity of neurotransmitter-related enzyme or 
binding of a receptor ligand) or global (for example, neuron survival or concentration of glial 
fibrillary acidic protein). The two-dimensional character of the preparations makes them 
particularly suited for morphologic evaluation, and detailed electrophysiologic studies are 
readily performed. The toxic effects and mechanisms of anticonvulsants, excitatory amino 
acids, and various metals and divalent cations have been assessed with these preparations. 
The cerebellar granular cell culture system, for example, has been exploited recently in 
studies of the mechanism of alkyllead toxicity (Verity et al., 1990). 
A related preparation made from single-cell suspensions of neural tissue is the 
reaggregate culture. Instead of being placed in culture dishes and allowed to settle onto the 
surface of the dishes, the cells are kept in suspension by agitation; under appropriate 
conditions, they stick to one another and form aggregates of controllable size and 
composition. Typically, the cells in an aggregate organize and exhibit intercellular relations 
that are a function of, and bear some resemblance to, the brain region that was the source of 
the cells. The cells establish a three-dimensional, often laminated structure. Reaggregate 
cultures lend themselves to large-scale, quantitative experiments in which neurobiologic 
variables can be examined, although morphologic and ligand-binding studies are performed 
less readily than with surface cultures. 
Organotypic explant cultures also are closely related to the intact nervous system. 
Small pieces or slices of neural tissue are placed in culture and can be maintained for long 
periods with substantial maintenance of structural and cell-cell relations of intact tissue. 
Specific synaptic relations develop and can be maintained and evaluated, both 
morphologically and electrophysiologically. Because all regions of the nervous system are 
amenable to this sort of preparation, it is possible to analyze toxic agents that are active only 
in specific regions of the central or peripheral nervous system. Explants can be made from 
relatively thin slices of neural tissue, so detailed morphologic and intracellular 
electrophysiologic studies are possible. Their anatomic integrity is such that they capture 
many of the cell-cell interactions characteristic of the intact nervous system while allowing a 
direct, continuing evaluation of the effects of a potentially neurotoxic compound added to the 
culture medium. The process of myelination has been studied extensively in explant cultures, 
and considerable neurotoxicologic information has been gained. A preparation similar to an 
explant culture is the organ culture, in which an entire organ, such as the inner ear or a 
ganglion, rather than slices or fragments, is grown in vitro. Obviously, only structures so 
small that their viability is not compromised can be treated in this way. 
In general, the technical ease of maintaining a culture varies inversely with the degree 
to which it captures a spectrum of in vivo characteristics of nervous system behavior. The 
problem of biotransformation of potentially neurotoxic compounds is shared by all, although 
the more complete systems (explant or organ cultures) might alleviate this problem in 
specific instances. In many culture systems, complex and ill-defined additives_such as fetal 
calf serum, horse serum, and human placental serum_are used to promote cell survival. A 
number of thoroughly described synthetic media are now available, however, and such fully 
defined culture systems can be used where necessary.

5. Neurotoxicology Risk Assessment 


5.1. Introduction 


Risk assessment is an empirically based process used to estimate the risk that 
exposure of an individual or population to a chemical, physical, or biological agent will be 
associated with an adverse effect. Generally, such effects can be quantified and the relative 
probability of their occurrence can be calculated. The risk assessment process usually 
involves four steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, 
and risk characterization (NRC, 1983). Risk management is the process that applies 
information obtained through the risk assessment process to determine whether the assessed 
risk should be reduced and, if so, to what extent (NRC, 1983). In some cases, risk is the 
only factor considered in a decision to regulate exposure to a substance. Alternatively, the 
risk posed by a substance is weighed against social, ethical, and medical benefits and 
economic and technological factors in formulating a risk management decision. The risk-
balancing approach is used by some agencies to consider the benefits as well as the risks 
associated with unrestricted or partially restricted use of a substance. The purpose of this 
chapter is to describe the risk assessment process as it has currently evolved in 
neurotoxicology and present available options for quantitative risk assessment. 


5.2. The Risk Assessment Process 


5.2.1. Hazard Identification 


Agents that adversely affect the neurophysiological, neurochemical, or structural 
integrity of the nervous system or the integration of nervous system function expressed as 
modified behavior may be classified as neurotoxicants (Tilson, 1990b). For hazard 
identification, the best or most generalizable studies would measure these changes in humans. 
With the exclusion of therapeutic agents, information on effects in humans is usually derived 
from case reports of accidental exposures and epidemiological studies. This type of data 
affords less certainty regarding generalizability as well as less specific exposure information. 
As discussed in chapter 4, a common alternative method of data generation for hazard 
identification is the use of animal models. Animal models that measure behavioral, 
neurophysiological, neurochemical, and structural effects have been developed and validated. 
Studies that employ these models to evaluate specific potential hazards are used to predict the 
outcome of exposure to the same hazard in humans. 


5.2.1.1. Human studies 


Information obtained through the evaluation of human exposure 
data provides direct identification of neurotoxic hazards. This type of information is 
generally available from clinical trials required for the approval of therapeutic products for 
human use. For the purposes of risk assessment of nontherapeutic substances, data on effects 
of exposure to humans come primarily from two types of studies, case reports and 
epidemiological (Friedlander and Hearn, 1980) (see chapter 3). Case studies can supply 
evidence of an agent's toxicity, but are often limited by both the qualitative nature of the 
signs and symptoms reported and the nature of the exposure data. Epidemiological studies 
can provide data on the types of neurotoxic effects and the possible susceptibilities of certain 
populations. Under appropriate considerations, they can generally provide convincing and 
reliable evidence of potential human neurotoxicity. As with case studies, however, often 
only qualitative estimates of exposure can be obtained. Controlled laboratory studies have 
the potential to provide adequate exposure and effects data for accurate hazard identification, 
but ethical considerations place moral and practical restrictions on such studies except in 
those instances where direct benefit to the subjects, as in the case of therapeutic agents, may 
be expected. Excluding instances of therapeutic product development, most studies are 
limited to measuring the effects of acute, rather than long-term, exposure. This limits their 
utility in risk assessment because the effect of long-term, low-level exposure to a potentially 
toxic agent is often the issue of concern. 
Methods available to evaluate neurotoxicity in humans include examination of 
neurophysiological and behavioral parameters. Specific tests to measure neuromuscular 
strength and coordination, alterations in sensation, deficits in learning and memory, changes 
in mood and personality, and disruptions of autonomic function are frequently employed (see 
chapter 3). 


5.2.1.2. Animal studies 


As discussed in chapter 4, animal models for many endpoints of 
neurotoxicity are available and widely used for hazard identification. Data from animal 
studies are frequently extrapolated to humans. For example, if exposure to an agent 
produces neuropathology in an animal model, damage to a comparable structure in humans is 
predicted. Similarly, biochemical and physiological effects observed in animals are 
commonly extrapolated to humans. Agents that produce alterations in the levels of specific 
enzymes in one animal species generally have the same effect in other species, including 
humans. Neurophysiological endpoints also tend to be affected by the same manipulations 
across species. Thus, an agent interfering with nerve conduction in an animal study is often 
assumed to have the same effect in humans. Behavioral studies in animals are also applied to 
human hazard identification, although the correspondence between methods employed in 
animals and humans is sometimes not as obvious. For this reason, behavioral methods 
developed for neurotoxic hazard identification need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. 


5.2.1.3. Special issues 


5.2.1.3.1. Animal-to-human extrapolation. The use of animal data to identify hazard to 
humans is not without controversy. Relative sensitivity across species as well as between 
sexes is a constant concern. Overly conservative risk assessments, based on the assumption 
that humans are always more sensitive than a tested animal species, can result in poor risk 
management decisions. Conversely, an assumption of equivalent sensitivity in a case where 
humans actually are more sensitive to a given agent can result in underregulation that might 
have a negative impact on human health. 
5.2.1.3.2. Susceptible populations. A related controversy concerns the use of data collected 
from adult organisms, animal or human, to predict hazards in potentially more sensitive 
populations, such as the very young and the elderly, or in other groups, such as the 
chronically ill. In some cases, identification of neurotoxicity hazard does not generally 
include subjects from either end of the human life span or from other than healthy subjects. 
Uncertainty factors are used to adjust for more sensitive populations. In addition, single or 
multigeneration reproductive studies in animals may provide a source of information on 
neurological disorders, behavioral changes, autonomical dysfunction, neuroanatomical 
anomalies, and other signs of neurotoxicity in the developing animal (chapter 4). 
5.2.1.3.3. Reversibility. For the most part, the basic principles of hazard identification are 
the same for neurotoxicity as for any adverse effect on health. One notable exception, 
however, concerns the issue of reversibility and the special consideration that must be given 
to the inherent redundancy and plasticity of the nervous system. 
For many health effects, temporary, as opposed to permanent, effects are repaired 
during a true recovery. Damage to many organ systems, if not severe, can be spontaneously 
repaired. For example, damaged liver cells that may result in impaired liver function often 
can be replaced with new cells that function normally. The resulting restoration of liver 
function can be viewed as recovery. In the central nervous system, cells generally do not 
recover from severe damage and new cells do not replace them. When nervous system 
recovery is observed, it may represent compensation requiring activation of cells that were 
previously performing some other function, reactive synaptogenesis, or recovery of 
moderately injured cells. While a damaged liver may recover due to the addition of new 
cells, severe damage to nervous system cells results in a net loss of cells. This loss of 
compensatory capacity may not be noticed for many years and, when it does appear, it may 
be manifest in a way seemingly unrelated to the original neurotoxic event. Lack of ability to 
recover from a neurotoxic event later in life or premature onset of signs of normal aging may 
result. It is therefore important to consider the possibility that significant damage to the 
nervous system may have occurred in experiments where effects appear to be reversible.

5.2.1.3.4. Weight of evidence. 


A ``weight of evidence'' approach to identifying an agent as 
a neurotoxic hazard is almost always necessary. With the exception of therapeutic products, 
a single, complete, controlled study of an agent's effects on the nervous system, conducted in 
an appropriate representative sample of humans, is rarely, if ever, possible. Rather, those 
individuals charged with identifying hazard are usually confronted with a collection of 
imperfect studies, often providing conflicting data (Barnes and Dourson, 1988). 
There are several possible approaches, depending on the quality of the evidence. 
Two examples are the use of data from only the most sensitive species tested and the use of 
data from only species responding most like the human for any given endpoint. In assessing 
neurotoxicity of therapeutic products, when human data are available and neurotoxic 
endpoints detected in animals can be clinically measured, the human findings supersede those 
of the nonclinical data base. Assuming that all available evidence is to be included, 
considerations necessary for formulating a conclusion include the relative weights that should 
be given to positive and negative studies. Sometimes positive studies are given more weight 
than negative ones, even when the quality of the studies is comparable. Experimental design 
factors such as the species tested, the number and gender of subjects evaluated, and the 
duration of the test are given different weights when data from different studies are 
combined. The route of exposure in a given study and its relevance to expected routes of 
human exposure are often a weighted factor. The issue of statistical significance is 
frequently debated. Some argue that an effect occurring at a statistically insignificant level 
may nevertheless represent a biologically or toxicologically significant event, and should be 
afforded the same weight as if the finding were statistically significant. In general, however, 
only statistically significant measures should be considered in hazard identification. The 
power of various statistical measures is also considered. 


5.2.2. Dose-Response Assessment 


In the second step of the risk assessment process, the dose-response assessment, the 
relationship between the extent of damage or toxicity and dose of a toxic substance for 
various conditions of exposure is determined. Because several different kinds of responses 
may be elicited by a single agent, more than one dose-response relationship may need to be 
developed (e.g., neurochemical and morphological parameters). 
When quantitative human dose-effect data are not available for a sufficient range of 
exposures, other methods must be used to estimate exposure levels likely to produce adverse 
effects in humans. In the absence of human data, the dose-response assessment may be 
based on tests performed in laboratory animals. Evidence for a dose-response relationship is 
an important criterion in assessing neurotoxicity, although this may be based on limited data 
from standard studies that often use only three dose groups and a control group (Barnes and 
Dourson, 1988). 
The most frequently used approach for risk assessment of neurotoxicants and other 
noncancer endpoints is the uncertainty- or safety-factor approach (Barnes and Dourson, 1988; 
Kimmel, 1990). For example, within the EPA, this approach involves the determination of 
reference doses (RfDs) by dividing a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) by 
uncertainty factors that presumably account for interspecies differences in sensitivity (Barnes 
and Dourson, 1988). Generally, an uncertainty factor of 10 is used to allow for the 
potentially higher sensitivity in humans than in animals and another uncertainty factor of 10 
is used to allow for variability in sensitivity among humans. Hence, the RfD is equal to the 
NOAEL divided by 100. If the NOAEL cannot be established, it is replaced by the lowest 
observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) in the RfD calculation and an additional uncertainty 
factor of 10 is introduced (i.e., the RfD equals the LOAEL divided by 1000). 
If more than one effect is observed in the animal bioassays, the effect occurring at the 
lowest dose in the most sensitive animal species and gender is generally used as the basis for 
estimating the RfD (OTA, 1990). Sometimes, different RfDs can be calculated, depending 
on endpoint or species selected. Selection of safety factors may be influenced by several 
considerations, including data available from humans, weight of evidence, type of toxic 
insult, and probability of variations in responses among susceptible populations (e.g., very 
young or very old). Established guidelines have been accepted by several agencies that use 
the safety-factor approach to account for intraspecies variability, cross-species extrapolation, 
and exposure duration. In some instances, comparisons between these predicted values and 
experimental data have been conducted and the results appear comparable for some selected 
examples (Dourson and Stara, 1983; McMillan, 1987). 
The uncertainty-factor approach is based on the assumption that a threshold does 
exist, that there is a dose below which an effect does not change in incidence or severity. 
The threshold concept is complicated and controversial. As described by Sette and MacPhail 
(1992), there are several different ways in which the term threshold is used. Thresholds are 
defined, in part, by the limit of detection of an assay. As the sensitivity of the analytical 
method or bioassay is improved, the threshold might be adjusted downward, indicating that 
the true threshold had not been previously determined. 
Another problem inherent with an observation of no discernible effects at low doses is 
that it is impossible to determine whether the risk is actually zero (i.e., the dose is below a 
threshold dose) or whether the statistical resolving power of a study is inadequate to detect 
small risks (Gaylor and Slikker, 1992). Every study has a statistical limit of detection that 
depends on the number of individuals or animals involved. For example, it would be 
relatively unusual to conduct an experiment on a neurotoxicant with as many as 100 animals 
per dose. If no deleterious effects were observed in 100 animals at a particular dose, it 
might be concluded that this dose level is below the threshold dose. However, we can only 
be 95 percent confident that the true risk is less than 0.03. That is, if 3 percent of the 
animals in a population actually develop a toxic effect at this dose, there is a 5 percent 
chance that a group of 100 animals would not show any effect. The observation of no toxic 
effects in an extremely large sample of 1,000 animals only indicates with 95 percent 
confidence that the true risk is less than 0.003, etc. Because thresholds cannot be 
realistically demonstrated, they are therefore assumed.

The notion of threshold may be useful in explaining mechanisms associated with 
specific types of toxicity. What little is known about mechanisms of neurotoxicity suggests 
that both threshold and nonthreshold scenarios are possible (Silbergeld, 1990). However, for 
one of the most studied neurotoxicants, lead, there has been a steady decline in exposure 
levels shown to have effects, suggesting to some that no threshold dose is apparent (Bondy, 
1985). Sette and MacPhail (1992) also consider the threshold as a mathematical assumption 
and as a population sensitivity and conclude that ``the idea of no threshold seems 
experimentally untestable. . . .'' 
The RfD approach relies on single experimental observations (the NOAEL or 
LOAEL) instead of complete dose-response curve data to calculate risk estimations. 
Chemical interactions with biological systems are often specific, stereoselective, and 
saturable. Examples include enzyme-substrate binding leading to substrate metabolism, 
transport, and receptor-binding, any or all of which may be a requirement of an agent's 
effect or toxicity. Therefore, a chemical's dose-response curve may not be linear. The 
certainty of low-dose extrapolation has been determined to be markedly affected by the shape 
of the dose-response curve (Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committee on Protocols 
for Safety Evaluation, 1971). Therefore, the appropriate use of dose-response curve data 
should enhance the certainty of risk estimations when thresholds are not assumed or 
determined. 
Dose-response models have generated considerable interest as more appropriate and 
quantitative alternatives to the safety-factor approach in risk assessment. Rather than 
routinely applying a ``fixed'' safety factor to the NOAEL (based on a single dose) to obtain a 
``safe'' dose, another approach uses data from the entire dose-response curve. 
Two fundamentally different approaches in the use of dose-response data to estimate 
risk have been developed. Dews and coworkers (Dews, 1986; Glowa and Dews, 1987; 
Glowa et al., 1983) and Crump (1984) demonstrated an approach in which they used 
information on the shape of the dose-response curve to estimate levels of exposure associated 
with relatively small effects (i.e., a 1, 5, or 10 percent change in a biological endpoint). 
Both Dews and Crump fit a mathematical function to the data and provided an estimate of the 
variability in exposure levels associated with a relatively small effect. 
An alternative approach developed by Gaylor and Slikker (1990) first establishes a 
mathematical relationship between a biological effect and the dose of a given chemical. The 
second step determines the distribution (variability) of individual measurements of biological 
effects about the dose-response curve. The third step statistically defines an adverse or 
``abnormal'' level of a biological effect in an untreated population. The fourth step estimates 
the probability of an adverse or abnormal level as a function of dose utilizing the information 
from the first three steps. The advantages of these dose-response models are that they 
encourage the generation and use of data needed to define a complete dose-response curve. 
Although more quantitative dose-response assessment models have emerged in recent 
years, uncertainty remains as to what biological endpoints from which species with what 
dosing regimen should be analyzed. Within a species, a given agent may produce a variety 
of effects, including neurochemical, neuropathological, and behavioral effects. In other 
instances, a chemical may produce alterations of one endpoint but not others (Slikker et al., 
1989). Species selection may also dramatically affect the outcome of risk assessments. The 
Parkinson-like syndrome produced by single doses of MPTP in the human or nonhuman 
primate is not observed in rats given comparable MPTP doses (Kopin and Markey, 1988). 
Although endpoint and species selection appear to have a tremendous effect on the outcome 
of an assessment, only a few studies have systematically investigated the effect on assessment 
outcome of varying either the species or the endpoint within a species (McMillan, 1987; 
Hattis and Shapiro, 1990; Gaylor and Slikker, 1992).

5.2.3. Exposure Assessment 



This step of the risk assessment process determines the source, route, dose, and 
duration of human exposure to an agent. The results of the dose-response assessment are 
combined with an estimate of human exposure to obtain a quantitative estimate of risk. As 
either the effect of or the exposure to an agent approaches zero, the risk of neurotoxicity 
approaches zero. It should be recognized that exposures to multiple agents may produce 
synergistic or additive effects. 

Exposure can occur via many routes, including ingestion, inhalation, or contact with 
skin. Sources of exposure may include soil, food, air, water, or intended vehicle (e.g., drug 
formulation). The degree of exposure may be strongly influenced by a number of factors, 
for example, the occupation of the individual involved. 

The duration of exposure (i.e., acute or chronic) and interval of exposure (i.e., 
episodic or continuous) are variables of exposure that are common to all types of risk 
assessments, including carcinogenicity (OSTP, 1985). 

Although not routinely used, biological markers or biomarkers of exposure could 
theoretically improve the exposure assessment process and, thereby, improve the overall risk 
assessment of neurotoxicants. Exposure biomarkers may include either the quantitation of 
exogenous agents or the complex of endogenous substances and exogenous agents within the 
system (Committee on Biological Markers, 1987). A limited number of examples of 
biomarkers of exposure have been reviewed by Slikker (1991) and include blood or dentine 
lead concentrations (Needleman, 1987), cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of dopamine 
metabolites following MPTP administration (Kopin and Markey, 1988), cerebrospinal fluid 
concentrations of a serotonin metabolite following MDMA exposure (Ricaurte et al., 1986), 
and serum esterase concentrations following organophosphate exposure (Levine et al., 
1986). The use of muscarinic receptor binding in peripheral plasma lymphocytes has also 
been described as a potential biomarker of exposure for the organophosphates (Costa et al., 
1990). These examples suggest that biomarkers of exposure are available for some agents, 
but more effort will be required to demonstrate that these biomarkers can routinely be used 
to improve the exposure assessment process. 



5.2.4. Risk Characterization 



The final step of the risk assessment process combines the hazard identification, the 
dose-response assessment, and the exposure assessment to produce the characterization of 
risk. As previously stated, the current practice is to divide the NOAEL by the appropriate 
safety factor to obtain the RfD. The magnitudes of the safety factors used to determine RfDs 
[interspecies extrapolation (10), intraspecies extrapolation (10), and acute vs. chronic 
exposure (10) = 1000] are based more on conservative estimates than on actual data 
(Sheehan et al., 1989; McMillan, 1987) and have been questioned for empirical reasons 
(Gaylor and Slikker, 1990). Uncertainty factors may be decreased as more data become 
available. Modifying factors are also employed under certain circumstances to account for 
the completeness of data sets. Along with this RfD numerical value, any uncertainties and 
assumptions inherent in the risk assessment should also be stated (OTA, 1990). Although the 
RfD provides a single numerical value, it does not provide information concerning the 
uncertainty of this number nor does the RfD approach attempt to estimate the potential risk 
as a function of dose or consider the potential risk at the NOAEL. The risk at the NOAEL 
generally is greater than zero and has been estimated to be as high as about 5 percent 
(Crump, 1984; Gaylor, 1989). Concern has been expressed that the application of the RfD 
approach to all neurotoxicants is unlikely to be biologically defensible in light of mechanistic 
data (NRC, 1992). Several other quantitative risk assessment procedures have recently 
emerged as alternatives to the RfD approach (Kimmel and Gaylor, 1988). 

Quantitative risk assessment may be defined as a data-based process that uses dose-response information and measurements
of human exposure to arrive at estimates of risk. 
Assumptions are required to extrapolate results from high to low doses, to extrapolate from 
animal results to humans, and to extrapolate across different routes and durations of 
exposure. 

In a step toward quantitative risk assessment, Crump (1984) suggested the use of a 
benchmark dose defined as ``a statistical lower confidence limit corresponding to a small 
increase in effect over the background level.'' The benchmark dose is determined with a 
mathematical model and is less affected by the particular shape of the dose-response curve. 
Although the benchmark approach avoids several problems inherent in the RfD approach 
(e.g., lack of precision in defining the LOAEL; Kimmel, 1990), the same final step of 
dividing by arbitrary safety factors is obligatory. 

Another approach to quantitative risk assessment is the statistical or curve-fitting 
approach. If quantal information concerning the proportion of response at a given dose is 
available but mechanistic information is lacking, statistical models can be used to fit 
population data (Wyzga, 1990). This approach has been used to fit various models to data of 
lead toxicity. The data were sufficient to allow discrimination of several models in terms of 
goodness of fit; the nerve-conduction velocity data from children exposed to environmental 
lead as a function of blood lead concentration fit a ``hockey-stick'' type dose-response curve 
rather than a logistic or quadratic model (Schwartz et al., 1988). These statistical approaches 
not only provide a method to extrapolate data to lower exposure conditions but also can 
provide circumstantial evidence to support a proposed mechanism of action. 

The development of quantitative risk assessment approaches depends, in part, on the 
availability of information on the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of the agent in 
question. In the development of a biologically based, dose-response model for MDMA 
neurotoxicity, Slikker and Gaylor (1990) considered several factors, including the 
pharmacokinetics of the parent chemical, the target tissue concentrations of the parent 
chemical or its bioactivated proximate toxicant, the uptake kinetics of the parent chemical or 
metabolite into the target cell and membrane interactions, and the interaction of the chemical 
or metabolite with presumed receptor site(s). Because these theoretical factors contain a 
saturable step due to limited amounts of required enzyme, reuptake, or receptor site(s), a 
nonlinear, saturable dose-response curve was predicted. In this case of neurochemical effects 
of MDMA in the rodent, saturation mechanisms were hypothesized and indeed saturation 
curves provided relatively good fits to the experimental results. The conclusion was that use 
of dose-response models based on plausible biological mechanisms provide more validity to 
prediction than purely empirical models. Concomitant with attempts to develop quantitative 
risk assessment procedures, it is imperative that regulatory policy or risk management 
procedures also be developed to use appropriately the type of data generated by quantitative 
risk assessment. However, until alternative risk assessment procedures have been validated, 
the available RfD approach with its limitations will most likely continue to be used. 



5.3. Generic Assumptions and Uncertainty Reduction 



The purpose of risk assessment is to determine the risk associated with human 
exposure to a hazard. The quality of the data from toxicological studies differs. In the case 
of therapeutic products where human effects information is available, risk assessments rely 
primarily on the result of controlled clinical trials. Even when clinical trial data are 
available, however, conducting a risk assessment is complicated by many uncertainties. In 
the face of these uncertainties, conservative assumptions are usually made at several steps in 
the risk assessment process. For example, unless adequate clinical data are available, the 
most sensitive experimental species is frequently used. While conservative assumptions may 
lead to a risk assessment that adequately protects the human population, this may result in an 
increased financial burden on the public (e.g., manufacturing costs or loss of jobs); even then 
it is impossible to be certain that the total population will be protected. Conversely, errors 
leading to allowable exposure levels that are too high reduce the safety margin for human 
health and increase health care costs. Thus, there are compelling public health and economic 
reasons to obtain more precise risk assessments; all assumptions cannot be completely 
eliminated, but the degree of uncertainty associated with certain specific assumptions can at 
least be reduced (Sheehan et al., 1989).

Risk assessment for neurotoxicity shares many common features with other noncancer 
toxicities such as developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity. As such, there are several 
generic assumptions that apply to all traditional, noncancer endpoint risk assessment 
procedures (Table 5-1).

<TEXT>
 

One approach to reducing some of the uncertainties is to critically define and examine 
the assumptions made in the risk assessment process. Several of the more generic of these 
assumptions are listed in Table 5-1. Despite their diversity, these assumptions share the 
attribute of being partially replaceable by factual information. If, for example, the 
assumption of 100 percent absorption of a toxicant from a contaminated food source is 
replaced by data demonstrating that 90 percent of the toxicant is not biologically available 
under human exposure conditions, then a revised risk assessment could allow a 10-fold 
greater exposure from that source; i.e., the former risk assessment was too conservative by a 
factor of 10. As another example, many risk assessments employ data from two species. 

If experimental animals and humans absorb or metabolize the same fraction of a dose, 
the potency estimate would not change when extrapolating from animals to humans. 
Therefore, it is necessary to have information on both human and animal rates before 
changes in potency estimates are made. If a toxicant acts via a reactive intermediate and 
humans produce 10-fold more of the intermediate than either of the test species under similar 
conditions, then allowable human exposure should be decreased 10-fold (i.e., the allowable 
exposure levels are 10-fold too high) or an increased danger to human health exists. These 
findings could then replace the ``most sensitive species'' principle with facts concerning 
relevant human exposure and susceptibility. In these examples, the identification of the 
assumption helps define research needs or knowledge gaps (Sheehan et al., 1989). 


In general, the knowledge gaps are many and complex, but some can be filled with 
practical solutions. The combination of ample dose-response data and a quantitative risk 
assessment process can eliminate assumptions 1 (existence of a threshold) and 2 
(reasonableness of safety factors) of the six generic assumptions (Table 5-1). The uncertainty 
of assumption 4 (exposure comparisons) could be at least reduced with the proper application 
of appropriate pharmacokinetic data. Likewise, the uncertainty of generic assumption 3 
(variability of heterogeneous populations) can theoretically be reduced with the use of 
biomarkers of exposure and biomarkers of effect, to more accurately define the relationship 
between exposure and biological effect in a large population. 

Many assumptions remain, however, and uncertainty reduction by filling knowledge 
gaps will ultimately require greater understanding of biological mechanisms underlying 
neurotoxicity. A single risk assessment model may not be adequate for all conditions of 
exposure, for all endpoints, or for all agents. Risk assessment models of the future may well 
include biomarkers of both effect and exposure as well as biologically based mechanistic 
considerations derived from both epidemiologic and experimental test system data.

6. General Summary 



It is now generally accepted that some chemicals, including industrial agents, 
pesticides, therapeutic agents, drugs of abuse, food-related chemicals, and cosmetic 
ingredients, can have adverse effects on the structure and function of the nervous system. It 
has recently been proposed that exposure to neurotoxicants might also be associated with Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's
disease. Several Federal agencies have initiated research 
programs in neurotoxicology, developed neurotoxicology testing guidelines, and used 
neurotoxic endpoints to regulate chemicals in the environment and workplace. 

The scientific basis for identifying and characterizing chemical-induced neurotoxicity 
has advanced rapidly during the last several years. The manifestation of neurotoxicity 
depends on the relationship between exposure (applied dose) and the dose at the site of toxic 
action (delivered or target dose) and response. Chemical-induced changes in the structure or 
function of the nervous system at the cellular or molecular level can be observed as 
alterations in sensory, motor, or cognitive function at the level of the whole organism. 
Several important features about the nervous system make it particularly vulnerable to 
chemical insult, including differential susceptibilities at different stages of maturation, the 
presence of blood brain and nerve barriers that may be the target of toxic action, high 
metabolic rate, and limited regenerative capability following damage. 

Methods devised to detect and quantify agent-induced changes in nervous system 
function in humans include clinical evaluations and neurotoxicity testing methods such as 
neurobehavioral, neurophysiological, neurochemical, imaging, and self-reporting procedures. 
Experimental approaches used in human neurotoxicology include epidemiological studies and, 
to a limited extent, human laboratory exposure studies. There are several important 
unresolved issues in human neurotoxicology, including the development of commonly 
accepted risk assessment criteria and animal-to-human extrapolation. 

It is generally assumed that if physical or chemical-induced neurotoxicity is observed 
in animal models, then neurotoxicity will be produced in humans. Considerable research has 
been performed to demonstrate the validity of many animal models in an experimental 
context and to show predictive validity. Methods in animal neurotoxicology are frequently 
used in a tier-testing framework with simpler, more cost-effective tests to screen or identify 
neurotoxic potential. In hazard identification, the presence of neurotoxicity at the first tier is 
used to make decisions about subsequent development of a chemical or about the need to 
conduct additional experiments to define the level at which neurotoxicity will be observed. 
A number of methods have been devised for studies in animal neurotoxicology, including 
neurobehavioral, neurophysiological, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical techniques. It is 
known that the neuroendocrine system may be affected adversely by neurotoxicants and that 
there are populations that are differentially vulnerable to neurotoxic agents. Considerable 
research is in progress to employ structure-activity relationships to predict neurotoxicity and 
newly developed in vitro procedures are being used to augment or complement currently 
existing in vivo approaches. 

Principles of risk assessment for neurotoxicity are evolving rapidly. At the present 
time, neurotoxicity risk assessment is generally limited to qualitative hazard identification. 
Neurotoxicological risk assessments have been generally based on a no observed adverse 
effect level and uncertainty factors. As with other noncancer endpoints, there is a need to 
consider more information about the shape of the dose-response curve and mechanisms of 
effect in quantitative neurotoxicology risk assessment. Research is needed to develop 
dose-response models that incorporate biologic information and mechanistic hypotheses into 
quantitative extrapolation of dose-response relationships across species and from high to low 
dose exposures.

Defense. Through advance arrangements in joint planning it is intended that the participants will provide capacity
to support a significant portion of surge and sustainment requirements in dry cargo or intermodal equipment emergencies.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The complete, draft text of VISA is published below. Copies of VISA and the associated application form are being sent,
unsolicited, to U.S.-owned companies which provide intermodal shipping services/systems. Copies also are available
to the public upon request. 



NOTICE OF MEETING: 

An open meeting for the purpose of developing the final text of VISA will convene at 2 p.m., Wednesday, August 31, 1994,
in Room 10234, Nassif Building, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.
Representatives of the maritime and intermodal transportation industry and interested members of the public are
invited to attend. Telephonic or facsimile notice of intent to attend, given to the point of contact above, will assure
adequate seating and more convenient access at security-controlled entrances.

Preface 


Pursuant to the authority contained in section 708 of the 
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2158) (Section 708), the Administrator, after consultation
with representatives of ocean carriers providing intermodal shipping services/systems and with representatives
of companies which lease containers, chassis and other intermodal equipment, has developed this standby agreement
for voluntary contribution of intermodal shipping services/systems needed to meet national defense requirements.

USTRANSCOM procures commercial shipping capacity to meet normal peacetime requirements for ships and intermodal
shipping services/systems through arrangements with common carriers (including services contracts), with contract
carriers and by charter. DOD, through USTRANSCOM, maintains and operates a fleet of ships owned by or under charter
to the Federal government, in sufficient numbers to meet those logistic needs of the military services which cannot
be met by commercial service. Ships of the RRF may be selectively activated for peacetime military tests and exercises,
and to satisfy military surge operational requirements which cannot be met by commercial shipping in time of war,
national emergency, or military contingency. Foreign-flag shipping may be used if no U.S.-flag ships can meet the
operational requirement. Through advance arrangements in joint planning described in IX. of this Agreement, it
is intended that Participants will provide capacity to support a significant portion of surge and sustainment requirements
in dry cargo and intermodal equipment emergencies. 
In time of war or national emergency, ships may be requisitioned under authority of section 902 of the Merchant Marine
Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1242) (Section 902). 
In some military contingency operations, more shipping capacity and related services may be required than are available
under peacetime arrangements, but general mobilization of shipping by requisition may not be appropriate. This
Agreement provides for the voluntary contribution of intermodal shipping services/systems in such a way as to distribute
the burden of such contributions in proportion to the capacity owned and controlled by each Participant. 
This Agreement will provide DOD with access to privately-owned intermodal shipping services/systems, will provide
door-to-door intermodal capacity, will create a pool of vessels, vessel capacity and intermodal equipment needed
in support of national defense activities and will provide Participants a defense to civil and criminal action for
violation of antitrust laws in carrying out this Agreement. 
This Agreement establishes the terms, conditions and general procedures under which each Participant agrees voluntarily
to make intermodal shipping services/systems available at the request of the Administrator. 
This Agreement is designed to create close working relationships among the Administrator, USTRANSCOM and Participants
through which military needs and the needs of the civil economy can be met by cooperative action. Participants are
allowed maximum flexibility to adjust commercial operations by cooperation, rationalization of services and pooling
of vessels, vessel capacity and intermodal equipment,

 Provided,

 such measures are approved, in advance, by the Administrator. 
The shipping capacity made available voluntarily under this Agreement may be supplemented by ships requisitioned,
under Section 902, from non-Participants in this Agreement and from Participants. 
The containers and chassis made available voluntarily under this Agreement may be supplemented by services and equipment
accessed by the Administrator through the provisions of 46 CFR Part 340. 
The SecDef will be asked to concur in this Agreement at the appropriate stage. SecDef will be asked to approve this Agreement
as a sealift readiness program for the purpose of section 909 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C.
1248) (Section 909). Withdrawal from or termination of participation in this Agreement does not excuse a Participant
from Section 909 or any other provision of law if said withdrawn or terminated Participant is otherwise subject thereto.

The Director, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Chairman, has concurred in this Agreement. 


Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement 
I. Purpose 


This Agreement establishes procedures for the contribution of intermodal shipping services/systems to satisfy
DOD needs. This Agreement will change from standby to active status upon a joint determination by the Secretary and
SecDef that a dry cargo shipping capacity emergency or an intermodal equipment emergency affecting the national
defense exists; that the defense requirement cannot be met by voluntary arrangements other than this Agreement;
and that the requirement can be met more efficiently by activating this Agreement than by requisitioning ships under
Section 902. 
This Agreement includes all intermodal shipping services/systems and all intermodal ship types, including container,
partial container, container/bulk, container/roll-on/roll-off, roll-on/roll-off and barge carrier (LASH,
SeaBee, etc.). Breakbulk ships may be enrolled in this Agreement at the discretion of the Administrator. When consideration
is being given to diverting intermodal shipping services/systems from commercial to defense use, an ocean carrier's
entire contribution will be considered. The object of this Agreement is to promote and facilitate the use of entire
intermodal transportation systems and to maximize DOD's use of commercial transportation resources while at the
same time attempting to minimize disruption to commercial operations. The Agreement does, however, provide for
the utilization of components of such systems (e.g., particular ship types) as necessary. Through advanced arrangements
developed during peacetime joint planning described in section IX of this Agreement, it is intended that Participants
will provide capability to support a significant portion of surge and sustainment requirements in dry cargo intermodal
equipment emergencies.

Section 708 of the Defense Production Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2158); Executive Order 12919, 59 FR 29525, June
7, 1994; Executive Order 12148, 3 CFR 1979 Comp., p. 412, as amended; 44 CFR Part 332; DOT Order 1900.8; 46 CFR Part 340.


Section 501 of Executive Order 12919 delegated the authority of the President under Section 708 to the Secretary,
among others. By DOT Order 1900.8, the Secretary delegated to the Administrator the authority under which this Agreement
is sponsored. 



III. General 



A. 

Need for this Agreement

_1. The Administrator has found, in accordance with Section 708(c)(1), that conditions exist which may pose a direct
threat to the national defense of the United States or its preparedness programs and, under the provisions of Section
708, has certified to the Attorney General that a standby voluntary agreement for utilization of intermodal shipping
services/systems is necessary for the national defense. 

2. The quantity of military dry cargo (unit equipment, sustaining supplies and ammunition) to be moved for support
of a military contingency, national emergency, or war in a foreign area could exceed the shipping capacity normally
available for charter or use from the commercial sector. It is desirable to avoid the disruptive effects of ship requisition
and of intermodal equipment allocation so long as military requirements can be met by voluntary cooperation between
the maritime industry and the Federal government. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Chairman, has issued
a finding that dry cargo capacity to meet national defense requirements cannot be provided by the industry through
a voluntary agreement having less anti-competitive effects or without a voluntary agreement. 

B. 

History of this Agreement

_The concept of this Agreement originated in discussions between MARAD and DOD officials on arrangements to promote
timely availability of ships, equipment and management services needed to operate them. Most U.S.-flag shipping
companies operate ships as part of an integrated land/ocean transportation system. In times of emergency, DOD needs
not only vessels and intermodal equipment, but also the management expertise to operate such assets as transportation
systems. 

It is anticipated that the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1101 

et seq

.) will be amended in accordance with H.R. 4003 to provide for operating agreements between vessel owners or operators
and the Secretary. This Agreement will constitute an Emergency Preparedness Program within the meaning of the amended
Title VI of the Act proposed in H.R. 4003. This Agreement will constitute a sealift readiness program when approved
by the SecDef and will meet all the conditions set forth under Section 909. An ocean carrier which is a Participant in
this Agreement is eligible for award of a Shipping Agreement or a Container Agreement from MSC without enrollment
in any other program. An ocean carrier eligible to participate in this Agreement but which elects not to do so is subject
to enrollment in the MSC Sealift Readiness Program (SRP) if it (1) receives operating-differential subsidy or construction-differential
subsidy or (2) wishes to carry DOD cargo. A carrier, while a Participant in this Agreement, will be subject only to the
provisions of this Agreement and not to the provisions of the SRP. 

C. 

Participation

_1. An ocean carrier may become a Participant by submitting an executed copy of the form referenced in XI. below. Any
ocean carrier organized under the laws of a State of the United States, or the District of Columbia, may be a Participant.


2. A company which owns, or has obtained through lease, intermodal equipment may become a Participant by submitting
an executed copy of the form referenced in XI. below. Such a company must be organized under the laws of a State of the
United States or the District of Columbia. 

3. The term ``Participant'' includes the entity signing this Agreement and all United States subsidiaries and affiliates
of that entity which own, operate, charter, or lease ships and intermodal equipment in the regular course of their
business and in which the entity holds a controlling interest. 

4. The term ``Participant'' also includes the controlled non-domestic subsidiaries and affiliates of the entity
signing this Agreement; 

Provided

, that the Administrator grants specific approval for their inclusion. 

5. An entity having an operating agreement with the Secretary shall be a ``Participant.'' 

6. An entity electing to place itself in a readiness program, such as Section 909 or Section 1202(c) of the Merchant
Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1282(c)), shall, upon signing this Agreement, be a ``Participant.''

7. Periodically, a list of Participants will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 

D. 

Effective Date and Duration of Participation

_Participation in this Agreement is effective upon execution of the application form by both the Participant and
the Administrator, or their designees, and remains in effect until terminated by the Administrator, the Attorney
General, or the Director, on due notice by letter, telegram, or publication in the 

Federal Register

, or until the Participant withdraws. 

E. 

Withdrawal from this Agreement

_A Participant may withdraw from this Agreement, subject to fulfillment of obligations incurred under this Agreement
prior to the date such withdrawal becomes effective, by giving 30 days written notice to the Administrator; 

Provided however

, that a Participant having an operating agreement with the Secretary will not withdraw from this Agreement during
the period the operating agreement is in effect. Withdrawal from this Agreement will not deprive a Participant of
an antitrust defense otherwise available to it in accordance with Section 708. Withdrawal by a Participant subject
to authorities referred to in C.6. above merely revives direct application of those authorities to the Participant
at withdrawal. 

F. 

Standby Period

_The ``standby period'' is the interval between the effective date of the Administrator's acceptance of an application
and the date of activation of this Agreement as prescribed in VIII. below. The Administrator's acceptance of an application
does not have or imply any constraint or other effect on the Participant's business operations during the standby
period. 

G. 

Rules and Regulations

_A Participant acknowledges and agrees to abide by all provisions of Section 708, and regulations related thereto
which are promulgated by the Secretary, the Attorney General, the Chairman and the Director. Standards and procedures
pertaining to voluntary agreements have been promulgated in 44 CFR Part 332. Note is taken that 46 CFR Part 340 establishes
procedures for assigning the priority for use and the allocation of shipping services, containers and chassis. The
Administrator will inform Participants of new and amended rules and regulations as they are issued. 

H. 

Modification/Amendment of this Agreement

_The Attorney General may modify this Agreement, in writing, after consultation with the Chairman and the Administrator.
The Administrator may modify this Agreement, in writing, with the concurrence or at the direction of the Director
after consultation with the Attorney General and the Chairman. Modifications initiated by the Administrator will
be submitted to the Director with the concurrence of the representative of SecDef. If modification of IX. below is
proposed, the Administrator will also seek the concurrence of USTRANSCOM. USTRANSCOM or a Participant may propose
amendments to this Agreement at any time. 

I. 

Administrative Expenses

_Administrative and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by a Participant during the standby period shall be borne solely
by the Participant. Such expenses may include, among other things, traveling to meetings, making reports of owned,
chartered and leased intermodal ships and equipment as contemplated in VI.E. below and keeping records as contemplated
in III.J. below. 

J. 

Record Keeping

_1. MARAD and USTRANSCOM have primary responsibility for maintaining records in accordance with 44 CFR Part 332.


2. The Director of MARAD's Office of National Security Plans shall be the official custodian of records related to
the carrying out of this Agreement. 

3. In accordance with 44 CFR 332.3(d), a Participant shall maintain for five (5) years all minutes of meetings, transcripts,
records, documents and other data, including any communications with other Participants or with any other member
of the industry or their representatives, related to the carrying out of this Agreement. Each Participant agrees
to make available to the Administrator, the Attorney General, the Director and the Chairman for inspection and copying
at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice any item that the Participant is required hereby to maintain. Any record
maintained by MARAD or USTRANSCOM under this subsection shall be available for public inspection and copying unless
exempted on the grounds specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1), (3) and (4) or identified as privileged and confidential
information in accordance with Section 708(e). 

K. 

Requisition of Ships of Non-Participants

_The Administrator may requisition ships of non-Participants to supplement capacity made available under this
Agreement and to balance the economic burden of defense support among ocean carriers. 

L. 

Plan of Action

_The Participants, under the leadership of the Administrator, or the Administrator's designee, shall adopt one
or more documents to implement this Agreement. Documents to implement this Agreement shall be styled ``Plan of Action.




IV. Antitrust Defense 



A. Under the provisions of Section 708, each Participant in this Agreement shall have available as a defense to any
civil or criminal action brought under the antitrust laws (or any similar law of any State) with respect to any action
taken to develop or carry out this Agreement or a Plan of Action, that such act was taken in the course of developing or
carrying out this Agreement or a Plan of Action and that the Participant complied with the provisions of Section 708
and any regulation thereunder, and acted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or a Plan of Action. 

B. This defense shall not be available to the Participant for any action occurring after termination of this Agreement.
Nor shall it be available upon the modification of this Agreement with respect to any subsequent action that is beyond
the scope of the modified text of this Agreement, except that no such modification shall be accomplished in a way that
will deprive the Participant of antitrust defense for the fulfillment of obligations incurred. 

C. The defense shall be available only if and to the extent that the person asserting it demonstrates that the action
was within the scope of this Agreement or a Plan of Action. 

D. The person asserting the defense bears the burden of proof.

<TEXT>
 

E. The defense shall not be available if the person against whom it is asserted shows that the action was taken for the
purpose of violating the antitrust laws. 

F. As appropriate, the Administrator will support applications by Participants to the Federal Maritime Commission
or the Interstate Commerce Commission to exempt this Agreement and any Plan of Action from the operation of statutes
administered by either agency. 



V. Breach of Contract Defense 



Under the provisions of Section 708, in any action in any Federal or State court for breach of contract, there shall
be available as a defense that the alleged breach of contract was caused predominantly by action taken by a Participant
during an emergency to carry out this Agreement or a Plan of Action. Such defense shall not release the party asserting
it from any obligation under applicable law to mitigate damages to the greatest extent possible. 



VI. Terms and Conditions 



A. 

Agreement by Participant

_1. Each Participant agrees to contribute intermodal shipping services/systems in accordance with this Agreement
and any Plan of Action applicable to the Participant and at such times and in such amounts as the Administrator shall
determine to be necessary to meet essential needs of DOD for transportation of military supplies and equipment during
the period this Agreement is activated. 

2. Participant agrees to provide all necessary elements to operate the intermodal transportation services/systems
it contributes. 

3. Each participant agrees to provide, on request, management services needed to operate the contributed intermodal
transportation services/systems; including inland container and trailer and other services, for the movement
to and from ports of equipment which is owned, operated, or controlled by a Participant. 

4. Whenever possible, the Participant which owns, operates, or controls a ship or ship capacity contributed will
provide the intermodal equipment and management services needed to utilize the ship at full efficiency. However,
upon the recommendation of the Committee and at the Administrator's discretion, the ships and intermodal equipment
of a Participant may be placed under the operational management and control of another Participant. 

B. 

Pooling Resources

_Each Participant agrees to make intermodal shipping services/systems and intermodal equipment available to other
Participants when requested by the Administrator, on the advice of the Committee. Such requests will be made in order
to meet the defense requirement, to ensure that overall contributions are made on a proportionate basis, and to assure
that no Participant is unduly hampered in meeting the needs of the civil economy consistent with priorities established
by the President. 

Participants may agree to cooperate, to rationalize services and to pool intermodal assets in order to meet the defense
requirement, equalize the burden of the contribution and insure continued support to the civil economy; 

Provided,

 however, that such activities involving Participants in the normal course of business when this Agreement has not
been activated and not to facilitate meeting requirements or requests of the Administrator are not covered by this
Agreement. 

C. 

Equitable Contribution of Shipping Capacity

_1. Each Participant agrees to contribute ships and ship's space under this Agreement in accordance with VIII.B.1.
and 2. below. The contribution should be in the proportion of its ``controlled tonnage'' in each shipping capacity
category to the total ``controlled tonnage'' of all Participants in each such category. Because exact proportions
may not be feasible, and because unique requirements for a particular category of ships or capacity may arise, each
Participant agrees that variations are permissible at the discretion of the Administrator. Any Participant may
offer to increase its contribution. 

2. ``Controlled tonnage'' consists of: 

a. Ships which are owned or chartered in by a Participant and documented under United States law; 

b. 

PLUS 

non-U.S.-documented feeder ships, in which a Participant or any of its subsidiaries or controlled affiliates has
a controlling interest and which are operated as an extension of U.S.-flag line haul service; 

c. 

PLUS 

any other non-U.S.-flag ships which a Participant may offer to designate as ``controlled tonnage'' and to which the
Administrator agrees; and 

d. 

LESS 

ships owned or controlled by a Participant which are chartered, leased, or contracted out to others for remaining
periods of at least six months from the effective date of activation of this Agreement and for which there is no termination
clause for war, national emergency, or military contingency. 

3. The laws of the country of documentation may require the approval of that government before ships on its register
can be covered by this Agreement. The Participant agrees to make a good faith effort to obtain the required approval.


4. The categories of ships are: 

a. Roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) ships. RO/RO ships which do not have installed ramps should be supplied with portable
ramps, to the extent practicable, by the Participant. 

b. Combination container-RO/RO ships. 

c. Barge carriers (LASH, SeaBee, etc.) The appropriate number of lighters should be supplied to operate the vessel
at full efficiency. 

d. Containerships, both self-sustaining and non-self-sustaining. Three containers should be provided per container
space. 

e. Partial containerships and container bulk. Three containers should be provided per container space. 

f. Breakbulk ships. 

5. The contribution of each Participant shall be calculated by the Administrator as soon as possible after this Agreement
is activated. The following standards will be used to determine proportionate contributions of ``controlled tonnage'':


a. 

RO/RO ships

_Square feet (meters) of cargo deck area.

<PARENT> FR940817-2-00114 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. 

Combination container_RO/RO

_Square feet (meters) and container capacity (expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units). 

c. 

Barge Carrier

_Cargo deadweight capacity. 

d. 

Partial containerships and container bulk

_Cargo deadweight. 

e. 

Self-sustaining containerships

_Total below deck and on deck container capacity (expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units). 

f. 

Non-self-sustaining containerships

_Total below deck and on deck container capacity (expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units). 

g. 

Breakbulk ships

_Cargo deadweight. 

6. A ship on charter to a Participant shall not be subject to contribution under this Agreement in the case where the
period of contribution would be longer than the remaining term of the Participant's charter or in a case where the contribution
would otherwise breach the terms of the charter party, but such tonnage shall be included in the calculation of the
Participant's controlled tonnage. 

7. The ``controlled tonnage'' of each Participant shall be divided into two categories: 

a. 

Level I

_Vessels of the Participant which are: 

i. Subject to Title VI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1171 

et seq.

) It is anticipated that Title VI will be amended in accordance with H.R. 4003 to provide for operating agreements between
vessel owners or operators and the Secretary. Vessels covered by an operating agreement are in Level I. 

ii. Otherwise required by law to be made available to meet national defense requirements. 

b. 

Level II

_All other vessels of the Participant. 

Level I vessels shall be provided immediately in response to the call of the Administrator and instructions of the
Administrator are to be observed with the utmost dispatch. Level I vessels will be called into service before Level
II vessels. 

Level II vessels shall be provided according to the schedule set forth in the call of the Administrator. Level II vessels
will be called into service if and when Level I vessels actually provided are not sufficient to meet the emergency.
A Participant may offer Level II vessels for service as Leve
