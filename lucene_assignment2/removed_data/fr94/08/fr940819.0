Federal Crop Insurance Corporation





Common Crop Insurance Regulations; Regulations for the 1994 and Subsequent Crop Years



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby amends the Common Crop Insurance Regulations. The number of
years a policy does not earn a premium without policy termination is changed from one year to three years. The intended
effect of this amendment is to allow a producer to rotate crops without policy cancellation. The arbitration procedures
are amended to apply to all disagreements on factual determinations and be in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association. Currently, the arbitration procedures apply only to disagreement on production to be
counted. The intended effect of this amendment is to broaden the applicability of arbitration procedures to other
possible disagreements under such policies.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation
1512-1. This action constitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations
under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is November 1, 1999.



A summary of this rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to be determined if it meets the
requirements of a ``significant regulation'' as defined by Executive Order 12866.

Executive Order 12612, Federalism. This rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. The policies and procedures contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects
on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various
levels of government.

Under Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) these regulations will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulatory revision is limited to reinsured companies and their
agents and crop producers insured under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.). Therefore,
this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis was prepared.

This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450.

This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24,
1983.

The Office of General Counsel has certified to OMB that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided
in subsections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this rule will preempt state and local
laws to the extent such state and local laws are inconsistent herewith. The administrative appeal provisions located
at 7 CFR part 400, subpart J must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought.

This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety.
Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.

Following publication of this rule as proposed, the public was given 60 days in which to submit comments, data, and
opinions. No comments were received, accordingly, this rule is hereby issued as final.

Military Whistleblower Protection



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary of Defense, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule implements Section 843 of Public Law 102-190, ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Years 1992-1993,'' December 5, 1991. It expands military whistleblower protection to those who make disclosures
to an audit, inspection, investigation or law enforcement organization, as well as to an Inspector General or a Member
of Congress. This rule also specifies that reprisal for whistleblowing is punishable under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice and removes 32 CFR part 98a.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Due to an administrative oversight the final rule was not previously published.




It has been certified that this rule is not a significant regulation action. The rule does not:

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in this Executive Order.

It has been determined that this rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because this rule
does not exert a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is made
based on the fact that the rule merely modifies the current regulation to ensure that policy and procedures with regard
to military whistleblower protection conform with the requirements under 10 U.S.C. 1034. These procedures involve
reporting and investigating allegations of reprisal for protected disclosures made by military members of the armed
forces to appropriate authorities.

It has been certified that 32 CFR parts 92 and 98a do not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).



List of Subjects in 32 CFR Parts 92 and 98a



Administrative practice and procedure; Investigations; Military personnel; Whistleblowing.




1. Accordingly, by the authority of 10 U.S.C. 301, 32 CFR part 98a is removed.

(1) Implement a regulation that provides that a violation of the prohibition against taking, withholding, or threatening
to take or withhold a personnel action in reprisal for making or preparing a lawful communication by a person subject
to 10 U.S.C. Chapter 47 (the Uniform Code of Military Justice) is punishable as a violation of 10 U.S.C. 892 (Article
92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice). The implementing regulation shall also provide that such a violation
by a DoD civilian employee is punishable under regulations governing disciplinary or adverse action.

(2) On receipt of a report of investigation from the IG, DoD, that concludes that a member suffered reprisal, and when
implementation of the recommendations requires action by a BCMR, advise that member that assistance in preparing
an application to the BCMR may be sought from the legal office supporting the member's command.

(3) Ensure that the Military Department IG:

(i) On receipt of a member's allegation of reprisal for making or preparing a protected disclosure, expeditiously
investigates that allegation. No investigation is required when such allegation is submitted more than 60 days after
a member became aware of that personnel action that is the subject of the allegation.

about the allegation, the relevant documents acquired during the investigation, and summaries of interviews conducted.

(iv) For all other investigations of alleged reprisal against a member for making or preparing a protected disclosure,
on completion of the investigation, informs the member in writing of the results of the investigation. This may be
accomplished by providing the member a thorough summary of the investigative report or a copy of the investigative
report, edited as necessary under 32 CFR part 285. The information provided to the member must contain a summary of
the material evidence and an analysis of that evidence that supports the determination of whether reprisal occurred.
Regardless of the form of communication, the information provided must be in sufficient detail to allow the member
to pursue the issue further.

(v) At the request of a BCMR, submits a copy of that investigative report to the BCMR.

(vi) At the request of a BCMR, gathers further evidence and issues a further report to the BCMR.

(4) Ensure that the BCMR:

(i) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1552, determines whether to resolve an application for the correction of records,
made by a member or a former member of the Armed Forces who has filed a timely complaint, alleging a personnel action
was taken in reprisal for making or preparing a lawful communication. That may include the receipt of oral argument,
examining and cross-examining witnesses, taking depositions, and conducting an evidentiary hearing at the BCMR's
discretion. When the BCMR decides to resolve such application, it shall:

(A) Review the report of any investigation into the member's allegation of reprisal conducted by the IG, DoD, or the
IG of a DoD Component.

(B) As deemed necessary, request that the IG, DoD, or the IG of the DoD Component originally investigating the allegation
gathers further evidence.

(ii) In such cases, if it elects to hold an administrative hearing, allows the member to be represented by a judge advocate
(JA) if all of the following conditions exist:




(A) The IG investigation finds there is probable cause to believe that a personnel action was taken, withheld, or threatened
in reprisal for a member of the Armed Forces making or preparing a protected disclosure.





(B) The Judge Advocate General concerned determines that the case is unusually complex or otherwise requires JA assistance
to ensure proper presentation of the legal issues in the case.




(C) The member is not represented by outside counsel chosen by that member.




(iii) If it elects to hold an administrative hearing, ensures that the member may examine witnesses through depositions,
serve interrogatories, and request the production of evidence, including evidence in an IG investigatory record
not included in the report released to that member.



(iv) If it determines that a personnel action was taken in reprisal for a member or a former member of the Armed Forces
making or preparing a lawful communication, makes a determination on the appropriateness of administrative or disciplinary
action against the individual or indviduals who committed the action and, if deemed appropriate by the BCMR, forwards
its recommendation in the matter to be the Secretary concerned.




(5) Within 180 days of its receipt, issue a final decision on an application for the correction of military records
from a member or a former member of the Armed Forces alleging reprisal for making or preparing a lawful communication.
When the final decision does not grant the full relief requested by the member, advise that member that within 90 days
he or she may request the Secretary of Defense to reconsider the decision in accordance with the procedures described
in  92.6(c).





(6) When reprisal is found, take appropriate corrective action, including the correction of the records of the member,
in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1552 and 1553.





(7) Ensure that administrative or disciplinary action, if appropriate, is taken against individuals found to have
taken reprisal against a member of the Armed Forces for making or preparing a lawful communication.




(8) Notify the IG, DoD, and the Military Department IG of a decision on an application for the correction of military
records received from a member or former member of the Armed Forces alleging reprisal for making or preparing a lawful
communication and of any disciplinary action taken.




(d) The Heads of the DoD Components shall:



(1) Based on an IG investigative report, take appropriate corrective action.




(2) Publicize the content of this Directive to ensure that military and other DoD personnel fully understand its scope
and application.





 92.6

Procedures.





(a) Any member of the Armed Forces who reasonably believes a personnel action (including the withholding of an action)
was taken or threatened in reprisal for making or preparing a lawful communication, may file a complaint with the DoD
Hotline under 32 CFR part 98. Such a complaint may be filed by telephone (800) 424-9098 or (202) 693-5080,

(b) Nothing in this part precludes a member of the Armed Forces from filing a complaint of reprisal for making or preparing
a lawful communication within their Military Department. If the member elects to file the complaint within his or
her Department, he or she should contact a local IG or JA for information concerning the procedures for filing such

Special Local Regulation; We Love Erie Days Fireworks, Lake Erie, Erie Harbor, Erie, PA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A special local regulation is being adopted for the We Love Erie Days Fireworks display. This event will be held on Lake
Erie, Erie Harbor, Erie, PA on August 21, 1994. Due to the large number of spectator vessels and the falling ash and debris
from the fireworks display, this regulation is needed to provide for the safety of life, limb, and property on navigable
waters during the event. This regulation will restrict general navigation on Lake Erie, Erie Harbor, Erie, PA.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth
Coast Guard District, until July 15, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in
advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.





Drafting Information



The drafters of this regulation are Scott J. Smith, Lieutenant Junior Grade, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Officer, Aids
to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch and Karen E. Lloyd, Lieutenant, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Attorney,
Ninth Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Discussion of Regulation



The We Love Erie Days Fireworks display will be conducted on Lake Erie, Erie Harbor, Erie, PA on August 21, 1994. This
regulation will restrict general navigation on Lake Erie, Erie Harbor, in a 300 foot circular zone, surrounding the
Erie Sand and Gravel Pier. This event will have an unusually large concentration of spectator vessels and falling
ash and debris, which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection
of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during this event. Any vessels desiring to transit the regulated area
may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station Erie, PA).

This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1225 and 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of 33 CFR Part
165.



Federalism Implications



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c
of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.



Economic Assessment and Certification



This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.



Collection of Information



This regulation will impose no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq.

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, TX



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

At the request of the Galveston County Navigation District No. 1, the Coast Guard is changing the regulation governing
the operation of the bascule span Pelican Island Causeway Bridge across the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, mile 356.1
at Galveston, Texas. The draw will no longer be closed to navigation on Saturday from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., 12 noon to 1
p.m. and 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. but will open on demand. The draw will continue to be closed to navigation during those
hours Monday thru Fridays, except Federal holidays.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Drafting Information




The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. John Wachter, Project Officer and Lieutenant Elisa
Holland, Project Attorney.



Background and Purpose



Upon request by the bridge owner, the closure hours of this bridge are being changed to create a better balance between
the needs of vehicular traffic and the needs of navigational traffic. Vehicular traffic across the bridge on Saturdays
has decreased while navigational traffic has remained the same. The closure of the draw is no longer necessary on Saturdays.
This change in the closure hours of the bridge is less restrictive on navigational traffic and will not significantly
affect vehicular traffic. For these reasons, the Coast Guard for good cause finds, under 5 U.S.C.  553(b)(B)
that notice and public procedure on the notice are unnecessary.



Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040); February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic
impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). This rule will have little impact on either vehicular or navigational traffic. Because it expects
the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted,
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1 (series), this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.

holidays, the draw need not be opened for passage of vessels. Public vessels of the United States and vessels in distress
shall be passed at any time.

Interim final rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a permanent safety zone in the Cape Fear and Northeast Cape Fear Rivers. A request for
comments from the public is also being solicited. The safety zone is needed to protect the public, vessels, and property
from risks and hazards associated with the transportation of certain hazardous materials while transiting the Cape
Fear and Northeast Cape Fear Rivers. Entry into this zone is prohibited during vessel transit and cargo transfer operations
unless authorized by the Captain of the Port.

Background and Purpose




The Cape Fear and Northeast Cape Fear Rivers carry commercial and public vessels laden with increasing of amounts
hazardous materials. The area is also experiencing rapid growth in the recreational vessel, barge, and other maritime
traffic. The hazards of the materials transported range from fire and explosion to public health hazards. These materials,
essential to the military, and to the petrochemical and textile industries are routinely transported in a safe manner.
However, maritime traffic which could interfere with the safe movement of a vessel carrying hazardous materials
would create a condition of unacceptable risk to the maritime community.

The shipping channel within the rivers is normally only 400 feet wide and maneuvering room for a deep draft vessel is
limited. Additionally, most of the facilities which handle these materials are about 30 miles upstream from the mouth
of the river.

The safety zone will be enacted by a Broadcast Notice to Mariners prior to the vessel's arrival into the river and will
be terminated by another broadcast.

Maritime traffic will not be significantly impacted because of the small percentage of vessels needing this safety
zone, and the limited duration of the zone, typically less than three hours during transit and only for initial hookups
and cargo operations. Other piloted commercial traffic would not normally be affected because meeting situations
between two piloted vessels are not normally scheduled by the pilots. Other commercial traffic not under a pilot's
control would be regulated and safe passage would be arranged by the vessel identified in the safety zone, Coast Guard
enforcement personnel, and the non-piloted commercial vessel's master. Recreational vessels would be directed
to the safe limits of the river out of the zone while the vessel passed and would be able to resume normal operation when
the vessel identified in the safety zone has passed.

The actual dates this safety zone would be in effect are not known at this time, but the public will be given notice through
a Broadcast Notice to Mariners when the Captain of the Port Wilmington invokes the safety zone.


This safety zone is needed to protect the public from the hazards associated with the passage of these vessels as well
as the movement of other maritime traffic around these vessels.



Regulatory Evaluation




This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Because it expects the impact of this rule to be so minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule consistent with section 2.B.2.c of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B (National Environmental Protection Act), and actions to protect the public safety have been
determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.



Federalism



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Program for Texas 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Texas for the purpose of
establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. The
SIP revision was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in the Clean Air Act (CAA), to ensure that
small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the
CAA. The rationale for the approval is set forth in this document; additional information is available at the address
indicated below. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Implementation of the provisions of the CAA, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses
so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emissions
of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate
such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these
requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical
and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally
approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report
to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title
V of the CAA. In February 1992, the EPA issued ``Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air
Act Amendments'', in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as
a tool to provide further guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. 

The State of Texas submitted a SIP revision to the EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to
gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following three PROGRAM elements: 

(1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses;

(2) The establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and

(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.


The Region used section 507 of the CAA when reviewing the State submittal for approvability. The SIP revision, discussed
in detail in the Technical Support Document, is briefly outlined below. 



II. Analysis 



A. Procedural Background 



The State of Texas has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required
PROGRAM elements. The Texas Clean Air Act (TCAA), TEXAS HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ANN. (Vernon 1992),  382.0365,
``Small Business Stationary Source Assistance Program'', enacted by the Texas 1991 legislative session and effective
September 1991, provides authority for the State to establish a PROGRAM (SIP Appendix A). Included in  382.0365
of the TCAA are provisions establishing an SBAP, establishing the SBAP's duties and responsibilities, creating
a State ombudsman, creating a CAP, establishing membership of the CAP, and establishing CAP duties. In addition,
the State of Texas has the legal authority necessary to implement the control strategies for the PROGRAM in compliance
with the CAA and the EPA requirements under the provisions of the TCAA,   382.0365(f) and 382.017. The
Texas Small Business Ombudsman, Small Business Advocate's Office, is located at the central offices of the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), Office of Air Quality, [formerly the Texas Air Control Board
(TACB)], in Austin, Texas. 

The State conducted public hearings on September 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10, 1992, to consider public comments on the proposed
PROGRAM, which will amend the Texas SIP to add a revision entitled, ``Revisions to the State Implementation Plan for
the Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program, Texas Air Control
Board''. The proposed SIP revision was formally adopted November 6, 1992, by the TACB. The Texas PROGRAM was submitted
to the EPA by the Governor of Texas on November 13, 1992 (received November 16, 1992) as a revision to the Texas SIP. It
was initially reviewed for completeness and was determined complete on January 15, 1993. The submittal was then reviewed
for approvability by the EPA Region 6 and EPA Headquarters. 

On September 1, 1993, the TACB merged with the Texas Water Commission to form the TNRCC and is now called the Office of
Air Quality within the TNRCC. The merger did not abrogate, void, or rescind any rules, regulations, Orders, permits,
or any other action previously taken by the former TACB. 



B. Plan Requirements 



1. Small Business Assistance Program 



The first PROGRAM element is the establishment of a SBAP to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses.

The State has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in its narrative SIP revision, under subsection I.A.3.c),
entitled ``Establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP)'', to establish a SBAP in the TACB, Program
Development Division. In order to establish this PROGRAM element,  382.0365(a) and (b) of the TCAA were enacted
and provide the legal authority requiring for establishment of the SBAP with responsibilities consistent with the
six requirements in title V of the Federal CAA. The SBAP will provide sufficient services to small businesses through
the development, collection, and dissemination of information to small businesses on matters of (1) Determining
applicable requirements under the CAA and permit issuance; (2) the rights and obligations of small businesses under
the CAA; (3) compliance methods and acceptable control technologies; (4) pollution prevention and accidental release
prevention and detection; and (5) audit programs. (Details are presented in the EPA's Technical Support Document
and the State's submittal.) 

a. The Texas SBAP is charged with the following duties: 

(i) Conducting independent evaluations of all aspects of the SBAP to determine program effectiveness and continuously
improving the program design; 

(ii) Reviewing and providing comments and recommendations to the Ombudsman's Office, the CAP, EPA, the State, and
the local air pollution control authorities regarding the development and implementation of regulations that impact
small businesses; 

(iii) Facilitating and promoting the early participation of small businesses in the development of new or modified
regulations and policies that impact small businesses; 

(iv) Assisting in providing to other State and local authorities, associations, educational institutions, environmental
groups, and the general public information regarding the applicability of the requirements of the CAA to small businesses;


(v) Actively promoting and assisting in the dissemination of information (i.e., upcoming regulations, control
technologies, etc.) to small businesses and other interested parties; 

(vi) Participating in and sponsoring meetings and conferences with State/local air pollution control authorities,
industry groups, and small business representatives;

Texas SBAP are presented below. 

b. Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements

1

 that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for
developing, collecting, and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small
business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons
to further compliance with the Act. 





The State has met this requirement. The SBAP will provide a system for developing, collecting, and coordinating information
on compliance methods and technologies. Data bases and experts in different areas will provide definitive guidance
information.

The SBAP will include: 

(i) Methods for disseminating technical and compliance information to small businesses: The SBAP will act as an information
clearinghouse by referring small businesses to State technical experts, specifically trained to handle specific
questions relevant to achieving compliance with the CAA. The State has installed and is operating a toll-free telephone
hot line to respond to inquires from small businesses. Services provided by the SBAP are to be publicized through an
electronic bulletin board, association newsletters, industry groups, trade associations, and community roundtables.
The flow of information includes two types of components: A proactive component and a reactive component. The proactive
component involves adequate communication with and information outreach to small businesses in the form of easily
discernable information which specifically details their obligations under the CAA. The reactive component involves
the establishment of a clearinghouse for handling incoming inquiries from small businesses regarding methods for
achieving compliance with air pollution control requirements under the CAA. A more detailed description of the SBAP
elements follows. 

(ii) Information dissemination methods available to qualified small businesses are as follows: 

(A) An electronic bulletin board will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide guidance on applicable
rules and regulations, a calendar of events, a listing of public hearings and workshops, and a menu of directories
that include Federal, State, and private environmental hot lines and technology centers. The electronic bulletin
board will also provide a mechanism that allows users to evaluate the system and provide anonymous comments on the
program and information provided; the user can make suggestions. Application forms, instructions, brochures,
and other technical and compliance information can be requested through the electronic bulletin board. Up-to-date
State and Federal regulations for all media will be available with search capability for review and selection by qualified
small businesses. The electronic bulletin board is available via computer modem (phone line) directly on the small
business site or at a variety of locations within the State. 

(B) The SBAP will mail, upon request, information outlining the rights of small businesses and how those rights can
be exercised. 

(C) Personal visits to small businesses may be made by the SBAP personnel. 

(D) Public service announcements by mass media methods such as newspapers, radio, and television are available.
Videos are also available upon request. 

(E) Area seminars will be conducted by the TACB on a periodic basis, including seminars at the central Austin, Texas
office. 

(F) A toll-free hot line to receive technical and compliance information will be implemented through the SBAP office.


(G) A clearinghouse will be established that will handle incoming inquiries from small businesses. Access to the
electronic bulletin board, facsimile machine, printer, and other information tools will be available to staff to
respond to the inquiries. Walk-in service will be provided, as well as electronic, written, and telephone contacts.
All information developed by the SBAP will be available through the clearinghouse, as well as any appropriate reference
materials needed to comply. 

c. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with
pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning
alternative technologies, process changes, products, and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution.


The State has met this requirement. The SBAP will assist small business stationary sources on methods of pollution
prevention and accidental release prevention and detection, including information concerning different technologies,
process changes, products, and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. Technical personnel from the
TACB will be available to provide pertinent information from the regional offices or from the Austin office. Circumstances
and specific emissions will dictate the required procedure to be followed by the small business stationary sources.
Mechanisms to provide assistance will include the following: 

(i) The SBAP will coordinate information relating to pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and
detection with all Federal, State, and local agencies with environmental jurisdictions; 

(ii) The SBAP clearinghouse and electronic bulletin board will include information on pollution prevention, accidental
release prevention, and detection; and 

(iii) A directory of contacts will be developed and made available of technical experts in the areas of pollution prevention,
accidental release prevention, detection, and familiarity with pollution prevention technologies and alternatives
to reduce pollution. 

d. The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
Act in a timely and efficient manner. 

The State has met this requirement. The State has committed to establish a small business stationary source compliance
assistance program for determining applicable requirements and permit issuance, including the following: 

(i) Industry-specific information packets will be developed and made available to small businesses and staff that
include information on rules, regulations, permit requirements, testing, recordkeeping, and compliance information,
as well as self-audit procedures and pollution prevention methods. 

(ii) Inspectors will be provided training on how to educate small business owners on conducting self-inspections
and understanding the compliance requirements they must meet; and 

(iii) Whenever a new policy or rule is promulgated, workshops will be conducted to inform and educate the specific
small business community on appropriate compliance methods and procedures.

<TEXT>
 

e. The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the Act.
The State has met this requirement. The State has committed to provide methods for notifying small business stationary
sources on a timely basis of their rights under the CAA, including the following:
(i) The SBAP will develop a data base that includes all small business stationary sources and associations, and will
coordinate with appropriate agency staff to notify affected sources of potential changes or rules that affect them;
(ii) Formal public notification procedures will be developed and implemented agencywide that ensure timely notice
of small businesses of their rights and obligations under the CAA; and
(iii) The SBAP will work with trade associations, local agencies, educational facilities, and community leaders
to establish environmental partnerships to bring about voluntary compliance with regulations under the CAA through
participation and educational activities.
f. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option
of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act.
The State has met this requirement. Methods that are identified in paragraph II.B.1.b.(ii) above (concerning the
first requirement) shall be utilized by the State to inform small business stationary sources of their obligations
under the CAA, including a program for referring sources to qualified auditors or for the State to provide for audits
of the operations of such sources to determine if they are within the rules of the CAA. The audit program will be established
no later than November 15, 1994.
g. The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary
source for modification of (A) any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the
technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source.
The State has met this requirement. The State will:
(i) Provide a system for collecting and coordinating information on compliance methods and technologies. Data bases
and experts in different areas will provide definitive guidance information.
(ii) Develop procedures to respond to requests from small business stationary sources for modification of any work
practice or technical methods of compliance, schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice, or method
of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of
any such small business stationary source. No such modification may be granted unless it is in compliance with the
applicable requirements of the CAA.
(iii) Establish approved procedures to provide review of requests from small businesses for modification of work
practice or technical methods of compliance based on financial and technological capability.
The SBAP core portion of the PROGRAM will be staffed with 18 positions. Hiring of all staff positions to support the
Texas SBAP will be completed by mid-1994. Most of the assistance provided to small businesses will be managed by this
group of staff members with assistance and input from the Small Business Advocate's (Ombudsman's) Office. Subsection
I.A.3.c) of the SIP, entitled ``Establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP)'', describes the details
of the SBAP, which meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a), and stated above. Furthermore,  382.0365
of the TCAA requires the establishment of the SBAP and requires the TNRCC to implement this core portion of the PROGRAM
in accordance with the CAA and the EPA requirements.


2. Ombudsman


The second PROGRAM element is the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of
small businesses in the regulatory process. Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve
as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources.
The State has met this requirement by hiring the Ombudsman on February 17, 1992. The Ombudsman reports directly to
the TNRCC Commissioners (previously to the TACB) and is not within the chain of command of the State agency itself.
Thus, the Ombudsman is separate from the air quality regulatory branch of the State agency, and therefore can be an
independent advocate for small businesses. The office is located at the central offices of the TNRCC, Office of Air
Quality (previously the TACB) at 12124 Park 35 Circle, Austin, Texas 78753. The office is currently partially staffed
and operational, and has been since October 1992. The Small Business Advocate's (Ombudsman's) Office will ultimately
be staffed with 11 positions by mid-1994, and the Office is responsible for administering the Ombudsman element of
this PROGRAM. The TCAA,  382.0365(b)(3) provides the legal authority for establishment of the Small Business
Ombudsman. The Ombudsman has the authority to request information from other State agencies that assist small businesses
and has the ability to testify before the Legislature.
a. It shall be the responsibility of the State office to represent small business stationary sources that require
assistance in air pollution matters.
b. The Ombudsman's Office has an adequate staff that includes appropriate personnel to assist in all phases of air
pollution control. Specific staffing plans are presented in Appendix C of the SIP.
c. The Ombudsman's Office has been and will be provided adequate funding to maintain the office.
d. The Ombudsman's Office is charged with the following duties:
(i) Conducting independent evaluations of all aspects of the SBAP;
(ii) Reviewing and providing comments and recommendations to the EPA, the State, and the local air pollution control
authorities regarding the development and implementation of regulations that impact small businesses;
(iii) Facilitating and promoting the participation of small businesses in the development of new regulations that
impact small businesses;
(iv) Assisting in providing to higher authorities and the public information regarding the applicability of the
requirements of the CAA to small businesses;
(v) Aiding in the dissemination of information (i.e., upcoming regulations, control technologies, etc.) to small
businesses and other interested parties;
(vi) Participating in and sponsoring meetings and conferences with State/local air pollution control authorities,
industry groups, and small business representatives;
(vii) Periodically reviewing the work and services provided by the SBAP with trade associations and small business
representatives;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(viii) Operating a telephone hot line to provide help on individual source problems and grievances;
(ix) Referring small businesses to the appropriate specialists in the SBAP where they may obtain information and
assistance on affordable alternative technologies, process changes, products, and operational methods to help
reduce air pollution and accidental releases;
(x) Arranging for and assisting in the preparation of guideline documents by the SBAP to ensure that the language is
readily understandable by the layperson;
(xi) Working with trade associations and small businesses to bring about voluntary compliance with regulations
under the CAA;
(xii) Interfacing with regional and State offices of the Small Business Administration, the Department of Commerce,
and/or other State and Federal agencies that may have programs to financially assist small businesses in need of funds
to comply with environmental regulations;
(xiii) Interfacing with private sector financial institutions to assist small businesses in locating sources of
funds to comply with State/local air pollution control requirements; and
(xiv) Conducting studies to evaluate the impacts of the CAA on the State's economy, local economies, and small businesses.
Copies of studies will be available upon request to the Ombudsman's Office.
Thus, it shall be the responsibility of the Small Business Advocate's Office to monitor the PROGRAM. The Office shall:
(A) Since February 1992, serve as ombudsman for small businesses in accordance with the Federal mandate of section
507 of the 1990 CAA; and
(B) Work with the SBAP to develop programs and provide assistance to small businesses in all areas, as necessary.
Sufficient resources will be provided to the State Advocate's Office to enable it to discharge its responsibilities
effectively. Provisions have been made to provide the Ombudsman with direct access to the government agencies and
officials necessary to ensure that the concerns of small businesses will be heard. Further, the Ombudsman is vested
with sufficient authority to identify and propose solutions to small business problems as they relate to the implementation
of the CAA. The narrative SIP revision, subsection I.A.3.a) entitled ``Designation of a State Office to Serve as Ombudsman
for Small Businesses'', describes the details of the Ombudsman element of the PROGRAM. Section 382.0365 of the TCAA
requires the establishment of the Ombudsman and requires the TNRCC to implement this element in accordance with the
CAA and the EPA requirements.


3. Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP)


The third PROGRAM element is the creation of a CAP to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.
Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a CAP that must include two members selected by the Governor who are
not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State legislature who are
owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the
Air Pollution Permit Program.
The State has met this requirement by committing to appoint members to the Panel by November 1994. Section 382.0365
of the TCAA creates the State Compliance Advisory Panel with responsibilities consistent with the requirements
in title V of the Federal CAA and specifies the panel's make-up, qualifications, and duties. Adequate support sources
and sufficient resources to conduct business will be provided to the Panel by the Ombudsman. The TNRCC, Office of Air
Quality (formerly the TACB), will assist in the formation of the seven-member CAP.
Although section 507 of the CAA requires selection by the majority and minority leadership of the House and Senate,
the EPA believes that, given the makeup of the State's legislature, as required by the State's constitution, Texas'
selection complies with section 507 of the CAA. Texas has a bicameral legislature. There are constitutional provisions
providing for leadership of the Senate and House in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor (President of the Senate)
and in the Office of the Speaker of the House. However, there are no positions in the Texas legislature which equate
to majority and minority leaders, as in the national Congress. In accordance with section 507(e) of the Federal CAA,
 382.0365(c) of the Texas Health and Safety Code provides for the composition of the CAP. Pursuant to  382.0365(c),
both the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House, who are the equivalent Texas entities for purposes of legislative
selection of CAP members, shall each select two members. It is the EPA's position that this appointment mechanism
complies with the legislative intent of section 507(e). Appendix D of the SIP revision submittal discusses the State's
constitutional/statutory legislative process for all appointment procedures. Minority leadership is represented
in the appointments made by the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House, since the Lieutenant Governor is
elected State-wide, and the Speaker is elected by the entire House. The EPA believes that the process for designation
of CAP members by the two legislative leaders meets the intent of section 507(e).
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP, the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
(1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered, and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions;
(2) To periodically report to the EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction
Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
;




(3) To review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and
(4) To develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP.
The State has met these requirements (A) by enacting the State law creating the CAP and providing it with the enumerated
responsibilities, and (B) by committing to appoint members to the Panel by November 1994.


4. Eligibility


Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:
(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals,
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act;
(C) Is not a major stationary source;
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants.
The State of Texas has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance
under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the
CAA. This mechanism is described in the State's narrative SIP revision, subsection I.A.4. entitled ``Source Eligibility''.
The State of Texas has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the
provisions of sections 507(c)(1) (C), (D), and (E) of the CAA but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants.

<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The State has also provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation
with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for
public hearing, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical
and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA. 


III. Final Action 


In this action, the EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Texas for establishing a Small Business
Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. 
The State of Texas has submitted a SIP revision for establishing each of the required PROGRAM elements required by
section 507 of the CAA. The EPA has reviewed this revision to the Texas SIP and is approving it as submitted because the
State's PROGRAM meets the requirements of section 507 of the CAA. The SIP includes a schedule of implementation, which
commits the State to have all three principal PROGRAM elements fully implemented by November 15, 1994. SIP schedule
implementation milestones are being tracked and monitored by the Region as part of the State's normal PROGRAM review.
Currently, Texas has partially staffed and initiated the SBAP, designated and partially staffed the State Office
to serve as Small Business Ombudsman, and created a CAP (and appointed five of its seven members). The CAP's initial
meeting will be held by November 15, 1994. The State is implementing a model program with most elements in place well
ahead of the EPA deadline of November 15, 1994 to have a fully operational program. 
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, EPA has published a simultaneous proposed rule in this 

Federal Register

. This direct final action will be effective October 18, 1994, unless adverse or critical comments are received by
September 19, 1994. If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn, and all public comments received
will be addressed in a subsequent final rule that is based on the proposed rule (please see the brief proposed rule published
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

). The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action
should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective
October 18, 1994.
The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms
with those requirements. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
By this action, the EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved in this action does not impose any
new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage
of assistance provided by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new
regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any
small entities affected. 
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory
action from Executive Order 12866 review. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 18, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. [See section
307(b)(2).]

Withdrawal of Approval of Implementation Plan Item; Wisconsin




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.








</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Environmental Protection Agency withdraws the conditional approval of the State of Wisconsin's
committal State Implementation Plan (SIP) for oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) reasonably available control technology (RACT) issued on February 1, 1994. Approval of this committal allowed
the State to delay submitting NO

X

 RACT rules until February 1, 1995. On May 6, 1994, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit)
rejected EPA's construction of the conditional approval provision to allow for committal SIPs. In light of this decision
EPA issued notices of failure to submit NO

X

 RACT SIPs to all States that had merely submitted committal NO

X

 RACT SIPs. Therefore, both to comply with the Court's decision and in the interest of equity with other States, EPA
believes it is necessary to make this withdrawal effective upon publication so that EPA may then immediately issue
a finding of failure to submit to the State of Wisconsin.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION




I. Background





On February 1, 1994, EPA issued a final conditional approval of a committal SIP submitted by the State of Wisconsin.
By this committal SIP, the State committed to adopt for the Milwaukee, Kewaunee, Manitowoc, and Sheboygan nonattainment
areas reasonably available control technology (RACT) for stationary sources of oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) emissions. The committal SIP consisted of a commitment of the State to adopt such rules and a schedule for adoption.
The State submitted this committal SIP pursuant to an interpretation of the EPA that such commitments could be considered
for conditional approval under section 110(k)(4) of the Act. 

See

 Memorandum, dated July 22, 1992, from Michael H. Shapiro, Deputy Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation,
entitled ``Guidelines for State Implementation Plans Due November 15, 1992'' (hereafter ``Shapiro Memorandum'');
Nitrogen Oxide Supplement to the General Preamble, 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992).

On October 9, 1992, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) challenged EPA's committal SIP policy as set forth
in the Shapiro Memorandum. 

NRDC

 v. 

EPA

, No. 92-1535 (D.C. Cir.). Furthermore, on December 4, 1992, NRDC challenged EPA's committal SIP policy with
respect to NO

X

 RACT submittals, as that policy was articulated in the NO

X

 Supplement to the General Preamble. 

NRDC 

v. 

EPA

, No. 92-1630 (D.C. Cir.). NRDC sought to consolidate these cases, along with a third case challenging EPA's
committal SIP policy for inspection and maintenance (I/M) SIP submittals. The Court denied NRDC's motions to consolidate
the cases, but set all three cases for oral argument on the same date.

The three cases were argued before the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on March 3, 1994. On March 8, 1994, the Court
issued an Order with respect to the I/M challenge, finding that EPA's committal SIP policy ``is contrary to law.''
The Court issued an Amended Order on April 22, 1994, but did not change this fundamental decision in the Amended Order.
On May 6, 1994 the Court issued its full opinion as to all three cases. In that opinion, the Court reiterated its rejection
of EPA's construction of the conditional approval provision to allow for committal SIPs.

II. Action



Because the Court has clearly rejected EPA's use of the committal SIPs policy to extend statutory deadlines, EPA is
withdrawing its conditional approval of Wisconsin's NO

X

 RACT committal SIP. Furthermore, EPA is using the good cause exception of the Administrative Procedure Act to take
such action without providing an opportunity for notice and comment because the Court has clearly articulated that
such a conditional approval is contrary to law. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Notice and opportunity for comment are unnecessary
because the Court directly addressed the use of conditional approval for NO

X

 RACT committal SIPs in its opinion and explicitly rejected such a use. Therefore, any comments would not be sufficient
to rebut this legal interpretation of the Court, and EPA would be obligated to take final action withdrawing the conditional
approval. Furthermore, because the Court has so clearly articulated that such action was contrary to law, it is not
in the public interest to prolong the process by providing notice and an opportunity for comment.

In addition, EPA also believes that it is proper to invoke the good cause exception for making an action effective earlier
than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. 

See

 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). Prompted by the Court's order, by July 8, 1994, EPA issued notices of failure to submit NO

X

 RACT SIPs to all States that had merely submitted committal NO

X

 RACT SIPs. Because EPA conditionally approved of Wisconsin's NO

X

 RACT committal SIP and such conditional approval was still effective on July 8, 1994, EPA did not issue such a finding
to the State of Wisconsin. The State of Wisconsin, however, should not be put in a more favorable position than other
States merely because EPA had not yet taken final action on the other States' committal SIPs. Therefore, both to comply
with the Court's decision and in the interest of equity, EPA believes it is necessary to make this withdrawal effective
upon publication so that EPA may then immediately issue a finding of failure to submit to the State of Wisconsin.



III. Summary and Conclusion



EPA is taking final action to withdraw the conditional approval of Wisconsin's NO

X

 RACT committal SIP. This action will be effective immediately upon publication of this action in the 

Federal Register

.



IV. Miscellaneous



A. Applicability to Future SIP Decisions



Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. The EPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.



B. Executive Order 12866



This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

C. Regulatory Flexibility 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq

., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

This approval does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant
impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act,
preparation of the regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness
of the State action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976). 



D. Petitions for Judicial Review 


Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 18, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; New Hampshire; Approval of PM

10

 State Implementation Plan (SIP) Revisions and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Hampshire. These revisions
were submitted in response to EPA's promulgation of new ambient air quality standards. The intended effect of this
action is to approve revised National Ambient Air quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter based on PM

10

 and other associated regulatory changes. This action is being taken in accordance with section 110 of the Clean Air
Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On July 13, 1989, the State of New Hampshire submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The
SIP revision consists of changes to New Hampshire's Air Quality Rules. New Hampshire also requests redesignation
of two municipalities from nonattainment for total suspended particulate (TSP) to unclassifiable.




Background



On July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634) EPA promulgated revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate
matter which was based upon the measurement of particles having a mean aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less (PM

10

). The revised standards replace TSP with PM

10

 as the standard for ambient air quality. States were required to make revisions to their SIPs to reflect this change.
EPA classified certain areas of the United States as Group I or Group II for PM

10

 (52 FR 29383). Areas not so classified are Group III areas. The State of New Hampshire is a Group III area. In the case
of a Group III area, EPA expects the State's current air pollution control requirements are sufficient to attain and
maintain the PM

10

 standards. In such cases, the State need only submit revisions to its current SIP which adopt the new PM

10

 standard and make other minor adjustments.



New Hampshire Submittal



On July 13, 1989, New Hampshire submitted formal SIP revisions. These SIP revisions change two sections of New Hampshire's
air quality rules. Env-A 303 of the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules refers to ambient air quality standards.
New Hampshire's submittal adopts the NAAQS for PM

10

 as the criteria pollutant for particulate matter for primary and secondary air quality standards and deletes the
now obsolete TSP NAAQS. New Hampshire also revised Env-A 1001, Open-Air Burning, to remove a reference to TSP. New
Hampshire's submittal also requests that the cities of Berlin and Manchester be redesignated from nonattainment
to unclassifiable for TSP. This change is consistent with and encouraged by the final rulemaking of July 1, 1987 (52
FR 24682), because it eliminates the need for TSP to be monitored in addition to PM

10

. Both areas are expected to meet applicable PM

10

 standards.




Review of the New Hampshire Submittal



EPA reviewed the New Hampshire Submittal to determine if it meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act, EPA regulations,
and applicable policies. The submittal meets the requirements found in the July 1, 1987, 

Federal Register

 (52 FR 24672), and EPA policy contained in the 

PM

10

 

SIP Development Guideline

 (EPA-450/2-86-001), dated June 1987, with a supplement dated July 1988.

The State of New Hampshire held a public hearing on the proposed changes on March 16, 1989. There were no public comments.
On April 21, 1989, the amendments to rule Env-A 303, were approved by the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative
Rules at a public hearing, and received final adoption by the Air Resources Division, Department of Environmental
Services. On May 24, 1989, the amendment to rule Env-A 1001 received the same approval. New Hampshire's submittal
clearly defines PM

10

 and sets primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM

10

 defined in accordance with appendix K of 40 CFR part 50.

Legal authority to enforce these rules is contained in New Hampshire Law RSA 125-C:4. The State does not plan
to delegate authority to any local agencies.

New Hampshire's submittal calls for a network of ten (10) PM

10

 monitoring sites. This network replaces the TSP network.



Changes in New Hampshire's Rules



New Hampshire's SIP revisions amend two rules: Env-A 303 and Env-A 1001. Env-A 303, specifically section Env-A 303.01,
defines primary and secondary ambient air standards. New Hampshire's revisions define primary and secondary standards
for particulate matter, consisting of PM

10

, measured at an annual arithmetic mean of 50  u g/m3, and a maximum average 24 hour concentration of 150  u g/m3,
which may be exceeded on a number of days equal or less than an average of one per year as determined in accordance with
Appendix K of 40 CFR Part 50. Env-A 1001 specifies when open-air burning will be permitted or prohibited. The only change
proposed would replace the phrase ``Total Suspended Particles (TSP)'', with the word ``particulates''. The revised
rule forbids open burning in areas designated nonattainment for particulates.

Redesignation of TSP Nonattainment Areas



EPA's final rulemaking of July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24682) promulgating the PM

10

 standard encourages states to request the redesignation of TSP nonattainment areas as unclassifiable for TSP at
the time they submit their PM

10

 SIP revisions. This is permissible because TSP is no longer the indicator for the particulate matter NAAQS. An area
designation (i.e., unclassifiable) must be maintained until the PM

10

 increment takes effect because section 163 PSD increments depend on the existence of section 107 designations. New
Hampshire has requested the redesignation of Berlin and Manchester from nonattainment to unclassifiable for TSP.
The entire State of New Hampshire was originally classified as Group III (52 FR 29383); therefore it is permissible
to redesignate these areas as unclassifiable for TSP.



Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990



The Agency has reviewed this SIP Revision for conformance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the State Submittal
preceded the date of enactment. Group III PM

10

 areas which did not show a violation of the NAAQS for PM

10

 are now designated as unclassifiable for PM

10

 under section 107(d)(4)(B)(iii).

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective 60 days from the date of this 

Federal Register

 notice unless, within 30 days of its publication, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.
If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing
two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing
a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised
that this action will be effective on October 18, 1994. 



Final Action



EPA is approving revisions to Env-A 303.01 and Env-A 1001 as New Hampshire's Group III PM

10

 SIP; and EPA is approving the State's request to redesignate Berlin and Manchester from nonattainment to unclassifiable
for TSP.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq

., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000.

This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The US EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

v. 

U.S. EPA

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2).

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance
with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. Although New Hampshire submitted this request
prior to November 15, 1990, the Agency has determined that this action conforms with those requirements. The revisions
strengthen the requirements in the New Hampshire SIP and conform to all of EPA's current regulations.

RIN 2070-AC57
Prohibition of Hexavalent Chromium-Based Water Treatment Chemicals in Comfort Cooling Towers; Amendment To Limit
the Scope of the Export Notification Requirements 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule amends 40 CFR part 749, subpart D, which prohibits, under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA),
the use of hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals in comfort cooling towers and the distribution of
such chemicals in commerce for use in comfort cooling towers. Today's action amends 40 CFR 749.68 to clarify that only
hexavalent chromium chemicals that can be used for water treatment are the subjects of this regulation, not other
hexavalent chromium chemicals. This amendment limits the scope of export notifications currently required for
hexavalent chromium chemicals under TSCA section 12(b), the TSCA Export Notification Rule (40 CFR part 707), and
 749.68. No changes to the prohibitions or labeling requirements of the hexavalent chromium rule are intended
by this amendment. As amended,  749.68 does not trigger the section 12(b) export notification requirements
for exports of hexavalent chromium products such as certain paints, dyes, pigments, coatings, electroplating and
conversion coating products, and other products containing hexavalent chromium that cannot be used to treat water.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63148), EPA proposed an amendment to 40 CFR part 749, subpart D, which prohibits the use of
hexavalent chromium (Cr

+6

)-based water treatment chemicals in comfort cooling towers (CCTs) and the distribution of such chemicals in commerce
for use in CCTs. The regulatory text of today's amendment is identical to the regulatory text of the proposed amendment.
Comments received on the proposed amendment are addressed in Unit V of this preamble. Today's amendment modifies
40 CFR 749.68 to clarify that only Cr

+6

 chemicals that can be used for water treatment are the subjects of the regulation, not other Cr

+6

 chemicals. This change limits the scope of TSCA section 12(b) export notifications currently required for Cr

+6

 chemicals. 


I. Authority


This amendment is being promulgated pursuant to TSCA sections 6 (15 U.S.C. 2605) and 12(b) (15 U.S.C. 2611(b)). Section
6 of TSCA authorizes EPA to impose regulatory controls if EPA finds that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture presents
or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Under this authority, EPA issued
a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 of January 3, 1990 (55 FR 222), that prohibits the use of Cr

+6

-based water treatment chemicals in CCTs and the distribution in commerce of Cr

+6

-based water treatment chemicals for use in CCTs (40 part CFR 749, subpart D). The rule also requires persons who distribute
in commerce Cr

+6

-based water treatment chemicals to label the containers of the chemicals.
Section 12(b) of TSCA requires that any person who exports or intends to export to a foreign country a chemical substance
or mixture for which: (1) The submission of data is required under TSCA section 4 (15 U.S.C. 2603) or 5(b) (15 U.S.C.
2604(b)); (2) an order has been issued under section 5; (3) a rule has been proposed or promulgated under section 5 or
6 (15 U.S.C. 2605); or (4) relief has been granted under section 5 or 7 (15 U.S.C. 2606) to notify the Administrator of
EPA of such exportation or intent to export. Upon receipt of such notification, section 12(b) of TSCA requires EPA
to furnish the government of the importing country with: notice of the availability of data received pursuant to action
under section 4 or 5(b), or notice of such rule, order, action, or relief under section 5, 6, or 7. EPA promulgated a rule
setting forth the export notification requirements of TSCA section 12(b) under 40 CFR part 707, subpart D. EPA amended
the export notification rule to limit notifications triggered by TSCA section 4 actions on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40238).


II. Background 


Because the Cr

+6

 rule was promulgated under TSCA section 6, export notification requirements under section 12(b) are triggered.
Currently, all Cr

+6

 chemicals are subject to section 12(b) because the term ``Cr

+6

 chemicals'' is presently defined in  749.68(d)(10) as ``any combination of chemical substances containing
hexavalent chromium and includes hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals.'' Thus, for example, the
export of paint containing a Cr

+6

 chemical that cannot be used for water treatment would currently trigger the section 12(b) notification requirements.

In the preamble to the final Cr

+6

 rule, EPA stated that pursuant to TSCA section 12(b) and 40 CFR part 707, subpart D, persons who export or intend to export
Cr

+6

 chemicals are required to notify EPA of those activities. EPA indicated that export notification would be required
for all Cr

+6

 exports ``because the substance subject to the rule is Cr

+6

'' and that it did not believe that the requirement should be narrowed, as a practical matter, because of the difficulty
in determining the end use of the Cr

+6

 at the time of export. EPA also anticipated that the burden of the notification requirements that would be triggered
by the export of Cr

+6

 for uses not regulated by the rule would be minimal.
After promulgation of the final Cr

+6

 rule, the Chrome Coalition filed a Petition for Review with the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia
Circuit dated April 17, 1990 (

Chrome Coalition v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

, No. 90-1138). In the petition, the Chrome Coalition argued that because EPA failed to set forth its interpretation
of TSCA section 12(b) in the proposed rule, the public was unable to comment on that interpretation. Additionally,
they argued that EPA's interpretation of section 12(b) is too broad in the context of the Cr

+6

 rule, and imposes an unnecessary burden on any business that exports products containing Cr

+6

, even when the products cannot be used in water treatment. As a part of the settlement reached with the Chrome Coalition
on December 15, 1992, EPA agreed to promulgate a rule that addressed the concerns raised by the Coalition. The Settlement
Agreement was filed with the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit on January 7, 1993. 
In light of the Chrome Coalition's Petition, EPA reevaluated the need to broadly require export notification for
all Cr

+6

 chemicals and proposed to modify the rule to clarify it on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63148).



III. Summary of this Final Rule 


EPA is amending the Cr

+6

 rule solely to clarify the scope of coverage of the rule, thereby limiting the scope of the required section 12(b) notifications.
This rule will require notification under 40 CFR part 707, subpart D, for the export or intended export of Cr

+6

 chemicals that can be used for water treatment. EPA is listing in  749.68 certain specific Cr

+6

 chemicals that the Agency believes can be used to treat water. This is not meant to be a complete listing of all Cr

+6

 chemicals that can be used to treat water, but rather a listing of examples. The export of any Cr

+6

 chemicals alone, or in combination with other chemical substances when the mixture can be used to treat water cooling
systems, will trigger the TSCA section 12(b) export notification requirements.
Under existing language of the Cr

+6

 rule, TSCA section 12(b) export notification is required for all Cr

+6

 compounds, if they are exported alone, or in combination with other substances, even if the exported product cannot
be used to treat water. With today's amendment, exporters of hexavalent chromium products such as paints, dyes, pigments,
electroplating and conversion coating products, and other substances containing Cr

+6

 that cannot be used to treat water will not need to report the export to EPA under TSCA section 12(b). To accomplish this,
EPA is amending the subject of the Cr

+6

 rule, certain definitions, and other appropriate provisions, as discussed below.


IV. Discussion of this Final Rule 


Exports of certain Cr

+6

 chemicals (e.g., in such products as paints, dyes, pigments, electroplating and conversion coating products) may
now be triggering TSCA section 12(b) export notifications in more cases than are necessary to reasonably carry out
the purposes of TSCA section 12(b) and the section 6 Cr

+6

 rule. EPA believes the current burden associated with exporters providing notification for exports of Cr

+6

 chemicals that cannot be used for water treatment to be substantial, without providing any appreciable reduction
in the risk addressed in the Cr

+6

 rule. In addition, the benefits to countries receiving these notifications are thought to be minimal. This amendment
modifies  749.68 to clarify that only Cr

+6

 chemicals that can be used to treat water are the subjects of the Cr

+6

 rule. Because the amended regulation will address the risk concerns identified as the basis for the existing Cr

+6

 rule, but at a lower cost, EPA finds that the amended rule will continue to protect human health and the environment
against unreasonable risk of injury. Moreover, this change, EPA believes, will provide to importing countries information
more reflective of EPA's concerns and will further Congress' intent, pursuant to TSCA section 2(c) (15 U.S.C. 2601
(c)) that EPA administer TSCA ``in a reasonable and prudent manner.''
This change is supported by the TSCA section 6 Cr

+6

 rulemaking effort. The supporting documentation used by EPA to promulgate the Cr

+6

 rule focused on data regarding Cr

+6

 emissions from CCTs (55 FR 222 at 224). A background document, ``Chromium Emissions from Comfort Cooling Towers -
Background Information for Proposed Standards'' (EPA-450/3-87-010a), March 1, 1988 (OPTS 61012) described EPA's
regulatory alternatives and expected impacts. The information-gathering, analysis, and rulemaking were used
solely to support a TSCA section 6 determination regarding Cr

+6

-based water treatment chemicals and not all possible Cr

+6

 mixtures and products. Therefore, EPA believes that this amendment is consistent with the originally intended scope
and coverage of the TSCA section 6 regulations.
The revised regulatory language clarifies that the chemicals subject to the rule are any Cr

+6

 chemicals that can be used to treat water, either alone or in combination with other chemicals, where the mixture can
be used to treat water. As stated above, the intended effect of this change is to reduce the scope of the TSCA section
12(b) export notifications that are triggered by  749.68. 
Currently, the section heading of  749.68 reads ``Hexavalent chromium chemicals in comfort cooling towers.''
EPA believes that a more appropriate focus and heading for the rule is ``Hexavalent chromium-based water treatment
chemicals in cooling systems,'' and is therefore implementing this change. Also, because the term ``hexavalent
chromium chemicals'' in the current  749.68(d)(10) will no longer be used, the definition is dropped. 
As discussed above, the TSCA section 12(b) export notification requirements are triggered by the export of certain
chemical substances or mixtures that are the subjects of certain actions under TSCA, including Cr

+6

 because of the section 6 Cr

+6

 rule. Currently,  749.68(a) states:




(a) 

Chemical substance subject to this section

. Hexavalent chromium, usually in the form of sodium dichromate (CAS No. 10588-01-9), is subject to this
section. 




Today,  749.68(a) is amended to state:




(a) 

Chemicals subject to this section

. Hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals that contain hexavalent chromium, usually in the form of
sodium dichromate (CAS No. 10588-01-9), are subject to this section. Other examples of hexavalent chromium
compounds that can be used to treat water are: Chromic acid (CAS No. 7738-94-5), chromium trioxide (CAS
No. 1333-83-0), dichromic acid (CAS No. 13530-68-2), potassium chromate (CAS No. 7789-00-6),
potassium dichromate (CAS No. 7778-50-9), sodium chromate (CAS No. 7775-11-3), zinc chromate
(CAS No. 13530-65-9), zinc chromate hydroxide (CAS No. 153936-94-6), zinc dichromate (CAS
No. 14018-95-2), and zinc potassium chromate (CAS No. 11103-86-9).




By instituting this amendment in conjunction with the other changes discussed herein, especially those at  749.68(d)(11)
(see below), EPA intends that only Cr

+6

 compounds which can be used to treat water, either alone or in combination with other chemicals, where the mixture
can be used to treat water, would be subject to the rule and thus the section 12(b) export notification requirements.

Related to this change, EPA is amending certain language in  749.68(b), entitled ``Purpose,'' and  749.68(c),
entitled ``Applicability,'' to reflect the changed focus of the rule from Cr

+6

 to Cr

+6

-based water treatment chemicals. Refer to  749.68(b) and (c) of the regulatory text for the revised language.

EPA is also adding a chemical definition of Cr

+6

 in  749.68(d)(10) to clarify the revised subject of the rule. The definition of Cr

+6

 is now ``the oxidation state of chromium with an oxidation number of +6; a coordination number of 4 and tetrahedral
geometry.'' 
Another key change is a revised definition of ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals.'' The current
definition in  749.68(d)(11) states that ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals means any
hexavalent chromium, alone or in combination with other water treatment chemicals, 

used

 to treat water.'' (emphasis added). The amended definition states that ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment
chemicals means any chemical containing hexavalent chromium which can be used to treat water, either alone or in combination
with other chemicals, where the mixture can be 

used

 to treat water.'' (emphasis added). This change is intended to require export notification for the export of chemicals
that 

can be used

 to treat water, whether or not they are actually used to treat water. EPA believes that exporters will not always know
the actual end use of the Cr

+6

 product. However, EPA believes that exporters are likely to know potential end uses or how Cr

+6

 can be used. Additionally, to help exporters identify which Cr

+6

 compounds can be used, either alone, or in combination with other chemicals to treat water, the Agency is listing examples
of such compounds. This change is not intended to have any effect on the current labeling requirements or the prohibitions
of the Cr

+6

 rule.

In order that the labeling requirements will not be affected by the changes being made today, EPA is changing the language
of  749.68(g). Currently, the labeling requirement at  749.68(g) states: 






Labeling

. (1) Each person who distributes in commerce hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals after February
20, 1990, shall affix a label. . .




As the current definition of ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals'' in  749.68(d)(11)
is ``any hexavalent chromium, alone or in combination with other water treatment chemicals, used to treat water,''
(emphasis added) labeling is required only for hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals used to treat
water. As stated above, the new definition of ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals'' in  749.68(d)(11)
is ``any hexavalent chromium which can be used to treat water. . .'' (emphasis added). Without changing  749.68(g),
this new definition would have the effect of expanding the labeling requirements to require labeling of any hexavalent
chromium, either alone or in combination with other chemicals, that can be used to treat water, where the mixture can
be used to treat water. However, as the intent of this amendment is not to change the scope of the labeling requirements,
the phrase ``for use in cooling systems'' is being added to  749.68(g). This section now reads:



(g) 

Labeling

. (1) Each person who distributes in commerce hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals for use in cooling
systems after February 20, 1990, shall affix a label. . . 




EPA believes this change, along with the other modifications, will have the effect of maintaining the current labeling
requirements.


All of the changes are meant to reduce the scope of TSCA section 12(b) export notifications without affecting the prohibitions
and labeling requirements in the current rule. With today's amendment, EPA intends that exporters of paints, dyes,
pigments, electroplating and conversion coating products, and other products containing Cr

+6

 that cannot be used to treat water will not report the export to EPA under TSCA section 12(b). To accomplish this, EPA
is amending certain definitions and other appropriate provisions of the Cr

+6

 rule as discussed above. EPA believes that today's rule will reduce the burden on the regulated community in cases
where export notification provides little or no benefit to importing countries.
Today's rule is consistent with other Agency efforts to improve the utility of these notices for receiving governments,
and to optimize the ability of EPA to process more efficiently export notices it receives annually and respond to requests
from foreign governments for additional information on chemicals and export notices. For example, on July 21, 1981
(46 FR 37608), in its notice on ``Asbestos Export Notification,'' EPA clarified the reporting responsibilities
of persons exporting asbestos or mixtures containing asbestos by defining which types of asbestos require export
notification. As another example, on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40238), in a 

Federal Register

 document entitled ``Export Notification Requirement; Change to Reporting Requirements; Final Rule,'' EPA issued
a rule that changed the current annual notification requirements for exporters of chemical substances and mixtures
subject to TSCA section 4 test rules or consent orders to a one-time (instead of annual) export notification per chemical
per importing country.
EPA believes that such actions, and today's action, will enhance other governments' ability to thoughtfully consider
notices received under TSCA section 12(b) and react appropriately to chemicals being imported by focusing export
notifications on a more defined set of chemicals that EPA has identified for regulatory action. As EPA stated in the
preamble to the final export notification rule, ``[t]he intended focus of the notice to foreign governments is the
chemical substance or mixture and what EPA has done or found out about it. . . .'' (45 FR 82844, December 16, 1980). Since
the primary purpose of TSCA section 12(b) export notification is to alert and inform other governments of hazards
that may be associated with a chemical substance or mixture, it is important that the export notification requirements
are implemented in a manner that efficiently conveys EPA's concerns. EPA believes that today's amendment will increase
the efficiency of the operation of the section 12(b) requirement as applied to the Cr

+6

 rule by eliminating the current export notifications associated with the export of Cr

+6

 chemicals that cannot be used to treat water.




V. Significant Comments on the Proposed Rule



One commenter requested that EPA expressly mention electroplating and conversion coating products among the examples
of products excluded from the TSCA section 12(b) notification requirement. Based on a technical evaluation of this
request, in appropriate sections of the preamble of this final rule, EPA is adding electroplating and conversion
coating products as examples of products excluded from the export notification requirement because these products
containing hexavalent chromium cannot be used to treat water. However, EPA does not intend that the listing of specific
examples should exclude any other products that cannot be used to treat water.

A second comment was that EPA revise the definition of ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals''
to encompass only hexavalent chromium ``intended'' for use in treating water, not that which ``can be'' so used. EPA
considered the option of substituting hexavalent chromium ``intended'' for use in treating water for the proposed
``can be used'' in the definition of ``hexavalent chromium-based water treatment chemicals,'' but has decided against
such substitution. EPA believes it could be extremely difficult to determine the exporter's intent regarding use
of an exported product. It is difficult to determine the ``intent'' of a manufacturer in exporting a substance or mixture.
However, even if the intent of the exporter could be determined as not including water treatment uses, once the substance
or mixture is imported into the foreign country, it could be used for a water treatment purpose not withstanding the
intent of the exporter. Retaining the ``can be used'' definition helps to ensure that foreign countries receive notice
of the import of substances or mixtures that could be of concern.

Another comment suggested adopting a de minimis and impurity exclusion for the export of section 12(b) substances.
EPA currently requires export notification for any section 12(b) substance present in mixtures, excluding articles
other than PCB articles, at any concentration and regardless of whether it is intentionally present in the mixture
or is present as an impurity. The suggestion made by the commenter is outside the scope of this rulemaking. However,
as stated in the preamble to a final amendment made to the export notification rule in the 

Federal Register

 of July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40238), EPA may examine additional approaches modifying the section 12(b) export notification
program in the future.

Finally, one commenter requested that EPA publish a formal 12(b) list in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which
would include effective and sunset (termination) dates. Because section 12(b) export notification is required
only for substances that are the subject of certain regulatory actions taken under TSCA section 4, 5, 6, or 7, EPA believes
the notice associated with publication of these underlying actions in the 

Federal Register

 is sufficient for purposes of section 12(b). Moreover, the notices initiating these underlying actions generally
include a specific discussion of obligations triggered under 12(b). Section 12(b) of TSCA requires no additional
rulemaking, separate from the underlying actions, to trigger the export notification requirements. For final rules
and orders, effective dates for the 12(b) requirements are the same as the effective dates of the underlying actions.
In cases where the proposed actions prompt the section 12(b) export notifications, the requirement to submit export
notifications begins 30 days after publication of the proposal in the 

Federal Register

. See 40 CFR 707.65(b). Sunset dates (i.e., dates that certain requirements terminate) for purpose of TSCA section
12(b) apply only where the underlying requirement prompting the export notifications are TSCA section 4 or 5(b) actions.
As stated in the preamble to the TSCA section 12(b) Export Notification Rule amendments in the 

Federal Register

 of July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40238), these sunset dates coincide with the expiration of the test data reimbursement period
as defined at 40 CFR 790.3. In the near future, EPA plans to issue a 

Federal Register

 notice listing test data reimbursement period expiration dates for certain TSCA section 4 substances.

As recognized by the commenter, EPA currently makes available an informal list of substances subject to section 12(b)
export notification that is updated on or about a quarterly basis. Although inadvertent omission from this section
12(b) list does not excuse non-compliance with the statutory requirements of section 12(b), EPA believes it does
serve as a valuable compliance aid. In light of the above, EPA believes that publication of the section 12(b) list in
the CFR is not warranted at the present time.




VI. Confidentiality 


A person may assert a claim of confidentiality for any information, submitted to EPA in connection with this rule.
Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information so claimed when it is submitted to EPA. Persons must mark
information claimed as confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL''
or some other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of confidentiality only
to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, Subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality
for information at the time it is submitted to EPA, EPA may make the information public without further notice to that
person. 


VII. Economic Impact


In a support document entitled Economic Analysis of the Amendment to the TSCA Section 6 Rule for Hexavalent Chromium,
dated April 1994, EPA has evaluated potential changes in costs to the Cr

+6

 rule that would be associated with these amendments. The total savings to industry and EPA associated with this amendment
are estimated to be $5,400 to $16,300 per year. EPA's complete economic analysis is available in the public record
for this rule (OPPTS-61018).


VIII. Rulemaking Record


EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket number OPPTS 61018A). The record includes basic information
considered by EPA in developing this rule. EPA has supplemented the record with all written comments and additional
information as it was received. In addition to the proposed rule (58 FR 63148, November 30, 1993) and comments received
on the proposal, the record now includes the following:

IX. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it
has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this rule does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small businesses. This rule actually decreases the reporting burden for small businesses
that export Cr

+6

 chemicals that cannot be used for water treatment, which are currently subject to the reporting requirements of TSCA
section 12(b). This rule would not add any economic burden to small businesses. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on small
businesses.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act


OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in the Cr

+6

 Rule at 40 CFR part 749, subpart D under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), and has
assigned OMB control number 2060-0193 to that collection activity. In addition, OMB has also approved the information
collection requirements contained in the Export Notification Rule at 40 CFR part 707, subpart D under the provisions
of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0030 to that activity. 
The changes in this rule are not expected to impact the information collection requirements contained in the Cr

+6

 Rule at 40 CFR part 749, subpart D, and EPA does not expect to change the burden estimates approved by OMB under OMB control
number 2060-0193. However, since the rule amends the applicability of the information collection requirements
contained in the Export Notification Rule at 40 CFR part 707, subpart D, EPA expects to change the burden estimates
approved under OMB control number 2070-0030, and upon the signature of this final rule, will submit an information
correction worksheet.
The rule will reduce the number of export notices required from the public by approximately 237 submissions per year.
Public reporting burden for the collection of information under 40 CFR part 707, ``Chemical Imports and Exports,''
is estimated to average .5 to 1.5 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
Total public reporting burden is expected to decrease as a result of this rule by approximately 119 to 356 hours per
year.

WARNING

: This product contains hexavalent chromium. Inhalation of hexavalent chromium air emissions increases the risk
of lung cancer. Federal Law prohibits use of this substance in comfort cooling towers, which are towers that are open
water recirculation devices and that are dedicated exclusively to, and are an integral part of, heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning or refrigeration systems.

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) hereby amends the regulations that establish designated ports for the importation,
exportation, and reexportation of plants by adding the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ports at Gulfport,
MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are
listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), or listed under the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The USDA has adequate facilities
and personnel at these ports to qualify the ports as designated ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation
of plants under the terms of the Act and CITES. The addition of these ports to the list of designated ports will facilitate
trade and the enforcement of the Act and CITES. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), requires, among other things, that plants be imported, exported,
or reexported only at designated ports or, under certain limited circumstances, at nondesignated ports. Section
9(f) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1538[f]) provides for the designation of ports. Under section 9(f)(1), the Secretary of
the Interior (Secretary) has the authority to establish designated ports based on a finding that such an action would
facilitate enforcement of the Act and reduce the costs of that enforcement. The United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) and the Secretary are responsible for enforcing provisions of the Act and the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) relating to the importation, exportation, and reexportation
of plants listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES. 

The regulations in 50 CFR part 24, ``Importation and Exportation of Plants,'' are for the purpose of establishing
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants. Plants that are listed as endangered or threatened
in 50 CFR 17.12 or in the appendices to CITES in 50 CFR 23.23 are required to be accompanied by documentation and may be
imported, exported, or reexported only at one of the USDA ports listed in section 24.12(a) of the regulations. Certain
other USDA ports are designated for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of specific listed plants. Section
24.12(e) of the regulations contains a list of USDA ports that are, for the purposes of the Act and CITES, designated
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants that are not listed as endangered or threatened.
(The USDA regulations in 7 CFR 319.37 contain additional prohibitions and restrictions governing the importation
of plants through those ports.) 

In a March 24, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice (59 FR 13921), the Service proposed that the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, be
listed as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened
under the Act or listed under CITES. 



Comments Submitted 



The Service's March 24, 1994, notice invited the submission of written comments regarding the proposal for a 60-day
comment period ending on May 23, 1994. One comment was received by that date, from a lumber company. The commenter fully
supported the proposed rule. 



Requests for Public Hearing 



Section 9(f)(1) of the Act provides that any person may request an opportunity to comment at a public hearing before
the Secretary of the Interior confers designated port status on any port. Accordingly, the Service's March 24, 1994,
notice invited public hearing requests, which were required to be received by the Service on or before May 9, 1994.
No such requests were received.

Treasury Department Approval To Designate Proposed Ports 



Section 9(f)(1) of the Act also provides, in part, that: 

``For the purpose of facilitating enforcement of this chapter and reducing costs thereof, the Secretary of the Interior,
with approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and after notice and opportunity for public hearing, may, by regulation,
designate ports and change such designations.'' 

Approval from the Secretary of the Treasury was obtained in accordance with these provisions. 

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, the Service is adopting the provisions of the proposal
as a final rule. 



Effective Date 



The effect of this rule is to grant an exemption from 16 U.S.C. 1538(f), which generally prohibits importation of wildlife
and plants except at such ports as may be designated. Accordingly, it may be given immediate effect under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1),
which permits a rule that ``grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction'' to be given immediate effect.




Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. 

The Service believes that establishing the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, as designated
ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under
CITES will have a positive economic impact. These ports are major ports of entry for logs and lumber, but they had not
been designated as ports for the importation of logs and lumber from listed trees (prior to the effective date of this
rule). Presently, importers wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico
can use only Mobile, AL, New Orleans, LA, and Houston and Brownsville, TX. Importers wishing to import logs and lumber
from listed trees into a port in the northwestern United States have only the port of Seattle, WA. Adding Gulfport,
MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, to the list of designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees
listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES will result in a savings in time and transportation
costs for importers of logs and lumber. 

Under these circumstances, the Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic effect
on a substantial number of small entities, as described in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Service has determined that this final rule adding designated ports under authority of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 for the importation of plants is not a major Federal action which will significantly affect the quality
of the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.




Paperwork Reduction Act 



This final rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.). 



List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 24 



Endangered and threatened species, exports, harbors, imports and plants. 




Accordingly, we are amending 50 CFR part 24 as follows:

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of inseason action. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, on behalf of the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC),
publishes notice of this inseason action pursuant to IPHC regulations approved by the U.S. Government to govern the
Pacific halibut fishery. This action is intended to enhance the conservation of Pacific halibut stocks in order to
help sustain them at an adequate level in the northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The IPHC, under the Convention between the United States of America and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut
Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea (signed at Ottawa, Ontario, on March 2, 1953), as amended by a Protocol
Amending the Convention (signed at Washington, DC, on March 29, 1979), has issued this inseason action pursuant to
IPHC regulations governing the Pacific halibut fishery. The regulations have been approved by the Secretary of State
(59 FR 22522, May 2, 1994). On behalf of the IPHC, this inseason action is published in the 

Federal Register

 to provide additional notice of its effectiveness, and to inform persons subject to the inseason action of the restrictions
and requirements established therein. 


Inseason Action 


1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 14 


Area 4C Closed to Halibut Fishing 


Landings from the August 3-4 fishing period in Area 4C totaled 34,000 lb (15.42 metric tons (mt)). This brings
the season total to 715,000 lb (324.32 mt), slightly exceeding the 700,000 lb (317.51 mt) catch limit. Area 4C is now
closed to halibut fishing for the remainder of 1994. 


Area 2A Commercial Halibut Fishery Closed 


The IPHC estimates that the Area 2A catch limit of 178,500 lb (80.96 mt) was reached after the August 3 fishing period.
Therefore, Area 2A is closed to commercial halibut fishing for the remainder of 1994. 


Area 2B Canadian Commercial Fishery Update 


Canadian halibut landings from Area 2B total 7.4 million lb ((3,356.61 mt) through August 8, leaving 2.6 million lb
(1,179.35 mt) of the catch limit to be caught. The fishery will continue until all individual vessel quotas have been
filled, or November 15, whichever is earlier.

AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for species that comprise the shallow-water species fishery by vessels using
trawl gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), except directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those
portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. This action is necessary because the third seasonal
bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut apportioned to the shallow-water species fishery in the GOA has been caught.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.


An emergency interim rule (59 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) and subsequent extension of effective date (59 FR 24965,
May 13, 1994) apportioned the Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit for trawl gear into bycatch allowances
and seasonal apportionments thereof among fishery categories. In accordance with  672.20(f)(3)(iii), the
shallow-water species fishery that is defined at  672.20(f)(3)(ii)(A) was apportioned 200 metric tons of
Pacific halibut PSC for the third season, the period June 30, 1994, through September 30, 1994.
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with  672.20(f)(3)(iv), that vessels participating
in the trawl shallow-water species fishery in the GOA have caught the third seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific
halibut PSC apportioned to that fishery. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for each species and species
group that comprise the shallow-water species fishery by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, except directed fishing
for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA open to directed fishing for pollock. The
species and species groups that comprise the shallow-water species fishery are: Pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water
flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, and ``other species.'' This closure is effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., August
15, 1994, through 12 noon, A.l.t., September 30, 1994.

 Reallocation.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is reallocating the projected unused amount of Pacific cod from vessels using trawl gear to vessels using hook-and-line
or pot gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to allow the 1994
total allowable catch of Pacific cod to be harvested.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the U.S. BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according
to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.


The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that vessels using trawl gear will not be able to harvest 8,000 metric
tons of Pacific cod allocated to those vessels under  675.20(a)(2)(iv)(A). Therefore, in accordance with
 675.20(a)(2)(iv)(B) NMFS is reallocating the projected unused amount to vessels using hook-and-line or
pot gear.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (the Act), amended the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to provide
a statutory mandate for drug testing of air carrier employees. The Act also prescribed certain consequences for prohibited
drug use and mandated the use of split specimen testing. This rule amends the antidrug rule for conformity to the requirements
of the Act. 



In addition, this rule incorporates other changes to the antidrug rule. These changes clarify the requirements of
the rule and also address concerns that have been raised since the rule was published. 

Finally, this rule includes substantive changes to address provisions of the rule that are unclear, do not comport
with the changes in the final DOT drug testing procedures, or do not adequately address required steps in the implementation
process.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Availability of Final Rule 



Any person may obtain a copy of this final rule by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office
of Public Affairs, Attn: Public Inquiry Center (APA-230), 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591,
or by calling (202) 267-3484. Requests must include the amendment number identified in this final rule. 

Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future rulemaking actions should request a copy of Advisory
Circular 11-2A, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Distribution System, which describes the application procedures.




Background 



On November 14, 1988, the FAA issued an antidrug rule which required specified aviation employers and operators to
initiate antidrug programs for personnel performing safety-sensitive functions. 

On October 28, 1991, the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (the Act) was enacted. Among other things,
the Act provided a statutory mandate for drug testing in the aviation industry and required specified consequences
for positive drug tests. A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), published on February 15, 1994, proposed amendments
to certain provisions of the FAA's antidrug rule in accordance with the Act. The NPRM also proposed certain other changes
to the antidrug rule that would clarify employer and Medical Review Officer responsibilities and addressed other
issues that have been identified since the promulgation of the rule. This rule incorporates the requirements of the
statutory mandate, as well as the clarifying amendments. 

Seven comments were received in the docket in response to the NPRM. These comments were taken into consideration during
the development of this final rule. 



Reason for Expedited Effective Date 



A section of this rule concerning split specimen testing is being made effective in less than the 30 days from publication
usually required by law. With an effective date of August 15, 1994, for this section the FAA can ensure that this rule
is consistent with the DOT final rule which was published on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7354). The DOT rule implements
split specimen collection testing required by the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, as of August
15, 1994, for four modal administrations under the DOT. The DOT rule provided affected employers 6 months to begin
implementing split specimen testing. Because employers have been given prior notification of the requirement for
split specimen testing, employers subject to this rule will not be unduly burdened by an effective date of less than
30 days. The FAA has therefore determined that good cause exists under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 533(d)(3) to warrant
an expedited effective date.

Discussion of Comments and Final Rule 



This rulemaking action encompasses a variety of changes to the FAA's antidrug regulation, most of which affect the
operational provisions of the antidrug rule found in 14 CFR part 121, appendix I. Because a variety of changes, both
substantive and minor technical revisions, were made to appendix I, the entire revised appendix has been republished
in this final rule. Each of the significant changes and any related comments are discussed in detail below. 



Random Testing 



This final rule does not change the random drug testing requirements. The FAA notes, however, that a separate NPRM
was jointly issued by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation and all DOT agencies with antidrug rules on February
15, 1994 (59 FR 7614). This NPRM proposed parallel changes to each agency's rule under which the random drug testing
rate would be established based on the rate of random positive drug tests in the particular industry. Because of the
common aspects of the random testing issues, the FAA will make any such changes as part of a joint final rule to be issued
in the near future. 



Amendments Required by the Act 



Prohibition on Service; Rehabilitation and Evaluation 



The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act section entitled ``Prohibition on service'' (found at new FAAct
section 614(b)) provides that no person who is determined to have engaged in illegal use of drugs may perform a safety-sensitive
function after such determination. In accordance with this section, the FAA proposed that sections of the FAA's regulations
that address the use of prohibited drugs (see, 

e.g

., 14 CFR 65.46(c), (d)) would be revised slightly to reflect the fact that entities other than certificate holders
(

i.e

., contractor companies) can require drug tests under the antidrug rule if they have an FAA-approved antidrug program.
The changes were supported by commenters and are included in the final rule. 

Section 614(b)(2) of the FAAct, ``Effect of Rehabilitation,'' states that no covered employee may perform a safety-sensitive
function after engaging in prohibited conduct unless he or she has completed a rehabilitation program under the provisions
of section 614(c) of the FAAct. Section 614(c)(1) requires the Administrator to prescribe regulations that at a minimum
provide for the identification and opportunity for treatment of employees in need of assistance in resolving problems
with the use of controlled substances. Further, the section states that the Administrator shall determine the circumstances
under which such employees shall be required to participate in such a program. This language recognizes that rehabilitation
may not be appropriate or warranted in all cases of prohibited conduct. 

The legislative requirement of section 614(b)(2) is implemented in the revisions to paragraph A, section VII, of
appendix I. The legislative history of the Act reflected the fact that the FAA did not prescribe regulations with respect
to specific types of rehabilitation in its antidrug rule. However, because the Act requires the FAA to prescribe regulations
under which persons in need of assistance would be identified, this final rule modifies the Medical Review Officer
(MRO) duties to include such identification. Some commenters noted that a MRO may not be qualified as a substance abuse
professional (SAP) and should therefore be required to refer the individual to a qualified SAP for the evaluation.
It was the FAA's intent that only MROs who also meet the qualifications of a SAP (as contained in the definition of a SAP)
would be authorized to perform the initial evaluation of individuals who have a verified positive drug test result
or refuse to submit to a required test. The final rule has been changed to clarify this requirement. It also incorporates
a provision parallel to one in the alcohol misuse prevention program final rule that limits the providers or facilities
to which SAPs who perform an initial evaluation may refer an employee determined to be in need of assistance. This limitation
also applies to MROs who serve as SAPs. 

The NPRM proposed, and this final rule provides, that each covered employee who had a verified positive drug test result
or who refused to submit to testing would be advised of all relevant resources available to the employee. Further,
each such employee would be evaluated by a SAP (who could be the MRO) who would determine whether and what assistance
the employee needed in resolving problems associated with prohibited drug use. Some commenters representing labor
organizations stated that the FAA should include requirements that employers must provide or pay for any required
treatment and that employees should be prohibited from terminating employees who are undergoing treatment. The
FAA reaffirms its position that these issues are most appropriately matters for employer/employee negotiation.


New section 614(b)(3) of the FAAct, ``Performance of prior duties prohibited,'' provides sanctions for employees
who engage in prohibited use of drugs. It provides that, under certain circumstances discussed below, an individual
shall not be permitted to perform the duties related to air transportation that he or she performed prior to the date
he or she engaged in the prohibited drug use. The legislation does not require that the individual's employment be
terminated, nor that he or she be reassigned to perform non-safety-sensitive functions. However, it is an absolute
bar to the performance of the same duties the employee performed before the violation.

The final rule implements the provisions in the Act in two ways. Appendix I has been revised by adding paragraph F to
section VI to preclude any person from performing the safety-sensitive function that the individual was performing
if that person had two verified positive drug test results or if the individual used a prohibited drug while performing
such a safety-sensitive function. A definition of ``performing'' paralleling the one in the alcohol misuse prevention
program rule has been added. In order to effectively administer this provision, the final rule provides that this
prohibition is effective for drug tests and on-duty drug use occurring after the effective date of the final rule.
(The NPRM proposed to amend the regulatory sections to implement this prohibition. However, for clarity and consistency
with the alcohol misuse prevention program we are adding this provision to appendix I.) 

The bar is limited to the narrow prohibition in the Act and will not affect the performance of other duties. While the
FAA recognizes that a narrow bar could lead to anomalous results (for example, a person might be barred from performing
screening duties but could serve as a pilot), a bar that is limited to the statutory requirements is more likely to be
consistent with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act or other legal constraints. The FAA expects
that employers will exercise responsible judgment in determining whether employees not expressly barred from service
should be permitted to perform other safety-sensitive duties. 

The bar on two-time violators will apply both to persons who have gone through rehabilitation and to those who, after
evaluation, were determined not to need treatment. Otherwise, an employee who was found to need treatment and had
an instance of recidivism would be subject to the bar, but an employee who did not need assistance but simply chose to
use drugs again would not be. This provision is established under the FAA's general statutory authority to prescribe
regulations affecting aviation safety. 

Commenters representing labor organizations objected to the permanent bar in principle, but recognized the FAA's
statutory requirement to impose such a bar. Commenters representing employers objected to the FAA's implementation
of the permanent bar in which the burden of ensuring that permanently barred individuals do not perform the relevant
safety-sensitive duties is placed on employers. These commenters assert that the FAA should maintain a name-specific
``black list'' that employers could check to determine an applicant's status. The FAA has not adopted this recommendation
and believes that it would be inappropriate to do so. Aside from the obvious privacy and logistical issues associated
with the creation of such a data base, it would not serve the purpose asserted by the commenters, which appears to be
to relieve the employers of the necessity of obtaining information regarding applicants' drug testing history.
However, the permanent bar is not the only measure precluding service in a safety-sensitive function. In addition,
if an individual has a verified positive drug test result or has refused to submit to a drug test, the employer cannot
use the individual to perform any safety-sensitive function unless and until the appropriate MRO or SAP evaluation
and return to duty requirements have been met. (A similar prohibition applies under the alcohol misuse prevention
program, 14 CFR part 121, appendix J). Information regarding such unresolved violations can be obtained only from
the employee's records. In summary, the FAA does not view the need to ensure that an applicant is not subject to the permanent
bar as materially different from the other requirements in this employer-based, employer-implemented program.


The FAA has addressed one concern raised by commenters regarding the availability of records from previous employers.
The confidentiality provisions have been revised to clarify that employers are required to release employee antidrug
program records upon written consent of the employee. This revision precludes prior employers from refusing to release
records and thereby frustrating the intent of this regulation. With respect to record retention, the FAA notes that
the retention periods provided in this rule are minimums and employers may choose to retain any records for a longer
period of time. Employers should consider longer retention of information regarding verified positive drug test
results, refusals to submit to testing, evaluation, and rehabilitation, if for no other reason than to ensure that
an individual previously terminated for violating the rule is not rehired for and impermissibly returned to the performance
of safety-sensitive functions. 

Commenters also expressed concern that employees be provided with adequate notice of the implications of having
a verified positive drug test result or using drugs while performing a safety-sensitive function. The FAA agrees
that employees should be advised of the consequences of such actions, and of the consequences of refusing to submit
to a required test (which, although it does not implicate the permanent bar, does necessitate removal from safety-sensitive
functions and possible reporting to the FAA). The FAA has therefore revised the employee assistance program provisions
of appendix I to include a requirement that the employer policy provide information on the consequences under the
antidrug rule of illegal use of drugs, verified positive drug test results, and refusals to submit to testing. It should
be noted that an employer may advise employees of any consequences imposed under the employer's independent authority
(e.g., termination); however, the employer could not purport or imply that the FAA's antidrug rule required such
actions. 

The permanent bar following a refusal to undertake or failure to complete rehabilitation is further implemented
by retaining the current requirement that prior to returning to duty performing safety-sensitive functions following
a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or refusal to submit to such a drug test, the employee
must be evaluated by the MRO on the specific issue of compliance with any previously-established treatment program.
This rule retains the provisions regarding MRO recommendations for return to duty, with the modification that, based
on the requirements of the Act, the MRO cannot recommend return to duty if an individual has failed to comply with a specified
rehabilitation program. The FAA has chosen, however, not to impose a definite time period during which the employee
must agree to undertake or complete the prescribed rehabilitation. This allows for the denial phase that most people
go through when first confronted with evidence of a drug problem.

Split Specimen Testing 



Split specimen testing, which is expressly required under the Act, is a procedure under which an original urine specimen
is divided into two containers, each of which is sealed, labeled, and maintained separately. If the primary specimen
tests positive, the split or secondary specimen can be tested to ensure that the confirmed positive was not caused
by error or tampering. In accordance with the requirements of the Act, DOT has revised its procedural rule to require
split specimen testing for all drug testing performed under the auspices of the FAA antidrug rule (and those of the
Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration).
Consistent with the provisions of the DOT rule, this final rule provides that split specimen testing is in lieu of the
right to request a retest of the original specimen. 

A number of commenters objected to the split specimen testing requirement as unnecessary and unduly burdensome.
These commenters stated that split specimen provisions should not be included in the final rule. The FAA is constrained
by the requirements of the Act and must provide for split specimen testing. All aviation entities with FAA-approved
antidrug programs must therefore ensure that they have split specimen testing provisions in place by August 15, 1994,
including providing appropriate amendments to their antidrug program plans to the FAA. 

Both the Act and the DOT's revised rule provide that an employee is entitled to split specimen testing if the employee
requests such testing within 3 days of receiving notice of the positive drug test result, and this final rule incorporates
an analogous provision. The NPRM proposed that the request must be in writing. Commenters noted that the requirement
for a written request conflicts with the limited time available during which to make the request to have a split specimen
tested. The FAA has deleted the proposed requirement that an employee request the split specimen test in writing.
The final rule also revises the provision regarding MRO verification of the primary specimen. The NPRM proposed that
the MRO ``may'' proceed with verification pending receipt of the split specimen test result. Although this language
was permissive, it was not the intent of the FAA that verification could be delayed solely based on an employee's request
for a split specimen test. Rather, the provision was intended to recognize that factors other than the request for
the split specimen analysis could affect the verification process. The final rule makes the intent of the FAA explicit.
Finally, the rule provides that no employer or agency action is stayed during the request period or while waiting for
a split specimen test result.

The NPRM included a notice that in the final rule the FAA would amend the antidrug rule to change the terms ``passing''
and ``failing'' a drug test. All of the DOT agencies that require drug testing, including the FAA, have received reports
of some confusion in their respective industries regarding the use of the terms passing and failing a drug test and
how those terms relate to different drug test results (

i.e.

, confirmed or verified positive or negative test, cancelled tests, etc.). The final rule changes these terms wherever
they are used throughout the antidrug rule to the more accurate ``verified positive'' or ``verified negative.''


Additionally, the revised appendix I published in this final rule includes a number of minor editorial changes. For
example, throughout the antidrug rule the phrase ``functions specified in section III of appendix I'' is used. This
final rule replaces that phrase with the term ``safety-sensitive function,'' which is defined accordingly. 



Contract Air Traffic Control Facilities 



As was noted in the preamble to the NPRM, when the FAA's final antidrug rule was published in 1988, air traffic control
(ATC) facilities operated under contract with the FAA were explicitly excluded from coverage under the rule. It was
subsequently determined that employees of contract ATC facilities would not be included in the FAA's program for
Federal employees and should be subject to the FAA's rules for the aviation industry. This final rule changes the definition
of covered employers to include such facilities. The FAA's air traffic control facilities and facilities operated
by the military (whether directly or by contract) are not affected by this change. 

Air traffic control facilities, whether they are currently required to perform testing by contract or not, should
submit plans to the FAA within 90 days after the rule's effective date, as required by paragraph A.5., Section IX. 



Refusal to Submit to Testing 



The final antidrug rule included amendments to the airmen certification sections of the FAA's regulations under
which a refusal to submit to testing could be the basis for a certificate action. However, the rule did not have an express
requirement for employers to notify the FAA of refusals or a specific mechanism for providing such notice. The NPRM
proposed a reporting requirement that (paragraph E of section VI of appendix I to part 121) would correct this gap in
the requirements of the rule. However, the proposal did not include a specific time for notifications. The final rule
specifies that employers must notify the FAA of refusals to submit to required tests within 5 working days. The final
rule also clarifies that sanctions do not attach to refusals to submit to either pre-employment or return to duty tests
since the redefinition of ``return to duty tests'' makes such tests essentially voluntary. An individual who refuses
to submit to pre-employment or return to duty testing but then wishes to perform a safety-sensitive function would
have to subsequently agree to take and have a verified negative drug test result on such a test. The individual would
then be subject to follow-up testing while performing safety-sensitive functions, because the individual might
have refused based on recent drug use. The individual would not, however, be subject to certificate action for declining
what is essentially a test taken voluntarily as a precondition to performing safety-sensitive duties. 



Employees Covered By the Antidrug Rule 



The final rule modifies the specified safety-sensitive duties slightly to parallel the classes of covered functions
in the FAA's new alcohol misuse prevention program rule (14 CFR part 121, appendix J). This modification is not intended
to significantly change the antidrug rule's coverage. The most significant changes are the elimination of flight
test and ground instruction duties. The former category is eliminated because the FAA has determined that as a practical
matter, these duties are essentially subsumed in flight crewmember or flight instructor duties. Ground instruction
duties have been eliminated based on the FAA's desire to reduce the burden of the antidrug rule on the industry and the
determination that individuals performing such duties could be removed from the program without jeopardizing public
safety. Additionally, the categories of ``aviation screening duties'' and ``ground security coordinator duties''
have been established to clarify the FAA's original intent with respect to covered security functions. 

Although most commenters supported these changes, one commenter believed that rather than specifying categories
of safety-sensitive duties, the rule should provide the Administrator with the discretion to establish these categories
without rulemaking. The FAA has not adopted this recommendation. While flexibility might be desirable, the FAA believes
that it is essential that adequate notice and opportunity for comment be given to individuals the FAA intends to subject
to the requirements of this rule. Publication of the safety-sensitive functions as part of the final rule also ensures
that affected employees and employers have actual or constructive knowledge of the requirements of the rule. 

The FAA has previously received a petition for rulemaking on the issue of the appropriate scope of covered employees
under the antidrug rule. Because the issues raised in the petition have been resolved in this final rule, the FAA has
closed this action. (Docket No. 26620) 

Because the covered employee categories are being revised, we are republishing with this final rule the Drug Testing
Management Information System (MIS) Data Collection Forms, which were published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 23, 1993 (58 FR 68198), and became effective on January 1, 1994. These forms provide the FAA with additional
data for use in monitoring the antidrug program and reflect the changes in employees covered by the antidrug rule.
There are no other significant changes to the forms. 



Pre-Employment Testing 



The NPRM proposed to revise the antidrug rule's pre-employment testing provision (paragraph A of section V of appendix
I) to make the provision less burdensome. When it was published in 1988, the antidrug rule required pre-employment
testing before an individual could be hired to perform a function specified in appendix I. As interpreted by the FAA,
testing was required of individuals not currently employed by the employer, of current employees moving from a non-covered
to a covered safety-sensitive function, and in circumstances where an employee was removed from the random testing
pool for any length of time or was unavailable for testing for an extended period of time. Individuals who had a verified
positive drug test result or refused to submit to an FAA-mandated drug test also had to pass a pre-employment test prior
to performing or returning to safety-sensitive duties. 

The FAA continues to believe that pre-employment drug testing has utility for those individuals who have not previously
been subject to the FAA-approved random drug testing program of an employer. However, we have reassessed the need
for pre-employment testing in other situations, such as when an employee has been on leave of absence or working outside
the territory of the United States. The FAA believes, and all of the commenters addressing this issue concur, that
safety can be maintained even if the requirement for pre-employment testing in some circumstances is eliminated.
Therefore, the FAA has revised its antidrug rule to require pre-employment testing of an individual only prior to
the first time the individual performs a safety-sensitive function for an employer. Such an individual must have
a verified negative drug test result on a pre-employment test prior to performing a safety-sensitive function, and
the employer could not permit the individual to perform such a function until the employer receives the verified negative
pre-employment drug test result. 

Employers would be permitted to require an employee to submit to pre-employment testing in cases where an employee
previously subject to random testing by that employer has been removed from the random testing pool for reasons other
than a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or refusal to submit to such testing.

Return to Duty and Follow-Up Testing 



The 1988 final antidrug rule included the category of ``testing after return to duty'' (former paragraph F, section
V, appendix I). Under this provision, individuals who had been hired to perform safety-sensitive functions, or returned
to the performance of safety-sensitive functions after receiving a verified positive drug test result on or refusing
to submit to an FAA-mandated drug test, were subject to unannounced testing. As noted above, the threshold test required
before returning to duty was characterized as a pre-employment test. 

Commenters concurred with the FAA's assessment that the FAA's prior use of the term ``return to duty'' testing has
caused confusion in the industry. The FAA also wishes to ensure consistency in terminology with the alcohol misuse
prevention program rule. For these reasons, the antidrug rule has been revised to provide that an individual who had
a verified positive drug test result on a pre-employment test, or refused a pre-employment test, must take another
pre-employment test and obtain a verified negative drug test result before performing safety-sensitive duties
and would then be subject to follow-up testing. An employee who had a verified positive drug test result on another
type of test or refused to submit to another type of test (

e.g.

, random) must take a return to duty test and obtain a verified negative drug test result before returning to the performance
of safety-sensitive duties, and would then be subject to follow-up testing. Like all FAA-mandated tests, return
to duty and follow-up tests must be performed in accordance with the requirements of appendix I and the testing procedures
in 49 CFR part 40. 

The FAA also proposed two other changes that would parallel the provisions of the alcohol rule. The first proposed
change was the addition of a mandatory minimum of six follow-up drug tests during an individual's first 12 months after
being hired for or returning to the performance of safety-sensitive functions after the individual has refused to
submit to or had a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated test. Commenters generally opposed this proposal,
believing the determination of the appropriate number of follow-up tests should be a matter for the MRO's discretion.
Based on these comments, the FAA has revised the follow-up testing provision. As revised, although follow-up testing
is required for any person who refuses to submit to or who has a verified positive drug test result on an FAA-mandated
drug test, a minimum of six tests over 12 months will be required only for an individual who is determined in an evaluation
conducted under this rule to be in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with illegal use of drugs. This
modification ensures that those employees most in need of monitoring will be subject to at least a minimum number of
tests over the first year after returning to duty, the period during which recidivism is the most likely to occur. The
remaining employees would be tested at the MRO's discretion. 

The second change permits the employer to direct the individual to undergo alcohol testing, as well as drug testing,
if the Medical Review Officer determines that such testing would be appropriate. No commenters addressed this change,
and the final rule includes this provision as it was proposed. 



Medical Review Officer Functions 



The NPRM proposed to substantially revise section VII of appendix I. First, changes in the DOT final rule (49 CFR part
40), which establishes the duties of the MRO in the verification process, have superseded the FAA's rule. Rather than
reiterate the duplicative provisions of the DOT rule, which are subject to change, the revised MRO section cites to
the applicable provisions of the DOT rule and incorporates them (and therefore any future amendments) by reference.


The MRO duties have been revised to require the MRO to inquire whether an individual holds a part 67 airman medical certificate,
to process requests for split specimen testing, and to evaluate or refer the individual to a SAP for evaluation, as
discussed previously. The MRO's duties in the case of an employee or applicant who holds a part 67 airman medical certificate
or who would be required to hold such a certificate to perform a safety-sensitive function for an employer are also
specified. In response to comments, the requirements for submission of the reports to the Federal Air Surgeon have
been revised. The final rule provides that an MRO has 10 working days following verification of a positive drug test
result in which to make a determination regarding drug dependence. All documents pertaining to the test result, verification,
dependency, SAP evaluations, and return to duty recommendations, if any, must be forwarded to the Federal Air Surgeon
within 12 working days of verifying the positive drug test result. 

The final rule also includes specific recordkeeping requirements for the MRO. This change makes explicit the previously
implicit requirement that MROs maintain records necessary for accomplishing their duties. While the records are
created on behalf of and remain the employers' records, the new recordkeeping section reflects the fact that, of necessity,
there are records that must be maintained by the MRO if the MRO is to fulfill his or her regulatory role. The provision
regarding forwarding of MRO records has been revised slightly from the NPRM to clarify that it is the employer's obligation
to ensure that MRO records are forwarded to a new MRO, even if the employer is obtaining MRO services through a consortium.
The change reflects the FAA's position that records associated with a particular employer's antidrug program remain
the employer's records, even if the records are maintained by the MRO and even if the employer does not contract directly
with the MRO. The FAA recognizes that a consortium may effect the actual transfer of records; however, the consortium
does so only as an agent of the employers using its services to implement their programs.

Antidrug Program Plan Submission 



Several changes were proposed in this NPRM to the plan submission provisions. First, the address to which plans and
plan amendments must be submitted has been changed to reflect the Drug Abatement Division's current address. Second,
the ``transition'' provisions of the rule for new aviation employers (paragraph A., section IX) have been changed
to eliminate the substantial grace period previously provided. Commenters supported the FAA's view that given the
published guidance available from the FAA and from private sector entities and the wealth of material and experience
now available, there is no longer a reason to permit carriers to begin operations without having implemented an FAA-approved
antidrug program. 

The FAA noted in the preamble to the final rule that the compliance deadlines for new businesses might be accelerated
in the future (53 FR 47043; November 21, 1988), and, accordingly, this final rule prohibits covered employers from
beginning operations without an approved antidrug program. The program must be implemented, and all covered employees
subject to testing, not later than the inception of operations. Any person hired by a new certificate holder to perform
a safety-sensitive function after the issuance of the certificate must undergo pre-employment testing. Additionally,
each new employer must ensure that employees performing safety-sensitive functions by contract are subject to an
FAA-approved antidrug program within 60 days of the implementation of the employer's program. This requirement
will impose no significant burden on new operators and any burden is outweighed by the benefits gained by public safety.


Third, the consortium plan submission section has been revised to require that each consortium program must provide
for notification to the FAA of changes in membership. Finally, a new provision (section IX, paragraph A.6.) expressly
states that covered employers must ensure that they are continuously covered under an approved antidrug program.
This new section reflects the FAA's recognition of the fluid nature of the aviation industry, in which locations,
contracts, and even corporate identities are subject to frequent changes. 



Employees Located Outside the United States 



As noted in the preamble to the NPRM, the original antidrug rule published in 1988 applied to employees performing
safety-sensitive functions for the specified employers regardless of whether the employees were located within
the territory of the United States or were located in a foreign country. In recognition of the international implications
of the rule, however, the effective date of the rule with respect to employees located outside the territory of the
United States was deferred on a number of occasions. Significant practical and legal concerns surrounding implementation
of the antidrug rule outside the territory of the United States remain and the FAA has substantially revised the international
section of the antidrug rule (section XII, appendix I).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00042 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Consistent with the proposed rule, this final rule provides that no employee located outside the territory of the
United States shall be tested for illegal use of drugs under the provisions of appendix I. To ensure proper selection
for random testing, an employer must remove from the random testing pool any employee assigned to perform safety-sensitive
functions solely outside the territory of the United States, since such an employee is not available for testing.
The employee must be returned to the random testing pool as soon as the employee once more begins to perform functions
wholly or partially within the territory of the United States. As noted above, the employer has the option of requiring
the employee to undergo a pre-employment test prior to returning to the performance of a safety-sensitive function
within the territory of the United States (and therefore to the random testing pool). This section also provides that
the provisions of appendix I do not apply to employees performing safety-sensitive functions by contract outside
the territory of the United States. 

Although most commenters supported this revision, one commenter expressed concern that employees performing safety-sensitive
functions within the territory of the United States may be subject to random testing at a disproportionately high
rate if employees outside the territory of the United States are excused from testing and that employees taken out
of the random testing pool may pose a safety risk. The FAA is cognizant of concerns about safety and economic parity
that are raised by this exclusion. However, the FAA has determined that the burdens associated with extraterritorial
testing outweigh the possible safety benefit. The FAA expects that employers will ensure that persons performing
safety-sensitive functions wholly or partially within the territory of the United States remain subject to an effective
random testing program. Finally, employers concerned about drug use by employees removed from the random testing
pool may, as addressed above, subject such employees to pre-employment testing prior to permitting the employees
to perform safety-sensitive functions within the territory of the United States. 



Paperwork Reduction Act Approval
 


The recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the final antidrug rule, issued on November 14, 1988, were previously
submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980. The OMB approval is under control number 2120-0535. The recordkeeping and reporting requirements
in this amendment to the final rule were submitted to OMB during the NPRM stage and approved under the same OMB

#

2120-0535. There have been no changes to the paperwork or recordkeeping burden since the NPRM approval. 



Federalism Implications
 


The amendments in this final rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, the FAA has determined that this final rule does
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



Regulatory Evaluation Summary 



The FAA has determined that this final rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. The
Agency has prepared a regulatory evaluation that analyzes the costs and benefits of this final rule. The FAA does not
expect that this rule will have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 

A copy of the complete regulatory evaluation, regulatory flexibility determination, and international trade assessment
has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the office identified under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 



International Trade Impact Analysis 



The FAA finds that this rule will not have an adverse impact on trade opportunities for either U.S. firms doing business
overseas or foreign firms doing business in the United States. 



Significance
 


This rule is not likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, although it may result in
a small increase in costs for consumers, industry, or Federal, State, or local agencies. The FAA has determined that
the rule is not significant under the Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department
of Transportation (44 FR 11034; February 2, 1979).

This appendix contains the standards and components that must be included in an antidrug program required by this
chapter. 

I. 

DOT Procedures.

 Each employer shall ensure that drug testing programs conducted pursuant to 14 CFR parts 65, 121, and 135 complies
with the requirements of this appendix and the ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs''
published by the Department of Transportation (DOT) (49 CFR part 40). An employer may not use or contract with any drug
testing laboratory that is not certified by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) pursuant to the DHHS
``Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' (53 FR 11970; April 11, 1988 as amended by 59
FR 29908; June 9, 1994). 

II. 

Definitions.

 For the purpose of this appendix, the following definitions apply: 



Accident

 means an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards
the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have disembarked, and in which any person suffers death
or serious injury, or in which the aircraft receives substantial damage. 



Annualized rate

 for the purposes of unannounced testing of employees based on random selection means the percentage of specimen collection
and testing of employees performing a safety-sensitive function during a calendar year. The employer shall determine
the annualized rate by referring to the total number of employees performing a safety-sensitive function for the
employer at the beginning of the calendar year. 



Employee

 is a person who performs, either directly or by contract, a safety-sensitive function for an employer, as defined
below. Provided, however, that an employee who works for an employer who holds a part 135 certificate and who holds
a part 121 certificate is considered to be an employee of the part 121 certificate holder for the purposes of this appendix.




Employer

 is a part 121 certificate holder, a part 135 certificate holder, an operator as defined in  135.1(c) of this chapter,
or an air traffic control facility not operated by the FAA or by or under contract to the U.S. military. Provided, however,
that an employer may use a person who is not included under that employer's drug program to perform a safety-sensitive
function, if that person is subject to the requirements of another employer's FAA-approved antidrug program. 



Performing

 (a safety-sensitive function): an employee is considered to be performing a safety-sensitive function during any
period in which he or she is actually performing, ready to perform, or immediately available to perform such function.




Prohibited drug

 means marijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), amphetamines, or a substance specified in Schedule I or
Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 811, 812, unless the drug is being used as authorized by a legal
prescription or other exemption under Federal, state, or local law. 



Refusal to submit

 means that an individual failed to provide a urine sample as required in 49 CFR part 40, without a valid medical explanation,
after he or she has received notice of the requirement to be tested in accordance with this appendix or engaged in conduct
that clearly obstructed the testing process. 



Safety-sensitive function

 means a function listed in section III of this appendix. 



Substance abuse professional

 means a licensed physician (Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathy), or a licensed or certified psychologist, social
worker, employee assistance professional, or addiction counselor (certified by the National Association of Alcoholism
and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission), with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis
and treatment of disorders related to drug use and abuse. 



Verified negative drug test result

 means that the test result of a urine sample collected and tested under this appendix has been verified by a Medical
Review Officer as negative in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. 



Verified positive drug test result

 means that the test result of a urine sample collected and tested under this appendix has been verified by a Medical
Review Officer as positive in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. 

III. 

Employees Who Must Be Tested.

 Each person who performs a safety-sensitive function directly or by contract for an employer must be tested pursuant
to an FAA-approved antidrug program conducted in accordance with this appendix: 

A. Flight crewmember duties. 
B. Flight attendant duties. 
C. Flight instruction duties. 
D. Aircraft dispatcher duties. 
E. Aircraft maintenance or preventive maintenance duties. 
F. Ground security coordinator duties. 
G. Aviation screening duties. 
H. Air traffic control duties.

IV. 

Substances for Which Testing Must Be Conducted. 

Each employer shall test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function for evidence of marijuana, cocaine,
opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines during each test required by section V of this appendix. As part of
a reasonable cause drug testing program established pursuant to this part, employers may test for drugs in addition
to those specified in this part only with approval granted by the FAA under 49 CFR part 40 and for substances for which
the Department of Health and Human Services has established an approved testing protocol and positive threshold.


V. 

Types of Drug Testing Required.

 Each employer shall conduct the following types of testing in accordance with the procedures set forth in this appendix
and the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' (49 CFR part 40): 

A. 

Pre-employment Testing. 

1. Prior to the first time an individual performs a safety-sensitive function for an employer, the employer shall
require the individual to undergo testing for prohibited drug use. 

2. An employer is permitted to require pre-employment testing of an individual if the following criteria are met:


(a) The individual previously performed a covered function for the employer; 

(b) The employer removed the individual from the employer's random testing program conducted under this appendix
for reasons other than a verified positive test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or a refusal to submit to such testing;
and 

(c) The individual will be returning to the performance of a safety-sensitive function. 

3. No employer shall allow an individual required to undergo pre-employment testing under section V, paragraphs
A.1 or A.2 of this appendix to perform a safety-sensitive function unless the employer has received a verified negative
drug test result for the individual. 

4. The employer shall advise each individual applying to perform a safety-sensitive function at the time of application
that the individual will be required to undergo pre-employment testing to determine the presence of marijuana, cocaine,
opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs in the individual's system. The employer
shall provide this same notification to each individual required by the employer to undergo pre-employment testing
under section V, paragraph A.(2) of this appendix. 

B. Periodic Testing.

 Each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function for an employer and who is required to undergo a medical examination
under part 67 of this chapter shall submit to a periodic drug test. The employee shall be tested for the presence of marijuana,
cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs during the first calendar
year of implementation of the employer's antidrug program. The tests shall be conducted in conjunction with the first
medical evaluation of the employee or in accordance with an alternative method for collecting periodic test specimens
detailed in an employer's approved antidrug program. An employer may discontinue periodic testing of its employees
after the first calendar year of implementation of the employer's antidrug program when the employer has implemented
an unannounced testing program based on random selection of employees. 

C. 

Random Testing.

 Each employer shall randomly select employees who perform a safety-sensitive function for the employer for unannounced
drug testing. The employer shall randomly select employees for unannounced testing for the presence of marijuana,
cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs in an employee's system
using a random number table or a computer-based, number generator that is matched with an employee's social security
number, payroll identification number, or any other alternative method approved by the FAA. 

(1) During the first 12 months following implementation of unannounced testing based on random selection pursuant
to this appendix, an employer shall meet the following conditions:

(a) The unannounced testing based on random selection of employees shall be spread reasonably throughout the 12-month
period. 

(b) The last collection of specimens for random testing during the year shall be conducted at an annualized rate equal
to not less than 50 percent of employees performing a safety-sensitive function. 

(c) The total number of unannounced tests based on random selection during the 12 months shall be equal to not less than
25 percent of the employees performing a safety-sensitive function. 

(2) Following the first 12 months, an employer shall achieve and maintain an annualized rate equal to not less than
50 percent of employees performing a safety-sensitive function. 

D. 

Post-accident Testing.

 Each employer shall test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function for the presence of marijuana, cocaine,
opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs in the employee's system if that employee's
performance either contributed to an accident or can not be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the
accident. The employee shall be tested as soon as possible but not later than 32 hours after the accident. The decision
not to administer a test under this section must be based on a determination, using the best information available
at the time of the determination, that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident. The
employee shall submit to post-accident testing under this section. 

E. 

Testing Based on Reasonable Cause.

 Each employer shall test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function and who is reasonably suspected
of using a prohibited drug. Each employer shall test an employee's specimen for the presence of marijuana, cocaine,
opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines, or a metabolite of those drugs. An employer may test an employee's
specimen for the presence of other prohibited drugs or drug metabolites only in accordance with this appendix and
the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs'' (49 CFR part 40). At least two of the employee's
supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of the symptoms of possible drug use, shall substantiate and concur
in the decision to test an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use; provided, however, that in the case of an
employer other than a part 121 certificate holder who employs 50 or fewer employees who perform safety-sensitive
functions, one supervisor who is trained in detection of symptoms of possible drug use shall substantiate the decision
to test an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use. The decision to test must be based on a reasonable and articulable
belief that the employee is using a prohibited drug on the basis of specific contemporaneous physical, behavioral,
or performance indicators of probable drug use.

F. 

Return to Duty Testing. 

Each employer shall ensure that before an individual is returned to duty to perform a safety-sensitive function after
refusing to submit to a drug test required by this appendix or receiving a verified positive drug test result on a test
conducted under this appendix the individual shall undergo a drug test. No employer shall allow an individual required
to undergo return to duty testing to perform a safety-sensitive function unless the employer has received a verified
negative drug test result for the individual. 

G. 

Follow-up Testing. 

Each employer shall implement a reasonable program of unannounced testing of each individual who has been hired to
perform or who has been returned to the performance of a safety-sensitive function after refusing to submit to a drug
test required by this appendix or receiving a verified positive drug test result on a test conducted under this appendix.


2. The number and frequency of such testing shall be determined by the employer's Medical Review Officer. In the case
of any individual evaluated under this appendix and determined to be in need of assistance in resolving problems associated
with illegal use of drugs, follow-up testing shall consist of at least six tests in the first 12 months following the
employee's return to duty. 

3. The employer may direct the employee to undergo testing for alcohol, in addition to drugs, if the Medical Review
Officer determines that alcohol testing is necessary for the particular employee. Any such alcohol testing shall
be conducted in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR part 40. 

4. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months after the date the individual begins to perform or returns to the performance
of a safety-sensitive function. The Medical Review Officer may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing
at any time after the first six tests have been conducted, if the Medical Review Officer determines that such testing
is no longer necessary. 



VI. Administrative and Other Matters 



A. 

Collection, Testing, and Rehabilitation Records. 

Each employer shall maintain all records related to the collection process, including all logbooks and certification
statements, for two years. Each employer shall maintain records of employee confirmed positive drug test results,
SAP evaluations, and employee rehabilitation for five years. The employer shall maintain records of negative test
results for 12 months. The employer shall permit the Administrator or the Administrator's representative to examine
these records. 

B. 

Laboratory Inspections. 

The employer shall contract only with a laboratory that permits pre-award inspections by the employer before the
laboratory is awarded a testing contract and unannounced inspections, including examination of any and all records
at any time by the employer, the Administrator, or the Administrator's representative. 


C. 

Employee Request for Test of a Split Specimen. 

Not later than 72 hours after receipt of notice of a verified positive test result, an employee may request that the
MRO arrange for testing of the second, ``split'' specimen obtained during the collection of the primary specimen
that resulted in the confirmed positive test result. 

2. The split specimen shall be tested in accordance with the procedures in 49 CFR part 40. 

3. The MRO shall not delay verification of the primary test result following a request for a split specimen test unless
such delay is based on reasons other than the pendency of the split specimen test result. If the primary test result
is verified as positive, actions required under this rule (e.g., notification to the Federal Air Surgeon, removal
from safety-sensitive position) are not stayed during the 72-hour request period or pending receipt of the split
specimen test result. 

D. 

Release of Drug Testing Information. 

An employer shall release information regarding an employee's drug testing results, evaluation, or rehabilitation
to a third party in accordance with the specific, written consent of the employee authorizing release of the information
to an identified person, to the National Transportation Safety Board as part of an accident investigation upon written
request or order, to the FAA upon request, or as required by this appendix. Except as required by law or this appendix,
no employer shall release employee information. 

E. 

Refusal To Submit to Testing. 

Each employer shall notify the FAA within 5 working days of any employee who holds a certificate issued under part 61,
part 63, or part 65 of this chapter who has refused to submit to a drug test required under this appendix. Notification
should be sent to: Federal Aviation Administration, Aviation Standards National Field Office, Airmen Certification
Branch, AVN-460, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125. 

2. Employers are not required to notify the above office of refusals to submit to pre-employment or return to duty testing.


F. 

Permanent Disqualification From Service. 

An employee who has verified positive drug test results on two drug tests required by appendix I to part 121 of this chapter
and conducted after September 19, 1994 is permanently precluded from performing for an employer the safety-sensitive
duties the employee performed prior to the second drug test. 

2. An employee who has engaged in prohibited drug use during the performance of a safety-sensitive function after
September 19, 1994 is permanently precluded from performing that safety-sensitive function for an employer. 



VII. Medical Review Officer/Substance Abuse Professional 




The employer shall designate or appoint a Medical Review Officer (MRO) who shall be qualified in accordance with 49
CFR part 40 and shall perform the functions set forth in 49 CFR part 40 and this appendix. If the employer does not have
a qualified individual on staff to serve as MRO, the employer may contract for the provision of MRO services as part

I. Refrigerant Recycling Regulations 



Final regulations published on May 14, 1993 (58 

FR

 28660) 
establish a recycling program for ozone-depleting refrigerants 
recovered during the servicing and disposal of air-conditioning 
and refrigeration equipment. Together with the prohibition on 
venting during the maintenance, service, repair, and disposal of 
class I and class II substances (see the listing notice January 
22, 1991; 56 

FR

 2420) that took effect on July 1, 1992, these 
regulations should substantially reduce the emissions of ozone-
depleting refrigerants. The regulations require that persons 
servicing air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment observe 
certain service practices that reduce emissions, and establish 
equipment and reclamation certification requirements, as well as 
a technician certification requirement. A sales restriction on 
the sale of refrigerant was also established by the final 
regulations. As of November 14, 1994, only certified technicians 
will legally be authorized to purchase refrigerant.
 In 
addition, the final regulations established a leak repair 
requirement for equipment that normally holds a refrigerant 
charge of fifty pounds or more. Finally, the regulations require 
that ozone-depleting compounds contained in appliances be removed 
prior to disposal of the appliances, and that all air- 
conditioning and refrigeration equipment, except for small 
appliances, be provided with a servicing aperture that will 
facilitate recovery of refrigerant. 





II. Revisions to the Refrigerant Recycling Regulations 



Through this action EPA is promulgating several minor 
changes to the final rule. Below is a description of each change 
to the regulatory text that appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on 
May 14, 1993. 



A. Definitions 



1. Technician 



Section 82.152(x) defines a ``technician'' for purposes of the 
refrigerant recycling rule. A technician is a person who 
provides maintenance, service or repair that could reasonably be 
expected to release ozone-depleting substances through those 
actions. Section 82.152(x) includes in the definition of ``technician'' a 
person who disposes of appliances, but does not include any 
person disposing of small appliances. In excluding such persons, 
EPA considered the nature of work associated with recovering 
refrigerants from small appliances prior to disposal, the 
affected workforce, and any environmental damage that could 
result from emissions during disposal. 

In drafting the final rule, EPA left out motor vehicle air 
conditioners (MVAC)
 and MVAC-like equipment
 in exempting 
certification of technicians disposing of certain types of 
equipment. Disposal of MVACs and MVAC-like appliances is similar 
in many ways to the disposal of small appliances. EPA 
distinguishes between large equipment that is dismantled on-site 
and portable equipment that may enter the waste stream with its 
refrigerant charge still intact because of the differences 
between the two types of equipment once they reach the end of 
their useful lives. Large equipment dismantled on-site must have 
refrigerant removed as part of the dismantling process because 
there is no other option that will result in successful recovery 
of refrigerant. This large equipment cannot enter the waste 
stream with the charge intact, while more portable small 
appliances, MVACs, and MVAC-like equipment frequently does enter 
the waste stream with the charge intact.

In regulations promulgated under section 608, EPA discussed the differences between the disposal sector and the
servicing sector. (See 58 FR 28705.) EPA noted that unlike the servicing sector, the disposal sector does not reintroduce
refrigerant to equipment, after removal. Refrigerant is merely being removed, usually after the appliances have
been removed from operation. This removal may occur at any stage either before it enters the waste stream or once in
the waste stream. 

Since the types of recover-only processes used with small appliances, MVACs, and MVAC-like equipment tend to be relatively
straight-forward and a simpler task than recycling or the recovery of refrigerant from larger types of appliances,
EPA did not require the certification of technicians disposing of small appliances. Since the circumstances for
disposing of small appliances is quite similar to the circumstances for disposing of MVACs and MVAC-like equipment,
EPA believes it is appropriate to revise the definition of ``technician'' to exclude any person disposing of MVAC
and MVAC-like equipment. The revised definition will consequently read as follows: ``Technician means any person
who performs maintenance, service, or repair that could reasonably be expected to release class I or class II substances
from appliances into the atmosphere, including but not limited to installers, contractor employees, in-house service
personnel, and in some cases, owners. Technician also means any person disposing of appliances except for small appliances,
MVACs, and MVAC-like equipment.'' 



2. Adoption of Standard Based on ARI 700-1993 in Definition of ``Reclaim'' 



Section 82.152(q) defines ``reclaim'' to mean ``to reprocess refrigerant to at least the standard of purity specified
in the ARI Standard 700-1988, Specifications for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants.'' A standard based closely on
ARI 700-1988 is included in the rule as Appendix A. During the comment period on the proposed  608 refrigerant
recycling rule, the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute had requested that EPA adopt a standard based
on ARI 700-1993, which is an updated version of ARI 700-1988. ARI described the differences between ARI
700-1988 and ARI 700-1993 during the public hearing and submitted a draft version of the updated standard,
which was included in the public docket for the rule. 
The updated standard included changes in three areas:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00056 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. ARI 700-1993 included purity standards for eleven additional refrigerants: R-23, R-32, R-123,
R-124, R-125, R-134a, R-143a, R-401(A), R-401(B), R-402(A), and R-402(B).


2. Liquid phase contaminant water levels were increased from 10ppm in ARI 700-1988 to 20ppm in ARI 700-1993
for R-11 and R-113 only. 

3. Where ARI 700-1988 allowed 0.5 as the maximum percentage by weight of ``other refrigerants,'' ARI 700-1993
allows 0.50 as the maximum percentage by weight of ``all other organic impurities, including other refrigerants.''
The inclusion of organic impurities other than refrigerants in the limit effectively tightens the standard, and
at the same time, the change from 0.5 to 0.50 reduces the tolerance of the standard by a factor of ten. (Thus, while a sample
containing 0.54 percent other refrigerants would have met the old standard, only a sample containing 0.504 percent
(or less) other organic impurities would meet the new standard.) 

Although all the comments received by EPA regarding adoption of the updated standard were favorable, the standard
was not included in the final rule because it was not finalized by the time the final rule was published. (See 58 FR 28679
for a discussion of this issue in the final rule.) An appendix to the standard specifying procedures for analyzing
refrigerant was undergoing a lengthy process of peer review, which is now complete. Because the final standard is
substantially identical to the draft that was included in the docket for comment, and because EPA agrees with commenters
that the changes to the standard are appropriate and necessary, EPA is changing the definition of ``reclaim'' to refer
to ARI 700-1993, and is replacing the standard based on ARI 700-1988 with a standard based on ARI 700-1993
as appendix A. EPA is also replacing references to ARI 700-1988 with references to ARI 700-1993 in its reclaimer
certification program. 

Because section 608 of the Act does not give EPA the authority to regulate refrigerants that do not contain class I or
class II substances until November, 1995, EPA is not adopting the purity standards of ARI 700-1993 that apply
to refrigerants that do not contain CFCs or HCFCs. Thus, EPA is not adopting purity requirements for HFC-23,
HFC-32, HFC-125, HFC-134a, or HFC-143a at this time. (ARI and other standard-setting organizations
remain free, of course, to adopt and observe purity requirements for these refrigerants.) However, the purity requirements
for CFC and HCFC refrigerants (including blends that contain either CFCs or HCFCs along with non-ozone-depleting
components) in appendix A are identical to the purity requirements for CFC and HCFC refrigerants in ARI 700-1993.


EPA would like to clarify that since it is not possible to return a refrigerant to a standard of purity if no standard
of purity is specified for that refrigerant, refrigerants that are not covered by appendix A need not be reclaimed
under this regulation.

1. Sale of Used Appliances Without Service Apertures



Section 82.154(j) and  82.154(k) are prohibitions against the sale and distribution, or offer for sale and
distribution of any appliance, unless such equipment is equipped with either a service aperture or, for small appliances,
with a process stub, to facilitate the removal of refrigerant. EPA would like to clarify that for the purposes of these
prohibitions, EPA will interpret sale, distribution, or offer of sale or distribution as not referring to the sale
of used products. Sale of used products means a sale or distribution by a person after a period of use other than demonstration
use. The Agency recognizes that there is a market for the sale of used air conditioners and refrigerators. Restricting
the resale of such used durable goods before the end of their productive lifetimes would provide little, if any, environmental
benefit. Indeed, the introduction of a service aperture may lead to unintentional releases by weakening the refrigeration
circuit. Because requiring these goods to be retrofitted prior to resale would impose significant economic hardship
on a great many consumers without providing significant environmental benefits, EPA does not believe it is necessary
to ban their resale. Consequently, while EPA's interpretation of sale and distribution or offer for sale and distribution
is such that the entire chain of sale and distribution from the manufacturer of a new product to its ultimate consumer
is included, the Agency recognizes that in the case of durable consumer goods, resale of the product to additional
consumers may occur after the original sale or distribution of the new product to the ultimate consumer after some
period of use by the original ultimate consumer. In such cases, EPA will not prohibit the sale of these used products.




2. Exceptions to Prohibition on Sale of Unreclaimed Refrigerant 



Prohibitions   82.154(g) and 82.154(h) currently prohibit the sale of used refrigerant that has not
been reclaimed by a certified reclaimer. EPA intended to exclude two classes of used refrigerant from this prohibition:
refrigerant that was and is to be used only in an MVAC or MVAC-like appliance, and refrigerant that is contained in an
appliance that is sold or offered for sale together with the refrigerant. The section 609 refrigerant recycling rule,
which covers MVACs, explicitly recognizes and permits the transfer of refrigerant between MVACs owned by different
persons if that refrigerant is: (1) Recovered from an MVAC and returned to an MVAC by a single service entity; and (2)
recycled to meet the SAE J1991 standard.
 (This provision of the section 609 rule, which is contained in the definition of ``properly using'' recycling and
recovery equipment, also covers MVAC-like appliances pursuant to  82.156(a)(5).) Because this standard
is not as stringent as the standard that reclaimed refrigerant must meet in the section 608 refrigerant recycling
rule, refrigerant that only meets this standard cannot be considered reclaimed. Thus, such refrigerant cannot be
sold under the section 608 rule. However, EPA did not intend to reverse the position that it took in the section 609 rule
regarding the transfer of refrigerant between MVACs owned by different people. For instance, one of the primary arguments
made in support of the reclamation requirement in the section 608 rule, that no less stringent recycling standard
currently exists (58 FR 28679), clearly does not apply to MVACs and MVAC-like appliances, which are governed by the
less stringent SAE J1991 standard. EPA is therefore amending the prohibitions to exclude the sale of refrigerant
transferred between MVACs or MVAC-like appliances. 





Another primary argument made in support of the reclamation requirement, that transfer of refrigerant between different
owners can contaminate appliances, clearly does not apply to refrigerant that changes ownership solely because
it is contained in an appliance that changes ownership. If refrigerant remains within a single appliance, it obviously
cannot introduce contaminants into another appliance. Thus, EPA is also amending the prohibition to exclude the
sale of refrigerant that is contained in an appliance that is sold or offered for sale together with the refrigerant.




C. Required Practices 



1. Exception for Leaky Appliances to Evacuation Requirements at Disposal 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 82.156(a)(2)(ii) establishes an exception to the evacuation requirements for appliances undergoing maintenance,
service, or repair. The paragraph reads: 

If, due to leaks in the appliance, evacuation to the levels in Table 1 is not attainable, or would substantially contaminate
the refrigerant being recovered, persons opening the appliance must: 

(A) Isolate leaking from non-leaking components wherever possible; 

(B) Evacuate non-leaking components to be opened to the levels specified in Table 1; and 

(C) Evacuate leaking components to be opened to the lowest level that can be attained without substantially contaminating
the refrigerant. In no case shall this level exceed 0 psig. 

Through an accidental omission, the requirements in  82.156(a)(3) for evacuating appliances at disposal
contain no exception for leaky appliances, although the rationale for such an exception at disposal is identical
to the rationale for the exception at maintenance, service, or repair. That is, leaks in the appliance may permit air
to enter the appliance as the internal pressure of the appliance is lowered, contaminating the refrigerant being
recovered and making it impossible to attain the required vacuum. EPA is therefore adding an exception for leaky appliances
to the evacuation requirements at disposal. This exception is identical to that at maintenance, service, and repair.





2. Use of Nitrogen to Pressurize -113 Appliances for Non-Major Repairs 




Section 82.156(a)(2)(B) prohibits the use of nitrogen to pressurize low-pressure appliances for non-major repairs.
In including this prohibition in the rule, EPA intended to encourage the use of pressurization methods that do not
require subsequent purging, such as heating of the evaporator and/or condenser. However, while heat can be safely
used to pressurize appliances utilizing CFC-11 and HCFC-123 to atmospheric pressure, heat alone is not
a practical or safe method for pressurizing appliances utilizing CFC-113 because the temperatures required
to raise the pressure of CFC-113 to atmospheric pressure are quite high (117.6 
 F for CFC-113 vs. 74.7 
 F for CFC-11). Thus, for refrigerants with boiling points above 85 
 F, EPA is now requiring that heat be used to raise the internal pressure of the appliance as much as possible, but
is permitting nitrogen to be introduced to meet the remaining pressure requirements. 

Contrary to popular perception, EPA has never prohibited the use of nitrogen to pressurize systems for purposes of
a leak check (because leak checking does not involve ``opening'' of the appliance), although the Agency encourages
the use of heat, rather than nitrogen, to pressurize systems whenever possible. Thus, it has been and remains acceptable
to introduce nitrogen into an appliance utilizing CFC-113 for purposes of a leak check. EPA recommends that
heat be the primary method used to raise the internal pressure of appliances containing CFC-113 as much as possible
for checking leaks, and that nitrogen be introduced to meet the remaining pressure requirements. 



3. Requirements for Recovery Using New Recovery Technologies 



In  82.158(b)(2), EPA provided for the certification of recycling and recovery equipment whose recovery efficiency
cannot be tested according to the procedures in ARI 740-1993, which measure levels of evacuation. The rule states
that this new equipment may be certified if an approved third-party testing organization adopts and performs a test
that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the recovery efficiency of the new equipment is
equal to or better than that of equipment that: (i) Is intended for use with the same type of appliance; and (ii) achieves
the level of evacuation in Table 2 of the rule. As discussed in the preamble to the final rule (58 FR 28689), EPA's goal
in including this provision was to avoid unnecessary delay in the certification, marketing, and use of new recovery
technologies that do not operate by drawing vacuums. 

However, EPA inadvertently neglected to include a provision in the required practices section (82.156) that would
permit the use of recovery technologies that do not operate by drawing vacuums. EPA is therefore adding a provision,
 82.156(a)(2)(iii), that permits the use of equipment certified pursuant to  82.158(b)(2), as long
as users of this equipment follow the manufacturer's directions for achieving the required recovery efficiencies.
EPA will make the development of and compliance with such directions part of the process for certifying new recovery
technologies under  82.158(b)(2). 



4. Availability of Certified Recycling and Recovery Equipment to Persons Disposing of MVACs and MVAC-Like Appliances




Section 82.156(b) currently requires that: All persons opening appliances except for small appliances and MVACs
for maintenance, service, or repair and all persons disposing of appliances except for small appliances must have
at least one piece of certified, self-contained recovery equipment available at their place of business. 


EPA inadvertently omitted three items from this paragraph. First, certified, self-contained recycling equipment
should have been listed along with certified, self-contained recovery equipment as equipment that would meet this
requirement. In all other sections of the rule, recycling and recovery equipment are treated identically, and EPA
did not intend to treat them differently here. Therefore, EPA is inserting ``or recycling'' between ``recovery''
and ``equipment'' in  82.156(b). 

Second, persons disposing of MVACs and MVAC-like appliances should have been excluded along with persons disposing
of small appliances from the requirement to have one piece of certified, self-contained recovery or recycling equipment
available at their place of business. EPA clearly intended to exclude these persons from this requirement because
it excludes recovery and recycling equipment used to dispose MVACs and MVAC-like equipment from third-party certification
requirements. (See the final rule preamble at 58 FR 28705,   82.158(a) and 82.158(l).) Therefore, EPA
is inserting ``MVACs, or MVAC-like appliances'' after ``all persons disposing of appliances except for small appliances,''
excluding all three groups from the requirement to have certified recovery or recycling equipment available at their
place of business. 

Third, EPA intended to exempt persons who own appliances containing pump-out units and who maintain, service, repair,
or dispose of only these appliances from the above requirement. The requirement was intended to ensure that persons
who used small, portable system-dependent recovery equipment to service appliances also had self-contained equipment
available in the event the appliance compressor was not operational. In general, such small, self-contained recovery
equipment is not prohibitively expensive, particularly if it is to be used for a large number of jobs. However, the
requirement may also affect owners of chillers, which are frequently equipped with built-in pump-out units that
are used for the recovery of large quantities of refrigerant. Because system compressors may be used to move the refrigerant
into the pump-out unit in some cases, these units may be considered ``system-dependent'' in those cases.
 While small self-contained recovery devices are relatively inexpensive, larger self-contained recovery devices
may be prohibitively costly for persons who own and service a limited number of chillers. Moreover, instead of purchasing
large recovery devices, owners of chillers may contract out the recovery procedure if the built-in unit is not capable
of meeting the applicable evacuation requirements. EPA did not intend to require such owners to purchase expensive
equipment when this less costly remedy exists. Thus, EPA is adding a sentence to make this exemption explicit. However,
persons exempted from  82.156(b) are still required to meet the other applicable requirements of  82.156
(e.g., evacuation requirements).

5. Exemption for Pump-out Units From 15-pound Limit for 
System-Dependent Equipment 



Section 82.156(c) prohibits the use of system-dependent equipment 
with appliances normally containing more than 15 pounds of 
refrigerant. This prohibition was intended to cover small, 
portable system-dependent equipment, which is not designed for 
the recovery of large quantities of refrigerant. As noted above, 
however, some large chillers are equipped with built-in pump-out 
units that could also be considered ``system-dependent equipment,'' 
but that are designed to be used for the recovery of large 
quantities of refrigerant. EPA did not intend to prohibit the 
use of such pump-out units for recovery. Thus, EPA is revising 
 82.156(c) to read ``System-dependent equipment shall not be used 
with appliances normally containing more than 15 pounds of 
refrigerant, unless the system-dependent equipment is permanently 
attached to the appliance as a pump-out unit.'' 



6. Applicability Solely to Equipment Containing More Than 
50 Pounds of Refrigerant of Leak Repair and Associated 
Recordkeeping Requirements 



Section 82.156(i), the leak repair requirement, contains two 
subparagraphs that apply to owners of different types of 
equipment. The first subparagraph,  82.156(i)(1), applies to 
``owners of commercial refrigeration and industrial process 
refrigeration,'' specifying no lower size limit for covered 
equipment. The second subparagraph,  82.156(i)(2), applies to 
``owners of appliances normally containing more than 50 pounds of 
refrigerant and not covered by paragraph (i)(1).'' EPA has 
received numerous inquiries regarding whether or not it intended 
to include a lower size limit in the first subparagraph. 

Although EPA did not explicitly restrict the scope of its 
leak repair requirement for commercial and industrial process 
refrigeration to equipment containing more than 50 pounds of 
refrigerant, EPA intended this requirement to cover only 
equipment containing at least 50 pounds. The definition of 
commercial refrigeration includes a note that ``[a]ll of the 
equipment contains large refrigerant charges, typically over 75 
pounds,'' and the discussion of industrial process refrigeration 
that appears in the preamble to the rule includes a note that 
``charge sizes can be very large, ranging from 750-3000 lbs for 
ice rinks, and rising as high as 20,000 lbs for built-up 
centrifugal units.'' (No other charge sizes are mentioned.) 
The preamble also notes: 

The 50-pound cut-off is intended to exempt smaller 
equipment where the cost of repairing the leak is an 
order of magnitude higher than the environmental 
benefit of repairing the leak (RIA). The 50-pound cut-off is also consistent with guidance found in the 
ASHRAE Guideline 3-1990 (58 FR 28680). 

This rationale applies to commercial and industrial process 
refrigeration as well as to other large appliances. 

In order to clarify that only commercial and industrial 
process refrigeration equipment containing more than 50 pounds is 
covered by the leak repair requirements, EPA is now specifying 
this limit in  82.156(i)(1). 



D. Equipment Certification 



1. Measurement of Recovery Rates 



Section 82.158(b)(6) requires manufacturers of recycling and 
recovery equipment to have an approved equipment testing 
organization measure the liquid and vapor recovery rates of 
equipment as part of the equipment certification process. EPA 
required measurement and publication of these recovery rates in 
order to ensure that technicians would not inadvertently purchase 
equipment whose recovery rates were too low for the intended 
application; the Agency was concerned that a technician 
purchasing underpowered equipment would be tempted to interrupt 
the resulting lengthy recovery process before it was complete. 

However, some types of equipment do not have inherent liquid 
and vapor recovery rates. For instance, the recovery rate of 
system-dependent equipment depends upon the compressor of the 
individual appliance from which it is recovering refrigerant. 
EPA intended to exempt this equipment from the requirement to 
have its liquid and vapor recovery rate measured. First, system-dependent equipment certified pursuant to  82.158(b)
typically 
has a higher recovery rate than self-contained equipment, because 
appliance compressors are usually larger and therefore faster 
than recovery equipment compressors. Second, the use of system- 
dependent equipment is limited to appliances normally containing 
less than 15 pounds of refrigerant. Thus, low recovery rates are 
not a concern for such equipment. EPA is therefore amending 
Section 82.158(b)(6) of the rule to clarify that equipment with 
no inherent liquid or vapor recovery rates need not have these 
rates measured. 



E. Technician Certification







Section 82.161(a) requires that technicians be certified. EPA 
exempted from this requirement technicians that are disposing of 
small appliances, room air conditioners, and MVACs because these 
technicians are only recovering the refrigerant prior to the 
disposal of this equipment. As discussed earlier, persons 
disposing of this equipment were exempt from the requirement 
because the nature of this work is straight-forward. As outlined 
above, EPA is extending this exemption to MVAC-like appliances. 
Throughout the rule, EPA states that since MVAC appliances and 
MVAC-like appliances are similar in nature and design, it is 
appropriate for these technicians to be treated in a similar 
fashion. In  82.161(a)(5), EPA provides a method for those 
servicing MVAC-like appliances to be certified by attending a 
program designed and approved under section 609 for training and 
certifying MVAC technicians. Therefore, to maintain consistency 
as discussed in Section A of this rulemaking, EPA will extend the 
exemption from the certification requirement to technicians that 
are disposing of MVAC-like appliances. In addition, since ``room 
air conditioners'' are considered a type of small appliance, and 
small appliances are already excepted from the certification 
requirement, EPA will delete ``room air conditioners'' from the 
list of exceptions.

F. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 



1. Sales Restriction_Effective Date for Recordkeeping 



Section 82.166(a) establishes a recordkeeping requirement for all 
persons who sell or distribute any class I or class II substance 
for use as a refrigerant. Since no effective date was specified 
for this particular requirement, this provision became effective 
June 14, 1993, the effective date of the Refrigerant Recycling 
Regulations. However, the restriction on selling or distributing 
of ozone-depleting refrigerants is not effective until November 
14, 1994, pursuant to  82.154(n). EPA does not believe it is 
necessary to maintain records regarding the sale and distribution 
of refrigerant in advance of the effective date of the actual 
sales or distribution restriction. Furthermore, such a 
requirement places an unnecessary burden on industry. Without 
the existence of a sales restriction, the usefulness of such 
records is dubious. Therefore, through this action EPA will 
change the effective date for maintaining records regarding sales 
and distribution of refrigerants from June 14, 1993 to November 
14, 1994. 



2. Proof of Employment of Certified Personnel 



Section 82.166(b) allows the purchasers of any class I or class II 
refrigerants who employ certified technicians to provide evidence 
of each technician's certification to the wholesaler who sells 
them refrigerant. The wholesaler will keep this information on 
file. The purchaser is further required to notify the wholesaler 
regarding any changes in a technician's certification or 
employment status. Concerns have recently been brought to EPA's 
attention about the practicability of implementing this 
provision. Large organizations often employ large numbers of 
certified technicians that may be situated at various locations 
around the country. Tracking and notifying wholesalers of 
employee status may result in an overwhelming responsibility. 
EPA did not intend this requirement to place any undue burden on 
the employers of large numbers of technicians. In fact, EPA 
believed that allowing employers to purchase refrigerant for 
their technicians, instead of requiring the technician to be 
physically present at the point of sale, would actually decrease 
the burden for the technician, the wholesaler, and the 
technician's employer. 

Therefore, EPA is modifying this requirement to read: 
Purchasers of any class I or class II refrigerants who employ 
certified technicians may provide evidence that at least one 
technician is properly certified to the wholesaler who sells them 
refrigerant; the wholesaler will then keep this information on 
file and may sell refrigerant to the purchaser or his authorized 
representative even if such purchaser or authorized 
representative is not a properly certified technician. In such 
cases, the purchaser must notify the wholesaler in the event that 
the purchaser no longer employs at least one properly certified 
technician. The wholesaler is then prohibited from selling class 
I or class II refrigerants to the purchaser until such time as 
the purchaser employs at least one properly certified technician. 
At that time, the purchaser must provide new evidence that at 
least one technician is properly certified. 

EPA believes that this requirement will still have the 
intended effect of lessening the likelihood that refrigerant is 
sold for use by non-certified personnel, while providing a more 
reasonable means for purchasers to comply with the sales 
restriction. 



G. Appendix A 



EPA adopted an industry standard in the final rule based on 
the Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI) Standard 
700-1988. This standard appeared as Appendix A to Subpart F_Specification for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants.
EPA was aware of 
efforts to revise ARI 700-1988 while the final regulations were 
being drafted. However, the revised version was not completed in 
time for incorporation into this appendix by EPA. As discussed 
above, the updated version, known as ARI 700-1993, includes 
changes in three areas: it adds purity standards for eleven 
additional refrigerants; it increases liquid phase contaminant 
water levels from 10ppm in ARI 700-1988 to 20ppm in ARI 700-1993 
for R-11 and R-113 only; and, where ARI 700-1988 allowed 0.5 as 
the maximum percentage by weight of ``other refrigerants,'' ARI 
700-1993 allows 0.50 as the maximum percentage by weight of ``all 
other organic impurities, including other refrigerants.'' The 
inclusion of all organic impurities in the limit effectively 
tightens the standard, and the change from 0.5 to 0.50 reduces 
the tolerance of the standard by a factor of ten. EPA has 
reviewed ARI 700-1993 and believes it should be substituted 
because it covers additional refrigerants, it increases liquid 
phase contaminant water levels, and broadens the maximum 
percentage of weight requirement to include all other organic 
impurities instead of just other refrigerants. Through this 
action EPA will substitute the standard based on ARI Standard 
700-1988 with a standard based on ARI Standard 700-1993.

Appendix B to Subpart F_Performance of Refrigerant Recovery, Recycling and/or Reclaim Equipment was mistakenly
referred to in the introduction of appendix B as ARI Standard 740-1991. However, this is incorrect. Appendix
B is based upon ARI Standard 740-1993. Through this action EPA will correct the 
reference in the introduction to appendix B. 



I. Appendix D 



Appendix D to subpart F_Standards for Becoming a Certifying Program for Technicians includes reporting requirements
for approved programs. Certifying programs are required to submit to EPA activity reports every six months, the 
first to be submitted six months following the date the program was approved. Since EPA has been approving programs
on a continual basis, these reports are due at various times, instead of being submitted simultaneously. In order
to maximize EPA's ability to review and respond to the information supplied by the programs, EPA is standardizing
the reporting dates. Certifying programs will submit reports to EPA on January 30 and June 30, beginning with the first
full six-month period for which the program has been approved. This means that if a program is approved on March 31,
that program is required to submit its 
first activity report to EPA on the following January 30. 



J. Removal of Parenthetical Statements 



EPA is deleting the parenthetical notes in the individual sections of 40 CFR part 82, subpart F. The Agency consolidated
its display of OMB control numbers in 40 CFR part 9 (see 58 FR 18014, 58 FR 24724, 58 FR 34198 and 58 FR 34369) including
the control number for 40 CFR part 82, subpart F; this consolidated display makes the parenthetical statements in
the individual 
sections of Subpart F duplicative. The information collection request (ICR) was previously subject to public notice
and comment prior to OMB approval. 



III. Effective Dates 



This final action will become effective on October 18, 1994 unless EPA is notified by September 19, 1994 that any person
wishes to submit adverse comment. Should EPA receive such notice, EPA will publish one subsequent action in the 

Federal Register

 to withdraw this final action and another action proposing this action and requesting comments. In such a case, following
a public comment period, the Agency will draft the final regulation to be published in the 

Federal Register

. 



IV. Summary of Supporting Analysis 



A. Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether this regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to 
a rule that may: 

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy,
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, 
or tribal governments or communities; 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 

It has been determined by OMB and EPA that this amendment to the final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review under the Executive Order. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their
regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of
proposed rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis
(RFA). Such an analysis is not 
required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00062 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

EPA believes that any impact that this amendment will have on the regulated community will serve only to provide relief
from otherwise applicable regulations, and will therefore limit the negative economic impact associated with the
regulations previously promulgated under Section 608. An examination of the impacts on small entities was discussed
in the final rule (58 FR 28660). That final rule assessed the impact the rule may have on 
small entities. A separate regulatory impact analysis accompanied the final rule and is contained in Docket A-92-01.
I certify that this amendment to the refrigerant recycling rule will not have any additional negative economic impacts
on any small entities. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



Any information collection requirements in a rule must be submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 Because no additional informational collection requirements are required by this amendment, EPA has determined
that the Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to this rulemaking and no new Information Collection Request document
has been prepared. 



V. Judicial Review 



Because these regulations are nationally applicable under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicial review of this
action is available only by the filing of a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit within sixty days of publication of this action in the 

Federal Register

.

appendix A; 


(c) Release no more than 1.5 percent of the refrigerant 
during the reclamation process; and 


(d) Dispose of wastes from the reclamation process in 
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. 


(e) The data elements for certification are as follows: 


(1) The name and address of the reclaimer; 


(2) A list of equipment used to reprocess and analyze the 
refrigerant; and 


(3) The owner or a responsible officer of the reclaimer 
must sign the certification stating that the refrigerant will be 
returned to at least the standard of purity set forth in appendix

distribute any class I or class II substance for use as a 
refrigerant must retain invoices that indicate the name of the 
purchaser, the date of sale, and the quantity of refrigerant 
purchased. 


(b) Purchasers of any class I or class II refrigerants who employ 
certified technicians may provide evidence that at least one 
technician is properly certified to the wholesaler who sells them 
refrigerant; the wholesaler will then keep this information on 
file and may sell refrigerant to the purchaser or his authorized 
representative even if such purchaser or authorized 
representative is not a properly certified technician. In such 
cases, the purchaser must notify the wholesaler in the event that 
the purchaser no longer employs at least one properly certified 
technician. The wholesaler is then prohibited from selling class 
I or class II refrigerants to the purchaser until such time as 
the purchaser employs at least one properly certified technician. 
At that time, the purchaser must provide new evidence that at 
least one technician is properly certified.

5.2 Refrigerant Sampling. 

5.2.1 

Sampling Precautions. 

Special precautions should be taken 
to assure that representative samples are obtained for analysis. 
Sampling shall be done by trained laboratory personnel following 
accepted sampling and safety procedures. 

5.2.2 

Gas Phase Sample. 

A gas phase sample shall be obtained 
for determining the non-condensables. Since non-condensable 
gases, if present, will concentrate in the vapor phase of the 
refrigerant, care must be exercised to eliminate introduction of 
air during the sample transfer. Purging is not an acceptable 
procedure for a gas phase sample since it may introduce a foreign 
product. Since R11, R113 and R123 have normal boiling points at 
or above room temperature, non-condensable determination is not 
required for these refrigerants. 

5.2.2.1 

Connection. 

The sample cylinder shall be connected to 
an evacuated gas sampling bulb by means of a manifold. The 
manifold should have a valve arrangement that facilitates 
evacuation of all connecting tubing leading to the sampling bulb. 

5.2.2.2 

Equalizing Pressures. 

After the manifold has been 
evacuated, close the valve to the pump and open the valve on the 
system. Allow the pressure to equilibrate and close valves. 

5.2.3 

Liquid Phase Sample. 

A liquid phase sample is required for 
all tests listed in this standard except the test for non- 
condensables. 

5.2.3.1 

Preparation. 

Place an empty sample cylinder with the 
valve open in an oven at 230 
 F [110 
 C] for one hour. Remove it 
from the oven while hot, immediately connect to an evacuation 
system and evacuate to less than 1 mm mercury (1000 microns). 
Close the valve and allow it to cool. 

5.2.3.2 

Manifolding. 

The valve and lines from the unit to be 
sampled shall be clean and dry. The cylinder shall be connected 
to an evacuated gas sampling cylinder by means of a manifold. 
The manifold should have a valve arrangement that facilitates 
evacuation of all connecting tubing leading to the sampling 
cylinder. 

5.2.3.3 

Liquid Sampling. 

After the manifold has been evacuated, 
close the valve to the pump and open the valve on the system. 
Take the sample as a liquid by chilling the sample cylinder 
slightly. Accurate analysis requires that the sample container 
be filled to at least 60% by volume, however under no 
circumstances should the cylinder be filled to more than 80% by 
volume. This can be accomplished by weighing the empty cylinder 
and then the cylinder with refrigerant. When the desired amount 
of refrigerant has been collected, close the valve(s) and 
disconnect the sample cylinder immediately. 

5.2.3.4 

Record Weight. 

Check the sample cylinder for leaks and 
record the gross weight. 

5.3 Refrigerant Purity Characterization. 

5.3.1 

Primary Method. 

The primary method shall be gas 
chromatography (GC) as described in Appendix-93 to ARI Standard 
700. The chromatogram of the sample shall be compared to known 
standards. 

5.3.2 

Alternative Method. 

Determination of the boiling point 
and boiling point range is an acceptable alternative test method 
which can be used to characterize refrigerants. The test method 
shall be that described in the Federal Specification for 
``Fluorocarbon Refrigerants,'' BB-F-1421 B, dated March 5, 1982, 
section 4.4.3 which is incorporated by reference. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of
the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the U.S. Government
Printing Office, Superintendent of Documents, Mail Stop: SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-9328. Copies may also
be inspected at Public Docket No. A-92-01, Waterside Mall (Ground Floor) Environmental Protection Agency,
401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC in room M-1500 or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street,
NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC.

5.3.3 

Required Values. 

The required values for boiling point and 
boiling point range are given in table 1, Physical Properties of 
Fluorocarbon Refrigerants and Maximum Contaminant Levels. 

5.4 Water Content. 

5.4.1 

Method. 

The Coulometric Karl Fischer Titration shall be 
the primary test method for determining the water content of 
refrigerants. This method is described in Appendix-93 to ARI 
Standard 700. This method can be used for refrigerants that are 
either a liquid or a gas at room temperature, including 
refrigerants 11 and 113, and 123. For all refrigerants, the 
sample for water analysis shall be taken from the liquid phase of 
the container to be tested. Proper operation of the analytical 
method requires special equipment and an experienced operator. 
The precision of the results is excellent if proper sampling and 
handling procedures are followed. Refrigerants containing a 
colored dye can be successfully analyzed for water using this 
method. 

5.4.2 

Alternative Method. 

The Karl Fischer Test Method is an 
acceptable alternative test method to the Coulometric Karl 
Fischer Titration for determining the water content of 
refrigerants. This method is described in ASTM E700-79, (Reapproved 1990), Standard Test Method for Water
in Gases Using Karl Fischer Reagent (American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, PA), which is incorporated
by reference. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia,
PA. Copies may also be inspected at Public Docket No. A-92-01, Waterside Mall (Ground Floor) Environmental
Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC in room M-1500 or at the Office of the Federal Register,
800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC. 

5.4.3 

Limits. 

The value for water content shall be expressed as 
parts per million by weight and shall not exceed the maximum 
specified (see tables 1 and 1a). 

5.5 

Chloride. 

The refrigerant shall be tested for chloride as 
an indication of the presence of hydrochloric acid and/or metal 
chlorides. The recommended procedure is intended for use with 
new or reclaimed refrigerants. Significant amounts of oil may 
interfere with the results by indicating a failure in the absence 
of chloride. 

5.5.1 

Method. 

The test method shall be that described in 
Appendix-93 to ARI Standard 700. The test will show noticeable 
turbidity at chloride levels of about 3 ppm by weight or higher. 

5.5.2 

Turbidity. 

The results of the test shall not exhibit any 
sign of turbidity. Report the results as ``pass'' or ``fail.'' 

5.6 Acidity. 

5.6.1 

Method. 

The acidity test uses the titration principle to 
detect any compound that is highly soluble in water and ionizes 
as an acid. The test method shall be that described in Appendix- 
93 to ARI Standard 700. This test may not be suitable for 
determination of high molecular weight organic acids; however 
these acids will be found in the high boiling residue test 
outlined in 5.7. The test requires a 100 to 120 gram sample and 
has a detection limit of 0.1 ppm by weight calculated as HCl. 

5.6.2 

Limits. 

The maximum permissible acidity is 1 ppm by 
weight as HCl. 

5.7 High Boiling Residue. 

5.7.1 

Method. 

High boiling residue shall be determined by 
measuring the residue of a standard volume of refrigerant after 
evaporation. The refrigerant sample shall be evaporated at room 
temperature or at a temperature 50 
 F [28K], above the boiling 
point of the sample using a Goetz bulb as specified in Appendix- 
93 to ARI Standard 700. Oils and or organic acids will be 
captured by this method.

5.7.2 

 Limits. 

The value for high boiling residue shall be 
expressed as a percentage by volume and shall not exceed the 
maximum percent specified (see tables 1 and 1a). 

5.8 Particulates/Solids. 

5.8.1 

Method. 

A measured amount of sample is evaporated from a 
Goetz bulb under controlled temperature conditions. The 
particulates/solids shall be determined by visual examination of 
the Goetz bulb prior to the evaporation of refrigerant. Presence 
of dirt, rust or other particulate contamination is reported as 
``fail.'' For details of this test method, refer to Appendix-93 to 
ARI Standard 700. 

5.9 Non-Condensables. 

5.9.1 

Sample. 

A vapor phase sample shall be used for 
determination of non-condensables. Non-condensable gases consist 
primarily of air accumulated in the vapor phase of refrigerants. 
The solubility of air in the refrigerants liquid phase is 
extremely low and air is not significant as a liquid phase 
contaminant. The presence of non-condensable gases may reflect 
poor quality control in transferring refrigerants to storage 
tanks and cylinders. 

5.9.2 

Method. 

The test method shall be gas chromatography with 
a thermal conductivity detector as described in Appendix-93 to 
ARI Standard 700. 

5.9.3 

Limit. 

The maximum level of non-condensables in the vapor 
phase of a refrigerant in a container shall not exceed 1.5% by 
volume (see table 1 and 1a). 

5.10 Impurities, including Other Refrigerants. 

5.10.1 

Method. 

The amount of other impurities including other 
refrigerants in the subject refrigerant shall be determined by 
gas chromatography as described in Appendix-93 to ARI Standard 
700. 

5.10.2 

Limit. 

The subject refrigerant shall not contain more 
than 0.50% by weight of impurities including other refrigerants 
(see table 1 and 1a). 



Section 6. Reporting Procedure 



6.1 

Reporting Procedure. 

The source (manufacturer, reclaimer or 
repackager) of the packaged refrigerant shall be identified. The 
refrigerant shall be identified by its accepted refrigerant 
number and/or its chemical name. Maximum permissible levels of 
contaminants are shown in table 1. Test results shall be 
tabulated in a like manner.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard is requiring escort vessels for 
certain oil tankers transiting Prince William Sound, Alaska, 
and Puget Sound, Washington. This rulemaking is mandated by 
the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). The regulations 
will reduce the chances of a tanker running aground or 
colliding as a result of loss of propulsion or steering 
control, thereby potentially reducing the risk of an oil 
spill.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Drafting Information 


The principal persons involved in drafting this 
document are Thomas Jordan, Project Manager, Oil Pollution 
Act (OPA 90) Staff, and Mary-Jo Cooney, Project Counsel, Oil 
Pollution Act (OPA 90) Staff. 


Regulatory History 


On July 7, 1992, the Coast Guard published a notice of 
proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ``Escort Vessels for 
Certain Oil Tankers'' in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 30058). 
When the Coast Guard received comments to the NPRM which 
were not as extensive as expected, it reopened the comment 
period (58 FR 16391, March 26, 1993) to solicit more 
specific comments on certain issues. 
The Coast Guard also published an advance notice of 
proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (58 FR 25766, April 27, 1993) 
seeking comment on other U.S. waters where an escort should 
be required, and other vessels that should also be escorted. 
That regulatory project (CGD 91-202a) is ongoing. 
In response to many comments, public hearings were held 
in Anchorage, Alaska on June 3, 1993, Valdez, Alaska on 
June 5, 1993 and Seattle, Washington on June 7, 1993 (58 FR 
25959, April 29, 1993; and 58 FR 29157, May 19, 1993). The 
Alaska hearings were also teleconferenced to include several 
outlying communities in the Exxon Valdez impact area. 
Transcripts of those hearings have been placed in the public 
dockets for these rulemakings (CGD 91-202 and CGD 91-202a) 
and are available for inspection or copying at room 3406, 
U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters. 
At this time, the Prince William Sound Disabled Tanker 
Towing Study (DTTS) Group is sponsoring a special study 
concerning the present tanker escort operations in Prince 
William Sound (PWS). The study group is made up of 
representatives from five regional interest groups: the PWS 
Tanker Association, the PWS Regional Citizens' Advisory 
Council, Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the Alaska 
Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Coast 
Guard. Although the DTTS is a separate project from this 
rulemaking, it is of particular value to this rulemaking 
because of the technical information it will develop on the 
maneuvering characteristics of disabled tankers under the 
control of different combinations of escort vessels. Part 1 
of the DTTS, entitled ``Evaluation of Existing Equipment, 
Personnel and Procedures,'' has been completed and is 
available to the public through the National Technical 
Information Service (NTIS). The Coast Guard published a 
notice of availability (NOA) (59 FR 1411; January 10, 1994) 
for Part 1. The NOA reprinted the Executive Summary from 
Part 1, and provided information for ordering copies of the 
study from NTIS. Part 2 of the study is expected to be 
completed in spring 1994; the Coast Guard will publish 
another NOA when details are available. 


Background and Purpose 


Section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 
(OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101-380) requires the Secretary of 
Transportation to initiate rulemaking to define areas where 
single-hulled tankers over 5,000 gross tons (GT) 
transporting oil in bulk must be escorted by at least two 
``towing vessels'' (as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101) or by some 
other vessels which the Secretary considers appropriate. By 
statute, these defined areas must include Prince William 
Sound, Alaska, and Rosario Strait and Puget Sound, 
Washington (including those portions of the Strait of Juan 
de Fuca east of Port Angeles, Haro Strait, and the Strait of 
Georgia subject to United States jurisdiction). The 
Secretary also has the authority to extend the escort rule 
to other U.S. waters as appropriate. 
The rulemaking authority has been delegated to the 
Coast Guard, which will implement section 4116(c) in two 
separate rulemaking projects: CGD 91-202 addresses escort 
requirements for the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound 
waters named in the statute, and CGD 91-202a addresses 
escort requirements for other waters. 


Discussion of Comments and Changes 


Comments received by the Coast Guard in response to the 
NPRM and public hearings are discussed as follows:

1. Role of escort vessels.

 Four comments suggested 
that the guidelines concerning the role of the escort must 
be clearly specified and defined. One comment stated that 
the principal purpose of the escort should be to prevent 
tanker accidents by steering or retarding disabled tankers. 
One comment stated that an escort should be able to safely 
assist a tanker moving near its maneuvering speed, alter the 
tanker's speed or course, apply lateral force, and overtake 
the tanker within confined waters. 
The Coast Guard generally agrees with these comments. 
The role of the escort vessels is to assist a tanker that is 
experiencing a loss of propulsion or steering control and is 
therefore at risk of collision or grounding. However, it 
must be pointed out that escort vessels may not always be 
able to prevent all tanker accidents. This rule requires 
that reasonably capable escort vessels be immediately on 
hand to assist a tanker as circumstances permit. The 
decision to respond, however, must be left to the 
professional judgement of the escort vessel's master, who 
must always first consider the risk to the escort vessel and 
its crew. 


2. Benefit of escort vessels.

 Four comments stated 
that they did not believe that the presence of escort 
vessels improves the safety of the transit; two comments 
further stated that safety is actually reduced because of 
increased vessel traffic (due to the escort vessels 
themselves) which increases opportunities for collisions. 
Additionally, another comment asserted that tug escorts 
would increase the risk of collision in Puget Sound. 
However, one comment points out that there are significant 
safety benefits gained by providing escorts for certain 
vessels. 
Although escort vessels may not always be able to 
prevent a tanker accident, the Coast Guard believes that 
escort vessels can successfully control a tanker under many 
circumstances. Having reasonably capable escort vessels on 
hand, coupled with the tanker master's duty to operate the 
tanker within the performance capabilities of the escort 
vessels, will provide the maximum feasible assurance that 
the transit can be safely made. The Coast Guard disagrees 
that vessel traffic would be substantially increased: in 
Prince William Sound the increased traffic would be two 
escort vessels once every two months; in Puget Sound the 
increased traffic would average four escort vessels per day, 
which is not a significant increase. 


3. Definitions.

 Thirteen comments related to the 
various definitions proposed in the NPRM, or proposed 
additional definitions. Accordingly,  168.5 of this rule 
adds, revises, and deletes certain terms that were proposed 
in the NPRM. 
Definitions of ``disabled tanker'' and ``escort transit'' 
have been added. 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The definition of ``escort vessel'' has been revised in 
order to reflect the fact that a variety of vessel types can 
perform escort services other than just the ``towing vessels'' 
cited in the statute. Furthermore, a vessel that may be 
suitable for escorting a particular tanker under certain 
transit conditions may not be suitable for escorting other 
tankers, or even the same tanker under other conditions. 
The necessary elements of an escort vessel are that: it is 
dedicated exclusively to the tanker for the duration of its 
transit; and it is properly equipped for its intended role 
in an emergency response (pushing, towing, etc.). The 
second element means that it is not necessary for the escort 
vessels to have duplicative capabilities. For example, one 
escorting vessel does not have to be outfitted with towing 
gear if another escorting vessel is adequately outfitted. 
The definition of ``laden'' replaces the NPRM's 
definition of ``transporting oil in bulk'' because it is more 
precise. 
The definition of ``single hull tanker'' has been added, 
although it still maintains the same vessel applicability as 
proposed in the NPRM: any tanker that is not double-hulled. 
Definitions of ``tanker owner or operator'' and ``tanker 
master'' have been added. They distinguish a shoreside owner 
or management organization (that has overall operational 
control of the tanker), including a demise (bareboat) 
charterer, from a tanker's master (who is the licensed, 
onboard person in charge of the tanker). 
The NPRM's definition of ``static bollard pull'' has been 
deleted because it is not used in the rule. 


4. Responsibilities.

 The NPRM originally made the 
tanker master responsible for selecting the escort vessels. 
Six comments were received on this issue, and all of them 
generally expressed the opinion that the tanker master 
should not be responsible for selecting or deciding escort 
vessel suitability. Some comments argued that the tanker 
master may not be sufficiently familiar with the local 
waters, weather conditions or other navigational 
considerations to select the best escort vessels; these are 
some of the reasons why pilots are embarked when any vessel 
enters a port. Some comments also argued that escort vessel 
selections might be made by the tanker's shoreside 
management company, putting the tanker master under 
considerable pressure to accept whatever vessels have been 
dispatched. 
The Coast Guard generally agrees that proper selection 
of escort vessels requires some specialized knowledge and 
pre-planning which might be beyond the abilities of the 
tanker master to accomplish. Such knowledge might have to 
be developed from tanker-specific maneuvering and control 
studies. Also, tanker owners or operators may wish to make 
contractual arrangements with escort vessel operators to 
ensure appropriate vessels are available at favorable rates. 
Because the resources to conduct studies or make contractual 
agreements are controlled by the tanker's owners or 
operators (shoreside management), it is more appropriate 
that they should be ultimately responsible for the escort 
vessel selection and providing the tanker master with any 
specialized information. 
Therefore,  168.10 makes the tanker owners or 
operators responsible for escort vessel selection and 
informing the tanker master of the performance capabilities 
of the escort vessels. The master is responsible for 
operating the tanker within those performance capabilities. 
The regulations do not preclude owners or operators 
from authorizing masters or other agents to make selections, 
although the tanker owners or operators will have to furnish 
the necessary technical information for proper escort vessel 
selection. 


5. Applicable vessels.

 OPA 90 specifically targets 
single hull tank ships of more than 5,000 gross tons 
(GT) (5,000 GT corresponds to approximately 10,000 deadweight 
tons (DWT), which is the tonnage measurement more commonly 
applied to tankers). The NPRM proposed to include tankers 
with only double bottoms or double sides but exclude double 
hulled tankers. 
Eight comments to the NPRM addressed the issue of hull 
design (i.e. single hull, double hull, double bottom, or 
double sides). Most of these comments stated that double 
hulls should not be excluded from the escort requirements. 
Two comments did agree with the double hull exclusion, 
another comment also agreed with the double hull exclusion 
and stated that double bottom tankers should also be 
excluded. One comment suggested that the escort 
requirements should apply to all tankers over 5,000 GT, 
(regardless of construction) and another comment suggested 
that they should apply to all vessels carrying oil 
(regardless of construction or size). One comment suggested 
that all single-hulled oil tankers should be included 
whether laden or unladen. The Coast Guard is of the opinion 
that Congress did not intend for tankers that meet the 
OPA 90 double hull design requirements to be escorted. 
Therefore, the originally-proposed hull design standard has 
not been revised: double hull tankers are excluded, but all 
other single hull, double bottom, and double side tankers 
are included. 
Eleven comments addressed size limits for applicable 
tankers, suggesting either to raise the gross tonnage 
threshold (thereby excluding some tankers greater than 5,000 
GT) or require escorts for only those tankers carrying more 
than a particular quantity of oil. One comment pointed out 
that smaller tankers are less of a threat to the environment 
than larger ones, and therefore should not have to be 
escorted. Two of the comments support the proposed size 
requirements. OPA 90 specifically includes tankers down to 
5,000 GT; therefore, the proposed size limit has not been 
changed. 
Four comments were received which advocated excluding 
those tankers with twin screw propulsion systems, on the 
grounds that a simultaneous failure of both propulsion 
systems was unlikely. OPA 90 requires tankers that are not 
double-hulled to be escorted, regardless of propulsion 
system. 
Therefore,  168.20 makes the regulations applicable to 
all U.S. and foreign-flag single hull tankers of more than 
5,000 GT, including tankers with only double bottoms or 
double sides, or double hull tankers that do not meet the 
dimensional standards of 33 CFR 157.10d (which are the OPA 
90 double hull standards). The regulations do not apply to 
tankers less than 5,000 GT or tank barges of any size. 


6. Applicable cargoes.

 The NPRM proposed to include 
``oil'' cargoes, without distinguishing between petroleum and 
non-petroleum (i.e., animal or vegetable) oils. Six 
comments indicated that tankers carrying animal and 
vegetable oils should be excluded from the escort 
regulations. One comment went on to say that if these oils 
are included, then the ruling would have a detrimental 
economic impact on his small business. The issue of 
requiring escorts for tankers carrying only animal and 
vegetable oils, and other non-petroleum oils, warrants 
further consideration. This will be addressed in the 
ongoing rulemaking (CGD 91-202a) which concerns other U.S. 
waters where an escort may be required and other criteria 
for defining the vessels that should be escorted. 
Therefore,  168.30 of this rule applies only to petroleum 
oils (MARPOL Annex I), which are listed in 46 CFR Table 
30.25-1 as pollution category I cargoes.

<TEXT>
 

Four comments noted that many hazardous chemical 
cargoes can pose serious risks to the marine environment or 
public health, and argued that vessels carrying these 
cargoes should also be escorted. One comment stated that 
additional regulations are needed to cover the transfer of 
hazardous substances not covered by the proposed 
regulations. The Coast Guard has determined that including 
hazardous material cargoes is outside the statutory 
authority of OPA 90. However, the Coast Guard will be 
seeking further comment on this issue as part of the ``other 
waters'' escort vessel rulemaking and may propose regulations 
to include certain hazardous material and or NLS cargoes 
under authority of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act 
(33 U.S.C. 1221 

et seq.

). 


7. Applicable waters. 

Twenty comments addressed what 
U.S. waters should be included under the escort regulations. 
For Prince William Sound, 12 comments stated that 
escorts should be continuously required all the way from 
Port Valdez to Hinchinbrook Entrance (including the mid-Sound region). Four comments stated that escorts should

only be required at Port Valdez and Hinchinbrook Entrance 
but not in mid-Sound because there is enough sea room in 
mid-Sound for a tanker to safely drift while waiting for the 
arrival of assist tugs dispatched from Port Valdez. The 
Coast Guard agrees that escorts are appropriate for all 
regions of Prince William Sound, and the rule so provides. 
For the Puget Sound escort zone, the NPRM proposed a 
western boundary of longitude 123
 24.5
' West, but excluded 
tankers transiting to and from the Ediz Hook anchorage of 
Port Angeles (which would require them to skirt just inside 
that boundary). Three comments suggested moving the western 
boundary of the escort zone to the entrance to the Straits 
of Juan de Fuca (Cape Flattery), while 2 comments suggested 
moving the western boundary eastwards to coincide with the 
existing escort zone established by Washington state. One 
comment suggested the applicable area be extended to the 
Ediz Hook anchorage adjacent to the Port Angeles Harbor. As 
a result of comments, this rule revises the western boundary 
by shifting it approximately 11 nautical miles eastwards to 
include the U.S. waters east of the line connecting New 
Dungeness Light (Washington) with Discovery Island Light 
(Canada). This new boundary location therefore coincides 
with the existing Federal boundary line governing maximum 
tanker size in Puget Sound waters (33 CFR 161.143), as well 
as the boundary line for escorting as required by the 
existing Washington state regulations. This change still 
excludes the Ediz Hook anchorage. 
The remaining comments nominated additional waters 
besides Prince William Sound and Puget Sound, such as Cook 
Inlet, Alaska, and the Olympic coast, Washington. These 
comments will be considered in the separate ``other waters'' 
rulemaking project (CGD 91-202a). 


8. Number of escort vessels. 

One comment suggested 
that the Coast Guard define the required capabilities of an 
escort vessel rather than only specifying any particular 
number of escort vessels. Another comment supported the 
requirements for two escorts in Prince William Sound. Two 
comments suggested that smaller tankers be allowed to use 
only one escort vessel. Two comments disagreed with 
requiring the usage of two escort vessels and suggested that 
one would be adequate in most cases. OPA 90 requires a 
minimum of two escort vessels for the Prince William Sound 
and Puget Sound waters stipulated in the statute. 
Therefore, regulations for those waters which cite OPA 90 
authority must incorporate this statutory minimum 
requirement. 


9. Relative positioning of escort vessels. 

Among 
other provisions, the NPRM proposed that the escort vessels 
be ``available in close proximity to the tanker at all 
times.'' Twelve comments addressed the issue of where the 
escort vessels should be positioned (relative to the tanker) 
during the escort transit. In lieu of a close proximity 
requirement, some comments suggested a specified maximum 
distance from the tanker, such as one-half mile. However, 
other comments argued that a specified distance was 
unnecessarily restrictive. The latter comments pointed out 
that the closer any vessel is to a tanker, the greater the 
risk of a collision. These comments argued that, in open 
waters, the escort vessel should have the flexibility to 
position itself at any safe distance as judged by its 
master, so long as it could still respond in a timely 
fashion. The Coast Guard agrees with the ``timely response'' 
approach, and has revised this rule accordingly. This will 
effectively require the tanker and escort vessel masters to 
continuously evaluate the situation and reposition 
themselves, as appropriate, at different points along the 
transit route. This does not preclude the escort vessels 
from remaining in the shelter of the tanker's lee if weather 
conditions and prudent seamanship warrant; the tanker should 
then adjust its speed to compensate for any delays before 
the escort vessels could move into position to render 
assistance in an emergency. 


10. Performance requirements. 

The NPRM proposed that 
the escort vessels be ``capable of providing sufficient 
maneuvering forces to substantially influence the speed and 
direction of travel of the tanker.'' Twelve comments 
addressed the issue of performance capabilities of the 
escort vessels. One comment recommended that a tug escort 
have the capability to push or tow a disabled ship away from 
the danger of grounding or collision. One comment suggested 
that tug escorts should have the ability to stop a disabled 
vessel within 10 vessel lengths from the declaration of an 
emergency (this comment qualified its suggestion by 
recognizing that such a standard would be very dependent 
upon the harbor conditions). Another comment suggested that 
tug escorts be capable of meeting the demands of assisting 
the escorted tanker. Another comment contended that 
performance and design criteria for tug escorts will be 
dictated by an effective escort program, and suggested that 
local geography, local man-made hazards, and regulated 
vessel speeds be considered when developing tug escort 
capabilities criteria. Four comments addressed the 
performance standards as outlined in the NPRM. One comment 
suggested that performance standards should be 
geographically-specific. Two comments recommended that 
performance based criteria be coupled with the tanker's 
tonnage, weather, or sea conditions. Additionally, one 
comment was specifically concerned with weather conditions 
and suggested that oil tankers only be allowed to operate in 
Prince William Sound when weather conditions would permit 
safe operation of the tug escorts. This comment further 
suggested that the realistic adverse weather limits for safe 
escorting operations is approximately 40-knot wind speed in 
10-foot seas. Another comment generally supported the 
performance-based criteria as proposed in the NPRM, but 
suggested that operating parameters also be considered. 
The Coast Guard agrees that performance requirements 
should be more detailed. Accordingly,  168.50 of this rule 
has been revised to include towing, stopping, holding, and 
turning requirements for controlling a tanker within 
specified parameters under various failure and weather 
scenarios, and to require that the tanker not be operated 
beyond a speed at which the escort vessels can reasonably be 
expected to bring it safely under control within the 
navigational limits of the waterway. The requirements were 
developed after reviewing several tanker/tug maneuvering 
studies that were submitted to the docket, and considering 
that the largest tankers in Prince William Sound are about 
265,000 DWT (deadweight tons) and the largest in the Puget 
Sound waters are 125,000 DWT.

The underlying basis of the performance requirements is to: (1) Ensure sufficient power to perform a rescue tow of
a tanker (or to substantially reduce its drift rate in severe winds); and (2) provide steering and stopping forces
that are equivalent to what the tanker could do itself (with its own steering and propulsion system) at a speed of 6 knots.
The Coast Guard believes that, in conjunction with an appropriate tanker speed during the transit, both conventional
tugs and tractor tugs that meet the performance 
requirements can reasonably be expected to safely accomplish effective emergency control of disabled tankers.
Discussion of the specific performance requirements is as follows: 



Towing:

 The regulations require an escort vessel to be capable of towing the tanker at 4 knots in calm conditions and hold it
in a steady position against a 45-knot headwind. 



Stopping:

 The regulations require that the escort vessel(s) be able to stop the tanker within the same distance that the tanker
would have been able to crash-stop itself from a speed of 6 knots using its own propulsion 
system. 



Holding on steady course:

 The regulations require that the escort vessel(s) be able to hold the tanker on a steady course against a 35-degree
locked rudder at 6 knots. This means that the escort vessels must be able to apply a counteractive turning moment equal
and opposite to the turning moment generated by the locked rudder, taking into consideration the geometry of the escort
vessel's applied force on the tanker's hull (points of application, angle of assist, etc.). 



Turning:

 The regulations require that the escort vessel(s) be able to turn the tanker 90 degrees, assuming a free-swinging
rudder and an initial speed of 6 knots, in the same distance (advance and transfer) as it would have been able to turn
itself using a hard-over rudder. The geometry of the escort vessels' applied forces on the tanker must similarly be
taken into consideration.

<TEXT>
 

These requirements are based upon the 6-knot maneuvering characteristics of the tanker because this is the upper
speed limit at which conventional tugs can safely make connections to the tanker. However, the Coast Guard 
recognizes that not all steering or propulsion failures will require immediate intervention by the escort vessels.
In many instances, there could be enough sea room in the waterway for the tanker to safely drift to a stop without 
assistance from escort vessels. The regulations, therefore, allow a tanker to transit at any speed provided that
there is sufficient sea room to accommodate the disabled tanker's travel (advance and transfer) until it has naturally
slowed down to the speed where the escort vessels can move in and bring it under control. For example, a tanker can make
a transit at 10 knots if there is adequate sea room on both sides of its trackline to tolerate a locked rudder at that speed.
In a constrained waterway, however, or in adverse 
weather conditions, prudent seamanship may require the tanker to reduce its transit speed, or expand the performance
capabilities of its escort vessels (such as by adding another escort vessel, pre-tethering, etc.), or both. 



11. Other operational requirements.

 One comment concerning other operational requirements suggested that escort vessels be required to be pre-tethered
to a tanker before entering especially constrained waterways (the hazard presented by Middle Rock in Valdez Narrows
was specifically mentioned as an example). Although the Coast Guard agrees that, under certain conditions, pre-tethering
may be appropriate, it may not be necessary under other circumstances. Pre-tethering may entail a safety risk to the
escort vessel and its crew; it should be viewed as an option that the tanker and escort vessel masters may utilize after
discussing the sea and weather conditions at the anticipated time of transit. 

Six comments on other operational requirements urged that specific speed limits be set as part of the regulations;
however, three comments disagreed. The Coast Guard also does not agree that specific speed limits are necessary because
 168.50(a)(3) requires that a tanker not be operated beyond a speed at which the escort vessels can reasonably
be expected to safely bring the tanker under control. 



12. Escort plans.

 The NPRM proposed that escort vessel operators prepare written information on the capabilities of their vessels
and submit the information to the local Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) for review 
and approval. The approved information would then be used by the tanker master to select escort vessels during the
pre-escort conference. Ten comments recommended requiring tanker-specific escort plans rather than escort vessel-specific
plans (on the argument that the appropriate approach to escort vessel selection must be based on the needs of the tanker
rather than the abilities of the escort vessels). Two comments suggested alternatives to selecting the escort vessels
at the pre-escort conference: one comment recommended that the Coast Guard COTP be responsible for prior approval
and designation, and the other comment recommended that each affected port establish a clearinghouse for certified
escort vessels. 

Because the regulations contain specific performance criteria, and because the responsibility for selecting appropriate
escort vessels is on the tanker owners or operators, the Coast Guard has reconsidered its originally proposed requirement
for submittal and approval of written escort plans, and decided that there is no longer any need. Tanker and escort
vessel owners or operators can work together to match tanker needs with escort vessel capabilities without Coast
Guard participation. Tanker owners or operators can make arrangements for appropriate escort vessels in advance
of the tanker's arrival, and retain the flexibility of making those arrangements in several ways, such as pre-contracting,
establishing local clearinghouses of escort vessels, etc. Therefore, the NPRM's original requirement for submittal
of written escort plans has been deleted. 



13. Pre-escort conference.

 The NPRM originally had two purposes for the pre-escort conference: (1) for the tanker master to determine the suitability
of the escort vessels (on the basis of written information submitted at the conference); and (2) a joint conference
for the tanker 
master, pilot and escort vessel masters to discuss and plan the escort transit. 

Eight comments were received concerning the pre-escort conference. In general, the comments agreed that it could
be used for exchanging safety and tactical information between the tanker master, pilot, and escort vessel masters.
One comment noted that the current briefing practice in Washington state is sufficient. However, four comments pointed
out that the conference, as proposed, would occur too late to actually select the escort vessels. Rejection of an escort
vessel at that point could lead to tanker delays and congestion while waiting for a replacement escort. They argued
that dispatching several escort vessels to meet a tanker, of which only two or three would be selected, would waste
the time and expense of the non-selected vessels. Two comments were concerned that lengthy pre-escort conferences
would similarly cause delays and congestion. Further, one of the comments indicated that this would cause undesirable
economic pressure for the vessel master and pilot. 

The Coast Guard recognizes that the pre-escort conference may be too late for selecting or rejecting the escort vessels.
As previously discussed in paragraph (4), escort vessel selection is now the responsibility of the tanker owner or
operators. This will allow them to make arrangements for appropriate escort vessels in advance of the tanker's arrival
(or departure, if outbound). 

Section 168.10 has been revised to reflect the changed responsibilities for selecting escort vessels and to state
more clearly the purpose of the conference and the topics to be discussed. 



14. Additional mission requirements.

 Fourteen comments addressed additional mission requirements for the escort vessels, nominating firefighting,
salvage, lightering, and pollution response capabilities (the spill response capability of the Alyeska Pipeline
Service Company's Ship Escort and Response Vessel System (SERVS) vessels in escort service in Prince William Sound
were specifically mentioned). One comment stated that spill 
containment and firefighting are excessive secondary functions that the escort should not be expected to perform.
The Coast Guard has determined that none of these capabilities can be easily retrofitted aboard the existing fleet
of tugs, which will make up the bulk of the escort vessel resources. This is because most tugs do not have sufficient
deck area to accommodate the additional mission equipment, nor sufficient above-water height (and associated stability)
to serve as effective firefighting platforms. However, the regulations do not preclude using vessels with such capabilities
if they are available.

<TEXT>
 



15. Coordination with vessel response plans (VRPs).

 Five comments suggested coordination of the escort regulations with the special vessel response plan (VRP) requirements
for tank vessels operating in Prince William 
Sound, as required by section 5005 of OPA 90 and the Interim Final Rule for vessel response plans (58 FR 7376, February
5, 1993). One of these special VRP requirements is to provide ``escort vessels with skimming capability.'' The 
concern of the comments is that there will be two Federal definitions of ``escort vessel:'' one definition in the VRP
regulations (which would include skimming requirements), and the other definition in the escort vessel regulations
(without any skimming requirements). This could lead to confusion or unnecessary expense. 

The Coast Guard agrees that there should be a single, consistent definition of ``escort vessel'' throughout all the
OPA 90 rulemakings. The intent of the special VRP requirement is for a vessel with skimming (response) 
capability to accompany a laden tanker across Prince William Sound. The Coast Guard has determined that this is a spill
response capability that is separate from the emergency control measures that the escort vessels are intended to
provide under this rulemaking. Accordingly, the final rule for the VRP rulemaking will be revised by eliminating
the term ``escort vessel'' and substituting in its place the term ``escorting response vessel.'' As previously noted,
this does not preclude a single, appropriately-equipped vessel from fulfilling both requirements (escorting and
skimming) in 
Prince William Sound. 



16. Prince William Sound Disabled Tanker Towing Study.

 Nine comments were received suggesting that the escort regulations should be postponed until completion of the Prince
William Sound Disabled Tanker Towing Study (DTTS), in 
order to benefit from the findings of that study. 

At this time the Coast Guard has reviewed Part 1 of the DTTS, as well as several other technical studies concerning escorting
and control of disabled tankers, and expects that the regulations will be supported by the final DTTS results. Therefore,
the Coast Guard believes that it can now move ahead with this rulemaking. 



17. Discussion of other comments.

 Two comments suggested that the Vessel Traffic Systems (VTS) be expanded instead of requiring escort vessels. One
comment, however, disagreed with the usage of the VTS system, saying that such a system failed in the EXXON VALDEZ disaster;
this comment suggested using another emergency towing arrangement. Two comments recommended that VTS control be
employed for small tallow tankers. Further, one of these comments suggested that when such employment is not feasible,
a single escort should be used. The Coast Guard does not agree that a VTS can substitute for the immediate, on-site assistance
that an escort vessel can provide. It should be noted that the VTS and escort vessel requirements of OPA 90 are separate,
and 
the use of one does not obviate the need for the other. 

One comment recommended that the Coast Guard should ensure construction of double hull U.S. flag vessels which have
a redundant propulsion system. The Coast Guard has determined that this is beyond the scope of the escort 
vessel rulemaking. 



Assessment 



Because of substantial public interest, this rule is a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive
Order 12866 and has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It requires an assessment
of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It is significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A final 
Assessment is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES.


 


Summary of Final Assessment 



Certain oil tankers transiting through both Prince William Sound and Puget Sound are already subject to state-level
escort requirements. The final Assessment for this rulemaking evaluates the economic impact of the proposed 
Federal regulations by analyzing the incremental cost increases beyond the costs already incurred due to the state
regulations. In Prince William Sound, the crude oil tankers operating out of Port Valdez are already escorted in 
accordance with the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company contingency plan which was approved by the State of Alaska.
Therefore, there is not much incremental impact from the Federal regulations: only approximately six tankers per
year deliver refined products to the Navy fuel depot at Whittier (these tankers are not required to be escorted under
Alaska regulations). In Puget Sound, an estimated 1,256 tanker transits per year are affected: approximately 879
transits where one escort vessel is already engaged (under Washington state regulations) will now require at least
one additional escort vessel to meet the Federal regulations. Also, because the Federal regulations encompass tankers
down to 5,000 GT (approximately 10,000 DWT), an estimated 377 additional tanker transits per year will now require
at least two escort vessels (these tankers presently do not require any escorts because the Washington state regulations
only extend down to 40,000 DWT). Therefore, the regulations are estimated to initially increase vessel traffic by
12 escort vessel transits per year in Prince William Sound and 1,633 escort vessel transits per year in Puget Sound.
However, these numbers will decline as single hull tankers are phased out of service. 

The OPA 90 phase-out schedule requires single hull tankers to be removed from service by 2010, but allows certain tankers
with double sides or double bottoms to remain in service until 2015. Because it was not possible to project how many
tankers of each design (single-hulled, double-bottomed, or double-sided) will be in service over the next 20 years,
the Assessment assumes that all tankers subject to this rulemaking are single-hulled (i.e., will be removed from
service by 2010). Therefore, the incremental escort vessel cost to the oil tanker industry will decrease to zero by
that year. The Assessment conservatively assumes the same phase out schedule as used for the Regulatory Evaluation
of the double hull rulemaking, although tanker owners or operators in these waters may choose to replace their single
hull tankers at an earlier time. 

As a result of comments to the NPRM, the regulations have been revised in certain respects. These revisions also affect
some of the economic assumptions and calculations in the original preliminary Regulatory Evaluation. Accordingly,
the final Assessment has been revised as follows: 

(1) Certain costs have been recalculated, using new cost data for escort vessel services. The Assessment assumes
the average cost of an escort vessel is $1,350 per hour; 

(2) New costs have been added, recognizing that tanker owners or operators may have to conduct various sea trials and
computer simulation studies (in order to determine the maneuvering and control characteristics of their tankers).
Even though this information is not directly required by regulation, it is still an indirect cost that will be borne
by industry; 

(3) The benefit analysis has been significantly revised (discussed later); 

(4) Costs and benefits have been recalculated at a 7 percent discount rate, in order to be consistent with current OMB
directives and other OPA 90 regulatory assessments (the original preliminary Regulatory Evaluation 
discounted all costs at 10 percent).

In Prince William Sound, the Assessment estimates that 
the incremental escort cost is $94,500 per tanker transit 
from Hinchinbrook Entrance to Whittier (via Bligh Reef pilot 
station) and return, using two escort vessels dispatched 
from Port Valdez. This cost-per-transit is relatively high 
because the tanker must pay for the total round-trip 
dispatch time of the escort vessels. Because these tankers 
are operated or chartered by the Navy, the escort costs will 
ultimately be borne by the U.S. Government (Department of 
Defense). 

In Puget Sound, the Assessment assumes that there is 
sufficient inbound or outbound tanker traffic such that a 
tanker will only be paying for one-way dispatch time of the 
escort vessels. However, unlike Prince William Sound, there 
are several possible destination terminals in Puget Sound; 
accordingly, escorted transit times range from 1 to 7 hours. 
Therefore, the average cost-per-transit is estimated to be 
$6,750 (5 hrs at approximately $1,350 per hour) for all 
tankers, in 1994 dollars. 

The Assessment estimates that the first-year cost of 
the regulations (1995) will be $11.4 million, and the total 
discounted program cost (1995 to 2015) will be $57.7 
million, in 1990 dollars. The tanker industry can reduce 
these costs by switching to double-hulled tankers earlier 
than assumed in the Assessment, or it can increase these 
costs by continuing to use double-sided or double-bottomed 
tankers after 2010. 

The original preliminary Regulatory Evaluation 
attempted to statistically estimate the benefits of the 
regulations. The Coast Guard has subsequently determined 
that there is no statistical basis for such estimations 
without making extreme assumptions of debatable validity. 
This is because the occurrence of a steering or propulsion 
failure is not related to the size of the tanker or its 
cargo capacity. Further, such failures do not necessarily 
result in a collision or grounding, nor do collisions or 
groundings necessarily result in rupture of cargo tank(s). 
And even if a tank were ruptured, there is no predicting the 
actual amount of outflow that would occur. 

Therefore, the final Assessment makes a presumption of 
effectiveness by assuming that the regulations would avert 
at least one collision or grounding that would otherwise 
spill 300,000 barrels of oil (This is derived from the 
approximate capacity of two cargo tanks on a midsize oil 
tanker of 80,000 DWT.). This averted oil spill could occur 
at any time during the 15-year period from 1995 (the first 
full year that the regulations will be in effect) to 2010 
(when the last single hull oil tanker is phased out of 
service). 

The monetary benefits of these regulations include 
avoided cleanup costs, third-party compensation (lost 
earnings to fishermen, etc.) and natural resource damages. 
Historically, these costs have varied enormously from spill 
to spill because of the great range of factors affecting the 
impact of oil spills, such as type of product, environment, 
time of year, location, and weather conditions. Accordingly, it is not possible to establish a definitive 
monetized (dollar) benefit value for unspilled oil. 
Therefore, the Assessment does not perform benefit 
calculations using dollar amounts. Instead, it uses the 
unspilled oil quantity, discounted at 7 percent back to 
1990 barrels. If the averted 300,000 barrel spill were 
assumed to occur in 1995, the discounted quantity would be 
213,896 barrels. If it were assumed to occur in 2010, the 
discounted quantity would be 77,526 barrels. 
Accordingly, the final Assessment has determined that 
the cost of these regulations ranges from $270 to $744 per 
discounted barrel of unspilled oil. 



Small Entities 



The Coast Guard has evaluated the impact of this 
rulemaking on small entities in accordance with the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The 
small entity impact analysis is incorporated into the final 
Assessment for this rulemaking. 

In response to the NPRM and public hearings, only six 
comments have been received to date concerning the impact of 
escort regulations on small businesses. The comments stated 
that the regulations would have detrimental economic impact 
on small businesses in the Puget Sound region if tallow and 
vegetable oil cargoes were included. However, the 
regulations do not include non-petroleum oil cargoes. 

The Coast Guard has determined that most of the tankers 
that are affected by the regulation in Prince William Sound 
and Puget Sound are owned either by oil companies or large 
shipping corporations. Since few small entities will be 
affected, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that 
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 



Collection of Information 



This rule contains no collection-of-information 
requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 
3501 

et seq.

). The original NPRM contained collection of 
information requirements in the form of written information 
that had to be prepared by escort vessel operators and 
submitted to the local Coast Guard Captain of the Port 
(COTP). As discussed elsewhere, the requirement has been 
deleted. 



Federalism 



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the 
principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 
and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient 
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 

This rule establishes standards and requirements for 
the escort of single hull tankers over 5,000 GT in Prince 
William Sound, Alaska and Puget Sound (and certain 
associated waters around Puget Sound), Washington. The 
authority to regulate such traffic is delegated to the Coast 
Guard by the Secretary of Transportation whose authority is 
committed by statute. 

While these regulations establish minimal requirements 
for escort of certain tanker traffic through these 
designated areas, the Coast Guard does not intend to preempt 
the states from issuing more stringent requirements provided 
they are not in direct conflict with Federal law or this 
rulemaking. 



Environment 



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of 
this rulemaking and concluded that the preparation of an 
Environmental Impact statement is not necessary. An 
Environmental Assessment and a Finding of No Significant 
Impact are available in the docket for inspection or copying 
where indicated under 

ADDRESSES.

 

The primary effect of the regulation will be a 
reduction in the probability of petroleum oil spills in 
Puget and Prince William Sounds. The only other impact will 
be a minor increase in vessel traffic (escort vessels) 
moving through Puget and Prince William Sounds: the 
estimated 1,276 additional escort vessel transits per year 
represent an average of 3 to 4 additional vessels per day; 
this will decrease as single hull tankers are phased out of 
service.

List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 168



Cargo vessels, Navigation (water), Oil pollution, Water pollution control.

 

For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard adds 33 CFR part 168 as follows: 



PART 168_ESCORT REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN TANKERS 



Sec. 



168.01 Purpose. 

168.05 Definitions. 

168.10 Responsibilities. 

168.20 Applicable vessels.

Authority:

 Section 4116(c), Pub. L. 101-380, 104 Stat. 520 (46 U.S.C. 3703 note). 



 168.01 

Purpose. 



(a) This part prescribes regulations in accordance with section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub.
L. 101-380). The regulations will reduce the risk of oil spills from laden, single hull tankers over 5,000 GT
by requiring that these tankers be escorted by at least two suitable escort vessels. The escort vessels will be immediately
available to influence the tankers' speed and course in the event of a steering or propulsion equipment failure, thereby
reducing the possibility of groundings or collisions. 

(b) The regulations in this part establish minimum escort vessel requirements. Nothing in these regulations should
be construed as relieving the master of a tanker from the duty to operate the vessel in a safe and prudent manner, taking
into account the navigational constraints of the waterways to be traversed, other vessel traffic, and anticipated
weather, tide, and sea conditions, which may require reduced speeds, greater assistance from escort vessels, or
other operational precautions.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule sets forth regulations that require air carriers, air taxi, and commercial operators to provide duty
period scheduling limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants engaged in air transportation and air
commerce. This action results from public and congressional interest in regulating flight attendant work hours
and from data contained in a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) study of industry practice relating to flight
attendant flight, duty, and rest times. This rule contributes to an improved aviation safety system by providing
the opportunity for flight attendants to be rested sufficiently to perform their routine and emergency safety duties.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Availability of the Final Rule




Any person may obtain a copy of this amendment by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office
of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA-430, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC
20591, or by calling (202) 267-3484. Communications must identify the amendment number of this final rule.



Background



Statement of the Problem



Flight attendants are crewmembers who perform essential routine and emergency safety duties. Routine duties include
ensuring that carry-on baggage is correctly stowed; verifying that exit seating requirements are met, that passenger
seat belts are fastened, and that galley service times are properly stowed; and conducting passenger briefings before
takeoff. Emergency duties include conducting land and water evacuations, controlling inflight fires, handling
passengers who threaten the safety of other passengers or the flight, managing medical emergencies such as passenger
illness or injury, managing inflight emergencies such as smoke or fire in the cabin, and managing turbulent air penetrations,
airplane decompression, and hijackings. Additionally, because flight attendants are crewmembers performing
safety-related functions, they must satisfactorily complete indoctrination, initial, transition, and recurrent
training requirements. In addition, they are subject to the alcohol and drug use regulations and drug testing regulations.
Currently, flight attendants are the only safety-sensitive aviation group that has no regulations with respect
to flight, duty, or rest periods. Such regulations exist for flight crewmembers, dispatchers, air traffic control
tower operators, and aviation maintenance technicians.

This final rule is comparable to flight, duty, and rest requirements for other safety-sensitive aviation groups
because it enhances public safety by requiring ``rest periods'' and limiting duty periods for flight attendants.
These requirements protect flight attendants from work related fatigue that interferes with their ability to perform
essential safety duties. No accident/incident data currently exists to provide a direct correlation between flight
attendant fatigue and passenger survivability. However, the FAA recognizes that a flight attendant who is excessively
fatigued is less likely to be capable of performing safety duties than an adequately rested flight attendant. This
is an unacceptable safety risk. Therefore, the FAA adopts this final rule in the interest of air transportation and
air commerce safety. The justification stated herein includes that which was included in Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
No. 93-3, published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 31, 1993 (58 FR 17024).

Historical Review



In 1985, the FAA received two petitions for rulemaking requesting limits on flight and duty hours for flight attendants.
One petition
 sought to establish flight and duty time regulations similar to current regulations for flight crewmembers. The
other petition
 recommended establishing maximum duty time limits and minimum daily, weekly, and monthly rest periods. Both petitions
recommended certain flight time limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants that were more restrictive
than those that existed for flight crewmembers. The FAA denied both petitions in a Denial of Petition issued on January
23, 1989, because the action sought by the petitioners was not warranted by the information, views, and arguments
contained in the petitions.






Congressional legislation (H.R. 638 and S. 1170) was introduced in 1989 to establish flight attendant duty time limitations.
On May 17, 1989, the Subcommittee on Aviation of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation held a public
hearing on H.R. 638. At the hearing, the FAA stated its intent to initiate further studies of air carrier flight attendant
scheduling practices.

The FAA completed its ``Report on the Study of Current Industry Practice-Flight Attendant Flight, Duty, and Rest
Times'' on September 12, 1989 (hereafter referred to as ``the Industry Study'' [Docket No. 27229]), and submitted
a copy of the study to the House Subcommittee on Aviation. The study focused on U.S. air carrier scheduling practices
and flight attendant actual work hours and highlighted cases of extended duty periods and minimum rest periods. The
study indicated that flight attendant duty hour problems may occur more frequently among certain industry segments
because of fundamental operational differences. The study noted that most air carriers had policies to address these
problems. The study provided a framework for the FAA to address this issue with appropriate regulatory action, which
is provided in this final rule.

The House Subcommittee on Aviation held another hearing on flight attendant duty and rest on March 13, 1991. The FAA
did not recommend rulemaking at that hearing. Subsequent legislation on flight attendant duty and rest, H.R. 14,
was passed in the House of Representatives. In 1992, the language of H.R. 14 was incorporated into a provision in the
House and Senate versions of the FAA's appropriations bill; however, that provision was deleted later by the conference
committee. On January 5, 1993, H.R. 14 was reintroduced in the House of Representatives.

On March 26, 1993, the FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Notice No. 93-3, Flight Attendant Duty
Period Limitations and Rest Requirements (58 FR 17024; March 31, 1993) that proposed duty period scheduling limitations
and rest requirements for flight attendants engaged in air transportation and air commerce. The FAA has incorporated
into this final rule comments on the NPRM received from the public during the comment period, as appropriate.



Discussion of Comments



Fifty-one commenters submitted comments in response to the NPRM. The commenters included trade and professional
associations, individual flight attendants, labor organizations, part 121 and 135 operators, public interest
groups, a government agency, a Member of Congress, and other individuals. Among the commenters were the Air Line Pilots
Association (ALPA); the Air Transport Association (ATA); the Allied Pilots Association (APA); the American Cyanamid
Company; AMR Combs; the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions; Delta Airlines; Great American Airways; the National
Air Carrier Association (NACA); the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB); North American Airlines (NAA);
the Regional Airline Association (RAA); Southwest Airlines (SWA); Sun Country Airlines (SCA); Transport Workers
Union Local 556 (TWU Local 556)_Southwest Airlines; and flight attendants, some of whom are employed by America West
Airlines; Continental Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines.

Commenters addressed general and specific issues such as scheduled versus unscheduled operations; the application
of flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants; rest period requirements; duty period
requirements; augmented crew requirements; reserve and deadhead status for flight attendants; flight attendant
responsibility; the costs contained in the initial regulatory evaluation; and the implementation period for this
final rule. Commenters also addressed the issues of flight attendant fatigue, the Industry Study, international
versus domestic operations, part 125 operations, and flight attendant duty limitations and rest regulations in
other nations.



Overview of the General Issues



Thirty-nine comments addressed the concept of regulating flight attendant duty period limitations and minimum
``rest period'' requirements. Fourteen comments did not support establishing flight attendant duty period limitations
and rest requirements while 18 comments did support establishing such limits and requirements based on certain revisions
to the proposed rule.

The commenters who supported regulating flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements included
ALPA, APA, The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, NTSB, nine commenters who identified themselves as flight attendants,
and a member of Congress who strongly supports the comments of the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions. The commenters
stated that, because a flight attendant's primary duties are safety related, establishing regulations would enhance
public safety.

The 14 commenters who did not support the NPRM include Great American Airways, RAA, SCA, and nine commenters who identified
themselves as flight attendants. Several of the commenters who identified themselves as flight attendants stated
that the provisions in the NPRM would limit a flight attendant's opportunities to work extra trips and that flight
attendants are capable of handling safety procedures and emergencies even when working longer duty periods.



Specific Issues



Apply Flight Crewmember Flight, Duty, and Rest Requirements to Flight Attendants



In the NPRM, the FAA invited comments on the possibility of modifying the proposed rule, as presented in the NPRM, to
add an option for operators to either follow the proposed duty limitations and rest requirements or apply flight crewmember
flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants.

Eleven commenters responded to the FAA's request for comments. Seven of the commenters supported the option to permit
operators to either follow the proposed duty limitations and rest requirements or apply flight crewmember requirements
to flight attendants. Three commenters opposed the option. Although Delta Air Lines did not oppose the option, it
expressed no interest in exercising the option.

ATA, Great American Airways, NACA, RAA, and Southwest Airlines agreed that operators should be permitted to apply
flight crewmember requirements to flight attendants. ATA specified that applying flight crewmember requirements
should remain an option at the operator's discretion. Great American Airways, Horizon Air, NACA, RAA, and Southwest
Airlines noted that there are scheduling and economic advantages to using the same set of rules of flight crewmembers
and flight attendants.

The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions and SCA opposed establishing the option to permit operators to apply flight
crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants. The Coalition of Flight Attendants Unions
stated that flight crewmember rules do not provide adequate protection from fatigue. SCA noted that, if this option
had been a requirement in 1992, SCA would have had to hire an additional 20 flight attendants. According to SCA, the
cost burden of hiring 20 flight attendants would have increased SCA domestic operating costs by $1.75 million.



FAA Response



The FAA recognizes that giving operators the option to apply flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements
to flight attendants provides additional scheduling flexibility and eliminates the need for an operator to have
two sets of scheduling requirements for its flight crewmembers and flight attendants. This provision also will permit
flight attendants on such operations to be scheduled with the same limitations as the flight crewmembers. Therefore,
the FAA has adopted this option, which appears in   121.467(c) and 135.273(c) of this final rule.

If an operator chooses to apply flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants, the operator
must establish written procedures for applying the requirements and the procedures must be approved by the Administrator
and referenced in the certificate holder's operations specifications. The written procedures must apply to all
flight attendants used in the certificate holders operation. In addition, written procedures must be applied to
the certificate holder's entire operation. Certificate holders may obtain approval by submitting their procedures
for preliminary review and approval to the principal operations inspectors assigned to them at the FAA Flight Standards
District Offices that are charged with the overall inspection of their operations. This approval process is similar
to those used for exit seating and passenger carry-on baggage requirements. Because flight crewmember regulations
were designed specifically for pilots, FAA approval is required to ensure that flight crewmember rules are adequately
applied to flight attendants. In addition, the written procedures for domestic, flag, and supplemental air carriers
and for commercial operators must apply the flight crewmember limitations contained in subparts Q, R, or S of part
121, except for the provisions for on-board rest facilities, as appropriate to the operation being conducted. Therefore,
operators must consider the type of operation being conducted for each flight segment when scheduling flight attendants
according to the option.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, the written procedures for establishing duty period limitations and rest requirements for operators
certificated under part 135 must include the limitations contained in subpart F, except for provisions for on-board
rest facilities, as appropriate to the operation being conducted. Part 121 and 135 certificate holders are required
to provide flight attendants on aircraft with certain passenger seating configurations in accordance with   121.391,
135.107, or the certificate holder's operations specifications, as appropriate. The number of flight attendants
required on an aircraft to meet the provisions of   121.391, 135.107, or the certificate holder's operations
specifications, whichever is greater, is referred to as the minimum flight attendant crew complement.

Any operator that elects the option to apply flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants
and has established written procedures for augmenting the minimum flight crewmember complement must establish
procedures for augmenting the minimum flight attendant complement. The augmenting procedures must be based on the
number of flight crewmembers assigned to the flight that is in addition to the minimum flight crewmember complement
as specified in the aircraft type certificate data sheet. For example, if the minimum flight crewmember complement
on a Boeing 747-300 is three, as specified in the aircraft type certificate data sheet, an operator that schedules
four flight crewmembers for an extended long-range flight will be required to schedule one flight attendant in addition
to the minimum flight attendant crew complement that is required by   121.391, 135.107, or the certificate
holder's operations specifications. For example, if the operations specifications for a certain airplane requires
8 flight attendants, and if the operator adds 1 flight crewmember, that operator would be required to add 1 additional
flight attendant, for a total of 9 flight attendants.

In addition, any operator that elects the option of applying the flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements
to flight attendants, must ensure that the definition of ``rest period'' in this final rule is applied to those flight
attendants. (See the detailed discussion on ``Rest Period Requirements'' and ``Reserve Status, Stand-by Status,
or Similar Assignments'' in this final rule.)

Under the provision for applying flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants, if
the Administrator finds that revisions to the written procedures are necessary for the continued adequacy of the
procedures for applying flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants, the Administrator
will require the operator to make necessary changes within 30 days after being notified by the Administrator. In addition,
an operator may petition the Administrator to reconsider the notice to change the procedures.

This procedure for requiring changes is consistent with the current regulatory language for aircraft inspection
programs and pilot training programs contained in   91.415 and 121.405, respectively, as well as a number
of other regulations.

Any operator that establishes written procedures to apply the flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements
to flight attendants and that subsequently wishes to revise this practice and schedule flight attendants according
to the duty period limitations and rest requirements in   121.467 or 135.273 must amend their operations
specifications in accordance with   121.79(c) and 135.17(b). These sections require a certificate
holder to file an application for an amendment of operations specifications at least 15 days before the effective
date proposed by the applicant for the amendment, unless a shorter filing period is approved by the Flight Standards
District Office charged with the overall inspection of the certificate holder.



Unscheduled Operations



The NPRM proposed duty period limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants in all domestic, flag, supplemental,
and commercial operations conducted under part 121 and part 125, and in all operations conducted under part 135. No
new requirements for operations conducted under part 91 were proposed. The FAA received comments from part 121 and
135 operators about the applicability of the proposed requirements to certain unscheduled operations. Those commenters
included AMR Combs, ATA, American Cyanamid Company, Delta Airlines, Great American Airways, North American Airlines,
and Southwest Airlines.

<PARENT> FR940819-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

ATA, Delta Airlines, North American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines said that the proposed duty period limitations
and rest requirements should not apply to military flights, e.g., Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) and Military Airlift
Command (MAC). ATA and Southwest Airlines also said that special charters for sports teams should be excluded from
duty period limitations and rest requirements. Commenters stated that because of the short notification associated
with military and special charters it would not be possible to obtain a waiver from the regulation to conduct them.
North American Airlines stated that the proposed requirements should not apply to flights flown to remote destinations
on a weekly or ad hoc basis.

AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company believe that the proposed requirements should not apply to operations that
do not require a flight attendant. AMR Combs stated that many unscheduled operators do not employ full-time flight
attendants and that a flight attendant may serve more than one certificate holder.



FAA Response



In response to commenters who stated that the proposed duty period limitations and rest requirements should not apply
to military flights and special charters, this final rule does not except military or special charter operations
from duty period limitations and rest requirements. If a certificate holder chooses to apply the flight crewmember
flight, duty, and rest time limitations option to flight attendants when conducting military and special charter
flights to retain operational flexibility by scheduling the flight attendants with the flight crewmembers,   121.467(c)
and 135.272(c) require that the flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements option be applied to all flight
operations conducted by the certificate holder.

In response to AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company, the FAA agrees with these commenters. The final rule will not
apply to those operations where flight attendants are not required. However, all flight attendants who are assigned
to duties in an aircraft for operations that require a flight attendant, including flight attendants in excess of
the minimum flight attendant crew complement, are subject to duty limitations and rest requirements.

For example, an operator conducting operations on an aircraft with 19 passenger seats or less, which does not require
a flight attendant under  135.107, will not be required to meet flight attendant duty period limitations and
rest requirements for flights conducted on that aircraft. However, if the operator's operations specifications
state that the operator will provide a flight attendant for flights on that aircraft, then the operation does require
a flight attendant. Therefore, for any flight attendant assigned to flight duties on that aircraft the certificate
holder is required to meet the duty period limitations and rest requirements of  135.273.



Duty Period Limitations



The NPRM proposed limiting flight attendant duty periods. Proposed   121.466(a) and 135.273(a) defined
a duty period as the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving flight time and release from
that assignment by the certificate holder. The NPRM proposed that the time be calculated using either Coordinated
Universal Time or the local time of the flight attendant's home base.

Eleven commenters submitted comments supporting or recommending revisions to this proposed definition. 

Delta Air Lines, Southwest Air Lines, and TWU Local 556 agreed with the FAA's proposed definition.

ALPA, APA, and the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions stated that duty periods should include non-flight duties.
ALPA noted that ground duties can be as fatiguing as flight duties. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions recommended
that the definition of a duty period be replaced with: ``Any continuous period during which a flight attendant is required
to carry out any task associated with the business of an aircraft operator.''

To ensure that the definition of duty period explicitly excludes reserve status, ATA recommended that the following
phrase be added to the definition of duty period: ```Duty period' does not include time when a flight attendant is on
reserve status assignment, free of any specifically assigned duties other than to report for a flight assignment
within a specified period of time, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or company work rules.''

In addition to receiving comments on the definition of a duty period, the FAA also received comments on the duty period
limitations proposed in the NPRM. The NPRM proposed to limit flight attendant duty periods based on the length of the
duty period, the number of flight attendants assigned to a crew, and the amount of rest following the duty period. The
proposed rule contained provisions (proposed   121.466(b) and 135.273(b)) to prohibit an operator
from assigning a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours unless certain conditions are met.
An operator would be allowed to assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period up to 20 hours, if the operator:
(1) Assigns flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement; and (2) schedules an extended
rest period following the duty period.

Thirteen commenters submitted comments on issues pertaining to flight attendant duty period limits. The comments
addressed the use of ``scheduled'' versus ``actual'' duty periods, addressed the effect of the proposed duty limits
on unscheduled operators, made recommendations to the proposals, and provided proposed duty period limits.

The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, Southwest Airlines, and TWU Local 556 addressed the use of ``scheduled''
duty periods as opposed to ``actual'' duty periods. Southwest Airlines and TWU Local 556 agreed that the proposed
duty period limitations should be ``scheduled,'' not ``actual.'' TWU Local 556 stated that, if this flexibility
is not retained, the following would occur: (1) Flight attendants would be replaced after 14 hours of actual duty,
which inconveniences passengers and causes delays because of the need to locate crew replacements; (2) reserves
would be placed at out stations; (3) crews would be rerouted to cover flights that the original crews cannot perform;
(4) flight attendants would lose days off and have their schedules disrupted; (5) additional costs for crews and stranded
passengers would be incurred; and (6) aircraft repositioning would be required. However, the Coalition stated that
there is no justification for having no limit on actual hours and added that the actual number of flight attendant duty
hours per day needs to be limited.

AMR Combs stated that scheduled duty period limitations should apply only to scheduled operations with more than
19 passenger seats.

Four commenters, including NAA, recommended revisions to the proposed duty period limitations. NAA recommended
that a layover of 4 to 5 hours during which a hotel room is provided should not count as duty time. Other comments recommended
limiting duty to: (1) 16 hours in 24 hours with 11 hours of flight time in domestic operations; (2) 30 hours in 5 days;
(3) 16 hours with no more than 10 hours of flight time; or (4) 12 hours for flights with multiple stops.

The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions submitted an alternative proposal to the NPRM that included duty period
limitations. This alternative divided duty period limitations according to domestic, international, and long-range
flights. The Coalition's alternative proposed to limit: (1) Scheduled duty periods on domestic flights to no more
than 14 hours and actual duty periods to 15 hours; (2) scheduled duty periods on international flights to no more than
16 hours and actual duty periods to 17 hours; and (3) actual duty periods on long-range flights to no more than 4 hours
greater than the scheduled duty time, not to exceed 20 hours. The Coalition distinguished between domestic and international
duty periods and stated that it reluctantly includes a 20-hour duty period for long range international flights to
accommodate new generation aircraft, but only if additional rest is provided.

FAA Response


In establishing duty period limitations, the FAA has considered a variety of alternatives submitted by commenters,
including the proposals to set different limits for different types of operations. In an effort to establish requirements
that are conducive to safety and compatible with air carrier operations, the FAA also has reviewed current industry
practices used to schedule flight attendants. To provide the least complicated method of establishing effective
limitations for scheduling duty periods for flight attendants, the FAA has decided to adopt the scheduled duty period
limitations as proposed, with a slight modification that distinguishes cosmetic and international scheduled duty
periods.
The FAA has revised the definition of a duty period in this final rule to state that the time is calculated using Coordinated
Universal Time or local time to reflect the total elapsed time. The phrase ``or the local time of the flight attendants's
home base'' was replaced with ``or local time'' to be consistent with the definition of a calendar day. The FAA has determined
that any time zone can be used, as long as the operator is consistent.
Duty period limitations are established to enhance the safety of the flying public by ensuring that flight attendants
do not become overly fatigued during flight assignments. In addition, the duty period limitations are designed to
suit all operations that require flight attendants without imposing a significant burden on operators.
In response to the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, the final rule does not provide actual duty period limitations
because such provisions may unreasonably reduce operational flexibility. However, the final rule requires that
a flight attendant ``be given'' a scheduled rest period between scheduled duty periods, i.e., rest periods must be
provided. Because duty periods are scheduled in combination with actual rest periods, the objective of ensuring
the flight attendants are provided an opportunity to be rested will be met.
After further review of the Coalition comments and an analysis of flight schedules, the FAA finds that scheduled duty
periods of operations wholly within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia should not be allowed to
exceed 18 hours. The FAA is not aware of any scheduled duty periods for these operations that currently do exceed 18
hours. However, duty periods that contain one or more flights that land or take off outside the contiguous 48 states
and the District of Columbia may extend up to 20 hours, provided that an extended rest period is scheduled following
the duty period and that additional flight attendants are assigned to each flight segment in the duty period. This
provision will allow air carriers to conduct extended long-range operations with new generation aircraft. Moreover,
sections 121.467(b)(14) and 135.273(b)(14) will allow a flight attendant for a domestic air carrier to continue
on duty beyond the time when duty would normally terminate, if circumstances exist that are unanticipated and beyond
the control of the air carrier such as adverse whether conditions). This same exception will apply to flag and supplemental
operations.
A duty period as defined in this final rule means the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving
flight time and release from that assignment. In response to ATA's recommendation that the definition of a duty period
should state that a duty period does not include the time when a flight attendant is assigned to reserve status, the
FAA refers to the definition of a duty period in   121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule, which indicates
that a duty period does not begin until a flight attendant reports for an assignment involving flight time. Reserve
status is discussed in further detail under the heading ``Reserve Status, Stand-by Status, or Similar Assignments.''
In response to NAA, all duty period assignments, including those assignments with a 4- to 5-hour break in duty at a hotel,
must be assigned within duty period limitations and must meet minimum rest requirements. The FAA would not consider
this to be a break in, or cessation of, the duty period.

In response to AMR Combs, this final rule applies to operations, both scheduled and unscheduled, that require flight
attendants. Therefore, operators are not required to meet duty period limitations and rest requirements of this
final rule for operations that do not require a flight attendant.



Duty Period Following Reduced Rest



Sections 121.466(i) and 135.273(i) of the NPRM proposed that an operator be permitted to reduce a 12-hour rest period
to 10 hours following a duty period of more than 14 hours. In conjunction with this proposed provision, the FAA also
proposed   121.466(j) and 135.273(j), which would limit the scheduled duty period following a 10-hour
reduced rest period to less than 14 hours.

ATA, Delta Air Lines, and NACA submitted comments on limiting duty periods following reduced rest. The commenters
recommended that the FAA permit an operator to schedule a 16-hour duty period following a reduced rest period of 10
hours. ATA noted that this flexibility is needed for international operations.

Delta Air Lines also recommended that the phrase ``14 or more hours'' appearing in proposed   121.466(j)
and 135.273(j) be replaced with ``no more than 14 hours.'' Delta noted that the proposal would limit the duty period
following reduced rest to 13 hours 59 minutes.



FAA Response



Sections 121.467(b)(9) and 135.273(b)(9) of the final rule adopt the provisions as proposed in   121.466(j)
and 135.273(j) of the NPRM, except that the provisions are revised, in response to Delta Airlines' comment, so that
an operator may not schedule a flight attendant for a duty period of more than 14 hours following reduced rest. This
revision permits an operator to assign a flight attendant to a duty period of up to and including 14 hours following
a reduced rest period of 10 hours.

The FAA does not agree with those commenters that state that an operator should be allowed to schedule a 16-hour duty
period following a reduced rest period of 10 hours. This was not proposed in the notice as it might promote problems
of cumulative fatigue.



Duty Time That Exceeds Scheduled Duty Time When Beyond the Certificate Holder's Control



Sections 121.466(o) and 135.273(o) proposed that a flight attendant would not be considered scheduled for duty in
excess of duty time limitations if the flights to which the flight attendant is assigned are scheduled and normally
terminate within the limitations but, because of circumstances beyond the control of the domestic, flag, or supplemental
air carrier or commercial operator (such as adverse weather conditions), are not at the time of departure expected
to reach their destination within the scheduled time.

ALPA, APA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, Southwest Airlines, and TWU Local 556 commented on this provision.


ALPA and APA stated that the maximum duty period limit should not be exceeded by more than 2 additional hours regardless
of circumstances beyond the control of the operator.

The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions stated that this provision is unacceptable. The Coalition further stated
that operators consider all delays outside their control.

Southwest Airlines and TWU Local 556 stated that this provision should apply to a flight attendant who is reassigned
after reporting for work and the reassignment is beyond the operator's control.



FAA Response



The FAA has adopted this provision as proposed so that air carriers will not be penalized for operational delays such
as those due to weather and air traffic control. The FAA recognizes that delays are costly and that operators avoid
delays whenever possible. Sections 121.467(b)(14) and 135.273(b)(14) of this final rule apply to flights that are
assigned and scheduled and that normally terminate within allowable duty limitations. However, this provision
does not apply to operational delays relating to flight attendant staffing problems. A flight attendant's duty period
begins when the flight attendant reports for a flight assignment and ends when the flight attendant is released by
the air carrier. Changes to a flight attendant's schedule after a duty period begins must be made in accordance with
the duty period limitations and rest requirements set forth in this final rule. In addition, if a flight attendant
reports for duty and is later reassigned, the scheduled duty time before reassignment must be counted as part of the
total duty period.



Example:

 A flight attendant is scheduled for a 13-hour duty period on flight staffed with the minimum cabin crew complement.
The duty period consists of two flight segments_a flight from New York to Frankfurt followed by a flight from Frankfurt
to Rome. Because of adverse weather conditions, the flight leaving New York is delayed 2 hours, causing the flight
attendant's duty period to exceed the scheduled 14-hour duty period limitation. Although it is apparent at the time
of departure that the flight attendant's duty period will exceed 14 hours, completion of the assignment will still
comply with duty period limitations, because the flight attendant was scheduled and assigned to flights that normally
terminate within the allowable duty period limitations.

However, if, for example, the flight attendant is reassigned in Frankfurt to a flight to Athens, the flight attendant's
revised scheduled duty period cannot exceed a total of 14 scheduled hours, unless the flight attendant crew is augmented
in accordance with   121.467 (b)(4), (b)(5), or (b)(6), as appropriate, and each flight attendant is
given the minimum required rest. The flight attendant's duty period did not start over in Frankfurt because of the
reassignment.



Rest Period Requirements



The FAA received numerous comments on issues related to the rest requirements proposed in the NPRM. Commenters addressed
issues including the definition of a rest period, scheduled rest versus actual rest, minimum rest, reduced rest,
subsequent rest, relief from duty in air transportation and air commerce for 24 consecutive hours of rest in any 7 consecutive
calendar days, and on-board rest requirements.

The NPRM defined a rest period as the period when a flight attendant is free of all restraint or duty for a domestic, flag,
or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator and is free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion
arise. ATA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, and Southwest Airlines recommended revisions to the definition
of rest period. The comments submitted by ATA and the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions addressed reserve status
in their recommended definitions of rest. Southwest Airlines stated that the definition of rest period should be
defined as actual hours of rest, not scheduled hours of rest. Two commenters, including Delta Airlines, agreed with
the definition of rest period as proposed in the NPRM.

The NPRM proposed requirements for scheduling rest and reduced rest periods. Sections 121.466 (c) and (h) and 135.273
(c) and (h) of the NPRM proposed requiring that a flight attendant scheduled for 14 hours or less of duty be given 9 consecutive
hours of rest, and that a flight attendant scheduled for more than 14 hours but less than 20 hours be given 12 consecutive
hours of rest. Proposed   121.466 (d) and (i) and 135.273 (d) and (i) proposed permitting an air carrier
or commercial operator to reduce these rest periods to 8 and 10 consecutive hours, respectively. Three commenters
(Southwest Airlines, TWU Local 556, and TWU of America) supported the minimum rest requirements proposed in the NPRM
and also indicated that the rest requirements should not be increased.

The RAA expressed concern that the requirement to provide 9 hours of rest for duty periods of more than 14 hours implies
that a flight attendant who reports for a flight that is canceled is required to receive 9 hours of rest before the next
duty period begins.

Commenters, including APA and individual flight attendants, indicated that the actual time available for rest during
a rest period is often less than the scheduled rest period and may be as much as 2 to 31/2 hours less than the number of hours
scheduled in the rest period. The commenters stated that this often occurs because of time lost due to assisting passengers
in deplaning, travel to and from a rest facility, and other activities such as eating. One commenter stated that it
may take 35 minutes to 1 hour for passengers to deplane, for the crew to gather its belongings, and for travel to the hotel;
1 hour to eat; and 1 to 11/2 hours to prepare for duty again and travel back to the airport.

The FAA received several alternatives to the proposed rest requirements. APA recommended that a flight attendant
scheduled for a duty period of 14 hours or less be given a scheduled rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours. The
rest period could be reduced but not scheduled as a reduced rest period as long as the rest period is reasonably calculated
to provide 8 consecutive hours at a suitable rest facility and the flight attendant is provided a subsequent rest period
of at least 11 consecutive hours. Under the APA proposal, scheduled rest periods and reduced rest periods would have
to occur during the 24-hour period preceding the scheduled end of a duty period. APA recommended that a flight attendant
scheduled for a duty period of more than 14 hours but no more than 18 hours be given a scheduled rest period of at least
12 consecutive hours. This rest period could not be reduced and must occur after the completion of the scheduled duty
period and immediately prior to the commencement of the subsequent duty period. The Coalition of Flight Attendant
Unions proposed rest requirements based on domestic and international operations (see the discussion of Domestic
and International Operations). The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions' proposal recommended a minimum of 10 hours
of rest following domestic flights, 12 hours of rest following international flights, and a rest period equal to twice
the scheduled flight time for long-range international flights. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions' proposal
did not include a provision for reduced rest. RAA requested that minimum rest requirements for flight attendants
be aligned with flight crewmember requirements. One commenter suggested that a rest period should be at least 91/2
hours at a hotel or 12 hours from the time of release to the beginning of the next report. Another commenter stated that
the proposed minimum subsequent rest is satisfactory for domestic flights but not realistic for international flights.
The commenter suggested that the rest period following international flights should be 24 hours.

Several commenters recommended that the FAA establish provisions for on-board rest. APA recommended that a domestic,
flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator be permitted to assign a flight attendant to a scheduled
duty period of more than 14 hours, but no more than 16 hours, if the inflight duties assigned to flight attendants by
the air carrier or commercial operator were such that each of the cabin crew could be free of all duty for ``25 percent
of the scheduled block time less 1 hour.'' APA stated that reclining seats suitable for rest reserved for 25 percent
of the assigned attendant complement would have to be available throughout the flight. APA also recommended that
a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator be permitted to assign a flight attendant to
a scheduled duty period of more than 16 hours, but no more than 18 hours, if the inflight duties assigned to flight attendants
by the air carrier or commercial operator were such that each of the cabin crew could be free of all duty for ``33 percent
of the scheduled block time less 1 hour.'' APA added that reclining seats suitable for rest reserved for 33 percent
of the assigned attendant complement would have to be available throughout the flight. The Coalition of Flight Attendant
Unions recommended that a flight attendant be provided at least 1 hour of continuous rest for any flight segment scheduled
for 8 or more hours of flight time, and that a passenger seat or bunk be assigned for crew rest.



FAA Response



This final rule adopts the definition of rest period and the minimum rest requirements as proposed in the NPRM. The
FAA has considered the various rest requirement alternatives proposed by commenters and has determined that the
rest requirements proposed in the NPRM and adopted in this final rule are adequate to ensure that flight attendants
are provided the opportunity to be sufficiently rested to perform their routine and emergency safety duties without
imposing a significant burden on operators. A discussion of the comments recommending that reserve status be addressed
in the definition of rest is contained under the heading, ``Reserve Status, Stand-by Status, or Similar Assignments.''

In response to Southwest Airlines' comment that rest should be ``actual'' hours of rest and not ``scheduled,'' the
FAA considers that the opportunity to rest, as provided by the rest period, to be ``actual'' rest. As proposed in the
NPRM, this final rule requires that a flight attendant ``be given'' a scheduled rest period. This provision makes
the operator responsible for ensuring that a flight attendant is scheduled for and receives the scheduled rest period.
The FAA recognizes that how the flight attendant utilizes this rest period cannot be regulated. Requiring operators
to schedule rest periods ensures that flight attendants know in advance when rest periods will occur and that they
will be of a specified duration.

A minimum rest period of 9 consecutive hours is required for all duty period assignments of 14 hours or less, unless
the rest period is reduced in accordance with  121.467(b)(3) or  135.273(b)(3). A flight attendant who
reports for duty to find that the flight has been canceled would have begun a duty period and would require minimum rest.
However, in response to RAA's concern, a carrier could either keep the flight attendant on duty for reassignment or
release the flight attendant for a complete rest period.

Rest periods are required to occur between the completion of a scheduled duty period and the commencement of a subsequent
duty period. Consequently, this final rule does not require that a required rest period be given immediately prior
to a flight assignment. Because duty periods are defined as assignments involving flight time, a rest period is not
required following assignments that do not involve flight time, such as training or ground duty assignments.

In response to commenters who indicated that the actual time available to rest is typically less than scheduled rest,
the FAA considers a flight attendant to be free of all restraint or duty upon release from an assignment involving flight
time. The FAA understands that the time available for sleep during a rest period may vary depending on the amount of
time a flight attendant spends in other activities during the rest period. The FAA also recognizes that it cannot compel
a flight attendant to use rest periods for actual rest.

Additionally, this final rule regulates the frequency and duration of required rest periods. This final rule does
not regulate the quality of rest facilities nor does it require certificate holders to provide on-board rest for flight
attendants.



Reduced Rest



Sections 121.466 (d) and (i) and 135.273 (d) and (i) of the NPRM included provisions for operators to schedule 8-hour
and 10-hour reduced rest periods in conjunction with certain scheduled duty period limitations. ALPA stated that
a rest period should never be scheduled for less than 10 consecutive hours. However, ALPA believes that it may be permissible
for an operator to reduce a rest period to less than 10 hours because of circumstances beyond the control of the certificate
holder. APA opposed the concept of reduced rest and stated that an air carrier or commercial operator should not be
permitted to schedule a reduced rest period.



FAA Response



The FAA has adopted the reduced rest provisions as proposed. This final rule permits an air carrier or commercial operator
to schedule a flight attendant for reduced rest. However, no flight attendant will receive a rest period of less than
8 hours. This provision enables operators to retain a certain degree of scheduling flexibility. The reduced rest
provision is adopted in conjunction with the requirement to schedule a longer rest period subsequent to an 8- or 10-hour
reduced rest period. Together, these provisions prevent a flight attendant from being assigned two consecutive
reduced minimum rest periods and are designed to protect flight attendants by minimizing the effects of cumulative
fatigue.



24-Consecutive-Hour Rest Period During Any 7 Consecutive Calendar Days



Sections 121.466(n) and 135.273(n) of the NPRM proposed that a certificate holder be required to relieve a flight
attendant engaged in air transportation or air commerce from all further duty for at least 24 consecutive hours during
any 7 consecutive calendar days. For convenience, hereafter, this requirement will be referred to as the 24-hour-in-7-day
rest requirement. Proposed   121.466(a) and 135.273(a) of the NPRM defined a calendar day as the period
of elapsed time, using Coordinated Universal Time or local time, that begins at midnight and ends 24 hours later. Labor
organizations, operators, and an association commented on the proposed 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement.

Several of the comments submitted included discussion of the term ``calendar day.'' ATA stated that the term ``calendar
day'' is confusing because it is unclear on which day an assignment begins or ends. APA stated that the term calendar
day should specify that the local time used is that of the flight attendant's home base. In the Coalition of Flight Attendant
Unions' alternative to the NPRM, the Coalition deleted the definition of the term ``calendar day'' but retained the
provision for 24 consecutive hours of rest in 7 consecutive calendar days.

ATA and Delta Air Lines recommended that the FAA revise the proposed 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement by replacing
the phrase ``every 7 consecutive calendar days'' with the phrase ``every 168-consecutive-hour period.''

Southwest Airlines and TWU Local 556 requested that the final rule permit a flight attendant to voluntarily waive
the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement in order to be able to work extra hours. Southwest Airlines states that, if
flight attendants cannot waive this provision, Southwest would be required to hire an additional 100 flight attendants
at an initial cost of $710,000 and an annual recurring cost of $660,000. TWU Local 556 stated that they applied this
provision to a sample of 13 flight attendant schedules for February 1993. According to TWU Local 556, if the 13 flight
attendants were not permitted to fly their schedule, which had been altered to include extra flights, each flight
attendant would have lost $11,063 in extra annual income. The total lost income for 2,200 flight attendants would
be $24 million.

ATA and Delta Air Lines recommended that the FAA include a provision in the final rule similar to a statement included
in the preamble to the NPRM that indicated that the requirement for a 24-consecutive-hour rest period in any 7 consecutive
calendar days could be postponed under certain circumstances.

AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company noted that current   135.267(f) and 135.269(d) require unscheduled
operators to provide flight crewmembers with at least 13 rest periods of at least 24 consecutive hours in each calendar
quarter. AMR Combs stated that the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement proposed in the NPRM only should apply to scheduled
operations. American Cyanamid Company suggested that flight attendants could be required to meet pilot weekly rest
requirements as an alternative.

Other comments submitted included: (1) A recommendation by TWU Local 556 that the FAA could require four 24-hour breaks
in 30 days or require a 12-hour rest preceding the seventh duty day; and (2) a Carnival Airlines flight service schedule
indicating that a flight attendant had been scheduled for 11 consecutive days of duty without receiving a 24-consecutive-hour
rest period.



FAA Response



The 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement is designed to supplement daily rest requirements and to ensure that flight
attendants receive the opportunity to obtain adequate rest. The FAA proposed the definition of a calendar day to provide
a unit of measure that could be used to determine whether the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement is met. In response
to ATA's concern that the term ``calendar day'' causes confusion, the FAA refers to the definition of ``calendar day''
in   121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule, which indicates that a calendar day begins at midnight
and ends 24 hours later at the next midnight. ``Seven consecutive calendar days'' as used in   121.467
and 135.273 of this final rule means a period of 7 consecutive days beginning at midnight on the first day and ending
at midnight 7 days later. In response to APA's recommendation that the definition of calendar day specify that the
local time be that of the flight attendant's home base, the FAA has determined that any time zone can be used to determine
whether the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement is met, as long as the carrier is consistent. In other words, a certificate
holder may not manipulate the use of time zones when calculating 7 consecutive calendar days so as to vary the number
of hours that comprise any 7 consecutive calendar days.

The FAA has considered the commenters' request to replace the proposed 7 consecutive calendar days with a 168-consecutive-hour
period. The FAA notes that the NPRM used language consistent with the language contained in the current flight crewmember
flight time limitations rule. The FAA has decided that it should not introduce at this final rule stage an inconsistency
between the flight crewmember flight time limitations rule language and the flight attendant duty period limitations
and rest requirements rule language. The FAA will consider whether rulemaking should be initiated to replace 7 consecutive
calendar days with 168-consecutive-hours.

The FAA has reviewed requests to permit flight attendants to voluntarily waive the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement.
The FAA has not included that alternative in this final rule because the purpose of requiring 24 consecutive hours
free from duty in any 7 consecutive calendar days is to ensure that flight attendants receive the opportunity to obtain
adequate rest. As with rest requirements following reduced rest, the requirement for 24 consecutive hours of rest
in any 7 consecutive calendar days is designed to protect flight attendants by minimizing the effects of cumulative
fatigue.

In response to comments received from ATA and Delta Airlines, the FAA has determined that it is not necessary to include
in this final rule provisions for permitting the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement to be delayed. This final rule
imposes restrictions for flight attendants that parallel the restrictions that currently exist for flight crewmembers.
The absence of provisions to permit the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement to be delayed does not preclude a flight
attendant from completing a duty period assignment that has extended into the seventh calendar day because of a delay
that is beyond the control of the operator. In addition, the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement may be delayed for
reasons such as deadheading, assignment to training, and others. However, if the requirement is delayed, the flight
attendant must be given the 24-consecutive-hour rest period before beginning any subsequent duty period assignment.

In response to unscheduled operators, the FAA notes that unscheduled part 135 operators conducting operations that
require flight attendants have the option to apply the flight crewmember flight time limitations to flight attendants
instead of using the duty period limitations and rest requirements contained in this final rule. Sections 135.267(f)
and 135.269(d) require certificate holders to provide each flight crewmember with at least 13 rest periods of at least
24 consecutive hours each in each calendar quarter. Among other requirements, operators that choose to apply flight
crewmember requirements to flight attendants would be required to provide flight attendants with at least 13 rest
periods of at least 24 consecutive hours in each calendar quarter instead of relief from duty for 24 consecutive hours
every 7 consecutive calendar days.

Comments on the costs associated with the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement are addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation
Summary.



Compensatory Rest Periods



Although there was no specific proposal in the notice, the FAA requested comments on the feasibility of establishing
compensatory rest periods for flight attendants when scheduled duty periods are exceeded. ATA, the Coalition of
Flight Attendant Unions, and Delta Air Lines opposed the establishment of compensatory rest periods.



FAA Response



In response to the comments submitted, the FAA will not mandate compensatory rest periods in this final rule. The FAA
has determined that compensatory rest is not necessary, because the duty period limitations and rest requirements
contained in this final rule ensure that flight attendants receive the opportunity to be adequately rested to perform
safety duties.



Reserve Status, Stand-by Status, or Similar Assignments



The FAA recognizes that current industry practice varies with regard to the use of these terms and their relationship
to duty or rest. In the NPRM, the FAA requested comments on the most appropriate way to address reserve status, stand-by
status, or a similar assignment. The FAA received 13 comments, primarily from air carrier associations and labor
organizations. Commenters described different types of reserve status and suggested situations when reserve should
be considered duty or rest.

ATA recommended adding the following phrase to the definition of rest period: ``except that reserve status assignments
shall be considered `rest' for purposes of this rule, provided that the only work-related restriction shall be to
report for a flight assignment within a specified period of time pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or
company work rules.'' The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions recommended that the definition of rest period be
revised to ``the time period free of all restraint or duty from a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial
operator and free of all responsibility, or interruption by, work or duty.''

<PARENT> FR940819-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, commenters indicated that different types of reserve status including ``call-in'' reserve and ``on-call''
reserve are commonly found in the aviation industry. As described by commenters, call-in reserve requires that a
flight attendant contact, or be available to be contacted by, the operator at designated times for flight assignments.
The commenters added that on-call reserve typically requires that a flight attendant be available for an assignment
on short notice (usually within 1 hour) if contacted by the operator.

A majority of the commenters on this issue discussed whether reserve status should be considered rest. ATA, NACA,
and Southwest Airlines stated that the time a flight attendant is assigned to reserve status and is not assigned to
a duty period should be considered rest for the purpose of meeting the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement proposed
in  121.466(n) of the NPRM. RAA stated that the type of reserve in which a person must contact the company for future
assignments_rather than being available for an assignment on short notice_should be considered rest because it
is free of all duty except for the possibility of communication with the operators. Two individual commenters stated
that the time a flight attendant spends on reserve should not be considered rest.

Four of the commenters, including ATA, Delta Air Lines, and RAA, commented on whether reserve status should be considered
part of a duty period. ATA and Delta Air Lines stated that the time a flight attendant spends on reserve should not be
considered a duty period. ATA noted that, if reserve is considered duty, operators will need to increase staff by 20
to 30 percent. ATA estimates that the annual cost would be $100 to $130 million for salaries, benefits, and associated
training and administrative costs. Delta Air Lines expressed concern that if ``on-call'' reserve is considered
duty, flight attendants would request at-home pay. RAA stated that the type of reserve in which a person is expected
to report on short notice should be considered duty. TWU Local 556 stated that duty time for a reserve flight attendant
should be calculated from actual report time to release time for a flight assignment.



FAA Response



In response to the commenters who stated that reserve status should be considered rest, the FAA notes that the time
during which a flight attendant is responsible for contacting a certificate holder or for being available to be contacted
by a certificate holder for an assignment (e.g., reserve or stand-by status) does not meet any rest period requirements,
because the FAA has defined a rest period as free of all restraint or duty and free of all responsibility for work or duty
should the occasion arise.

Specifically in response to ATA's, NACA's, and Southwest Airlines' suggestions that reserve assignments should
fulfill the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement if no duty period is assigned, the FAA reiterates that rest period
requirements are not met when a flight attendant is assigned to reserve status even if the flight attendant is not given
a duty period assignment. A duty period, as defined in this final rule, does not begin until a flight attendant reports
for an assignment involving flight time. For example, a flight attendant who has been assigned to reserve status for
24 hours but has not reported for a duty period assignment during that time will not have satisfied the 24-hour-in-7-day
rest requirement. The rest requirement is not satisfied, because the reserve assignment is a restraint and includes
present responsibility for work as a flight attendant if the occasion arises.

Some commenters stated that reserve status should not be restricted by duty period requirements. The FAA refers the
commenters to the definition of duty period in   121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule, the first
sentence of which reads: ``Duty period means the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving
flight time and release from that assignment. * * *'' It should be clear that reserve status alone does
not meet the definition of duty period. On the other hand, it also should be clear that reserve status may not be performed
during a rest period. The definition of rest period in   121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule states
that ``Rest period means the time period free of all restraint or duty for a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier
or commercial operator and free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion arise.''



Augmented Cabin Crews



This final rule permits operators to schedule flight attendants for duty periods of more than 14 hours provided an
operator: (1) Assigns flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the
flight or flights in that duty period under the certificate holder's operations specifications; and (2) schedules
an extended rest period following the duty period.

Ten commenters submitted comments on the proposed augmented cabin crew requirements addressing: (1) The concept
of augmenting cabin crews in proportion to the type of aircraft; (2) the relationship between augmented cabin crews
and flight attendant fatigue; and (3) the effect of augmented crew requirements on unscheduled operators.

APA, NAA, and RAA noted that the proposed augmented cabin crew requirements are not based on the size of the aircraft.
APA stated that if the FAA intends the provision for augmented cabin crews to be used only for long-range operations,
this should be clarified in the final rule. APA noted that, under the proposed provisions, one flight attendant would
be added to either a two-person crew or an eight-person crew. NAA noted that, one additional flight attendant on a Boeing
757 is a 20 percent increase in crew; one additional flight attendant on a wide-body airplane is a 7 percent increase
in crew. NAA recommended that the FAA distinguish between wide-body and narrow-body airplanes by requiring one additional
flight attendant for any duty period between 14 and 20 hours on a narrow-body airplane. RAA stated that operators of
airplanes that require one or two flight attendants should not be required to augment cabin crews in order to schedule
duty periods longer than 14 hours. RAA added that a passenger seat will be needed for an additional flight attendant.
RAA also noted that regional operators schedule some duty periods longer than 14 hours; however, many of these include
an intermediate rest period.

APA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, and RAA addressed the relationship between augmented cabin crews
and fatigue. APA and the Coalition stated that a larger crew does not necessarily result in a less fatigued crew and
noted that American Airlines, Trans World Airlines, United Air Lines, and USAir currently assign flight attendants
in addition to the minimum crew complement. APA and the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions noted that the proposal
does not require an operator to provide a flight attendant with inflight rest. RAA stated that requiring augmented
cabin crews for the purpose of reducing fatigue has been inadequately justified.

ATA and Delta Air Lines stated that the rule should permit a flight to operate if an augmented crew is assigned but not
present for a flight because of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., illness or injury during a layover). Delta suggested
that 1 hour of on-board crew rest for the remaining flight attendant crew could be provided in this circumstance.

AMR Combs noted that a change is needed for on-demand operators. They stated that a ``larger'' aircraft such as a Gulfstream
or a Challenger cannot accommodate up to four flight attendants. AMR Combs stated that these operators would either
apply for an exemption or not use a flight attendant.



FAA Response



This final rule provides scheduling flexibility by permitting an operator to schedule a flight attendant for a duty
period of more than 14 hours if the flight attendant crew is augmented in accordance with  121.467 (b)(4), (b)(5),
or (b)(6), or  135.273 (b)(4), (b)(5), or (b)(6). The augmented flight attendant crew provision permits extended
duty periods to accommodate certain operational requirements such as those for long-range international flights,
but this provision also may be applied to domestic operations.

The provision for augmented cabin crews is designed to reduce fatigue by decreasing flight attendant work load on
a flight and by providing an extended rest period following a long duty day. Although the FAA recognizes that the provision
will not require flight attendant crews to be augmented proportionally for each aircraft type, it provides the least
complicated method for reducing fatigue and accommodating certain operational requirements. Therefore, in this
final rule, the FAA adopts the provision for augmenting cabin crews on a flight or flights with a scheduled duty period
of more than 14 hours but not more than 18 hours, and scheduled duty periods that do not exceed 20 hours for duty periods
that contain one or more flights that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia.



In response to comments from AMR Combs, Delta Airlines, and RAA, this final rule contains no provision to except an
operator from meeting minimum augmented cabin crew requirements when a flight attendant duty period is scheduled
for more than 14 hours in operations that require a flight attendant. This includes instances in which a required crewmember
is not available following a layover, e.g., due to illness or injury. Additionally, the use of an approved passenger
seat is required for operators that schedule flight attendants for duty periods of more than 14 hours on aircraft that
are not configured with a flight attendant jumpseat for the additional flight attendant(s).


In response to AMR Combs' comment regarding the use of flight attendants in Gulfstream and Challenger aircraft, this
final rule applies to operations that require a flight attendant. Typically, Gulfstream and Challenger aircraft
are not configured with more than 19 passenger seats and a flight attendant is not required to be on board. Therefore,
flight attendants assigned to such operations are not subject to the duty period limitations and rest requirements
in this final rule. In addition, operators have the option to apply flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements
to flight attendants.







Deadhead Transportation







Proposed   121.466(m) and 135.273(m) described deadhead transportation as time spent in transportation,
not local in character, that a certificate holder requires of a flight attendant and provides to transport the flight
attendant to an airport at which that flight attendant is to serve on a flight as a crewmember, or from an airport at which
the flight attendant was relieved from duty to return to the flight attendant's home base. Under the proposal, time
spent in deadhead transportation is not rest.




ATA, Delta Air Lines, and NACA requested that the final rule provide scheduling flexibility for flight attendants
in deadhead transportation. ATA requested that the FAA permit: (1) Operators to schedule 2 hours of deadhead transportation
to a domicile that is not counted within duty time limitations; (2) flight attendants to waive all duty time limitations
when returning to a domicile and count the time as rest; and (3) flight attendants to delay the weekly rest requirement
to return to the flight attendant's home base. Delta Air Lines stated that the FAA should permit a flight attendant
to alter schedules to exceed the scheduled maximum duty time after the last flight segment to return to the flight attendant's
home base. Delta also recommended that an operator be permitted to deadhead a flight attendant for up to 20 hours regardless
of the number of assigned flight attendants. NACA suggested that the final rule clarify that the time a flight attendant
spends deadheading is not limited by duty periods or the requirement to augment the flight attendant crew because
no inflight duties are involved.






ATA and NACA stated that the final rule should clarify that a deadheading flight attendant is not a working member of
the cabin crew for the purpose of determining if staffing requirements must be augmented.



The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions and NACA agreed with the NPRM that the time a flight attendant spends in deadhead
transportation is not rest.








FAA Response




Deadhead transportation as adopted in   121.467(b)(12) and 135.273(b)(12) of this final rule is not
considered part of a rest period. This use of deadhead transportation in relation to flight attendant duty period
limitations and rest requirements is consistent with the application of flight crewmember flight time limitations
and rest requirements.




In addition, a flight attendant scheduled for deadhead transportation is not assigned to duty in an aircraft and is
not considered a working crewmember. Therefore, for the purpose of determining duty period limitations and rest
requirements, deadhead transportation is not considered an assignment involving flight time and is not part of a
duty period. In response to the comments submitted, the FAA reiterates that an operator is not required to augment
flight attendant crews for flights when a flight attendant is assigned to deadhead transportation because the time
spent in deadhead transportation is not part of a duty period. For example, an operator may schedule a flight attendant
crew for a flight to Europe with a duty period of 14 hours. Immediately following the flight and before beginning a 9-hour
rest period, the operator requires the flight attendant crew to deadhead for 2 hours to position the crew for the next
duty period assignment. In this example, the operator is not required to augment the flight attendant crew because
the deadheading portion of the assignment is not considered part of the duty period. However, the 2 hours spent positioning
the crew for the next assignment are not considered part of the 9-hour rest period.






Flight Attendant Responsibility





Proposed   121.466 and 135.273 state that a flight attendant may not accept a work assignment that does
not meet the duty time limitations and rest requirements. Six commenters responded to this provision.




ATA, APA, Delta Air Lines, and RAA opposed this provision. The commenters stated that, if the provision were adopted,
flight attendants would be subject to FAA civil penalties. The commenters also expressed concern that the provision
would interfere with labor-management relations. APA noted that a flight attendant could be permitted to complete
a flight assignment that the flight attendant believes to be improper and to inform the FAA at the next opportunity.

The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions included in its alternative the provision for a flight attendant to refuse
a work assignment that does not meet the Coalition's proposed duty time limitations and rest requirements. In contrast,
TWU Local 556, representing the flight attendants of Southwest Airlines, commented that the provision of flight
attendant responsibility could place a flight attendant in the impossible position of risking either a fine from
the FAA or discipline for insubordination from the airline if the carrier's scheduling department makes a mistake.


FAA Response


In light of comments received, the FAA has determined that only an operator, not a flight attendant, should be responsible
for ensuring that duty limitations and rest requirements are met. The FAA bases its decision on the fact that a flight
attendant could be called upon to decide between the violation of a regulation and possible disciplinary action from
the company. That misunderstanding and conflict between company scheduling personnel and flight attendants could
occur at a time when flight attendants should be giving their full attention to the passengers. In cases in which a flight
attendant is aware that an assignment does not meet duty period and rest requirements, the FAA recommends that the
flight attendant bring the situation to the air carrier's attention. If the situation is not corrected, the flight
attendant should then inform the FAA. However, this recommendation does not preclude a flight attendant from informing
the FAA before contacting the air carrier. In addition, flight attendant duty and rest time records are subject to
FAA review. Air carriers found to be in noncompliance with the regulation are subject to enforcement action.


Recordkeeping


Sections 121.683(a)(1) and 135.63(a)(5) of the NPRM proposed requiring certificate holders to maintain current
records on flight attendant duty and rest time requirements. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, Southwest
Airlines, TWU Local 556, and TWU of America agree with the proposed recordkeeping requirements. The Coalition of
Flight Attendant Unions does not anticipate that the recordkeeping requirements as proposed in the NPRM would be
unduly burdensome.
NAA stated that the cost of tracking crew time for duty and rest could be very expensive. NAA noted that many small carriers
do not have expensive computer tracking systems and cannot afford to do manual tracking.
Delta Airlines stated that the one-time cost for computer software changes would be $368,000. NACA noted that one
of its members estimates that the proposed recordkeeping requirements would cost $50,000 annually.


FAA Response


The information and recordkeeping requirements of this final rule are currently under review by the Office of Management
and Budget. Provided that they are approved by OMB, the FAA adopts the recordkeeping requirements as proposed in the
NPRM. These requirements will become effective when they have been approved by OMB. The FAA anticipates that this
approval will be given soon.
The FAA recognizes that a concern of the aviation industry has been the potential cost involved in tracking crew time
for duty and rest periods. The regulation provides that carriers maintain current records for each flight attendant
to verify compliance with flight, duty, and rest time periods. The FAA intends to be as flexible as possible in interpreting
this recordkeeping requirement. Records may be maintained by computer, by hand documentation, or by any other method
that will permit a carrier to assure compliance with the regulatory requirements.
Since many carriers already track flight attendant duty periods to ensure that union contract or company guidelines
on duty and rest time are met, the FAA expects that recordkeeping systems already in place will be sufficient to meet
the recordkeeping requirements of the final rule with minimal modification. Carriers that do not currently track
flight attendant duty periods will incur costs in developing recordkeeping systems; however, the flexibility built
into the final rule should help to minimize these costs. Further, the FAA intends to assist these carriers by providing
information and guidance based on already-implemented recordkeeping systems maintained by other air carriers.


Implementation Time of the Final Rule


ATA and Delta Air Lines requested that the FAA not implement this final rule immediately. They noted that operators
will need time to revise their computer programs. ATA requested a 12-month implementation period; Delta requested
an 18-month implementation period.


FAA Response


The FAA has considered the implementation periods proposed by ATA and Delta. However, in the interest of public safety,
the FAA has determined that the final compliance date of this rule should be no later than March 1, 1995. Because most
operators are currently using scheduling guidelines and tracking systems for flight attendants, the FAA has determined
that the March 1, 1995, date is reasonable.


Additional Issues


Fatigue


Commenters who addressed flight attendant fatigue include ATA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, NACA,
NTSB, RAA, SCA, and Southwest Airlines.
ATA emphasized that flight attendant fatigue caused by abusive scheduling or duty periods is not a problem in the scheduled
airline industry. NACA, RAA, SCA, and Southwest Airlines emphasized that studies have found no correlation between
flight attendant fatigue and the ability of a flight attendant to perform safety-sensitive functions. SCA point
out that accident data do not specify flight attendant fatigue as a factor in delay of evacuation or in injuries or fatalities
that occurred.

<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00097 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions provided a summary of research on circadian dysrhythmia and fatigue with
an extensive bibliography. NTSB reiterated Recommendation I-89-1, which stated that the Department
of Transportation should ``expedite a coordinated research program on the effects of fatigue, sleepiness, sleep
disorders, and circadian factors on transportation system safety.'' Other commenters submitted copies of articles
and recommendations related to fatigue.


FAA Response


The FAA has reviewed the extensive amounts of literature provided by commenters on fatigue related to travel and extended
work periods as well as to shift work. Although consideration has been given to numerous fatigue studies, no accident/incident
data is available to provide a direct correlation between flight attendant fatigue and passenger safety. However,
it is evident that fatigue may affect flight attendant performance and that proper scheduling practices may help
avoid compromising flight attendant performance. The FAA recognizes that flight attendants perform essential
safety duties and has determined that the requirements contained in this final rule enhance safety by protecting
flight attendants from acute and chronic fatigue. This final rule addresses the potential safety problems that could
occur if fatigued flight attendants work excessive duty hours or receive inadequate rest.


Industry Study


The principal commenters who addressed the Industry Study include AMR Combs, American Cyanamid Company, the Coalition
of Flight Attendant Unions, and SCA.
American Cyanamid Company stated that the Industry Study does not indicate that there is a pattern of air carriers
willfully scheduling long duty days or long series of days without a day off. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions
indicated that the Industry Study has been used as evidence that extreme examples of scheduling abuse are isolated
and that the actual occurrences of scheduling abuse were most likely under-reported because the instances provided
in the Industry Study were ``self-selected.'' The Coalition further stated that, even though the instances were
self-selected, the Industry Study found industry-wide flight attendant duty and rest period problems. SCA stated
that the Industry Study does not provide evidence to establish any correlation among flight attendant duty time,
flight attendant safety duties, and risk to passengers. AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company noted that the Industry
Study did not consider unscheduled part 135 operators.


FAA Response


The FAA conducted the Industry Study to determine if scheduling extremes exist, and, if so, to determine the nature
of the extremes, not to determine the statistical frequency with which they occur or to correlate passenger risk with
extreme scheduling. Access to records was gained through the cooperation of air carriers. The air carriers did not
choose individual records for examination. Based on the purpose of the study, records were selected for review when
flight attendant scheduling extremes were expected to be likely. Therefore, statistical inferences cannot be made.
However, the data contained in the Industry Study provides fundamental background information on flight attendant
scheduling practices.
The Industry Study included a review of data from major, national, regional, and supplemental carriers. The study
did not include a review of unscheduled part 135 operators because relatively few of these operators conduct operations
that require a flight attendant. As previously discussed, air carriers and commercial operators conducting operations
for which the FAA does not require a flight attendant will not be required to comply with flight attendant duty period
limitations and rest requirements even if flight attendants are involved in those operations.


International and Domestic Operations


The proposed amendment did not make a distinction between domestic and international operations in determining
flight attendant duty limitations and rest requirements. Five commenters commented on whether there should be a
distinction between domestic and international operations for determining flight attendant duty period limitations
and rest requirements. Four commenters, including the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions and the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM & AW), supported making a distinction. The Coalition provided
definitions for a domestic flight, an international flight, and a long-range international flight. One commenter
stated that flight attendants assigned to international flight require more rest than flight attendants assigned
to domestic flights because flight attendants on international flights are in a state of physical desynchronization.
Another commenter stated that duty period limits should be 12 hours for domestic flights and 14 hours for international
flights. NAA stated that no distinction should be made between international and domestic flights because some domestic
flights are as long as international flights and the work load is the same for the crew.


FAA Response


After a review of the Coalition comments and an analysis of flight schedules, the FAA finds that scheduled duty periods
for operations wholly within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia should not be allowed to exceed
18 hours. The FAA is not aware of any scheduled duty periods for these operations that currently do exceed 18 hours.
However, for duty periods involving one or more flights that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the
District of Columbia, the duty period may not exceed 20 hours. Thus, the final rule makes this distinction between
domestic and international operations.


Part 125 Operators


The NPRM proposed that each flight attendant be relieved from all duty for at least 8 consecutive hours during any 24-hour
period.
Two commenters, including the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, addressed this proposal. The Coalition recommended
that the 8-hour period free of duty be replaced with a 10-hour period free of duty.


FAA Responses


Section 125.37, Duty time limitations, currently requires a flight crewmember to be relieved from duty for at least
8 consecutive hours during any 24-hour period. The final rule incorporates flight attendants into the current provision,
thus providing parallel duty time limitations for flight attendants and flight crewmembers.


Rules for Flight Attendants in Other Nations


APA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, and the IAM & AW noted that flight attendants in other nations have
regulations that provide flight attendant duty time limitations and minimum rest requirements. APA stated that
the proposed Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) regulations address issues related to fatigue. The Coalition provided
a copy of the proposed JAA rules.

FAA Response



During the Industry Study, the FAA conducted a review of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO)
regulations relating to flight attendant flight, duty, and rest times including a review of ICAO Circular Flight
Crew Fatigue and Flight Time Limitations (52-AN/47/6). The Industry Study identified 23 countries that have
government regulations for flight attendant flight and duty limitations and rest requirements, and 24 countries
that do not have such regulations. The FAA notes that the Joint Aviation Regulations currently do not include flight
time limitations for flight attendants; however, the JAA have proposed flight time limitations for flight crewmembers
and flight attendants that are currently under review by the European Community. Based on this information, the FAA
has determined that flight attendant flight and duty limitations and rest requirements of some countries are less
stringent than the final rule adopted by the FAA, and the requirements of other countries are more stringent than those
being adopted. Therefore, the FAA considers the final rule to be within the range of worldwide governmental regulations
governing flight attendant duty limitations and rest requirements.



Changes to the NPRM



The FAA amended several provisions of the proposed rule in response to comments received from the public. Any changes
that significantly altered the requirements of the duty period limitations and rest requirements are discussed
previously and are summarized in this section.

The NPRM made no distinction between domestic and international operations. In the final rule domestic operations
are limited to up to 18-hour scheduled duty periods. However, scheduled duty periods that involve one or more flights
that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia may be scheduled up to 20 hours, providing
required augmentation is provided.

The FAA moved flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements from proposed  121.466 in the
NPRM to  121.467 in the final rule to facilitate the incorporation of future amendments. In addition, paragraphs
describing duty period and rest period provisions in the NPRM have been revised and renumbered in the final rule to
incorporate new and revised requirements. The FAA also revised the NPRM to include minor editorial changes and revised
the list of subjects to include additional terms.

Based on comments receive, the FAA removed the proposed requirement that a flight attendant be responsible for ensuring
compliance with duty period limitations and rest requirements before accepting any flight assignments. The FAA
determined that this is an operator's responsibility and not the responsibility of a flight attendant.

The NPRM included the proposal that an operator may not assign a flight attendant a duty period of 14 or more hours following
a 10-hour reduced rest period. In   121.467(b)(9) and 135.273(b)(9), the FAA revised the NPRM to restrict
an operator from assigning a flight attendant to a duty period of ``more than 14 hours'' following a 10-hour reduced
rest period. This change permits an operator to assign a flight attendant to a duty period of up to and including 14 hours
following the reduced rest period.

The FAA incorporated provisions into the final rule to give operators the option to apply the flight crewmember flight,
duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants. The FAA permits this option provided that the operator establishes
written procedures that are referenced in the certificate holder's operations specifications for applying the
appropriate flight crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants.

The following chart depicts the scheduled duty period, rest period, and augmented flight attendant crew requirements
for this final rule.

Costs



In the NPRM, the FAA requested additional information on the costs of the proposed rule. The FAA received comments
from associations, labor organizations, and part 121 operators.

ATA, which primarily represents part 121 scheduled operators, stated that the proposal would cost its members at
least $8 million annually to revise current computer crew scheduling programs, hire additional personnel, extend
layovers, and schedule reserves. ATA believes that the costs were understated in the NPRM and noted that they did not
include an inflation factor. ATA indicated that the 15-year cost of the proposed rule would be $88,947,099 using a
7-percent discount rate and a 3-percent inflation rate. RAA stated that the costs associated with the proposed rule
are significantly understated. In addition, RAA believes that the economic effect of the proposed rule should reflect
the cost burden of other recent rulemakings. NACA stated that the proposal would cost one of its members an estimated
$372,000 annually for additional staffing and $50,000 annually to meet recordkeeping requirements.

The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions stated that the median flight attendant salary, based on the average salary
for supplemental air carrier flight attendants represented by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), is $18,461.
According to the Coalition, if 6,000 flight attendants are hired by supplemental operators, the cost in salaries
will be $1,107,660 [sic]. The Coalition noted that this is one tenth the cost of random drug testing.

Delta Airlines, a scheduled part 121 operator, indicated that the initial cost to comply with the proposed rule would
be $2,863,416. This cost includes the cost of hiring 36 additional flight attendants, estimated at $1,348,000; paying
flight attendants during deplaning, estimated at $749,000; providing additional meals, estimated at $400,000;
and modifying computer software, estimated to be a one-time cost of $367,000. Delta estimates that the annual cost
to comply with the proposed rule would be $2.5 million.

Sun Country Airlines, an unscheduled part 121 operator, stated that it would be required to augment cabin crews on
domestic flights more often than it now does. Sun Country Airlines also stated that, if the NPRM had been effective
in 1992, the carrier would have hired an additional 34 flight attendants and the cost to domestic operations would
have been $2.6 million in salaries, benefits, training, hotels, meals, deadhead travel, and administrative burden.
Sun Country Airlines pointed out that the NPRM estimated that supplemental operators would absorb 60 percent of the
proposal's costs while supplemental operators employ only 1 percent of all flight attendants.

Great American Airways, an unscheduled part 121 operator, stated that the proposed rule would impose substantially
greater costs on supplemental air carriers. Positioning flight attendants would become a major expense for supplemental
operators. Unanticipated schedule and routing changes could severely curtail current flexibility. However, Great
American Airways stated that the disruptions mentioned above would be minimized if supplemental air carriers had
the option to apply the same work rules to both flight attendants and pilots. Great American Airways estimates that
the total cost savings that would be derived from implementing a single set of duty limitations for its cabin and flight
crewmembers, as opposed to adopting the requirements proposed in the NPRM, would be more than $100,000 annually.



FAA Response



The comments that address the costs associated with this final rule are addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation Summary.



Paperwork Reduction Act




Information collection requirements for parts 121, 125, and 135 have been previously approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) and have been assigned
OMB Control Numbers as follows: For part 121, OMB Control Number 2120-0008; for part 125, OMB Control Number
2120-0085; and for part 135, OMB Control Number 2120-0039. The FAA has prepared changes to these control
numbers to reflect the additional paperwork requirements of this final rule and has submitted these changes to OMB.

In completing this rulemaking, the FAA has been mindful that it is the policy of the agency and the Administration to
avoid imposing unnecessary paperwork burdens on industry. To that end, the FAA has carefully considered all comments
on recordkeeping and has made every attempt to minimize the paperwork burden for carriers. For example, allowing
carriers to employ a single scheduling system for entire crews_pilots and flight attendants_will enable them to
avoid maintaining two separate duty schedules. Indeed, for many carriers, the FAA believes the final rule will create
little or no net additional paperwork.



Regulatory Evaluation Summary



The FAA has determined that this rule: (1) Is a significant regulatory action as defined in the Executive Order; (2)
is significant as defined in Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) would not constitute a barrier to international
trade. These analyses, summarized below, are available in the docket.



Cost-Benefit Analysis



Benefits

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00100 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The FAA expects the final rule to help ensure that flight attendants are rested and alert when performing emergency
and routine safety related duties and thereby reduce injuries and fatalities in air carrier accidents. However,
as in the NPRM, the FAA has not quantified the benefits associated with this rulemaking because there is a lack of accident/incident
data that can be used to directly correlate flight attendant fatigue with passenger fatalities and injuries. Instead,
the FAA has examined the potential benefits of this rulemaking from a qualitative perspective.



Increased Safety



The FAA received comments both supporting and opposing the correlation between flight attendant duty period limitations
and rest requirements and passenger safety. One commenter stated that fatigue increases during the work period,
and duty times that exceed 12 hours for domestic flights and 14 hours for international flights can be expected to potentially
derogate safety performance. Another commenter stated that the FAA has provided no sufficient foundation for concluding
that the absence of the proposed regulations constitutes a derogation of aviation safety, and that the absence of
any experience in which a flight safety problem was attributable to undue flight attendant fatigue is a strong argument
that no such problem exists.



FAA Response



The FAA agrees with commenters who stated that inadequate rest or excessive duty periods could derogate safety. However,
the commenters did not define acceptable or unacceptable levels of risk, and did not provide any justification for
the distinction. Because quantifiable data was not available, the FAA was unable to calculate the quantitative benefits
of the rule.

The FAA recognizes that inadequate rest periods for flight attendants could create a potential safety problem. Therefore,
the FAA expects that this final rule will ensure that flight attendants receive the opportunity to be rested and alert
when performing emergency and routine safety-related duties, thereby reducing passenger and crew injuries and
fatalities.



Increased Worker Productivity



The Coalition stated that, in addition to improving the safety of air travel, the regulatory evaluation should take
into account the cost savings from improved worker productivity. That commenter also stated that a careful review
of various studies would likely reveal that the benefits of more reasonable duty hours and adequate rest include decreased
absenteeism and health problems related to fatigue. The Allied Pilot Association stated that ``the welfare of regulated
employees ought to be one of the concerns of rulemakers.''



FAA Response



The FAA has examined the impact of improved worker productivity as it relates to safety and has determined that reduced
rest for flight attendants could impede flight attendant performance during emergency evacuations or during routine
safety duties requiring a high degree of alertness. Cost savings could result from improved worker productivity;
however, no information is available to quantify this benefit.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00101 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The change in duty hours coupled with adequate rest could decrease absenteeism and improve health. However, the information
needed to quantify this, is not currently available.

In addition, the FAA is concerned with passenger and crewmember safety, and is sensitive to crewmember health and
welfare. The FAA recognizes that employee health could improve if employees get more rest.



Costs



Cost estimates contained in this summary are based on 1993 dollars and are discounted at an annual effective rate of
7 percent. The FAA estimates that the cost to the air carrier industry of establishing flight attendant duty period
limitations and rest requirements will be $42.7 million over a 15-year period. The FAA expects that operators would
incur costs in the areas of recordkeeping and additional staffing.

Cost estimates for supplemental air carriers and scheduled major, national, and regional/commuter operators are
separated. The FAA estimates that the nondiscounted cost for all supplemental air carriers for the first year will
be approximately $2.5 million, and the annual nondiscounted cost for all supplemental carriers would be approximately
$2.23 million. The FAA estimates that the total discounted costs for supplemental air carriers over 15 years will
be approximately $20.8 million. The FAA estimates that the first-year nondiscounted cost for scheduled major, national,
and regional/commuter operators will be approximately $2.9 million, and the annual nondiscounted cost for these
operators would be approximately $1.2 million. The FAA estimates that the total discounted costs for scheduled major,
national, and regional/commuter over 15 years will be approximately $21.9 million. Therefore, over 15 years, the
discounted cost for the air carrier industry will be $42.7 million.

The above cost estimate is based on the assumption that air carriers must augment their flight attendant crews. In
some situations, augmentation under the flight attendant rule requirements may be avoided if an air carrier adopts
and applies to flight attendants, by option, the international, supplemental carrier pilot rules covering flight
and duty period.



Twenty-Four Consecutive-Hour Rest Period During any Seven Consecutive Days



Southwest Airlines stated that the requirement for 24 consecutive hours of rest during any 7 consecutive days would
make it necessary for the air carrier with which the commenter is affiliated to hire about 100 additional flight attendants
at a first-year cost of $710,000 and a subsequent annual cost of $600,000. A commenter representing Transport Workers
Union of America on behalf of Southwest Airlines flight attendants indicated that the proposed rule, if adopted,
would create a financial burden for flight attendants and their employers and would result in an average annual loss
of $11,063 in extra income for each flight attendant. This loss, projected for 2,200 flight attendants for 1 year,
would total $24 million in lost income.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00102 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

FAA Response



The requirement for 24 consecutive hours of rest in any 7 consecutive days is designed to supplement daily rest requirements
and to ensure that flight attendants receive the opportunity for adequate rest. The FAA did not verify lost flight
attendant income, because the annual loss of extra income to some flight attendants represents a gain to flight attendants
who would be hired. This income transfer is not considered a cost of this rulemaking.



Single Set of Duty Time Rules for Cabin and Flight Crew Members



Great American Airways stated that the total cost savings derived from implementing a single set of duty time rules
for its cabin and flight crewmembers, as opposed to adopting the rules proposed in the NPRM, would exceed $100,000
per year.



FAA Response



The FAA recognizes that giving operators the option to apply flight crewmember flights, duty, and rest requirements
to flight attendants may provide a cost savings to certain operators, particularly supplemental operators. The
FAA expects that the operators that choose the option will incur costs that are lower than those estimated in the final
regulatory evaluation.

However, the FAA recognizes that operators who choose to apply the flight crewmember regulations for duty limitations
and rest requirements must submit an application to the appropriate Flight Standards District Office for approval.
This is a minor, one-time cost, and the FAA assumes that operators who choose to incur this cost would do so because it
would obviate those operators from designing and establishing a tracking system for flight attendants. Instead,
this option would allow them to use whatever system is in place for flight crewmembers. The application process chosen
was selected deliberately out of concern that recordkeeping costs be kept to a minimum. That is, the FAA chose an application
process that is very familiar to carriers, the commonly-used procedure for changes to operations specifications.



Limiting Scheduled Duty Period to Fourteen Hours



Great American Airways stated that limiting scheduled flight attendant duty periods to 14 hours would force the air
carrier and other supplemental air carriers to add flight attendants at intermediate stops. The commenter stated
that, because company-required deadhead transportation would be considered part of a duty period under the FAA's
proposal, it would be necessary to schedule flight attendants for required rest after they completed a deadhead flight
segment and before they began the next duty period.

This commenter also stated that the proposed rules would impose substantially greater costs on supplemental air
carriers than other air carriers because supplemental air carriers rarely have travel privileges with scheduled
carriers, and, when they do, they are often very restrictive. Finally, this commenter stated that unanticipated
schedule and routing changes occur more frequently among charter operators than scheduled carriers and could severely
curtail the flexibility of supplemental air carriers.

<PARENT> FR940819-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

FAA Response



The FAA agrees that the greatest costs will be incurred by air carriers that schedule flight attendants for the longest
duty periods. However, the commenter does not appear to provide any information on the air carrier's ability to augment
existing crews. The FAA points out that costs could be minimized by using crew argumentation as a means of compliance.
In addition, time spent in deadhead transportation is not considered part of a duty period; therefore, an operator
is not required to provide a rest period for flight attendants following time spent in deadhead transportation.



Overall Costs



ATA stated that the FAA has understated costs considerably. This commenter stated that the annual cost of complying
with the proposed regulation would be at least $8.0 million. This cost would include programming expenses, additional
personnel costs, costs associated with extended layovers, and costs associated with reserve scheduling (assuming
that carrier reserve scheduling practices are not modified). Assuming a discount rate of 7.0 percent and an inflation
rate of 3.0 percent, the 15-year present value cost for the association's members would be approximately $88.9 million.



FAA Response



The survey of ATA members indicates that the annual cost would be at least $8.0 million. ATA stated that added annual
personnel costs for air carrier operators would be $4.0 million, additional meal/hotel expenses would be $1.5 million,
and additional reserve staffing would be $2.5 million. Finally, ATA stated that carriers can expect to incur a one-time
expense of between $2.0 million and $3.0 million for computer system program modifications. After contracting ATA
twice after the comment period closed to obtain clarifying information, the FAA concluded that their estimate could
not be used in its entirety because information such as the number of affected carriers, wage rates, additional employees
needed, or hours worked was not provided.

In addition, ATA did not provide information on the cost of augmenting the existing crew. The FAA permits longer duty
periods with the use of augmented crews. FAA data indicates that many flights are staffed with more than the minimum
flight attendant crew complement; therefore, little or no additional cost would be incurred to meet the crew argumentation
requirements.

ATA also stated that the 15-year present value cost for its members would be $88.9 million. This estimate assumed a
discount rate of 7.0 percent and an inflation rate of 3.0 percent. The basis for the commenter's estimate of the annual
cost ($8.0 million) was not detailed enough for the FAA to use it or the 15-year estimate derived from it.

The FAA has nevertheless attempted to develop an industry cost estimate by recalculating the ATA estimate to exclude
the ATA inflation factor and by accounting for the fact that ATA members only represent a portion of the industry that
would be affected. As shown in the Regulatory Evaluation, that figure would be $78.8 million. However, the original
information provided could not be fully substantiated, which suggests that the ATA estimate may not be representative
of the total industry.

Supplemental Carriers


The Coalition stated that the median flight attendant salary at supplemental air carriers is $18,461. The commenter
indicated that this estimate may be high because it represents the average salary at supplemental carriers that have
a collective bargaining agreement with their flight attendant workforce. The commenter also stated that the FAA
assumed that the rule would lead to the hiring of 6,000 flight attendants at supplemental carriers, and that the additional
cost for these new hires would be $1,107,600. The FAA received revised salary information from the commenter stating
that the average salary of a flight attendant working for a supplemental carrier is $24,552, which includes $6,092
in benefits.


FAA Response


The final regulatory evaluation assumes that, in the case of supplemental operators, each flight attendant works
150 duty periods, and that a carrier's cost per duty period is $163.68. Therefore, the cost of 6,000 additional duty
periods would be $982,100. To the extent practicable, this cost estimate for supplemental operations was used in
developing the final regulatory evaluation.


Irregular Operations


Delta Air Lines stated that the proposed rule would cause the air carrier to incur costs associated with irregular
operations. The air carrier estimated that it would have to hire 36 flight attendants at an annual salary cost of $1.3
million for irregular operations. Other costs associated with hiring additional flight attendants to meet the requirements
of the proposed rule, if adopted, would total $2.86 million in the initial year. The recurring annual cost of the proposed
rule, if adopted, would be nearly $2.5 million.
This commenter stated that, based on operations in June/July 1992 and January/February 1993, 62 flight attendants
working together did not meet the requirements of the NPRM and would require crew replacement. The commenter typically
schedules flight attendants for 3-day city pairings with an average flight attendant crew of six. Because most of
the replacements that were needed were on domestic flights, the commenter used an average of four flight attendants.
These results showed that 744 additional duty days would be required. The commenter calculated that an additional
36 flight attendants would be needed because a reserve flight attendant is available to fly an average of 20.5 days
per month. Given an average monthly salary of almost $2,500, plus monthly hotel, meal, and transportation expenses
of almost $650 for irregular operations, the cost for a flight attendant would be about $3,100 per month, or $1.3 million
annually.
The commenter also stated that they do not have a deplaning period. That is, pay and expenses cease at the block-in time
of the last flight in the duty period for the trip. This commenter calculates that the cost of a 15-minute deplaning
period would result in the hiring of 20 additional flight attendants. The cost would amount to $749,000 annually.
Finally, the commenter provided information documenting the carrier's one-time cost of computer software changes,
including recordkeeping. The only additional information is that the cost of programming and testing per man-hour
is $40.


FAA Response


The FAA received clarification from the commenter stating that ``An Ad Hoc Computer Program was developed to search
through our crew tracking systems to identify irregular operations that had occurred that would have required crew
replacement under the NPRM.'' The commenter also stated that the NPRM ``Would require crew replacement.'' Finally,
the commenter stated that they used an average crew of four flight attendants in their calculations, which implies
that they were replacing their existing crew. This leads the FAA to assume that the commenter did not consider crew
augmentation. However, the FAA did use some of the salary and cost data provided by the commenter.
With regard to hiring additional flight attendants for a 15-minute deplaning period, the FAA notes that there is no
new requirement in this rule concerning deplaning; deplaning of the aircraft is a current requirement.


Small Operators


Sun Country Airlines operates a fleet of 10 aircraft with 520 employees, 170 of whom are flight attendants. Based on
1992 operations, the proposed rule would have required the commenter to hire 34 additional flight attendants, which
would have increased operating costs (i.e., salaries, benefits, costs of training, hotels, meals, deadhead travel,
and general administrative overhead) by $2.6 million in 1992. However, this air carrier stated that, by applying
crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants, the air carrier would need to employ 20 additional
flight attendants rather than 34 additional flight attendants, with increased operating costs of $1.75 million
rather than $2.6 million. However, these lower costs still exceeded the entire 1992 new profit for this carrier.
The Regional Airline Association stated that the proposed rule would either require an additional jump seat in the
cabin for which there is insufficient space or it would require that a passenger seat be set aside for the additional
flight attendant. This commenter stated that daily or routine loss of a revenue seat on a fleet of regional aircraft
with 20 to 50 seats would be enormous. It also pointed out the added costs associated of layover lodging, meals, and
per diem, and the significant incremental weight of an added crewmember.
The National Air Carrier Association stated that the proposed rule would impose costs of approximately $372,000
in additional flight attendant staffing, and approximately $50,000 in recordkeeping.


FAA Response


The FAA received additional clarification from Sun Country indicating that the proposed rule would cost $2.6 million.
The annual cost to deadhead flight attendants to their domicile would be $832,000. In addition, hotel accommodations
would be $842,000, added per diem cost would be $308,000, initial and recurrent training would be $10,200, and administrative
costs would be $58,000. Because this commenter does not have any interline agreements, it would have to pay the added
costs for deadhead tickets. This commenter estimated that these costs would be $579,000.
Based upon this cost estimate, the cost per added flight attendant would be about $76,500 per flight attendant ($2.6
million divided by 34 additional flight attendants). If this commenter did not have to incur the costs for deadhead
tickets, then the added cost would be $60,300 per flight attendant.

The commenter also provided information stating that the annual cost of applying the part 121 supplemental carrier
pilot flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants would be $1.75 million. The added cost of 20 flight
attendants would be $489,000. Hotel expenses would be $679,000; per diem costs would be $244,000; training would
cost $6,000; and administrative costs would be $34,000. Finally, the annual cost of deadheading flight attendants
back to their place of domicile would be $289,000.

Based upon their total cost estimate, the cost per added flight attendant would be $1.75 million divided by 20 additional
flight attendants, or about $87,000 per flight attendant. If this commenter did not have to incur the costs for deadhead
tickets, then the added cost would be $72,600 per flight attendant.

The FAA contends that these cost estimates represent the costs associated with replacing the existing crew. The cost
estimates do not appear to represent the costs associated with augmenting the existing crew with additional flight
attendants. An air carrier whose goal is profit maximization and cost minimization would choose the least costly
means of achieving compliance with the proposed rule, and, in most cases, that appears to be the crew augmentation
option.

RAA asserted that the final rule would impose costs based on the fact that some aircraft would fly longer than 14 hours
and full. The FAA contacted this commenter and asked a clarifying question on the number of times that an aircraft would
fly more than 14 hours full. The commenter was unable to provide information to substantiate this assertion, and therefore,
while a problem may exist, the FAA is unable to determine the magnitude of it.

The FAA received additional information from a NACA member (American Trans Air) stating that, to calculate annual
costs, they multiplied the average number of block hours in the fleet by the percentage of flight hours the NPRM is expected
to affect. The product is the total number of affected block hours.

The number of affected block hours was then divided by the expected number of flight attendant utilization hours,
which varies by aircraft type, and multiplied by the number of flight attendants to compute crew requirements. Based
on this calculation, 20 additional flight attendants would be needed to meet the requirements of the proposed rule.
This commenter then multiplied the number of additional flight attendants by their annual salary, including fringe
benefits and training, to arrive at a cost estimate of $372,000. Administrative costs of $80,000 were added. 

The FAA received additional clarification that the percentage of flight hours was based upon the commenter's examination
of all flights that exceeded 14 hours. The commenter did not look at flights of 14 to 16 hours, 16 to 18 hours, or 18 to 20
hours.

The commenter divided the number of affected block hours by the expected flight attendant utilization hours (Boeing
727, 60 hours; Boeing 757 and Lockheed L-1011, 56 hours). The commenter did not know how many duty periods this
represented. After multiplying this number by the number of flight attendants needed to complete crew requirements,
the commenter concluded that 20 additional flight attendants would be needed to augment its flights.

The $13,000 annual salary represents a flight attendant's first-year salary without overtime. The 20 percent benefits
estimate represents the company's portion of employee benefits.

To the extent practicable, the cost information provided by commenters was used to revise the cost estimates in the
final regulatory evaluation.



Recordkeeping Costs



Several commenters provided the FAA with information on recordkeeping. The Air Transport Association estimated
that air carriers would incur a one-time expense for computer system program modifications of $2.0 million to $3.0
million. Delta Air Lines stated that the one-time cost of software computer changes, including recordkeeping, would
be $367,200. American Trans Air, a member of the National Air Carrier Association, stated that administrative costs
would be $80,000, approximately $54,000 of which would be the cost to program and upgrade software, and $26,000 of
which would be the cost of data entry and associated labor.



FAA Response



Because of limited supporting documentation, a wide variation between commenters' estimates, and the difficulty
of ascertaining what portion of the recordkeeping costs could be attributed to the implementation of this final rule
versus the cost to upgrade current systems, the FAA stands by its original recordkeeping cost estimate.



Summary of Benefits and Costs



The FAA estimates that the cost of compliance with the requirements of this final rule will be $42.7 million, discounted.

Although benefits cannot be quantified, the FAA concludes that the establishment of flight attendant duty period
limitations and rest requirements are warranted, because they will contribute to an overall enhancement of transport
category airplane safety and utility that will both promote and enhance the U.S. air transportation system.



Final Regulatory Flexibility Determination



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by Federal regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if
a proposed rule would have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order
2100.14A outlines FAA's procedures and criteria for implementing the RFA.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00106 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The fleet size for an operator of aircraft for hire to be considered a small entity is nine or fewer aircraft. The threshold
annualized cost levels for operators of aircraft for hire in 1993 dollars are $117,800 for scheduled operators whose
fleets have aircraft with seating capacities of more than 60, $67,000 for scheduled operators whose fleets have aircraft
with seating capacities of 60 or less (other scheduled operators), and $4,570 for unscheduled operators. The proposals
in the NPRM would affect air carriers that provide passenger-carrying operations in aircraft for which flight attendants
are required. Other types of aviation companies would not be affected. A ``substantial number'' of small entities
is a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one-third of the small entities subject to this rule.

According to FAA records of small entity air carriers that provide passenger-carrying operations in aircraft that
require flight attendants, there are 23 part 125 and 135 operators that could be affected by the final rule. Of these
23 operators, 7 are part 121/135 operators, 12 are part 125 operators, and 4 are part 135 operators. The affected operators
are those with nine or fewer aircraft. At least one of the aircraft that they own have a seating configuration of more
than 19 as described in either  125.269 or  135.107 and therefore would have at least one flight attendant
on board. There are also 8 part 121 operators that would be affected by the final rule. In July 1993, there were a total
of 25 part 121/135 operators, 39 part 125 operators, and 3,040 part 135 operators. There are also more than 100 part
121 operators. The number of carriers that could be affected by the rule does not exceed one-third of the total number
of carriers in any of the four categories of operators (parts 121, 121/125, 125 and 135). The FAA has therefore determined
that a regulatory flexibility analysis is not necessary.



International Trade Impact Statement



This final rule would not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American goods and
services to foreign countries and the import of foreign goods and services into the United States.

The FAA has determined that the amendments to parts 121 and 135 will not have a significant impact on international
trade. The final rule is not expected to have an impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas
or foreign firms doing business in the United States. This finding is based in large part upon the review of foreign
civil aviation regulations governing flight attendant flight and duty time practices and minimum rest requirements
found in the Industry Study as well as information supplied by commenters to the public docket.

The Industry Study review shows that 23 countries, including Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, the Netherlands,
France, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and West Germany, have government regulations on flight attendant
flight and duty times and rest periods.

The comment provided by the Flight Attendants states that the European Community, through its Joint Aviation Authority
(JAA) ``is poised to issue flight attendant duty time and rest provisions which would be based on state of the art research
concerning work schedules and fatigue.'' They state that the JAA rule would base duty time and rest limits on the time
of departure and the number of segments flown.

On the other hand, the Industry Study noted that 24 countries, including Australia, Canada, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Japan, and Mexico, do not regulate flight attendant work time.

The FAA concludes that there are many countries with flight attendant flight and duty times and rest periods and many
countries without these regulations. Second, many firms in the United States appear to be already in compliance or
near compliance with the final regulation. Therefore, the FAA has determined that the amendments to parts 121, 125,
and 135, will not have a significant impact on international trade.



Federalism Implications



The regulation herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national
government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation will not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Conclusion



For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the FAA has determined that this regulation is a significant regulatory
action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the rule is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures. However, the FAA has determined that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact,
positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities or on international trade. A final regulatory evaluation
of the regulation, including a final Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Analysis,
has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under

Flight attendant

 means an individual, other than a flight crewmember, who is assigned by a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier
or commercial operator, in accordance with the required minimum crew complement under the certificate holder's
operations specifications or in addition to that minimum complement, to duty in an aircraft during flight time and
whose duties include but are not necessarily limited to cabin-safety-related responsibilities.



Rest period

 means the period free of all restraint or duty for a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator
and free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion arise.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial
operator may assign a duty period to a flight attendant only when the applicable duty period limitations and rest requirements
of this paragraph are met.

(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, no domestic, flag, or supplemental
air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a flight attendant scheduled to a duty period of 14 hours
or less as provided under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be given a scheduled rest period of at least 9 consecutive
hours. This rest period must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the
subsequent duty period.

(3) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be scheduled or reduced to 8 consecutive hours
if the flight attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours; this subsequent rest
period must be scheduled to begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest period and must occur
between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.

(4) A domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled
duty period of more than 14 hours, but no more than 16 hours, if the air carrier or commercial operator has assigned to
the flight or flights in that duty period at least one flight attendant in addition to the minimum flight attendant
complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the air carrier's or the commercial operator's
operations specifications.

(5) A domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled
duty period of more than 16 hours, but no more than 18 hours, if the air carrier or commercial operator has assigned to
the flight or flights in that duty period at least two flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant
complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the air carrier's or the commercial operator's
operations specifications.


(6) A domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled
duty period of more than 18 hours, but no more than 20 hours, if the scheduled duty period includes one or more flights
that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, and if the air carrier or commercial
operator has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least three flight attendants in addition to the
minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the domestic air
carrier's or the commercial operator's operations specifications.

(7) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a flight attendant scheduled to a duty period of more than
14 hours but no more than 20 hours, as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, must be given
a scheduled rest period of at least 12 consecutive hours. This rest period must occur between the completion of the
scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.

(8) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(7) of this section may be scheduled or reduced to 10 consecutive hours
if the flight attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 14 consecutive hours; this subsequent rest
period must be scheduled to begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest period and must occur
between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.

(9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, if a domestic, flag, or supplemental
air carrier or commercial operator elects to reduce the rest period to 10 hours as authorized by paragraph (b)(8) of
this section, the air carrier or commercial operator may not schedule a flight attendant for a duty period of more than
14 hours during the 24-hour period commencing after the beginning of the reduced rest period.

(10) No domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant any duty
period with the air carrier or commercial operator unless the flight attendant has had at least the minimum rest required
under this section.

(11) No domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant to perform
any duty with the air carrier or operator during any required rest period.

(12) Time spent in transportation, not local in character, that a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial
operator requires of a flight attendant and provides to transport the flight attendant to an airport at which that
flight attendant is to serve on a flight as a crewmember, or from an airport at which the flight attendant was relieved
from duty to return to the flight attendant's home station, is not considered part of a rest period.

(13) Each domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier must relieve each flight attendant engaged in air transportation
and each commercial operator must relieve each flight attendant engaged in air commerce from all further duty for
at least 24 consecutive hours during any 7 consecutive calendar days.

(14) A flight attendant is not considered to be scheduled for duty in excess of duty period limitations if the flights
to which the flight attendant is assigned are scheduled and normally terminate within the limitations but due to circumstances
beyond the control of the domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator (such as adverse weather
conditions) are not at the time of departure expected to reach their destination within the scheduled time.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator
may apply the flight crewmember flight time and duty limitations and rest requirements of this part to flight attendants
for all operations conducted under this part provided that_
(1) The certificate holder establishes written procedures that_
(i) Apply to all flight attendants used in the certificate holder's operation;
(ii) Include the flight crewmember requirements contained in subparts Q, R, or S of this part, as appropriate to the
operation being conducted, except that rest facilities on board the aircraft are not required;
(iii) Include provisions to add one flight attendant to the minimum flight attendant complement for each flight crewmember
who is in excess of the minimum number required in the aircraft type certificate data sheet and who is assigned to the
aircraft under the provisions of subparts Q, R, and S, as applicable, of this part;
(iv) Are approved by the Administrator and are described or referenced in the certificate holder's operations specifications;
and
(2) Whenever the Administrator finds that revisions are necessary for the continued adequacy of the written procedures
that are required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section and that had been granted final approval, the certificate holder
must, after notification by the Administrator, make any changes in the procedures that are found necessary by the
Administrator. Within 30 days after the certificate holder receives such notice, it may file a petition to reconsider
the notice with the FAA Flight Standards District Office that is charged with the overall inspection of the certificate
holder's operations. The filing of a petition to reconsider stays the notice, pending decision by the Administrator.
However, if the Administrator finds that an emergency requires immediate action in the interest of safety, the Administrator
may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a change effective without stay.
5. Section 121.683 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(1) to read as follows:

read as follows:



 135.261 

Applicability.



Sections 135.263 through 135.273 of this part prescribe flight time limitations, duty period limitations, and rest
requirements for operations conducted under this part as follows:



* * * * *



(e) Section 135.273 prescribes duty period limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants in all operations
conducted under this part.

12. Section 135.273 is added to Subpart F to read as follows:



 135.273 

Duty period limitations and rest time requirements.



(a) For purposes of this section_



Calendar day

 means the period of elapsed time, using Coordinated Universal Time or local time, that begins at midnight and ends
24 hours later at the next midnight.



Duty period

 means the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving flight time and release from that assignment
by the certificate holder. The time is calculated using either Coordinated Universal Time or local time to reflect
the total elapsed time.



Flight attendant

 means an individual, other than a flight crewmember, who is assigned by the certificate holder, in accordance with
the required minimum crew complement under the certificate holder's operations specifications or in addition to
that minimum complement, to duty in an aircraft during flight time and whose duties include but are not necessarily
limited to cabin-safety-related responsibilities.



Rest period

 means the period free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion arise.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a certificate holder may assign a duty period to a flight attendant
only when the applicable duty period limitations and rest requirements of this paragraph are met.

(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, no certificate holder may assign
a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a flight attendant scheduled to a duty period of 14 hours
or less as provided under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be given a scheduled rest period of at least 9 consecutive
hours. This rest period must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the
subsequent duty period.

<TEXT>
 

(3) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be scheduled or reduced to 8 consecutive hours
if the flight attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours; this subsequent rest
period must be scheduled to begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest period and must occur
between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.





(4) A certificate holder may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours, but no more than
16 hours, if the certificate holder has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least one flight attendant
in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under
the certificate holder's operations specifications.





(5) A certificate holder may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 16 hours, but no more than
18 hours, if the certificate holder has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least two flight attendants
in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under
the certificate holder's operations specifications.

(6) A certificate holder may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 18 hours, but no more than
20 hours, if the scheduled duty period includes one or more flights that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states
and the District of Columbia, and if the certificate holder has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period
at least three flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or
flights in that duty period under the certificate holder's operations specifications.



(7) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a flight attendant scheduled to a duty period of more than
14 hours but no more than 20 hours, as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, must be given
a scheduled rest period of at least 12 consecutive hours. This rest period must occur between the completion of the
scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.



(8) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(7) of this section may be scheduled or reduced to 10 consecutive hours
if the flight attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 14 consecutive hours; this subsequent rest
period must be scheduled to begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest period and must occur
between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.







(9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, if a certificate holder elects to reduce
the rest period to 10 hours as authorized by paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the certificate holder may not schedule
a flight attendant for a duty period of more than 14 hours during the 24-hour period commencing after the beginning
of the reduced rest period.

(10) No certificate holder may assign a flight attendant any duty period with the certificate holder unless the flight
attendant has had at least the minimum rest required under this section.
(11) No certificate holder may assign a flight attendant to perform any duty with the certificate holder during any
required rest period.
(12) Time spent in transportation, not local in character, that a certificate holder requires of a flight attendant
and provides to transport the flight attendant to an airport at which that flight attendant is to serve on a flight as
a crewmember, or from an airport at which the flight attendant was relieved from duty to return to the flight attendant's
home station, is not considered part of a rest period.
(13) Each certificate holder must relieve each flight attendant engaged in air transportation from all further duty
for at least 24 consecutive hours during any 7 consecutive calendar days.
(14) A flight attendant is not considered to be scheduled for duty in excess of duty period limitations if the flights
to which the flight attendant is assigned are scheduled and normally terminate within the limitations but due to circumstances
beyond the control of the certificate holder (such as adverse weather conditions) are not at the time of departure
expected to reach their destination within the scheduled time.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, a certificate holder may apply the flight crewmember flight time
and duty limitations and rest requirements of this part to flight attendants for all operations conducted under this
part provided that_
(1) The certificate holder establishes written procedures that_
(i) Apply to all flight attendants used in the certificate holder's operation;
(ii) Include the flight crewmember requirements contained in subpart F of this part, as appropriate to the operation
being conducted, except that rest facilities on board the aircraft are not required; and
(iii) Include provisions to add one flight attendant to the minimum flight attendant complement for each flight crewmember
who is in excess of the minimum number required in the aircraft type certificate data sheet and who is assigned to the
aircraft under the provisions of subpart F of this part, as applicable.
(iv) Are approved by the Administrator and described or referenced in the certificate holder's operations specifications;
and
(2) Whenever the Administrator finds that revisions are necessary for the continued adequacy of duty period limitation
and rest requirement procedures that are required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section and that had been granted final
approval, the certificate holder must, after notification by the Administrator, make any changes in the procedures
that are found necessary by the Administrator. Within 30 days after the certificate holder receives such notice,
it may file a petition to reconsider the notice with the FAA Flight Standards District Office that is charged with the
overall inspection of the certificate holder's operations. The filing of a petition to reconsider stays the notice,
pending decision by the Administrator. However, if the Administrator finds that there is an emergency that requires
immediate action in the interest of safety, the Administrator may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a change
effective without stay.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Transportation is making a series 
of minor or technical amendments to its drug and alcohol 
testing procedures. The most significant of these include 
revising the initial test cutoff level for marijuana 
metabolites, changing split specimen collection procedures to 
be consistent with those of the Department of Health and 
Human Services, revising the temperature range for urine drug 
specimens, revising the drug testing custody and control form 
and modifying the alcohol testing form, clarifying laboratory 
reporting procedures to consortiums, deleting a requirement 
for a second ``air blank'' after alcohol confirmation tests, 
specifying procedures related to the display of the 
sequential number for alcohol tests, and clarifying chain of 
custody requirements. The changes have the purposes of 
updating the procedures to be consistent with Department of 
Health and Human Services guidelines and addressing 
implementation problems of which the Department has become 
aware.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department is publishing this final rule to make several minor or technical amendments to its drug and alcohol
testing procedures, 49 CFR Part 40. The changes to Part 40 are described below. The changes are intended, among other
things, to conform Part 40 to a number of provisions in the recently revised Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) guidelines (59 FR 29908; June 9, 1994) and to correct a misinterpretation of the Department's chain of custody
requirements. The Department is seeking comments on these amendments and will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 responding to comments received including, if appropriate, any changes to the amendments based on the comments.


The Drug Testing Custody and Control Form


As the result of a lengthy process of consultation among the Department of Transportation, the Department of Health
and Human Services (DHHS), and other interested parties, the Department has made modifications to the drug testing
custody and control form. This form will be used in Federal employee testing as well as testing under DOT rules. The
form is reproduced in Appendix A. OMB has approved the form under the Paperwork Reduction Act.
Under the current rule, program participants have had the discretion to modify the drug testing custody and control
form, as long as the contents of the form met the requirements of the regulatory text describing the form in  40.23(a).
In the Department's experience, this has led to a proliferation of different forms, with consequent confusion and
increased probability of error. In the alcohol testing procedures, we required employers to use the Department's
alcohol testing form without modification. Now that we have an improved drug testing custody and control form, we
believe that it should be used universally in the program, without exception and without modification. For this reason,
we are amending  40.23 to delete the regulatory text description of the form (which is no longer needed, since
everyone would be using exactly the form printed in Appendix A) and to require participants in the program to use the
Department's form without modification.
We recognize that participants have stocks of existing forms. To provide participants a reasonable time to exhaust
these stocks and begin to obtain new forms, this amendment will not be made effective until February 16, 1995. In addition,
we are providing 60 days for interested persons to comment on this amendment (i.e., on the requirement to use the form
without modification, not on the content or format of the form itself). Employers and other participants are authorized
to use the new form immediately. We believe it would be very useful for those employers who must begin split sample testing
on August 15, 1994, to begin using the new form as soon as possible, since we believe the new form is better suited to split
sample testing than its predecessors.
We emphasize that seven-part forms must be used in all cases for split samples. Older seven-part split sample forms
may continue to be used during the six month transition period (six-part forms may 

never

 be used in split sample testing). After that, the new seven-part form must be used. RSPA and Coast Guard employers who
choose to use 

single

 sample collection may continue to use old six-part forms during the six month transition period, and thereafter must
use the new form, discarding copy three.


The Alcohol Testing Form and Log Book


Currently, Copy 1 of the Alcohol Testing Form (the original) is designated as the breath alcohol technician's (BAT's)
copy of the form, for which there is no record retention requirement stated. Copy 3 is designated the employer's copy,
which the employer must retain. It makes more sense, in our view, for the original of the form to be retained by the employer,
rather than a copy. Consequently, we are switching the form designations, so that Copy 1 will be the employer's copy
and Copy 3 will be the BAT's copy. The statement to be signed by the employee in Step 4 of the form is reworded slightly
to emphasize the employee's agreement that the test reflected on the form is the test that the employee took and that
the result is recorded accurately.

In  40.59(c), in the context of the discussion of the log book, the rule requires the notation of the ``quantified
test result.'' The Department intends that this result be the numerical result displayed by the EBT. The term has the
same meaning as the term ``result displayed on the EBT'' elsewhere in the rule (e.g.,  40.63(d)(1)(i)), and
we are changing the term for the sake of consistency.


Clarification of Reference to NHTSA CPL in Definition of ``EBT''


The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Conforming Products List (CPL) for Evidential Breath
Testing Devices (EBTs) includes both devices that meet September 1993 amendments to NHTSA's model specifications
and devices that meet only the previous version of the model specifications. Only those devices on the CPL that meet
the September 1993 model specifications may be used in the DOT alcohol testing program. Other devices on the CPL (those
designated by an asterisk on the published CPL; see for instance 59 FR 18840 (April 20, 1994)) are not authorized for
use in DOT-mandated alcohol testing programs. We are adding a reference to the September 1993 model specifications
in the definition of ``EBT'' in  40.3 to clarify this point.


Split Sample Collection Procedures


The Department's procedures for collecting split samples for drug testing direct the collection site person to pour
the urine from a collection container into one or two specimen bottles (depending on the collection method used).
Some concern has been raised that this requirement would preclude the use of newer technologies that would subdivide
a specimen into a primary and a split specimen without the necessity of a collection site person physically pouring
the urine from one vessel into another. The Department does not intend its procedures to preclude the use of such methods
or systems, as long as they result in primary and split samples that can be transmitted to laboratories and tested in
ways that fully comply with Part 40 requirements. We have added language to this effect. The Department does not endorse
drug testing products, and this change should not be construed as an endorsement of any particular product.
In using whichever of the authorized methods of collecting split samples, the Department advises collectors that
we believe the preferred practice is to have temperature strips attached to the collection container, which can reduce
the time lag in checking the temperature and reduce the likelihood of errors or delays. The temperature should be read,
of course, from the collection container itself, rather than from another bottle into which the split specimen may
be poured.
Section 40.25(f)(10)(ii)(C) of the Department's current regulation describes one of the alternative split specimen
collection procedures. In this procedure, a single specimen bottle is used as the collection container. The collection
site person pours 30 ml of the urine from this container into a second specimen bottle, which is then used as the primary
specimen. The urine remaining in the collection container becomes the split specimen. When DHHS published its revised
drug testing guidelines, however, DHHS provided that, in this situation, the collection site person would pour 15
ml of the urine into the second bottle, to be used as the split specimen, with 30 ml remaining in the collection container,
to be used as the primary specimen. In other words, the DHHS procedure was the reverse of the one we issued in February.
While there are advantages to the procedure in the current Part 40, we believe, on balance, that it is more important
that the DHHS guidelines and Part 40 be consistent on this point. Consequently, we are changing our procedures to conform
with those of DHHS.


Change in Temperature Range

The revised DHHS guidelines modify the temperature range 
within which a specimen must fall in order to avoid creating 
a reason to believe that a urine specimen has been altered or 
substituted. The old range is 32.5-37.7C/90.5-99.8F. The 
new range is 32-38C/90-100F. Part 40 references are being 
changed to conform with the DHHS revision. 



Clarification of Chain of Custody Requirement 



Section 40.25 contains a number of references to use of 
chain of custody documentation in the handling and 
transportation of urine specimens. Recently, an arbitrator 
misinterpreted these provisions, determining that a chain of 
custody was invalid, and that the test must be canceled, 
because persons involved solely in the transportation of the 
intact shipping container did not make a chain of custody 
entry. This interpretation is contrary to Part 40 
procedures, wholly unnecessary in order to preserve the 
integrity of the process, and, if followed, would result in a 
wholesale disruption of the DOT testing program. As DHHS 
recently pointed out in its revised drug testing guidelines, 
``Since specimens are sealed in packages that would indicate 
any tampering during transit to the laboratory and couriers, 
express carriers, and postal service personnel do not have 
access to the chain of custody forms, there is no requirement 
that such personnel document chain of custody for the package 
during transit.'' 

The Department interprets its 

existing 

regulatory 
provisions as not requiring couriers, postal employees, and 
other personnel involved in the transportation of urine 
specimens to make chain of custody form entries. Likewise, 
the Department interprets its 

existing 

rules as not requiring 
making entries on the chain of custody form when a sealed 
shipping container is put into or removed from temporary, 
secure storage. In present  40.25(c), for example, handling 
or transportation of a specimen from one ``place'' to another 
must be accomplished through chain of custody procedures. 
The Department interprets this as meaning that as long as 
there is an entry from an individual authorized to release 
the specimen from the collection site ( ``Place'' 

#

1) and 
another from an individual authorized to receive it on behalf 
of the laboratory (``Place'' 

#

2), the persons who perform 
intervening, ministerial transportation services (e.g., 
couriers, truck drivers, airplane pilots, postal service 
employees, mail room employees) need not make such entries. 

Present paragraph 40.25(h) authorizes chain of custody 
documentation to be ``enclosed'' in the shipping container for 
shipment to the laboratory. This container is sealed with 
tamper-evident tape. As a program matter, the Department 
recommends enclosing chain of custody documentation in the 
shipping container, as opposed to attaching it to the 
exterior of the container, since this minimizes the 
likelihood of loss of or damage to the documents. 
Interpreting the rule to require persons performing 
intervening transportation services to make chain of custody 
entries would nullify this important provision of the rule. 
In order to make chain of custody entries, intervening 
transportation personnel would have to break the 
tamper-evident seal, dig out the documentation, make an 
entry, reinsert the documentation, and re-seal the container. 
Of course, a shipping container with a seal that had been 
broken and re-sealed a number of times would make it 
unlikely, if not impossible, for a valid test to be conducted 
of the specimen it contained. The Department could not 
interpret its regulations to create such an absurd result. 

Present  40.25 (k) directs the use of a chain of custody 
form ``from the point of collection to the final disposition 
of the specimen.'' This provision directs that every 
individual ``in the chain'' be identified. Unlike authorized 
collection site and laboratory personnel, who actually handle 
the specimen, intervening transportation personnel are not, 
properly speaking, ``in the chain'' at all, a point which the 
Department has understood to be consistent with long-standing 
case law in a variety of contexts. Consequently, the 
Department never understood or intended this language to 
require that intervening transportation personnel make chain 
of custody entries. 

A related issue, raised in the same arbitration 
decision, concerns temporary secure storage. That is, a 
collection site person conducts the test, fills out the 
custody and control form, places the specimen and form in a 
sealed shipping container, and places the container in 
secure, temporary storage at the collection site, where a 
courier picks it up subsequently for transportation to the 
laboratory. Again, any tampering would be revealed by the 
tamper-evident seal. Here, too, requiring an entry in the 
chain of custody for putting the package into and removing it 
from the temporary secure storage is unnecessary and 
disruptive. Alternatives, such as not sealing the chain of 
custody documentation in the shipping container until 
immediately before pickup, or attaching the chain of custody 
documentation to the outside of the shipping container when 
it is ready for pickup, multiply the possibilities for error. 
We emphasize that the collector should, as a matter of good 
practice, document in its own records the times at which 
sealed shipping containers are put into and removed from 
temporary secure storage. 

Notwithstanding the Department's reasonable construction 
of its existing regulatory language, which has been 
communicated in the past to persons raising the question, at 
least one arbitrator did misinterpret these provisions. To 
prevent the possibility of any such mistakes in the future, 
the Department it taking this opportunity to clarify its 
regulations. To this end, we are adding language very 
similar to that of DHHS to  40.25 (c), (h), and (k), as well 
as an additional sentence that strongly emphasizes and 
underlines that chains of custody need not include entries 
from such personnel in order to be valid. In addition, the 
amendments to these paragraphs make clear that the absence of 
entries in the chain of custody relating to the putting the 
package into or retrieving it from temporary secure storage 
of the collection site does not invalidate the chain of 
custody. 

The Department is making this amendment effective 
immediately, because it is essential to protect DOT drug 
testing procedures from misinterpretations that, if 
followed, could invalidate virtually all chains of custody 
for DOT drug tests, even though they follow Part 40 
requirements. This necessity constitutes the good cause 
required by the Administrative Procedure Act to make a 
regulation effective without the normal 30-day effective 
date. 



Untestable, Inadequate, or Unavailable Split Specimens 



In split sample testing, there could be situations in 
which the primary specimen reaches the laboratory unscathed, 
but the split specimen does not. Instead, the split specimen 
is untestable, inadequate, or unavailable. For example, the 
split specimen container may have leaked, leaving an 
inadequate amount of urine for testing. What is a 
laboratory to do? To answer this question, which the 
Department has been asked on a number of occasions, we are 
adding a paragraph to  40.29. The paragraph directs the 
laboratory to go ahead and test the primary specimen in the 
usual way. The laboratory then sends the result of the test 
of the primary specimen to the MRO in the usual way. If the 
test result from the laboratory was a confirmed positive, and 
the MRO verifies the result as positive, then the employee 
has 72 hours to request a test of the split specimen. If 
the employee does so, the MRO will pass the request on to the 
laboratory. It is only at this point, and not before, that 
the laboratory informs the MRO that the split specimen is 
untestable, inadequate, or unavailable. The MRO would then 
cancel the test. This approach is consistent with existing 
DOT guidance and the DHHS guidelines.

<DOCNO> FR940819-0-00117 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The vast majority of tests of primary specimens have 
negative results. Of those that test positive, a portion are 
verified negative by MROs. Of those verified positive by 
MROs, not all will result in a timely request by the employee 
for a test of the split specimen. In view of these facts, it 
would be counterproductive for the laboratory to reject an 
otherwise testable primary specimen because the split 
specimen was unavailable, inadequate, or untestable. Nor 
would it be cost-effective for the laboratory to notify the 
MRO of the problem with the split specimen at an earlier 
stage of the process, which could result in the cancellation 
of tests that may otherwise stand up. There is no loss of 
protection to the employee, who will be in no worse position 
than if there was a testable split specimen. As a general 
matter, employers using split sample collection should not, 
as a matter of prudence, take irrevocable action (e.g., 
terminate, as opposed to suspend) against an employee until 
the result of the split specimen is available. 

Split specimens may become unavailable for testing at 
other stages of the process (e.g., the receiving laboratory 
mishandles or loses the split specimen in storage, the split 
specimen is lost in transit between the receiving laboratory 
and the second laboratory which would analyze the split). In 
all these cases, the same rule applies. The MRO is not 
notified of the unavailability, inadequacy, or untestability 
of the split specimen unless and until there is a verified 
positive test and the employee has made a timely request for 
a test of the split specimen. 



Reduction of Marijuana Initial Test Level 



In its June 9, 1994, revision to its drug testing 
guidelines, DHHS reduced the initial test level for marijuana 
metabolites from 100 ng/ml to 50 ng/ml. This rule changes 
the initial test level for marijuana in Part 40 to conform 
with the revised DHHS guidelines. This change is consistent 
with the existing language of  40.29(e)(2), which states that 
the initial test levels for drugs are subject to change by 
DHHS. Since the new DHHS guidelines go into effect September 
1, 1994, this provision will be effective on that date, so 
that DHHS and DOT testing level requirements remain 
consistent with one another. 



Methamphetamine Levels 



The Department is also adding to the chart in this 
section showing confirmation test levels a new footnote 3, 
stating that, to be confirmed positive, a specimen containing 
methamphetamine must also contain amphetamine at a 
concentration equal to or greater than 200 ng/ml. This 
footnote is also added to be consistent with the revised DHHS 
guidelines. 



Reports to Employers and Consortia 



Section 40.29(g)(6), concerning monthly statistical 
summary reports from laboratories to employers, has been the 
subject of some confusion since it does not specify the role 
of consortia in the reporting chain. Laboratories had 
expressed concern that they were not authorized, by the 
present language of the paragraph, to provide these reports 
to a consortium instead of to individual employers. The 
Department is revising this paragraph to clarify this 
matter. Suppose a laboratory tests specimens originating 
with employers 1-100, all of whom are part of Consortium X. 
The laboratory may send its report summary only to 
Consortium X, rather than sending 100 single reports to each 
of the employers. However, the data provided to Consortium 
X must include employer-specific information for each of the 
employers and, within 14 days of receiving the laboratory 
report, Consortium X is responsible for sending the 
employer-specific data to each of the 100 employers. When, 
as provided in the last sentence of  40.29(g)(6), 
employer-specific data is withheld because no testing 
pertinent to the employer was held, or because release of 
the data would permit inferences about individual employees' 
identity, the written reports concerning the withholding of 
the data may also be provided to the employer via the 
consortium, through the mechanism described above. 



MRO Conflicts of Interest 



In its revised guidelines, DHHS has added a new 
provision prohibiting relationships between laboratories and 
medical review officers (MROs) that could have the reality 
or create the appearance of a conflict of interest. DHHS 
added this provision in the belief, with which DOT concurs, 
that any such relationship that could be construed as a 
conflict of interest may be sufficient to undermine the 
integrity of the program. For this reason and to remain 
consistent with DHHS guidelines on this important issue, the 
Department is adding the DHHS language to  40.29(n). 



Removal of Requirement for Second Air Blank 



The alcohol testing procedures in Subpart C, as 
originally issued, contained a requirement that the breath 
alcohol technician conduct an ``air blank'' (i.e., an internal 
check of calibration) both before and after every 
confirmation test. Failure to do so, or a result for an 
air blank that exceeded 0.00, is a ``fatal flaw'' that 
automatically invalidates a test. We have decided, on 
further reflection, that the air blank after the 
confirmation test is unnecessary. The main point of an air 
blank is to ensure that each employee has a testing device 
that is a ``clean slate,'' unaffected by any alcohol from 
previous tests or other sources. The pre-test air blank 
accomplishes this objective fully; the post-test air blank 
is not necessary for this purpose. Moreover, on some breath 
testing devices, particularly where a test has shown a high 
alcohol concentration, it may take several minutes for all 
alcohol to clear from the device. Under the existing rule, 
if the breath alcohol technician were to do a post-test air 
blank under these circumstances too soon, it could result in 
a reading above 0.00, invalidating an otherwise valid test. 
Because it is unnecessary, and to avoid problems of this 
kind, we are deleting the provision requiring a post-test 
air blank and the provision making the failure to conduct 
 such a test a ``fatal flaw.'' 



Display of Sequential Test Numbers 



Section 40.53(b)(2) requires that EBTs used for 
confirmation tests be capable of assigning a unique 
sequential number to each test, which can be read by the BAT 
and the employee before the test and printed out on each 
copy of the test result. Section 40.79(a)(7) makes it a 
``fatal flaw'' if the sequential number displayed on the EBT 
before the test is not the same as the sequential number 
printed on the test result. However, the existing 
regulation leaves a gap between these two points, since the 
procedures for conducting alcohol tests (  40.63 and 40.65) 
do not specify the handling of sequential numbers in the 
testing process. 

The Department is adding language to fill this gap. 
Section 40.65(e) is being revised to require the BAT to 
ensure that the BAT and the employee read the displayed 
sequential number before the confirmation test, and 
 40.65(h)(3) is revised to direct the BAT to enter in the 
``Remarks'' section of the form any disparity between that 
number and the sequential test number on the printed result. 
Such a disparity, per  40.79, is a fatal flaw. We have made 
parallel changes to  40.63 (d)(1) and (e)(2), which apply to 
situations in which a screening test is conducted with an 
EBT that has the features specified in  40.53(b) for EBTs 
that can be used for confirmation tests. 



Record Retention Requirement for BAT Training

The alcohol testing requirements of Part 40 currently call on employers or their agents to keep records of breath alcohol
technician (BAT) training and proficiency for two years. The Department is concerned that, for BATs who work as such
for longer than two years, this record retention requirement may not be sufficient. The Department requests comment
on whether this record retention requirement should be extended (e.g., to require retention of records of the training
of a BAT for as long as that BAT works for the employer). Such an extension would not apply, presumably, to BATs who were
no longer working for the employer.


Regulatory Analyses and Notices


This is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866 or under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures.
It does not impose costs on regulated parties and may, to a limited extent, reduce regulatory burdens (e.g., the provisions
concerning reporting and post-test air blanks). Consequently, a regulatory evaluation has not been prepared.
The Department finds, for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act, that issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking
on these subjects is unnecessary, impracticable, or contrary to the public interest. This is because the amendments
are conforming changes to actions of the Department of Health and Human Services or joint DOT/DHHS actions (the change
in the marijuana initial test level, the new Federal drug testing custody and control form), important clarifications
the rapid issuance of which is in the public interest (the clarifications to the split sample collection procedures,
the chain of custody requirements, and the laboratory reporting procedures regarding consortia), or a correction
of what we have come to regard as a mistake in procedures that have not been implemented (removal of the post-test air
blank requirement).
The particular effective dates are established for the following reasons. The 180-day effective date for the requirement
to use the new drug testing custody and control form is established in order to give participants time to exhaust stocks
of existing forms and also to give interested persons a 60-day opportunity to comment on this matter. The August 15
effective date for amendments pertaining to split sample testing procedures was established in view of the August
15 starting date for mandatory split sample testing in the aviation, motor carrier, and railroad industries. The
September 1 effective date for the amendments to the initial test level for marijuana is established to be consistent
with the September 1 effective date of the revised DHHS guidelines, with which the Department's requirements in this
matter should be consistent. The immediate effective date for the amendments to the chain of custody is established
because of the necessity of immediately correcting an error that could create potentially serious damage to the program.

For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Department of Transportation amends Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations,
part 40, as follows: 


PART 40_PROCEDURES FOR TRANSPORTATION WORKPLACE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAMS 



1. The authority citation for 49 CFR Part 40 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

 49 U.S.C. 102,301,322; 49 U.S.C. app. 1301nt., app. 1434nt., app. 2717, app. 1618a.


 40.3 

[Amended]


2. In  40.3, the definition of the term ``EBT'' is amended by changing the period at the end of the definition to
a comma and by adding the following: ``and identified on the CPL as conforming with the model specifications available
from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of Alcohol and State Programs.'' 

3. Section 40.23(a) is revised to read as follows: 



 40.23 

Preparation for testing. 



* * * * * 



(a) Use of the drug testing custody and control form prescribed under this Part. This form is found in Appendix A to this
part. Employers and other participants in the DOT drug testing program may not modify or revise this form, except that
the drug testing custody and control form may include such additional information as may be required for billing or
other legitimate purposes necessary to the collection, provided that personal identifying information on the donor
(other than the social security number or other employee ID number) may not be provided to the laboratory. Donor medical
information may appear only on the copy provided to the donor. 


* * * * * 


4.  40.25(c) is revised to read as follows: 


 40.25 

Specimen collection procedures. 


* * * * * 


(c) Chain of Custody. The chain of custody block of the drug testing custody and control form shall be properly executed
by authorized collection site personnel upon receipt of specimens. Handling and transportation of urine specimens
from one authorized individual or place to another shall always be accomplished through chain of custody procedures.
Since specimens and documentation are sealed in shipping containers that would indicate any tampering during transit
to the laboratory and couriers, express carriers, and postal service personnel do not have access to the chain of custody
forms, there is no requirement that such personnel document chain of custody for the shipping container during transit.
Nor is there a requirement that there be a chain of custody entry when a specimen which is sealed in such a shipping container
is put into or taken out of secure storage at the collection site prior to pickup by such personnel. This means that the
chain of custody is not broken, and a test shall not be canceled, because couriers, express carriers, postal service
personnel, or similar persons involved solely with the transportation of a specimen to a laboratory, have not documented
their participation in the chain of custody documentation or because the chain of custody does not contain entries
related to putting the specimen into or removing it from secure temporary storage at the collection site. Every effort
shall be made to minimize the number of persons handling specimens.

(10) * * * 
(ii) * * * 
(B)(

1

) If a collection container is used, the collection site person, in the presence of the donor, pours the urine into two
specimen bottles. Thirty (30) ml shall be poured into one specimen bottle, to be used as the primary specimen. At least
15 ml shall be poured into the other bottle, to be used as the split specimen. 
(

2

) If a single specimen bottle is used as a collection container, the collection site person, in the presence of the donor,
shall pour 15 ml of urine from the specimen bottle into a second specimen bottle (to be used as the split specimen) and
retain the remainder (at least 30 ml) in the collection bottle (to be used as the primary specimen). 
(C) Nothing in this section precludes the use of a collection method or system that does not involve the physical pouring
of urine from one container or bottle to another by the collection site person, provided that the method or system results
in the subdivision of the specimen into a primary (30 ml) and a split (at least 15 ml) specimen that can be transmitted
to the laboratory and tested in accordance with the requirements of this Subpart.

8.  40.25(h) is revised to read as follows: 



 40.25 

Specimen collection procedures. 



* * * * * 





(h) Transportation to Laboratory. Collection site 
personnel shall arrange to ship the collected specimen to 
the drug testing laboratory. The specimens shall be placed 
in shipping containers designed to minimize the possibility 
of damage during shipment (e.g., specimen boxes and/or 
padded mailers); and those containers shall be securely 
sealed to eliminate the possibility of undetected tampering 
with the specimen and/or the form. On the tape sealing the 
shipping container, the collection site person shall sign 
and enter the date specimens were sealed in the shipping 
container for shipment. The collection site person shall 
ensure that the chain of custody documentation is enclosed 
in each container sealed for shipment to the drug testing 
laboratory. Since specimens and documentation are sealed in 
shipping containers that would indicate any tampering during 
transit to the laboratory and couriers, express carriers, 
and postal service personnel do not have access to the chain 
of custody forms, there is no requirement that such 
personnel document chain of custody for the shipping 
container during transit. Nor is there a requirement that 
there be a chain of custody entry when a specimen which is 
sealed in such a shipping container is put into or taken out 
of secure storage at the collection site prior to pickup by 
such personnel. This means that the chain of custody is not 
broken, and a test shall not be canceled, because couriers, 
express carriers, postal service personnel, or similar 
persons involved solely with the transportation of a 
specimen to a laboratory, have not documented their 
participation in the chain of custody documentation or 
because the chain of custody does not contain entries 
related to putting the specimen into or removing it from 
secure temporary storage at the collection site.

(k) 

Use of chain of custody form. 

A chain of custody 
form (and a 
laboratory internal chain of custody document, where 
applicable), shall be used for maintaining control and 
accountability of each specimen from the point of collection 
to final disposition of the specimen. The date and purpose 
shall be documented on the form each time a specimen is 
handled or transferred and every individual in the chain of 
custody shall be identified. Since specimens and 
documentation are sealed in shipping containers that would 
indicate any tampering during transit to the laboratory and 
couriers, express carriers, and postal ser
