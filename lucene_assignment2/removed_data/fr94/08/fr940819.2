DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 



Farmers Home Administration

Submission of Information Collection to OMB (Under Paperwork Reduction Act and 5 CFR Part 1320) 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farmers Home Administration, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The information collection requirement described below has been submitted to OMB for expedited clearance under
5 CFR 1320.18. The Agency solicits comments on subject submission. This action is necessary in order for the Agency
to amend its Farmer Programs servicing regulations to add the Disaster Set-aside (DSA) Program. This program will
be made available to Farmer Program borrowers who operated a farm or ranch in a county where a disaster occurred in 1993
and was declared/designated a disaster area in accordance with FmHA regulations. Under this program, distressed
borrowers will have the opportunity to move their next scheduled FmHA annual installment to the end of the loan term.
The intended effect is to service disaster victims in an efficient and timely manner while keeping them in business.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agency has submitted the proposal for collection of information as described below, to OMB for clearance as required
by the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). It is requested that OMB approve this submission within 10 days.
The supporting statement attached explains the need for adding FmHA Regulation 1951-T, Disaster Set-Aside
Program. 






Authority:

 Section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507. 



Supporting Statement 


7 CFR 1951-T, Disaster Set-Aside Program 



1. Explanation of the circumstances that make the collection of information necessary. 

The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) is requesting expedited clearance of the paperwork burden for this regulation.
Approval is requested in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act and 5 CFR 1320. 

Eighty percent of the 3,151 counties serviced by FmHA were declared disaster areas in 1993. Due to heavy flooding in
the midwest and extreme droughts in the South, considerably more borrowers were affected by disasters in 1993 than
in any of the previous five years. Although this program was initially begun for the borrowers who were affected by
the 1993 disasters, it will also help those who are affected by the 1994 flood disaster in the South if they were also
affected by the previous disasters in 1993. It will also be possible to consider extension of this program to assist
borrowers affected only by the 1994 disaster. This consideration will be given prior to issuance of the final rule.
In order to prevent massive delinquencies and farm failures, it is imperative that borrowers in a crisis situation
receive immediate financial assistance. 

It is for this purpose and by the authority granted the Secretary under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development
Act (CONACT), Section 331A (7 U.S.C. 1981a), FmHA has made available the Disaster Set-aside Program. As provided
in Section 331A, the Secretary has the authority to defer principal and interest at the request of the borrower on any
outstanding loan made, insured, or held by the Secretary under the CONACT, subject to the borrower showing that due
to circumstances beyond his/her control, he/she is temporarily unable to continue making payments when due without
unduly impairing his/her standard of living. The set-aside program is designed to assist borrowers in financial
distress who operated a farm or ranch in a county where a disaster occurred in 1993 and was declared/designated a disaster
area as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter.

Under this program, farmer programs borrowers can receive immediate financial relief from their FmHA payment obligations.
FmHA projects that approximately 60,000 borrowers affected by 1993 disasters will request assistance under the
set-aside program. Of these borrowers, approximately 20,000 have installments that came due January 1, 1994. If
these installments are not paid by January 1, 1995, or otherwise set-aside, the borrower will be two installments
behind and will no longer be eligible to receive disaster set-aside assistance. Borrowers more than one payment behind
will be able to receive more assistance and offered more options through FmHA's loan servicing program under 7 CFR
1951-S. However, borrowers who cannot obtain servicing through 7 CFR 1951-S may be able to cure their delinquency
with set-aside assistance. The set-aside program will be better for some borrowers than the servicing program provided
through 7 CFR 1951-S since the set-aside will be a faster process, eligibility requirements are easier to meet,
paperwork is less, and some borrowers will be able to be back on track after one payment is set-aside. The Agency realizes
that although this may not be a solution to finding the borrower a feasible plan, it may provide temporary assistance
to borrowers needing that type of relief. It will allow some borrowers to use sources other than FmHA to maintain their
farm operation and allow them to work out their financial difficulty over the next year or so. Borrowers can cure their
FmHA delinquency while at the same time continue farming and find the means to recover from the affects of the disaster.
Other borrowers may prefer to use the year to voluntarily liquidate. This regulation will therefore provide options
to prevent the foreclosure of borrowers in both of these instances. It is because of these reasons that implementation
of this regulation as an interim rule is crucial to providing assistance to borrowers with the most urgent need while
keeping them in business or allowing them crucial time to make optional choices. Borrowers who are not eligible for
the DSA program, or who need more extensive servicing, will still have the opportunity to be considered for FmHA's
primary loan servicing program as set forth in 7 CFR 1951-S. 

The set-aside program allows eligible borrowers to move one FmHA annual installment for each loan to the end of the
loan term, thereby quickly eliminating the immediate financial stress. The installment set-aside may be the one
due immediately after the disaster or, if that installment is paid to the neglect of other creditors or family living
and operating expenses, then the next scheduled installment may be set-aside. Borrowers who received primary loan
servicing after the disaster will not be eligible for the disaster set-aside, as restructuring of the account resolved
the financial distress for the current and next production/marketing period. 

The reporting requirements imposed on the public by the regulations set out in 7 CFR 1951-T are necessary to administer
this program. Borrowers must request DSA in writing and be able to show from their actual production income and expense
records that because of the disaster, their projected income was reduced to an amount that would prevent payment of
all family living and operating expenses, and paying amounts due FmHA and/or other creditors. The addendum is needed
in order to amend the promissory note/assumption agreement to reflect the amount set-aside and provide for collection
on or before the final due date of the loan. 

2. Indicate how, by whom, and for what purpose the information is to be used and the consequence to Federal program or
policy activities if the collection of information was not conducted. 

The information required of FmHA farm borrowers is collected by FmHA loan servicing officials to facilitate an effective
decision-making process when considering set-aside requests. 

The effectiveness of this regulation is dependent upon collection of information from the borrower and the ability
to execute an agreement for future repayment of the set-aside installment. Without this information, the Agency
cannot provide disaster victims with the servicing they most desperately need in an expedient manner. 

Specifically, the burden imposed by this regulation is described as follows: 



Written Request for DSA 



The letter of notification about the DSA program requires borrowers to respond in writing if they wish to be considered
for set-aside. Written response can be limited to one sentence with signatures of all persons liable for the FmHA debt.
The burden is limited to the time it takes the borrower to read the notification letter and prepare a signed written
request. The average response time is estimated to be 15 minutes. 



Production, Income and Expenses Records 



The letter of notification about the DSA program also requires the borrower to provide actual production, income
and expense figures for the production/marketing period in which the 1993 disaster occurred, unless this information
has already been provided to FmHA. The majority of the borrowers who request DSA will have already provided these records
because of other FmHA regulations that require annual year-end analysis of the farming operation. The average response
time is estimated to be 5 minutes. 



Addendum to the Promissory Note/Assumption Agreement for the Disaster Set-Aside Program 



In order for eligible borrowers to participate in the DSA program, an addendum must be signed for each loan installment
set-aside and attached to the promissory note/assumption agreement. This addendum must be signed within 30 days
from the date the borrower is notified of eligibility. The addendum provides an agreement from the borrower that the
installment being set-aside, plus accrued interest on any principal set-aside, will be paid on or before the final
due date of the loan. The addendum is completed by FmHA personnel. The burden imposed on the borrower is limited to the
time required to read and sign the addendum. The average burden time is estimated to be 5 minutes. 


3. Describe any consideration of the use of improved information technology to reduce burden and any technical or
legal obstacles to reducing burden. 

The information collected is of such type and nature that the use of improved information technology, such as data
and word processing, would not significantly reduce the public burden. The Agency has not identified any legal obstacles
to reducing reporting burdens associated with this regulation. 

4. Describe efforts to identify duplication. 

Every effort has been made to avoid unnecessary duplication of information collected. Any information that was previously
collected concerning the debtor that remains relevant is utilized to reduce the public burden.

5. Show specifically why any similar information already available cannot be used or modified for the purpose(s)
described in 2. 


There is no similar information available to replace the written request of the borrower or the set-aside addendum.
However, and as previously stated, if the borrowers production and income and expense records for the disaster year
have already been collected, this information does not have to be provided again. 
6. If the collection of information involves small businesses or other small entities, describe the methods used
to minimize burden. 
The information required by this regulation places no burden on small businesses or other small entities beyond that
performed in the course of normal business practices. 
7. Describe the consequence to Federal program or policy activities if the collection were conducted less frequently.

The borrower can only request disaster set-aside one time. Therefore, the frequency of collection is at the absolute
minimum level necessary to enable FmHA to make responsible decisions. 
8. Explain any special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner inconsistent with the
guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 
There are no information requirements that are inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 
9. Describe efforts to consult with persons outside the agency to obtain their views on the availability of data, frequency
of collection, the clarity of instructions and recordkeeping, disclosure, or reporting format (if any), and on the
data elements to be recorded, disclosed, or reported. 
The following groups were contacted in July 1994 to obtain their views on the paperwork burden: (1) Lane Landenburger
of the North Dakota Department of Agriculture, Telephone number 701-223-4423, (2) Lynn Hayes, Farmers
Legal Action Group, Telephone number 612-223-5400, (3) Renee Robinson, Illinois Stewardship Alliance,
Telephone number 217-498-9707, and (4) Melody G. Julian, National Association of County Supervisors,
316-227-3761. The regulation and form letter were reviewed. Their comments were all favorable. In their
opinion, the regulation and instructions to the borrower were easy to understand. Most borrowers should have their
actual records for the 1993 disaster year completed since the 1993 tax year has already passed. In fact, most borrowers
will have already provided these records to FmHA for their year-end analysis and will not have to provide them again.
In these cases, the only item left to submit is the letter of request. They also stated the addendum the borrower signs
is easy to read and understand and there shouldn't be any confusion. 
10. Describe any assurance of confidentiality provided to respondents and the basis for the assurance in statute,
regulation, or agency policy. 
There is no assurance of confidentiality provided to respondents for the information required by this regulation.

11. Provide additional justification for any questions of a sensitive nature, such as sexual behavior and attitudes,
religious beliefs, and other matters that are commonly considered private. 
The information to be collected under this regulation does not involve any questions of a sensitive nature. 
12. Provide estimates of annualized cost to the Federal Government and to the respondents. Also provide a description
of the method used to estimate cost, which should include quantification of hours, operational expenses, and any
other expense that would not have been incurred without the paperwork burden. 
The annual cost to the Federal Government to implement and administer this regulation is estimated to be $1,544,400,
which includes salaries, operational expenses and overhead. The national average cost factor is $17.16 per hour.
Federal Government costs for this regulation are based on the number of notifications, responses and persons qualifying
for the program, times the hourly cost factor. 
The estimated annual cost to respondents is $246,092, using a rate of $10.34, derived from the Statistical Abstract
of the United States 1992, the National Data Book, Table 650, page 410. This table was based on information from the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Average Hourly and Weekly Earnings in Current and Constant (1982) Dollars for 1991.

13. Provide estimates of the burden of the collection of information. 
Attached is a chart indicating the estimates of the public's annual burden. FmHA estimates that approximately 100,000
farmer programs borrowers will be notified of the DSA program. This number includes all FP borrowers who operated
in a disaster area during 1993. FmHA estimates that approximately 60,000 of these borrowers will make a written request
for DSA. The other 40,000 will not apply for various reasons. Approximately 10,000 borrowers have or will be restructured
under subpart S of part 1951 and therefore will not be eligible for this program. Approximately 20,000 will not apply
because they know they cannot meet the eligibilty requirements. The other 10,000 will not apply because even though
they might have operated in a disaster area, they were able to pay all family living and operating expenses, and all
payments to FmHA and other creditors. 
Of the 60,000 borrowers who request DSA, FmHA estimates that 50,000 will actually receive DSA. The other 10,000 will
either not qualify for the program or will choose 1951-S servicing instead. 
14. Explain reasons for changes in burden, including the need for any increase. 
This is a new regulation. 
15. For collections of information whose results are planned to be published for statistical use. 



There are no plans to publish information from these documents for statistical purposes and therefore Section B does
not apply.

Exhibit A_Addendum to the Promissory Note/Assumption Agreement for the Disaster Set-Aside Program 



Subpart T_Disaster Set-aside Program 


 1951.951 

Purpose.
 


This subpart sets forth the policies and procedures for establishing and implementing the Disaster Set-aside Program
(DSA). The DSA program is available to Farmer Programs (FP) borrowers, as defined in subpart S of this part, who suffered
losses as a result of a 1993 disaster. FP loans that may be serviced under this subpart include Farm Ownership (FO),
Operating (OL), Soil and Water (SW), Emergency (EM), Economic Emergency (EE), Special Livestock (SL), Economic
Opportunity (EO), Softwood Timber (ST), Recreation (RL), and Rural Housing loans for farm service buildings (RHF).
Non-program (NP) farm type loans may be serviced under this subpart for borrowers who also have program FP loans. FP
borrowers have until July 1, 1995, to request disaster set-aside and submit a complete application. Requests received
after this date will not be accepted. 



 1951.952 

General. 
 


Disaster set-aside is a program whereby borrowers who are current or not more than 1 installment behind on any and all
FP loans may be permitted to move one Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) scheduled annual installment(s) for each
eligible FP loan to the end of the loan term. Borrowers whose loans are restructured in accordance with subpart S of
this part after the disaster occurred are not eligible for the DSA program. The intent of this program is to relieve
some of the borrower's immediate financial stress caused by the disaster and avoid foreclosure by the Government.




 1951.953 

Notification and Request for DSA. 



(a) 

Notification. 

The County Supervisor will use form letter 1951-1-T to notify FP borrowers of the availability of the DSA
program and how to apply. All FP borrowers, as defined in  1951.906 of subpart S of this part, who operated a farm
or ranch in a county during 1993 in which a disaster occurred and was declared/designated as a disaster area, or contiguous
county, as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter will be notified within 10 days of the effective date of
this instruction. Notification of the DSA program will not affect the notification requirements set forth in subpart
S of this part. 

(b) 

Request for DSA. 

(1) All FP borrowers liable for the debt must request disaster set-aside in writing prior to July 1, 1995. 

(2) Borrowers must provide the County Supervisor with actual production, income and expense figures for the production/marketing
period in which the 1993 disaster occurred, unless this information is already in the borrower case file. 

(3) Borrowers may only be considered for DSA one time. 

(c) Eligibility requirements. 

(1) The borrower operated a farm or ranch in a county declared/designated a disaster area as set forth in subpart A of
part 1945 of this chapter, or a contiguous county to such an area based on a 1993 disaster. The borrower must have been
operating the farm or ranch at the time of the disaster. 

(2) The borrower has acted in good faith as defined in  1951.906 of subpart S of this part. 

(3) All nonmonetary defaults have been resolved. This means that even though the borrower has acted in good faith,
he/she may still be in default for reasons, such as, but not limited to: no longer farming, prior lienholder foreclosure,
bankruptcy, not properly maintaining chattel and real estate security, not properly accounting for the sale of security
as agreed, or not carrying out any other agreements made with FmHA. 

(4) The borrower is current or not more than one installment behind on any and all FP loans at the time the scheduled installment(s)
will be set-aside as reflected on the Finance Office 540 or 582 status reports. 

(5) The borrower's projected income for the disaster year was reduced as a result of the disaster, causing insufficient
income available to pay all family living and operating expenses, pay debts to other creditors and pay FmHA. This determination
will be based on the borrower's actual production and income and expense records for the disaster year. Releases of
normal income security will continue as set forth in subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter. 

(6) The term remaining on the loan(s) receiving set-aside equals or exceeds 2 years from the due date of the installment
being set-aside.

  1951.954-1951.956

 [Reserved] 



 1951.957

Eligibility determination and processing. 



(a) Eligibility determination. 

Upon receipt of a DSA request, the County Supervisor will determine whether the borrower meets the eligibility requirements
set forth in  1951.953(c) of this subpart and notify the borrower of the results within 30 days from the date of
the DSA request. The file shall contain documentation to reflect the date of request and the date the borrower was notified
and the addendum signed.
 
(1) The borrower shall be provided up to 30 days to sign Exhibit A, ``Addendum to the Promissory Note/Assumption Agreement
for the Disaster Set-aside Program.'' If the addendum is not signed within 30 days and/or prior to the borrower becoming
more than 1 installment behind, the DSA request will be withdrawn and the borrower notified of their appeal rights
under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. 

(2) Pending requests for primary loan servicing will continue to be considered as set forth in subpart S of this part.
However, borrowers cannot accept servicing under both programs. 

(i) Borrowers determined eligible for the DSA and 1951-S servicing will be required to choose between the two
program requests. The choice will be noted in the borrower case file and initialed by the borrower. 

(ii) Borrowers may choose to proceed with the DSA prior to a decision being made for primary loan servicing such as in
cases where a decision will not be available on the primary loan servicing application prior to the borrower becoming
more than 1 installment behind. 

(iii) The application for the program not chosen will automatically be withdrawn at the time the installment(s) are
set-aside or the loan(s) restructured, whichever is applicable. This voluntary withdrawal is not appealable. 

(iv) By signing Exhibit A of this subpart, the borrower agrees to the withdrawal of any pending request for primary
loan servicing. The borrower may resubmit a request at any time according to subpart S of this part. 

(b) 

Processing. 

Installments will be set-aside as set forth in this paragraph. 

(1) All borrowers liable for the debt will sign Exhibit A of this subpart for each loan installment set-aside. Exhibit
A may be modified with the assistance of the Office of the General Counsel to comply with individual State laws. 

(2) Only one unpaid installment for each FP loan may be set-aside. 

(i) The installment set-aside will be the first scheduled annual installment due immediately after the disaster
occurred, or if that installment is paid current, the next scheduled annual installment. Set-aside will not be granted
on the loan if both of these installments are paid current. 

(ii) The amount set-aside will not exceed the annual scheduled installment being set-aside minus any portion of that
installment paid prior to Exhibit A being signed by the borrower. This amount will include the unpaid interest and
any principal that would be credited to the account as if the installment were paid on the due date. 

(iii) Recoverable cost items charged to FO, SW, and RHF loans may be set-aside with the annual installment. Cost items
identified with a loan number different from the parent loan cannot be set-aside. 

(3) Interest will accrue on any principal amount set-aside at the same rate charged the non-set-aside portion. Interest
will not accrue on the interest portion set-aside. 

(4) The amount set-aside, including interest accrual on any principal set-aside, will be due on or before the final
due date of the loan. 

(5) There are no security requirements attached to the DSA program. All existing security instruments will remain
in effect.

<TEXT>
 

(6) Exhibit A will be used as the source document to process the set-aside through ADPS. Until automation capabilities
are implemented, Exhibit A should be placed in a pending file and the borrower's account flagged ``51-S.'' The
Finance Office borrower account status reports will reflect the amount(s) set-aside for each loan. 

(7) The National Automated Tracking System (AGCREDIT) will be utilized to document the notification and servicing
scheme associated with this subpart. 

(8) The loan(s) will be considered current after the installment(s) is set-aside and, therefore, debt writedown
or net recovery buyout may not be subsequently approved under subpart S of this part, and loans may not be made under
 1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter, unless the set-aside is reversed as set forth in  1951.958(b)(2)
of this subpart or the borrower becomes delinquent on the non-set-aside portion. 

(c) 

Adverse determination.

 Borrowers who do not meet the requirements for the DSA program will be notified of their appeal rights in accordance
with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. If the borrower becomes more than 1 installment behind on any FP loan while
processing the DSA request, or while an appeal is being considered, the DSA request will be denied and/or any associated
appeal request withdrawn. Being denied set-aside based on the failure to meet the not-more-than-1-installment-behind
requirement is not an appealable issue, but is reviewable. The letter to the borrower will describe in full detail
all the reasons for the adverse decision. Borrowers denied set-aside will continue to be serviced in accordance with
subpart S of this part. 



 1951.958 

Supervision and servicing of borrowers with DSA. 



(a) 

Supervision.

 Borrower supervision will continue as set forth in subpart B of part 1924 of this chapter. 

(b) 

Servicing. 

FP loans will continue to be serviced in accordance with the appropriate servicing regulations. 

(1) Payments applied to the amount set-aside will be processed as a miscellaneous payment on Form FmHA 451-2,
``Schedule of Remittance.'' 

(2) The set-aside will be reversed and the addendum cancelled if, prior to the first scheduled installment due date
after set-aside, the current borrower needs a writedown in order to develop a feasible plan or a net recovery buyout
in accordance with subpart S of this part, or loan assistance set forth in  1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of
this chapter. The Finance Office must be notified by memorandum of the set-aside reversal prior to the time assistance
is granted. A copy of the memorandum will be attached to the addendum. 

(3) In cases not covered by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the set-aside will be considered automatically cancelled
whenever a program loan receives primary loan servicing.

Exception authority. 



The Administrator may, in individual cases, make an exception to any requirement or provision of this subpart or address
any omission of this subpart which is not inconsistent with the authorizing statute or other applicable law if it is
determined that application of the requirement or provision or failure to take action in the case of an omission would
adversely affect the Government's interest. The Administrator will exercise this authority upon the request of
the State Director, with the recommendation of the Assistant Administrator for Farmer Programs; or upon request
initiated by the Assistant Administrator for Farmer Programs. Requests for exception must be made in writing and
supported with documentation to explain the adverse effect and proposed alternative courses of action, and to show
how the adverse effect will be eliminated or minimized if the exception is granted.

<DOCTITLE>Environment Impact Statement, Shamrock Timber Sale(s), Tongass National Forest, AK</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will issue a supplemental Draft EIS for the Shamrock Timber Sale(s). The supplement will include
an additional road and unit, minor road changes, designation of retention areas, a new Forest Service list of sensitive
species, a change in subsistence findings, and a change in the range of timber volume in the Proposed Action and Purpose
and Need. This revised Notice of Intent (NOI) updates and replaces the December 1991 Notice.




The proposed action changes from 10-40 to 10-52 million board feet of commercial timber within the Shamrock
area, and as before, to construct the associated road system. The timber would be sold in one or more timber sales beginning
in September 1995.

The study area includes Value Comparison Units 436, 438, and 429 on Kupreanof Island in southeast Alaska. This area,
encompassing approximately 108,000 acres, has been allocated by the Tongass Land Management Plan to Land Use Designation
IV, in which management emphasis is primarily on commodity or market resources.

The original NOI was published on page 66428 of the 12/23/91 

Federal Register.

 Notice of the draft EIS was published on page 45338 of the 10/27/93 issue, and the comment period of the Draft EIS was
extended on page 59033 of the 11/5/93 issue.

The purpose of this project is to provide 10-52 million board feet of timber for harvest according to direction
described in the Tongass Land Management Plan, to meet the Federal obligation to make timber volume available for
harvest by timber operators, and to improve the timber productivity of the project area by harvesting mature stands
of timber and replacing them with faster growing stands of second-growth timber.

The decision to be made is whether to harvest 10-52 million board feet of timber from the Shamrock Study Area,
and if so, in which locations and under what conditions. This decision will be made by Abigail R. Kimbell, the Stikine
Area Forest Supervisor.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A public scoping letter was sent to all persons who indicated an interest in the project by responding to the Stikine
Area Project Schedule, or who otherwise notified the Stikine Area that they were interested in the Shamrock Timber
Sale(s).




Alternatives include the no-action alternative and four action alternatives that would harvest form 20-52
million board feet of timber from 1,066-2,592 acres and construct 22-40 miles of specified road. Yarding
systems would include shovel, highlead, skyline, and helicopter.

The following issues have been identified:





1. Transportation: 

What effect will road construction and subsequent maintenance following harvest have on access to and within the
Shamrock Area?



2a. Timber Resources: 

How will long-term forest health and productivity be affected by harvesting and the specific harvest treatments
in the Shamrock area?



2b. Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive Plants (TES); Wetlands: 

Will harvesting and road construction result in adverse impact to any populations of TES plants? What are the expected
losses of wetland area and functional value under each harvest alternative?



3. Wildlife: 

What effects will timber harvest and related activities have on wildlife habitat?



4. Fish: 

What effects will timber harvest and road construction have on habitats used by trout and salmon?





5. Biodiversity: 

How will timber harvesting associated with the Shamrock area affect the biodiversity and old growth structure of
Kupreanof Island?



6. Watershed: 

Will timber harvesting adversely affect the hydrologic balance and water quality of streams in the Shamrock area?

7. Floodplains: 

Will harvest activities and road construction in the Shamrock area affect the conveyance of floodwater or result
in an increase in potential flood damage?


8. Soils: 

To what degree will soil erosion and sedimentation increase as a result of harvest activities and the construction
of roads in the Shamrock area?


9. Minerals: 

Will timber harvest and road building in the Shamrock area affect mining activities?


10. Air Quality: 

Are there potential air quality impacts due to burning, road construction, or harvest activities?


11. Subsistence: 

To what extent will each alternative affect subsistence resources and use within the study area?


12. Cultural Resources: 

Would cultural resources, particularly Native American sites, be impacted by harvesting in the Shamrock area?


13a. Recreation Opportunities: 

What effects will the proposed sale or sales in this area have on recreational opportunities?


13b. Wild and Scenic Rivers: 

What effects will each alternative have on streams eligible or suitable for Wild and Scenic River designation?


14. Visual Resources: 

To what extent will each alternative influence the landscape character of the analysis area, and to what extent will
harvest designs be mitigated to protect visual quality?


15. Economics: 

To what extent will action alternatives within the Shamrock area include timber sale(s) that are profitable and meet
economic criteria for timber harvest in the Tongass National Forest?
The supplemental Draft EIS is scheduled for publication in December 1994 and the Final EIS in September 1995.
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so it is meaningful and
alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions (

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 533 [1978]). Also, environmental objections that could have been raised at the Draft EIS stage may be
waived if not raised until after the completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts (

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 F.2d 1016, 1022 [9th Cir. 1986] and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 [E.D. Wis. 1980]). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is helpful if comments refer to specific
pages or chapters of the draft environmental impact statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft
environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers
may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing the procedural provisions
of the National Environmental Policy Act in 40 CFR 1503.3 while addressing these points.
The responsible official for the decision is the Abigail R. Kimbell, Forest Supervisor, Stikine Area of the Tongass
National Forest, Alaska Region, Petersburg, Alaska.

<DOCTITLE>Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>



DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection
of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

Field Representative Exit Questionnaire.


Form Number(s): 

BC-1294.


Agency Approval Number: 

None.


Type of Request: 

New collection.


Burden: 

13 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

160.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

5 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

In a continuous effort to devise policy and practice aimed at reducing turnover among field representatives (FR)s--our
field interviewing staff--the Census Bureau needs to collect data on the reasons FRs leave the Bureau.
An exit questionnaire will help the Census Bureau in identifying specific reasons for the turnovers. Based on the
survey results, the Census Bureau can develop both general and specific plans to reduce turnover. Approximately
every month, a sample of one-half of all FRs voluntarily resigning within the period will be contacted by telephone
to complete a questionnaire. Interviewers hired to conduct the census enumeration will not be included in the sample.
Similar data was last gathered in 1992. Since computers have recently become part of the FRs' tools the questionnaire
now incorporates questions how on the use of computers may affect their decisions on continued employment.


Affected Public: 

Individuals or households.


Frequency: 

On occasion.


Respondent's Obligation: 

Voluntary.


OMB Desk Officer: 

Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395-7313.

Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Tach&eacute;, DOC
Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482-3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue,

<DOCTITLE>Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>


DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection
of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

Continuous Measurement System--Random Digit Dialing Test.


Form Number(s): 

None.


Agency Approval Number: 

None.


Type of Request: 

New collection.


Burden: 

21,000 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

28,000.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

45 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

The Census Bureau is developing and evaluating a design to continuously measure the long-form data that has
traditionally been collected once a decade as part of the decennial census. Under the Continuous Measurement System
(CMS) a long-form questionnaire would be mailed to a sample of different addresses contained in our master address
file (MAF) each month. Continuously collecting the long-form data will not only provide more timely data, but
will lessen respondent burden in the decennial census. The first phase in this research is to conduct a survey in approximately
2,000 different households each month over a 14 month period. The objectives of this test are to determine the feasibility
and costs of a telephone nonrespondent follow-up component for the CMS, examine question wording to collect
``rolling'' or accumulated income estimates based on 5 years of data, review possible seasonal effects on income
estimates, prototype the processing system, and research the cost and effectiveness of using cross-reference
directories to obtain phone numbers. Random Digit Dialing (RDD) will be employed in the test as a means of sampling
and for obtaining telephone numbers of households.


Affected Public: 

Individuals or households.


Frequency: 

Monthly.


Respondent's Obligation: 

Voluntary.

Needs and Uses: 

For the 2000 decennial census, as well as other census programs, the Census Bureau is building on its 1990 census address
list to create a permanent and continuously maintained Master Address File (MAF). We will link this national inventory
of living quarters to the Census Bureau's Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER)
data base. The existence of such a linked address/geographic file for the nation will provide important opportunities
for the Census Bureau's research and demographic programs. The Census Bureau currently solicits the participation
of local governments and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in a cooperative arrangement to determine
the locations of missing addresses and streets to assist us in maintaining the TIGER data base. For those not wishing
to participate we will conduct the FARSAS to help us determine both the availability and usefulness of reference materials
we can use to update the TIGER data base for those areas. On the basis of information collected during FARSAS we will
be able to resolve non-matching cases from the geocoding process.


Affected Public: 

State or local governments.

<DOCTITLE>Action Affecting Export Privileges; Mega Computer Corporation; Order Denying Permission to Apply for or Use Export
Licenses</DOCTITLE>


On March 23, 1992, Mega Computer Corporation (Mega Computer) was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of California of violating the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.A. app. 2401-2420
(1991, Supp. 1993, and Public Law 103-277, July 5, 1994)) (the Act). The conviction followed a plea of guilty
to one count of a multiple-count criminal indictment. Mega Computer was convicted of knowingly violating the Act
by exporting from the United States to Singapore United States-origin computer equipment without the validated
export license required by the Export Administration Regulations (currently codified at 15 CFR Parts 768-799
(1994)) (the Regulations).
Section 11(h) of the Act provides that, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce,
 no person convicted of violating the Act, or certain other provisions of the United States Code, shall be eligible
to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the Act or the Regulations for a period of up
to 10 years from the date of the conviction. In addition, any export license issued pursuant to the Act in which such
a person had any interest at the time of its conviction may be revoked.




Pursuant to   770.15 and 772.1(g) of the Regulations, upon notification that a person has been convicted
of violating the Act, the Director, Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Director, Office of Export
Enforcement, shall determine whether to deny that person permission to apply for or use any export license issued
pursuant to, or provided by, the Act and the Regulations, and shall also determine whether to revoke any export license
previously issued to such a person.
Having received notice of Mega Computer's conviction for violating the Act, and following consultations with the
Director, Office of Export Enforcement, I have decided to deny Mega Computer permission to apply for or use any export
license, including any general license, issued pursuant to, or provided by, the Act and the Regulations, for a period
of 10 years from the date of its conviction. The 10-year period ends on March 23, 2002. I have also decided to revoke all
export licenses issued pursuant to the Act in which Mega Computer had an interest at the time of its conviction.
Accordingly, it is hereby Ordered:

States or abroad involving any commodity or technical data exported or to be exported from the United States, in whole
or in part, and subject to the Regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, participation, either
in the United States or abroad, shall include participation, directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity: (i)
As a party or as a representative of a party to any export license application submitted to the Department; (ii) in preparing
or filing with the Department any export license application or request for reexport authorization, or any document
to be submitted therewith; (iii) in obtaining from the Department or using any validated or general export license,
reexport authorization or other export control document; (iv) in carrying on negotiations with respect to, or in
receiving, ordering, buying, selling, delivering, storing, using, or disposing of, in whole or in part, any commodities
or technical data exported or to be exported from the United States, and subject to the Regulations; and (v) in financing,
forwarding, transporting, or other servicing of such commodities or technical data.


III


After notice and opportunity for comment as provided in Section 770.15(h) of the Regulations, any person, firm, corporation,
or business organization related to Mega Computer by affiliation, ownership, control, or position or responsibility
in the conduct of trade or related services may also be subject to the provisions of this Order.


IV


As provided in Section 787.12(a) of the Regulations, without prior disclosure of the facts to and specific authorization
of the Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Office of Export Enforcement, no person may directly or
indirectly, in any manner or capacity: (i) Apply for, obtain, or use any license, Shipper's Export Declaration, bill
of lading, or other export control document relating to an export or reexport of commodities or technical data by,

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty 
Administrative Reviews.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On June 29, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative
reviews of the antidumping duty order on color television receivers (CTVs) from the Republic of Korea covering exports
of this merchandise to the United States by the manufacturer Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. (Daewoo). Based on our review
of these exports during the period April 1, 1988 through March 31, 1989, we found a margin of 4.00 percent. Daewoo had
no shipments during the April 1, 1989 through March 31, 1990, administrative review period. We invited interested
parties to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from the Independent Radionic Workers of America,
International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Technical, Salaried, and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers of America, and the Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO (collectively the petitioners)
and Daewoo stating that they have no objection to our preliminary results. Therefore, our final results of review
remain unchanged from those presented in our preliminary results. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33487), the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 the preliminary results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on CTVs from the Republic of Korea
(49 FR 18336; April 1984) covering exports of this merchandise to the United States by the manufacturer, Daewoo. For
administrative convenience, we have combined the results of two reviews covering the periods April 1, 1988 through
March 31, 1989, and April 1, 1989 through March 31, 1990, for this manufacturer. We have now completed these administrative
reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 


Scope of the Review 


Imports covered by these reviews include CTVs, complete and incomplete, from the Republic of Korea. The order covers
all CTVs regardless of tariff classification. During the period of review, the subject merchandise was classified
under item numbers 684.9246, 684.9248, 684.9250, 684.9252, 684.9253, 684.9255, 684.9256, 684. 9258, 684.9262,

Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated

 (TSUSA). This merchandise is currently classifiable under item numbers 8528.10.80, 8529.90.15, 8529.90.20, and
8540.11.00 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule

 (HTS). Although the HTS and TSUSA item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description
of the scope remains dispositive. 


Analysis of Comments Received 


We invited interested parties to comment on our preliminary results of the reviews. We received comments from petitioners
and Daewoo stating that they have no objection to our preliminary results. Therefore, our final results of review
remain the same as those presented in our preliminary results. 


Final Results of the Review 


Based on our review of these exports during the period April 1, 1988 through March 31, 1989, we determine Daewoo's dumping
margin to be 4.00 percent. Daewoo had no shipments during the April 1, 1989 through March 31, 1990, administrative
review period. 
The Department shall instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. 
Furthermore, since Daewoo has been reviewed in a period subsequent to this period, the cash deposit rate for Daewoo
will remain at 0.90 percent, the company's rate from the most recently reviewed period. See, 

Color Television Receivers from the Republic of Korea; Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review

 (59 FR 21958; April 28, 1994). 
This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibilities concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. 
These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, as amended (19
U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22.

 Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 5, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the
antidumping duty order on silicon metal from Brazil. The review period is March 29, 1991 through June 30, 1992. The
review covers four manufacturers/exporters. 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. Based on our analysis of the comments
received, we have changed our results from those presented in our preliminary results as described below in the comments
section of this notice. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On August 5, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 41721) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on silicon metal
from Brazil (July 12, 1991, 56 FR 36135). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance
with Section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 



Scope of the Review 



The merchandise covered by this review is silicon metal containing at least 96.00 but less than 99.99 percent of silicon
metal from Brazil. Silicon metal is currently provided for under subheadings 2804.69.10 and 2804.69.50 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule 

(HTS) as a chemical product, but is commonly referred to as a metal. Semiconductor grade silicon metal (silicon metal
containing by weight not less than 99.99 percent of silicon and provided for in subheading 2804.61.00 of the HTS) is
not subject to the order. HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description
remains dispositive. 

On February 3, 1993 the Department determined, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.29 (1993), that silicon metal with a higher aluminum
content containing between 89 and 96 percent of silicon metal is of the same class or kind of merchandise as silicon
metal subject to the antidumping duty order. While this scope determination was undertaken in the context of the antidumping
duty order governing silicon metal from the People's Republic of China, the silicon metal subject to that order is
the same as the silicon metal covered by this order. Therefore, the Department will include such merchandise in future
reviews of this order. 

This review covers four manufacturers/exporters of Brazilian silicon metal. The period covered by this review is
March 29, 1991 through June 30, 1992. 



Analysis of Comments Received 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results as provided by section 353.22(c)
of the Department's regulations. We received comments from the petitioners (American Alloys, Inc., Elkham Metals
Company, Globe Metallurgical Inc., SKW Metals & Alloys, Inc. and SMI Group, Inc., Rock Island Silicon Division)
and from four respondents (Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio (CBCC), Companhia Ferroligas Minas Gerais-Minasligas
(Minasligas), Eletrosilex Belo Horizonte (Eletrosilex), and Rima Eletrometalurgia S.A. (Rima)). On January 14,
1994, we held a public hearing. 



Comment 1: 

Petitioners contend that CBCC refused to provide cost information necessary for the calculation of cost of production
(COP) and constructed value (CV). Specifically, petitioners argue that CBCC did not properly report its interest
expenses and charcoal replacement costs. Petitioners also contend that CBCC understated its electricity and quartz
replacement costs. Petitioners conclude that the Department should utilize the highest, most adverse margin as
best information available (BIA) since the deficiencies in CBCC's COP/CV response are so pervasive. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with petitioners. While during verification we did find areas where the costs were not appropriately
quantified, we have not found these deficiencies to be so significant or pervasive as to call into question the accuracy
of the entire response. It should be noted that some of the issues, as discussed in comments 2, 4, 6, and 11, are related
to methodological questions, rather than areas of incorrect reporting of costs. In the instances where we found insufficient
verification support (

see 

December 20, 1993 ``CBCC Cost Verification Report''), we relied on partial BIA. For the methodological issues, we
recalculated the costs to correct a particular cost element. Although we have made certain adjustments to the information
submitted by CBCC (

see e.g.,

 our responses to comments 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9), we generally have used CBCC's data in reaching these final results of
administrative review.

Comment 2:

 Petitioners note that Solvay do Brasil owns 99.8 percent of CBCC. Petitioners contend that if the Department uses
the COP/CV information submitted by CBCC, it should base its calculation of interest expense upon the borrowing experience
associated with the consolidated group of companies. Petitioners contend that the Department should use the financial
expenses reported on Solvay do Brasil's financial statements to perform this calculation. Finally, petitioners
assert that the Department should apply this allocation to the replacement cost of manufacture (COM) to properly
account for Brazilian hyperinflation. 
CBCC argues that calculation of interest expense on a consolidated basis would be improper. CBCC contends that the
December 20, 1993, verification report concludes that CBCC made interest-free loans to Solvay do Brasil. CBCC contends
that it charged Solvay do Brasil the minimum Brazilian statutory requirement for the monetary correction. CBCC also
argues that the Department found no evidence of loans from Solvay do Brasil to CBCC at verification. 



Department's Position:

 We agree with petitioners that CBCC's interest expense should be calculated on a consolidated basis. Since the cost
of capital is fungible, we believe that calculating interest expense based on consolidated statements is the most
appropriate methodology (see, 

e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Small Business Telephones from Korea, 

54 FR 53141, 53149 (December 27, 1989), 

Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada, 

55 FR 31414, 31418-31419 (August 2, 1990), and 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings)
and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, et al., 

54 FR 18992, 19074 (May 3, 1989)). 
In order to extinguish its outstanding debt, CBCC issued new shares of capital stock to its parent company. Also, we
established at verification that Solvay do Brasil owns 99.8 percent of CBCC. Based on these facts, it is evident that
the shift in debt is due to the parent company's control over the subsidiary. Accordingly, the degree of relationship
influenced the structure of debt for the entire company. Therefore, consistent with our normal practice, we revised
CBCC's submitted interest expenses based on the consolidated financial statements of Solvay do Brasil. 
During verification, CBCC company officials did not provide the source documents for Solvay's financial income
and expenses. Therefore, we have used BIA to determine CBCC's financial expenses. As BIA, we used information from
Solvay do Brasil's financial statements. This percentage was then applied to each month's COM to ensure that CBCC's
COP data fully reflected interest expenses. 


Comment 3:

 Petitioners contend that the Department's December 20, 1993, COP verification report suggested allocating interest
expenses to CBCC's COP based on the sum of the financial expenses reflected in CBCC's and Solvay do Brasil's 1991 and
1992 financial statements. Petitioners note that if the Department took that approach, it would determine interest
expenses as a percentage of the sum of both companies' cost of goods sold (COGS), adjusted for intercompany interest
transactions. Petitioners further contend that CBCC's financial statements reflect only net interest expenses,
and that use of the allocation that the Department proposed in its December 20, 1993, verification report would give
CBCC credit for all of its interest income, whether short-term or not. Petitioners argue that CBCC submitted no information
regarding short-term interest income, making it impossible for the Department to make any adjustment for intercompany
interest transactions. 


Department's Position:

 We agree with petitioners that CBCC did not provide information documenting the company's short-term interest income.
As previously discussed in our response to Comment 2, we have relied upon BIA in our calculation of CBCC's interest
expense. As BIA, we used the financial expense information from Solvay do Brasil's financial statements. We then
applied this percentage to each month's COM for purposes of our COP/CV calculations. 


Comment 4:

 Petitioners assert that CBCC purchased electricity at a discount when the electricity is used to restart idled machinery.
Petitioners note that, prior to March 1992, CBCC averaged the cost of electricity obtained from its own production
and from three separate pricing plans. Petitioners note that, after March 1992, CBCC stopped averaging electricity
costs, and used the discounted electricity associated with the running of idled machines. Petitioners contend that
the Department should use CBCC's average electricity costs in the COP/CV calculations rather than the discounted
electricity costs associated with the restarting of idled machinery. 
CBCC contends that the antidumping law contemplates that producers will base pricing decisions on currently available
COP information. CBCC contends that the Department verified that the furnace was idle prior to the acquisition of
the discounted energy, and that the discounted energy was only used on the restarted furnace. CBCC argues that it applied
the discounted energy to silicon metal so as to minimize the COP of silicon metal consistent with the Department's
COP methodology. CBCC suggests that averaging its electricity costs would result in rejection of its cost data simply
because the cost is not high enough.

Department's Position:

 In reaching these final results we have relied upon our general practice in a hyperinflationary economy which is to
calculate a monthly average cost for each input. The Department believes that it is inappropriate to specifically
identify inputs obtained at a lower cost to a particular product or production run. The furnaces used to produce silicon
metal can produce other products that are not subject to review. Likewise, other furnaces used to produce non-subject
merchandise can be used to produce silicon metal. Accordingly, any benefits derived from the use of a particular furnace
relate to all products produced during the period of review. 
We note that in this case it is strictly a management decision as to which product will be made in the furnace which is
receiving the less expensive input. As such, in months in which there were U.S. shipments of silicon metal, the furnace
which utilizes less expensive electricity can be assigned to produce silicon metal. That same furnace could be assigned
to produce ferrosilicon in months in which CBCC had U.S. sales of ferrosilicon, a product which is also subject to an
antidumping duty order. In fact, during the period covered by this review, the furnace in question did produce both
silicon metal and ferrosilicon. (Both silicon metal and ferrosilicon were also produced in other furnaces.) 
The facts of the instant case are consistent with the Department's position requiring the weight-averaging of the
costs of merchandise produced in more than one facility. The Department has consistently held that it is inappropriate
to make adjustments for cost differences between facilities when the merchandise produced in each is identical (see


Department of Commerce Policy Bulletin No. 92.2, 

July 29, 1992, which is on file at the Central Records Unit). 


Comment 5:

 Petitioners contend that the Department verified that on several occasions CBCC paid an advance deposit on its electricity
bill. Petitioners further contend that the Department should make an upward adjustment to CBCC's reported electricity
costs to account for the effect of Brazilian inflation. 
CBCC argues that it received a credit from CEMIG (its energy supplier) for advance payment. CBCC asserts that the Department
should deduct the amount of the credit from the invoiced amount since that represents the real ``cost'' of the item.




Department's Position:

 In calculating the replacement cost of electricity obtained in each month of the period of review we used the invoiced
price for that month. We did not reduce the invoiced amount for the effect of any ``credits'' CBCC may have obtained.
Such a reduction would not properly reflect the replacement cost of electricity. Although this is a short-term monetary
asset which is not subject to the balance sheet monetary corrections, through agreement, CEMIG credits CBCC for the
value of cruzeiros as of the invoice date. This does not reduce the replacement cost of electricity CBCC obtained but
merely reduces the nominal cruzeiro amount outstanding. Under the Department's replacement cost methodology each
month's cost is measured in the monthly nominal invoiced cruzeiro amounts. Therefore, we have accepted the amounts
billed by CEMIG as each month's replacement cost, without the effect of the ``credit.'' 


Comment 6:

 Petitioners note that CBCC reported electricity costs exclusive of the ICMS tax in its calculation of third-country
COP. Petitioners contend that these tax payments should have been included in CBCC's calculation of electricity
costs. 


Department's Position:

 We agree with petitioner. When using third-country sales as the basis of FMV, we must determine if the manufacturer
incurred costs which resulted from the payment of taxes on the purchase of inputs. In this review period, CBCC incurred
ICMS tax, a value added tax (``VAT''), in purchasing electricity. CBCC is able to offset some of this tax when it sells
products in the home market because it charges and receives a VAT on its home market sales. In this case, even though
the home market was not viable, CBCC did make some home market sales. However, there were not enough home market sales
for the VAT charged and received on those sales to offset all of the VAT it paid on the electricity purchased to produce
the merchandise sold in the third country. Accordingly, this resulted in a net cost to CBCC for the ICMS taxes paid in
the production of silicon metal sold for export. As such, the Department included the net amount of the ICMS VAT in the
submitted COP and CV amounts. 
This approach differs from that used in the Department's remand determination concerning the underlying investigation.
In that determination, we made an allowance for an offset to the ICMS VAT paid currently for potential VAT to be received
on future home market sales. Under this approach the ICMS was, in effect, excluded from the calculation of constructed
value. We have subsequently reconsidered this methodology and have concluded that allowing such an offset for potential,
future sales results in an adjustment that we now consider to be purely speculative. Accordingly, we will include
in CV ICMS on inputs that are not offset by VAT charged and collected on actual home market sales which occur during the
period of review. We believe our current approach better reflects the economic reality of the costs incurred during
the period of review (

i.e.

 current costs are not tied to potential future events). Our approach in this case is consistent with the 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Ferrosilicon from Brazil,

 59 FR 732, 737 (January 6, 1994). We believe this approach also is in accordance with the court's remand instructions
on this issue in 

Camargo Correa Metais, S.A. v. United States

, Slip. Op. 93-163 (CIT August 12, 1993).

Comment 7:

 Petitioners contend that CBCC made no provision in its calculation of charcoal costs for the effects of inflation
when CBCC harvested an area. Petitioners note that the Department requested additional documentation from CBCC
at verification regarding CBCC's estimates of charcoal harvest and the other assumptions CBCC built into its calculation
of charcoal cost. Petitioners contend that, because CBCC failed to provide information, the Department should apply
BIA. Petitioners argue that use of BIA is appropriate when a respondent refuses to submit information after being
asked to do so, and where the refusal to provide the requested information impedes the Department's proceeding. 
Petitioners contend that CBCC's failure to provide the appropriate information justifies the use of noncooperative
BIA for CBCC. Finally, if the Department determines not to use noncooperative BIA for CBCC, petitioners suggest that
the Department adjust CBCC's reported cost for company-produced charcoal upward to an amount equal to that charged
to CBCC from unrelated suppliers. 


Department's Position:

 We agree with petitioners that we should adjust CBCC's charcoal replacement costs. However, we disagree that CBCC
was noncooperative and should receive a margin based solely upon BIA. We discovered errors made by CBCC when it calculated
its cost of producing charcoal, a primary raw material used in the production of silicon metal. For purposes of calculating
replacement costs, CBCC substantially understated its cost of producing charcoal by inaccurately recording the
costs associated with its forests which provide the raw material needed to produce charcoal. We note, however, that
CBCC reported cost information consistent with that which is maintained in its normal cost accounting system. Therefore,
we have recalculated the cost of CBCC's production of charcoal. We relied upon the actual weighted-average monthly
cost CBCC was charged by unrelated vendors. 

Comment 8:

 Petitioners argue that the Department should revise CBCC's reported 1992 quartz replacement costs upward to account
for the more costly delivery charges the Department discovered at verification. 


Department's Position:

 At verification we noted that CBCC changed procedures for quartz purchasing in 1992. Because we found that CBCC's
reported quartz replacement costs for 1992 did not reflect the entire cost of the material, we randomly chose May 1992
as a sample to determine the amount of the discrepancy. In establishing the amount of the discrepancy, we valued all
quartz purchases received in May at the delivered price in effect for the region of origin. This reconciliation indicated
that CBCC's estimate of delivery charges for this month understated the per ton cost for quartz by approximately four
percent. Because CBCC did not fully report its quartz replacement costs, we have applied partial BIA for this material.
As BIA, we have adjusted upward the reported quartz prices reported for January through May 1992 by four percent. 


Comment 9:

 Petitioners contend that CBCC's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses is flawed. Petitioners note that
there is a large difference between the amount of silicon metal produced by CBCC and the amount of silicon metal sold
by CBCC. Petitioners also object to the limited data provided by CBCC for electrode paste and charcoal and argue that
CBCC's inclusion of a large year-end depreciation charge in December 1991 resulted in significantly understated
COPs for all but one month of the review period. 
Petitioners assert that, by using sales and production data provided by CBCC, petitioners have derived a corrected
inventory holding gain/loss calculation for CBCC. Petitioners contend that the Department should use petitioners'
revised calculation of CBCC's inventory holding gains/losses in the final results. 


Department's Position: 

We have reviewed CBCC's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses (see CBCC's February 24, 1993 submission
at Exhibit A) and have found certain inconsistencies which render that calculation unacceptable. For certain months
CBCC reported sales and shipments of silicon metal but showed no removal of silicon metal from inventory. In other
months, the tonnage of silicon metal removed from inventory was either much less or much greater than the amount of
merchandise that CBCC reported in its sales listings. 
Moreover, we find that petitioners' ``corrected'' calculation of CBCC's inventory gains/losses is also unacceptable
since it fails to account for finished silicon metal consumed in the production of other products. Accordingly, we
have rejected both CBCC's and petitioners' calculation of inventory gains/losses, and have removed this item from
our COP/CV calculations, which has the effect of increasing COP/CV. 


Comment 10:

 Petitioners argue that the Department should make an addition to CBCC's COP to account for certain costs (power, secondary
materials and crushing costs) which CBCC omitted from CBCC's revised COP/CV calculation. Petitioners note that
these expenses were included in CBCC's original COP/CV response. 
CBCC contends that power, secondary materials and crushing costs were included in its revised response under the
variable ``VARCOM.'' CBCC argues that it summarized these three costs in order to comply with the Department's reporting
requirements. 


Department's Position:

 Although the power, secondary materials and crushing costs were not detailed in CBCC's revised COP/CV calculations,
the total reported costs furnished by CBCC (variables ``TOTCOP'' and ``TOTCV'') did include these expenses. CBCC
did omit these items from the variables representing variable overhead, fixed overhead, and total variable cost
of manufacturing, 

i.e.,

 variables ``VARFOH'', ``FIXFOH'', and ``TOTCOM''. However, since CBCC included these expenses in its calculation
of total COM, no adjustment to CBCC's reported COP or CV is required. 


Comment 11: 

 Petitioners contend the Department should reject CBCC's allocation of general and administrative (G&A) and
selling expenses. (CBCC allocated these expenses to individual products using the ratio of each product's cost of
goods sold (COGS).) Petitioners contend that the Department should follow its established practice and allocate
these expenses to total COGS, as the Department did in the preliminary results of this review. 
CBCC suggests that the allocation of G&A and selling expenses used in the Department's preliminary calculations
results in a systematic overstatement of these expenses. CBCC argues that the Department should allocate the ratio
of G&A and selling expenses by the historical ratio of these expenses to historical COM. CBCC notes that the Department
followed this methodology in the redetermination of the original investigation for this proceeding (see 

Silicon Metal from Brazil: Preliminary Determination on Remand,

 (November 17, 1993, at 5).

<PARENT> FR940819-2-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Department's Position:

 G&A expenses are period expenses which are normally measured over a fiscal year. As such, the Department calculated
G&A on an annual historical basis. In order to avoid overstating G&A expenses and to neutralize hyperinflationary
effects, we applied the G&A ratio (

i.e.,

 the ratio of annual G&A expenses to cost of goods sold reflected in the financial statements) to each month's COM
calculated on a historical basis. In addition, CBCC had failed to include Solvay do Brasil's G&A expenses. Therefore,
we applied a portion of Solvay do Brasil's G&A in the final calculation of these costs (see CBCC Calculation Adjustment
Memorandum, February 2, 1994). This is consistent with the method we used to calculate G&A expenses in the remand
determination in the underlying investigation. 


Comment 12:

 Petitioners contend that the Department should include ICMS and IPI taxes in the calculation of CBCC's raw material
costs. Petitioners contend that these taxes are included on home market sales, and must, therefore, be included in
the COP of home market merchandise. 


Department's Position:

 Petitioners' argument that ICMS and IPI taxes are included on home market sales is not relevant since CBCC's home market
sales were insufficient to form a basis for FMV and, therefore, FMV was based upon third country sales. However, we
agree that, since the ICMS and IPI taxes resulted in a net cost to CBCC, the Department should include this net amount
of ICMS and IPI in the submitted COP and CV amounts. Our reasoning for doing so is discussed further in our response to
comment 6, which involved a similar situation. 


Comment 13:

 Petitioners argue that the Department failed to include CBCC's and Minasligas's imputed credit expenses in the preliminary
CV calculations. Petitioners argue that the Department should make an adjustment for imputed credit in the final
calculations. 


Department's Position:

 We agree with petitioners. In these final results we have included CBCC's and Minasligas's imputed credit costs in
our calculation of CV. We based this adjustment on the credit expenses that these companies incurred on home market
or third-country sales. 



Comment 14:

 Petitioners contend that the Department should use the quartz replacement costs reported by Minasligas in its original
COP/CV response rather than the costs reported in Minasligas's revised response of November 9, 1993. Minasligas
provided average quartz delivery charges in its revised COP/CV response. Petitioners note that the Department's
verification report indicates that averaging freight charges significantly understates Minasligas's type A quartz
costs. 
Minasligas contends that, while the corrected cost data may result in lower delivered prices for type A quartz, the
revised data result in significantly lower overall replacement costs for that material. Minasligas indicates that
it does not object to use of the quartz replacement costs reported in its original COP/CV response, and notes that the
Department used these costs in the preliminary calculations. 


Department's Position:

 We agree with petitioners. As discussed in the cost verification report (December 17, 1993), the revised costs calculated
by Minasligas and filed with the Department on November 9, 1993 reflect a methodology which understates the delivered
cost of type A quartz, by allocating the delivery charges among all quartz purchases. Accordingly, we have rejected
the revised replacement cost for quartz and relied upon the cost information Minasligas reported in its original
COP/CV response. As Minasligas notes, this is the information we used in reaching the preliminary results of review.



Comment 15:

 Petitioners state that the Department determined at verification that Minasligas did not include forest amortization
costs in its calculation of charcoal replacement costs. Petitioners argue that omission of these expenses significantly
understates the cost of the charcoal which Minasligas produced. Petitioners contend that the Department should
use the costs associated with Minasligas's purchase of charcoal from unrelated suppliers in the final calculation
of charcoal replacement costs. 
Minasligas argues that the charcoal replacement costs it reported in its original COP/CV response were exclusively
based on the delivered price charged to the company by suppliers cutting trees on land that Minasligas did not own.
Minasligas contends that it pays less for charcoal cut from trees on its own land, and that its corrected charcoal costs
are significantly lower than those reported in its original COP/CV response. Minasligas 
indicates that the Department should use the charcoal replacement costs reported in its original COP/CV response,
if the Department decides not to use the corrected charcoal replacement costs supplied by Minasligas. 


Department's Position:

 We agree with petitioners. As discussed in the cost verification report (December 17, 1993), the revised costs calculated
by Minasligas and filed with the Department on November 9, 1993 reflect a methodology which understates the replacement
cost of charcoal by averaging the payment to subcontractors for charcoal obtained from company-owned land with the
higher costs from unrelated charcoal vendors. This calculation does not include any cost to Minasligas for acquiring
forests or planting and maintaining forests. Accordingly, we have rejected the revised replacement cost for charcoal
and relied upon the cost information provided by Minasligas in its original COP/CV response.

Comment 16: 

Petitioners contend that the Department found at verification that Minasligas had not accurately accounted for
loss allowances for quartz and charcoal used in 1991 silicon metal production. Petitioners contend that the Department
should make an upward adjustment to Minasligas's reported 1991 quartz and charcoal costs to account for this expense.
Petitioners suggest that the Department use the loss allowances provided by Minasligas for 1992 silicon metal production
to make this adjustment. 
Minasligas contends that the question of whether quartz and charcoal losses were understated prior to 1992 is irrelevant
because Minasligas had no U.S. sales during that time. Minasligas notes that it did provide an acceptable calculation
for charcoal and quartz losses for 1992. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with the petitioners that, prior to 1992, the measured consumption of charcoal and quartz into the furnace
was not consistently and scientifically adjusted to reflect losses sustained between the time the material was delivered
into the factory stockyard and introduced into a furnace. Beginning in 1992, Minasligas established a loss allowance
and consistently applied it to both quartz and charcoal. For 1991 quartz and charcoal, Minasligas estimated loss
allowances and recorded them on an occasional basis. We have recalculated loss allowances for 1991 based upon BIA.
As BIA, we have used the loss allowance established by the company in 1992 and applied this percentage to both quartz
and charcoal consumption for all months in 1991. We disagree with Minasligas's assertion that the 1991 costs are irrelevant,
since they are used to determine whether home market sales were sold at or above their COP. 


Comment 17: 

Petitioners contend that the Department should allocate Minasligas's consumption of iron rods and tubes over all
months of the period of review, instead of accepting Minasligas's approach. (Minasligas recognized the entire expense
associated with these charges in the month in which they were requisitioned out of inventory.) Petitioners suggest
that for those months for which Minasligas did not report iron rods and tube costs, the Department should use the per-unit
output costs for rods and 
tubes from the most recent month with an adjustment for inflation. 
Minasligas contends that allocating the consumption of rods and tubes over the period of review would only marginally
change the cost of materials for the month that Minasligas had a U.S. sale. Minasligas contends that more rods were
requisitioned during that month than were consumed. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners that it is more accurate to allocate the number of rods and tubes removed from inventory to
production tons over the period in which they were consumed, rather than just the month of requisition. Accordingly,
we have reallocated the total rods and tubes consumed during the period of review equally to tons produced during this
same time period. Each month's allocated consumption quantity was then valued at the reported replacement cost for
that same month. We also agree with Minasligas that this adjustment does not have a serious impact on the reported cost
information. 


Comment 18: 

Petitioners assert that verification revealed that Minasligas's supplier measures electricity from the fifth
of one month to the fifth of the following month. Petitioners further argue that Minasligas used the invoice received
from its supplier on approximately the tenth of the month to represent the electricity costs for that month. Petitioners
contend that such a methodology understates the replacement costs for electricity since it primarily reflects the
costs incurred during the previous month. Petitioners contend that for each month of the review period the Department
should use the electricity costs reported by Minasligas for the following month.

Department's Position: 

We agree with the petitioners. Minasligas reported the replacement cost of monthly electricity for the month in which
the bill was received. Each month's bill reflects the cost of electricity purchased in the prior month. Therefore,
the reported replacement cost of electricity is understated since it lags the actual cost by one month. We have corrected
for this understatement by matching each month's bill with the month that it covered. 


Comment 19: 

Petitioners contend that Minasligas's allocation of G&A expenses is incorrect. (Minasligas allocated monthly
G&A expenses to individual products based upon the number of furnaces used in the production of each product.)
Petitioners contend that the Department should allocate G&A expenses to total COGS as was done in the preliminary
results. 
Minasligas contends that a larger portion of its operation is devoted to ferrosilicon than to silicon metal. Minasligas
contends that allocating G&A expenses to total COGS overstates the amount of G&A expenses relating to silicon
metal. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners. G&A expenses are period expenses which relate to the operation of the company as a whole
and are not customarily associated with a particular product or process. Therefore, we recalculated G&A expenses
on a company-wide annual historical basis and, in order to avoid overstating G&A expenses and to neutralize hyperinflationary
effects, we applied the G&A ratio to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis. 


Comment 20: 

Petitioners contend that the Department should calculate Minasligas's interest expense as the consolidated expenses
of Minasligas and Delp Engenharia S.A. (Delp). Petitioners note that Delp controls over 93 percent of Minasligas's
common stock and thus has a controlling interest in Minasligas. Petitioners suggest that the Department use Delp's
1991 and 1992 financial statements to perform this calculation. 
Minasligas contends that Delp and Minasligas are separate entities, maintain separate financial statements, and
have their own interest expense and income. Therefore, Minasligas asserts that it would be improper to calculate
interest expense on a consolidated basis. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners that Minasligas should report interest expense on a consolidated basis. See our response
to comment 2. 
In the case of Minasligas, Delp does not consolidate its accounts with Minasligas. In addition, because there are
no significant intercompany transactions between the two companies, we combined the financial expenses of the two
companies and calculated an interest expense as a ratio to cost of sales, effectively creating consolidated accounts.
The Department only allows income generated from investments of working capital, which the company documents as
short-term in nature, to offset interest expense (see, 

e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Cellular Mobile Telephones from Japan, 

54 FR 45447, 45455 (October 31, 1985), and 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan, 

55 FR 335, 342 (January 4, 1990)). Minasligas was able to substantiate only a portion of the investments to be short-term;
consequently, we have allowed only the documented portion of interest income as an offset. We did not allow an offset
to Minasligas's parent, Delp, for interest expense because the information required to substantiate such an adjustment
is not contained in the record of this review. 
In order to avoid overstating financing charges, we applied the interest expense ratio (

i.e., 

the ratio of net interest expense to cost of goods sold) to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis rather
than to amounts computed under the replacement cost basis. This is consistent with the methodology used in the remand
determination in the underlying investigation. 


Comment 21: 

Petitioners contend that Minasligas did not submit information regarding short-term interest income at the consolidated,
parent company level. Accordingly, the petitioners contend that it is not feasible to ``compute interest expense
using the sum of Minasligas's and Delp's financial expenses adjusted for intercompany interest transactions'',
as suggested by the Department's cost verification report. Finally, petitioners assert that the Department should
apply this allocation to COM to properly account for Brazilian hyperinflation. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners that the record does not contain information regarding short-term interest income at Minasligas's
parent company, Delp. Accordingly, we have not allowed any such offset for Delp's interest income in our calculation
of combined interest expense. Consistent with our practice in the 

Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Fair Value; Ferrosilicon from Brazil, 

59 FR 732, 736-737, January 6, 1994, we have applied the calculated interest expense ratio to the monthly COMs
calculated on a historical basis rather than amounts computed under the replacement cost basis. 


Comment 22: 

Petitioners contend that Minasligas's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses is flawed because Minasligas
failed to properly ``layer'' inventory according to the month that the merchandise was placed in inventory. Petitioners
contend that Minasligas's calculation reflects one level of inventory even though Minasligas held merchandise
in inventory for at least two preceding months. Petitioners contend that this flaw makes Minasligas's calculation
unusable. Accordingly, petitioners contend that the Department should disregard Minasligas's calculation, and
make no adjustment for inventory holding gain or loss in the final COP calculations. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with petitioners. Minasligas's calculation of inventory holding gains/losses did not account for merchandise
that spent multiple months in inventory. Accordingly, we have rejected Minasligas's claimed inventory holding
gain.

Comment 23: 

Petitioners contend that the Department should disallow the portion of Minasligas's duty drawback claim pertaining
to IPI and ICMS taxes. Petitioners contend that these expenses are taxes, not duties. Petitioners also note that these
two taxes were not listed in the duty drawback regulations provided by Minasligas. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with petitioners. Article 314 of the Brazilian Customs Regulations provides for the ``suspension of
payments of 

tributes

 due when importing merchandise to be exported * * *.'' (Emphasis added.) The suspension is not limited
to customs duties. It includes all ``tributes'' paid upon importation of the merchandise. IPI and ICMS taxes incurred
on imported electrodes are two such tributes which are suspended upon exportation of the merchandise. Thus, Minasligas
correctly included these expenses in its claimed adjustment for duty drawback. 



Comment 24: 

Petitioners contend that the Department should use adverse, noncooperative BIA for RIMA. Petitioners make reference
to the Department's December 22, 1993 verification report regarding RIMA's COP/CV response. That report indicated
that RIMA: (1) Was unwilling to supply the Department with necessary worksheets, schedules, or source documents,
(2) that the aspect of RIMA's COP/CV response pertaining to related party transactions, G&A expenses, finance
costs, and profit were not verified, (3) that RIMA's calculation of charcoal and quartz costs were not reflective
of monthly replacement costs, and (4) that RIMA did not adjust the value of its electrode purchases to account for inflation.


Petitioners assert that the verification report indicates that RIMA based its cost response on a managerial cost
accounting system that was not used for purposes of valuing inventory in the financial statements. As such, petitioners
contend that RIMA's submitted cost information could not be reconciled with RIMA's financial statements. According
to petitioners, the verification report also indicates that RIMA based its calculation of labor hours on theoretical
times and that actual labor hours exceeded these theoretical hours by a significant amount. Finally, petitioners
find that the Department determined that RIMA's COP response did not account for costs associated with write-downs
or obsolescence. 

Petitioners contend that RIMA's refusal to provide requested information significantly impeded the completion
of this review. In accordance with the Department's practice, petitioners argue that the Department should assign
as BIA the higher of the highest prior margin established for any company or the highest margin determined in this administrative
review. 



Department's Position: 

At verification we encountered serious and pervasive problems in our efforts to verify the information submitted
by RIMA. We found that these problems were so extensive that we could not test major areas of the response. For those
areas we tested, we found significant discrepancies in the amounts reported, in addition to a lack of sufficient data
to corroborate the response. We outlined the major deficiencies that we found during verification in the public version
of the cost verification report (December 22, 1993) and the RIMA calculation memorandum, both of which are on file
in the Central Records Unit. 

Under these circumstances, the Department cannot properly base its determination on the information submitted
by RIMA. The Department cannot be placed in the position of having to identify and perform numerous and substantial
revisions to develop accurate cost data, if indeed such revisions were even possible in this case. As stated in 

Photo Albums and Filler Pages From Korea; Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 

50 FR 43754, 43755-43756 (October 29, 1985):




It is the obligation of respondents to provide an accurate and complete response prior to verification so that the
Department may have the opportunity to analyze fully the information and other parties are able to review and comment
on it. Verification is intended to establish the accuracy and completeness of a response rather than to supplement
and reconstruct the information to fit the requirements of the Department.




Therefore, for the reasons stated above, we have determined that rejection of the cost response submitted by RIMA
is appropriate for these final results and is consistent with past practice (see, 

e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Antifriction Bearings (Other Than tapered Roller Bearings)
and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, et al..,

 54 FR 18992 (May 3, 1989), 31704-31709, and 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber From Taiwan,


55 FR 34586 (August 23, 1990, 34586-34587)). 

In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we use BIA in cases where a party refuses or is unable to produce
information in a timely manner and in the form required. The Department generally uses a two-tiered approach in its
choice of BIA. For uncooperative respondents, the Department uses the higher of: (1) The highest rate for any company
from the original investigation or a prior administrative review, or (2) the highest rate found in the current review
for any company. For respondents that attempt to cooperate, the Department uses the higher of: (1) The highest rate
ever applicable to the firm for the subject merchandise, or (2) the highest calculated rate in the current review for
any firm (see 

Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from France, et al., Final Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 

58 FR 39729, 39739, July 26, 1993).

RIMA responded to our questionnaire and to each of our requests for supplemental information. Therefore, we have
determined that RIMA attempted to cooperate, even though it was unable to substantiate much of the information contained
in its COP/CV response. Since RIMA attempted to cooperate, we have applied a rate of 91.06 percent, the highest rate
ever applicable to RIMA for the subject merchandise (see 

Silicon Metal from Brazil, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 

56 FR 26972, June 12, 1991). 

 

Comment 25: 

Petitioners contend that it is the Department's established practice to exclude from the dumping calculations sales
that were sold during the review period but shipped outside the period of review. Because Eletrosilex's only sale
was shipped after the close of this review period, petitioners argue that Eletrosilex had no sales subject to review
for the current 1991-1992 administrative review. Petitioners contend that the Department should maintain
the 91.06 percent all others rate for 
Eletrosilex since this constitutes the most recent information available for Eletrosilex. Petitioners note that
in 

Asahi Chemical Indus. Co., Ltd. 

v. 

United States, 

585 F. Supp 1261, 1267 (CIT 1982), the CIT held that when there were no shipments during the period of review, the Department
uses the most recent information to determine margins. 






Department's Position: 

We disagree. Section 353.22(b) of our regulations stipulates that administrative reviews ``normally will cover,
as appropriate, entries or sales of the merchandise during the 12 months immediately preceding the most recent anniversary
month.'' 

We based this review upon sales because (1) the selling price and each of the expenses associated with this sale were
known by Eletrosilex and reported to the Department at an early stage of the review process, and (2) use of this sale
in our margin calculations constitutes the most accurate reflection of Eletrosilex's pricing practices during
the review period. Moreover, we note that we have based some other administrative reviews upon sales rather than entries
(see 

Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan, Final Results of Administrative Review, 

56 FR 56393, 53697, November 4, 1991, and 

Gray Portland Cement and Clinker from Japan, Final Results of Administrative Review, 

58 FR 48826, 48832, September 20, 1993). Finally, we note that the question addressed in 

Asahi 

was whether we could conduct an administrative review in the absence of exports, entries or sales during the period
of review. In this case, Eletrosilex clearly had sales during the period of review. 



Comment 26: 

CBCC and RIMA contend that the Department violated the statute and the regulations by failing to publish the final
results of review by July 31, 1993. CBCC and RIMA note that section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act stipulates that the Department
will issue a final determination ``(A)t least once during each 12-month period'', and that  353.22(c)(7) of
the regulations indicates that the Department will publish a final determination ``not later than 365 days after
the anniversary month.'' 

CBCC and RIMA contend that the Department abused its discretion by conducting a verification of sales and cost data
since these verifications further delayed the issuance of the final results. CBCC and RIMA suggest that the final
results should be based upon the record that existed on July 31, 1993, and that the record at that time indicated no dumping
margins for either company. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree. The CIT has determined that the completion of administrative reviews within the one-year time period
is ``directory'' rather than ``mandatory'' (see 

Koyo Seiko Co., 

v. 

United States, 

796 F. Supp. 517,523 (CIT 1992)). While we strive to complete administrative reviews within a year, the issuance of
our final results is sometimes delayed by other regulatory and statutory requirements associated with the administration
of the antidumping law. 

In this case, petitioners demonstrated that ``good cause'' existed for verification pursuant to 19 C.F.R.  353.22(c)
and 353.36(a). Specifically, petitioners noted potential deficiencies in the replacement cost data provided by
CBCC and RIMA. Because ``good cause'' existed for verification, our decision to verify the COP responses of CBCC and
RIMA was appropriate. 



Comment 27: 

Minasligas indicates that it agrees with the statement in the Department's cost verification report (December 17,
1993) that an allocation of direct and indirect labor, maintenance, and other overhead items based upon production
quantity would result in lower fabrication charges than those reported in its questionnaire response. (Minasligas
allocated these charges on the number of furnaces in its COP/CV response.)

<DOCNO> FR940819-2-00030 </DOCNO>

Department's Position: 

Consistent with our finding in the 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Ferrosilicon from Brazil, 

59 FR 732, 739, January 6, 1994, we have determined that the number of furnaces is not an adequate basis for allocating
labor or other fabrication costs. The number of furnaces in a facility is an arbitrary measure which does not necessarily
reflect the actual level of labor and overhead expended in the production of the subject merchandise. In the instant
case, output tons is a more accurate allocation basis because these costs are directly related to production amounts.
Therefore, we have revised the submitted costs to reflect an allocation based on actual production units. 



Comment 28: 

Eletrosilex contends that the Department incorrectly based its conversions of certain cruzeiro-denominated expenses
(inland freight, port charges, ocean freight, warehousing, and packing) on the U.S. sale date. Eletrosilex argues
that the Department's policy in countries with hyperinflationary economies is to base currency conversions on the
date that the expenses were incurred. Eletrosilex requests that the Department follow this policy with respect to
the conversion into dollars of the cruzeiro-denominated expenses outlined above. 



Department's Position: 

We agree. As is our standard practice in cases where the economy is hyperinflationary, we based our currency conversions
on the date that the cost was incurred, rather than on the date of the U.S. sale (see 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Industrial Nitrocellulose from Yugoslavia 

(55 FR 34946, 34949, August 27, 1990), and 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Oil Country Tubular Goods from Israel 

(52 FR 1511, 1513, January 14, 1987)). We have adjusted our final calculations for Eletrosilex accordingly. 



Comment 29: 

Eletrosilex contends that the allocation of G&A and selling expenses that the Department used in its preliminary
results is improper because it does not accurately reflect Eletrosilex's experience as a silicon metal producer
and seller during the period of review. Eletrosilex notes that the Department relied upon the 1991 financial statement
to perform this calculation, and that these financial statements do not fully reflect Eletrosilex's experience
for the review period. Eletrosilex contends 1991 was an ``aberrational year'' in which it incurred G&A and selling
expenses which were unrelated to the production of silicon metal. 

Eletrosilex indicates that on March 10, 1993, it submitted total G&A and selling expenses by month for every month
included in the period of review. Eletrosilex urges the Department to derive G&A and selling expenses by summing
all selling expenses and dividing the total amount of these expenses by the total COM that Eletrosilex reported for
the period March 29, 1991 through June 30, 1992. 



Department's Position: 

As noted in our response to Comment 11, our current practice in cases in which the economy is hyperinflationary is to
apply the G&A and selling expenses ratio to each month's COM calculated on a historical basis. We did not ask Eletrosilex
to supply historical COM information in this review. Accordingly, as a reasonable alternative to our current practice,
we have summed all selling expenses reported by Eletrosilex for the period of review, and divided this total amount
by the total COM that Eletrosilex reported for the review period. 



Comment 30: 

RIMA contends that the Department's December 22, 1993 COP/CV verification report incorrectly characterized its
personnel as ``unwilling'' to supply worksheets, schedules, and source documents. RIMA states that it cooperated
with the verification team and that the difficulties encountered during the verification were due to: (1) The fact
that the verification outline was not made available to RIMA until a week before commencement of the verification,
(2) the company had never previously undergone a verification, (3) there had been a good deal of turnover in the company
and the personnel responsible for the verification did not participate in the preparation of the response, and (4)
the verification began on Saturday, continued through Sunday, and a Brazilian national holiday.

<TEXT>
 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with RIMA. RIMA's suggestion that the company's problems relate to having only one week of preparation
time after receipt of the verification agenda is completely erroneous. The verification outline was in fact released
to counsel for RIMA on October 28, 1993, and verification of RIMA's cost response began on November 13, 1993. Thus the
agenda was available more than two weeks prior to the start of verification. Further, the verification agenda merely
indicates the Department's approach to performing the verification. Any suggestion that the company did not realize
the Department intended to review the underlying source documents is unsupported. The fact that the Department is
particularly concerned with each company's methodology for linking the cost response to its cost and financial accounting
system is indicated in the Department's questionnaire (September 1, 1992), which requires the company to provide
detailed explanations of this connection. The questionnaire also instructed company personnel to contact the Department
if for any reason they did not intend to rely on the company's cost accounting records to prepare the response (September
1, 1992 at page 53). 

RIMA's further assertions that the company's problems related to conducting verification on a weekend and a lack
of verification experience are not persuasive. Company personnel and their counsel knew well in advance of the need
to schedule verification time on the weekends; in fact, counsel for each of the respondents, including counsel for
RIMA, provided input in setting the verification schedule for this case. It should also be noted that the Department's
personnel conducting the verification noted no improvement in the company's ability to provide verification support
as the verification progressed into the regular work week. Indeed we know of no reasons why it would improve on a particular
day of the week since the information the Department requested should be available within the company, and all of the
company personnel who participated in the verification were available on the weekend. 

It is not unusual for a respondent to be unfamiliar with the verification process and the Department does not expect
such experience. However, if company personnel are unable to explain the methodology followed in preparing the response
and provide the source documents which were relied upon, we are not able to conclude that this is simply a result of being
unfamiliar with the verification process. 



Comment 31: 

RIMA argues that it used a reasonable methodology to report quartz and charcoal costs. RIMA contends that it used its
financial accounting system to price these inputs because (1) its cost system does not use replacement values, and
(2) the cost system was subject to distortions that were known to RIMA's management. Moreover, RIMA argues that the
variations between these two cost systems were minor, and that RIMA provided the most accurate information in its
COP/CV response that it could. 

RIMA argues that the COP/CV verification report indicates that RIMA's production standard specifies the use of specific
types of charcoal and quartz. However, RIMA, in practice, sometimes used other types of these materials, depending
on availability. RIMA contends that use of these other materials resulted in a lower calculated cost than RIMA reported
in its COP/CV response. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with RIMA's assertions that its reported material cost were overstated. As discussed in the cost verification
report, the monthly replacement costs noted for certain of the materials actually used in production were higher
than the unit costs for the specific materials which RIMA had indicated were used in production. Thus these unit prices
were understated. 



Comment 32: 

RIMA asserts that it provided ``critical source documentation'' concerning the quantity of inputs used in the production
of silicon metal, contrary to the assertion of the Department's verification report. RIMA contends that during the
verification it made the ``underlying statistical measurements'' available for inspection by the verification
team. RIMA argues that it should not be expected to produce daily or hourly source documents because of the great volume
of papers involved. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with RIMA's contention that it provided source documents. We also disagree with RIMA's assertion that
we expected the company to provide daily or hourly source documents. RIMA was expected to provide an accurate response
to the Department's specific requests for information. As discussed in the Department's verification report (December
22, 1993), prior to verification RIMA completely failed to indicate the true nature of its cost and financial accounting
systems, and even stated that the systems reflect the same costs. RIMA also indicated that its cost accounting system
was relied upon in preparing the submitted cost information. We found each of these assertions to be inaccurate. 

Although RIMA was able to provide pages of graphs which purportedly reflected the actual material consumption, RIMA
was unable to reconcile this information to either the cost or financial accounting system. Thus, the reported material
consumption quantities were presented to the Department quite literally in a complete vacuum, merely a handful of
graphs, unreconcilable to any other recorded measure of material consumption. This was the extent of the underlying
statistical measurements which were made available to the Department for inspection. 

As discussed in our response to comment 24, the discrepancies noted in the material quantity input together with other
significant inconsistencies have caused us to reject RIMA's cost submission.

Comment 33: 

RIMA argues that it is unfair for the Department to penalize the company for having a cost accounting system that does
not tie to its financial accounting system. RIMA contends that its former cost accounting system was not designed
to tie into its financial accounting system, and argues that rejection of its response is equivalent to a penalty for
providing accurate data. 


Department's Position: 

The Department is not penalizing RIMA for having any particular type of accounting system. RIMA's cost information
was rejected for the specific reasons which are outlined in the public version of the cost verification report and
the calculation memorandum. We found that these problems were so extensive that major areas of the response could
not be tested. For those areas which were tested we found significant discrepancies in the amounts reported, in addition
to a lack of sufficient data to corroborate the response. 
Finally, we are unable to understand RIMA's argument that rejection of its response is equivalent to a penalty for
providing accurate data. The record does not begin to establish that the information provided by RIMA is accurate
in any way. 


Comment 34: 

RIMA argues that the Department's COP/CV verification report erroneously characterized the reported labor hours
as ``theoretical'' rather than ``actual''. RIMA states that it used its statistical process control reports to calculate
labor expense, and asserts that this constitutes a more accurate way of reporting this expense than would have been
reflected in RIMA's ``managerial'' costing system. 


Department's Position: 

We disagree that the cost verification report provides an erroneous characterization. The Department's cost verification
report outlines the findings at verification. As the report indicates, the analysis upon which the reported labor
cost was based is no longer performed by RIMA and was never used for any purpose other than the company's submission.
Based upon the company's inability to relate this analysis to any other recorded measure of costs, we cannot conclude
that the information provided reflected a ``more accurate'' measure of the costs. 


Comment 35: 

RIMA argues that it properly did not report several of the home market transactions characterized as ``unreported
sales'' in the Department's December 20, 1993 sales verification report. RIMA contends that commercial samples
and intracompany transfers are not ``sales'' and should not have been reported. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with RIMA that several of the home market transactions which are characterized as unreported sales in our
December 23, 1993 verification report were in fact commercial samples or intracompany transfers. We note, however,
that our determination to use BIA for RIMA was based upon RIMA's inability to provide reliable cost data. The commercial
samples and intracompany transfers referenced in the December 23, 1993 sales verification report were not factors
in our decision to use BIA for RIMA. 


Comment 36: 

RIMA argues that the home market sales that it did not report made no difference in the determination of market viability
or foreign market value. 


Department's Position: 

As noted in our response to comment 24 we used BIA for RIMA because RIMA was unable to provide reliable cost data. Thus,
the question of whether these unreported sales would have made a difference in the determination of foreign market
value is moot. 


Addendum 
We have made an additional change in our analysis for these final results: We have amended our COP calculations to adjust
for the amount of the Brazilian inflation that was factored into the home market selling price. To make this adjustment,
we compared Minasligas's and Eletrosilex's selling prices to their respective COPs in effect as of the date of payment
rather than the date of sale.

Final Results of Review 


As a result of our analysis of the comments received, we determine that the following margins exist for the period March
9, 1991 through June 30, 1992: 


 

The Department shall determine, and Customs shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual
differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement
instructions directly to Customs. 
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of these final results of administrative
review for all shipments of silicon metal from Brazil entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or
after the publication date, as provided by Section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, and will remain in effect until the
final results of the next administrative review: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed companies will be those
listed above, (2) for previously investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit will continue to be the
company-specific rate published for the most recent period, (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review,
or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the
most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise, and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers
or exporters will be the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation of this case,
in accordance with the CIT's decisions in Floral Trade Council v. United States, 

Slip Op. 93-79 (CIT May 25, 1993), and 

Federal Mogul Corporation and Torrington Company v. United States, 

Slip. Op. 93-83 (CIT May 25, 1993). The all others rate is 91.06 percent. These deposit requirements, when imposed,
shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. 
This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. 
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with Section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22 (1993).

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications to operate its Alaska Minority Business Development Center (MBDC). 


The purpose of the MBDC Program is to provide business development services to the minority business community to
help establish and maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate
public and private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of client services
to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority business.
The MBDC will provide service in the Anchorage Metropolitan Statistical Area. The award number of the MBDC will be
10-10-95005-01.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months)
from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1995, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount is $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share of 15% $29,846 in
non-federal (cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may
be in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations
thereof. 


The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(25 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. 
The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business. 
Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities. 
Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. Federal funds for this project include audit funds for non-CPA recipients.
In the event that a CPA firm wins the competition, the funds allocated for audits are not applicable. Questions concerning
the preceding information can be answered by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application kits and
applicable regulations can be obtained at the above address. The collection of information requirements for this
project have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights of the White House Information Infrastructure Task Force has issued
a preliminary draft of its report, ``Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure,'' and
is soliciting public comment. Copies of the preliminary report may be obtained by calling the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office at (703) 305-9300 or by sending a written request to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, Box 4, Washington, DC 20231, marked to the attention to Terri A. Southwick, Office of

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner
of Patents and Trademarks, Bruce A. Lehman, was established as part of the White House Information Infrastructure
Task Force. The Task Force, chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, was created to work with Congress and
the private sector to develop comprehensive telecommunications and information policies aimed at articulating
and implementing the Administration's vision for the National Information Infrastructure (NII).



Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure: A Preliminary Draft of the Report of the Working
Group on Intellectual Property Rights represents the Working Group's examination and analysis to date of the intellectual
property implications of the NII, and includes the Group's draft findings and recommendations. While it addresses
each of the major areas of intellectual property law, including patent, trademark and trade secret, the preliminary
report focuses primarily on copyright law and its application and effectiveness in the context of the NII.

 Proposed Additions to and Deletion from Procurement List. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Committee has received proposals to add to the 
Procurement List commodities and services to be furnished by 
nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other 
severe disabilities, and to delete a commodity previously 
furnished by such agencies. 




COMMENTS MUST BE RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE:

 September 19, 1994. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice is published pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 47(a)(2) and 41 CFR 51-2-3. Its purpose is to provide interested
persons an opportunity to submit comments on the possible impact of the 
proposed actions. 



Additions: 


If the Committee approves the proposed addition, all entities of the Federal Government (except as otherwise indicated)
will be required to procure the commodities and services listed below from nonprofit agencies employing persons
who are blind or have other severe disabilities. 
I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
major factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and services.

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and services to the Government.

4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement
List. Comments on this certification are invited. 
Commenters should identify the statement(s) underlying the certification on which they are providing additional
information. The following commodities and services have been proposed for addition to Procurement List for production
by the nonprofit agencies listed:

ACTION:

 Additions to the procurement list.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List commodities and 
services to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons 
who are blind or have other severe disabilities.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On November 5, 1993, April 22, June 3 and 24, 1994, the 
Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely 
Disabled published notices (58 FR 39013, 59 FR 19164, 28847 
and 32686) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. 
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the 
additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee 
has determined that the commodities and services listed below are 
suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 
46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 



I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
commodities and services to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the commodities and services. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the commodities and services to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the commodities and services 
proposed for addition to the Procurement List. 
Accordingly, the following commodities and services are hereby 
added to the Procurement List:

<DOCTITLE>Procurement List; Additions </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>

 Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or 
Severely Disabled.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Additions to the procurement list.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List commodities to 
be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind 
or have other severe disabilities. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 17, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are 
Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 FR 31218) 
proposed addition to the Procurement List. 


Comments were received from two cap manufacturers. Both firms 
noted the serious decline in military uniform headwear purchases of 
recent years and indicated that the loss of any more headwear items 
from competitive purchasing would further reduce the competitive 
market and increase their chances of going out of business. 
The Committee is aware of the decline in Government purchasing of 
clothing items. However, it should be noted that nonprofit 
agencies participating in the Committee's program which produce 
military uniform items are also experiencing the results of this 
decline, and their employees with severe disabilities have 
traditionally had higher rates of unemployment, and thus more 
difficulty in securing other work, than workers without disabilities employed by commercial uniform item manufacturers.
The 
nonprofit agency which will produce the cap under the Committee's 
program is also recovering from the employment losses caused by a 
severe hurricane which closed the military base on which the agency 
was performing other contracts under the Committee's program. 
It should also be noted that neither of the commenters is currently 
producing the cap for the Government, as the current competitive 
contract was won by the nonprofit agency which will produce the cap 
under the Committee's program. Accordingly, the commenters will 
not lose anything they currently have, other than a chance to bid 
on future competitive contracts for the cap. Because there is no 
guarantee under the competitive bidding system that any particular 
company will get a contract, the Committee does not consider the 
loss of this chance to constitute severe adverse impact on a 
company. 
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
commodity, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the 
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
that the commodity listed below are suitable for procurement by 
the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
commodities to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the commodities. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the commodities to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the commodities proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 
Accordingly, the following commodities are hereby added to the 
Procurement List: 


Cap, Garrison, Women's

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation) is announcing that it is seeking flagship television
stations to assist AmeriCorps programs with recruitment and community awareness.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Corporation is a new government corporation that encompasses the work and staff of two previously existing federal
agencies, the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans
of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service. This service will address the nation's education, public
safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation
will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide education opportunity
for those who make a substantial commitment to service.




The Corporation is establishing a new national service initiative called AmeriCorps that includes a wide variety
of programs operated by grantees which will be local and national non-profits, state and local government agencies,
Indian tribes and territories. The Corporation will also support service-learning initiatives for elementary
and secondary schools and institutions of higher education called Learn and Serve America and operate the senior
volunteers programs previously supported by ACTION. Some of the national service programs will be operating this
summer, and most of the others will be operational by this fall.

The Corporation is striving to build partnerships between AmeriCorps programs and television stations in order
to promote national service. Through this partnership, television stations will help further national service
by assisting AmeriCorps programs with community awareness and recruitment and educating the American public about
the impact of national service via public service announcements and an educational documentary. To achieve this
end, the Corporation requests that television stations nationwide volunteer to serve as flagship television stations
to help promote AmeriCorps programs and national service.

All interested television stations should contact Wendy Grassi at (202) 606-5000 extension 262. Ms. Grassi
will provide further information about existing AmeriCorps programs and how to become a flagship television station
for AmeriCorps programs.

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Proposed North Expansion of Kennecott Copper's
Tailings Impoundment in Salt Lake County, UT</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Kennecott Copper proposes to expand their current tailings impoundment by an additional 3,500 acres. The present
tailings impoundment is reaching its storage capacity. Kennecott projects the need to store an additional 1.9 billion
tons of tailings in order for operation and production to continue throughout the life of the mine. In addition, Kennecott
has identified the need for a seismic upgrade of the existing impoundment. The intended location of the expanded facility
and its design is projected to meet this need. Construction of the north expansion will require a Department of the
Army permit pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The Corps of Engineers, as the lead Federal agency for this
project, has determined that an Environmental Impact Statement will be required prior to making a permit decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Kennecott Copper owns and operates the Bingham Canyon Mine 30 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah within the Oquirrh
Mountains. Copper ore is mined from an open pit mine and processed at the concentrator, smelter and refinery facilities.
Annual production of copper from the facility is over 250,000 tons annually, Tailings, the end-product of the process,
are disposed in a slurry to an existing impoundment.




The existing impoundment's footprint covers approximately 5,700 acres and contains 1.7 billion tons of tailings.
The current impoundment is 190 feet high. It has the capacity for an additional 0.3 to 0.4 billion tons of tailings which
will raise its height to 250 feet. Its capacity is projected to be reached by 1998. However, the expected life of the
mine is estimated at an additional 30 years with a total production of 1.9 billion more tons of tailings.

Construction of the North Expansion will occur in two phases. The Phase 1 design will provide for 1.1 billion tons of
tailings storage. (An additional 0.3 to 0.4 billion tons of tailings will be deposited into the existing impoundment
during the remaining years of service.) Related project elements for Phase 1 include construction of the North Expansion
berm, expanded dewatering of select reaches of the existing impoundment, and modification of the process water system,
all designed to enhance the seismic stability of the existing impoundment. Phase 1 is expected to run from year 1999
to 2018.

Phase 2 construction of the North Expansion will allow storage of an additional 0.4 to 0.5 billion tons of tailings,
resulting in a final impoundment height of 250 feet by the year 2027.

Construction of the North Expansion will require a new pipeline bridge and modification of the tailings distribution
system. It will also involve relocating utility lines, powerlines, the C-7 ditch, the Union Pacific Railroad
main lines, the construction of a new bridge for Highway 202 over the relocated railroad lines and the modification
of Interstate 80 on and off ramps.

In addition to the proposed North Expansion, other alternatives have tentatively been identified. These include
both onsite and offsite alternatives. The onsite alternatives range from the proposed North Expansion to the continued
raising and impounding of tailings within the existing impoundment. Offsite alternatives would involve separate
sites capable of meeting the tailings storage capacity needs. Five have been identified: Barneys Canyon, Coon Canyon,
Dry Fork/Carr Fork, Tooele/Carr Fork and Stockton. All sites are located in the Oquirrh Mountains and within Kennecott
Copper's mine properties. Alternatives and their practicability will be analyzed by the Corps of Engineers pursuant
to the 404(b)(1) Guidelines contained in 40 CFR Part 230.



Public Scoping Meeting





A public scoping meeting will be held to help identify significant issues and alternatives for inclusion in the DEIS.
Potentially significant issues to be analyzed in the DEIS include wetland impacts, impacts to surface and ground
water, both in terms of quantity and quality; public safety, air quality, fish and wildlife impacts, transportation
and traffic. A public scoping meeting will be held at the following time and location: 6 p.m., Wednesday, September
19, 1994: Main Auditorium, Utah Department of Natural Resources, 1636 West North Temple, Salt Lake City, Utah.

Federal, state and local agencies as well as other interested parties are encouraged to attend the scoping meeting.
In addition, written comments addressing relevant issues to be considered in the DEIS as per this NOI may be sent to
Mr. Schwinn at the above address. Comments in response to this NOI will be received until the date of the scoping meeting.

OMB Clearance Request for Defense Production Act Amendments



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of new request for OMB clearance.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve a new information
collection requirement concerning Defense Production Act Amendments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




A. Purpose





Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 authorizes various forms of Government assistance to encourage
expansion of production capacity and supply of industrial resources essential to national defense. The DPA Amendments
of 1992 provide for the testing, qualification, and use of industrial resources manufactured or developed with assistance
provided under Title III of the DPA.



FAR case 93-304 requires contractors, upon the direction of the contracting office, to test Title III industrial
resources for qualification, and provide the test results to the Defense Production Act Office. The interim rule
expresses Government policy to pay for such testing and provides definitions, procedures, and a contract clause
to implement the policy. This information is used by the Defense Production Act Office, Title III Program, to determine
whether the Title III industrial resource has been provided an impartial opportunity to qualify.





B. Annual Reporting Burden





Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 

100 

hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding
this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this
burden, to General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th & F Streets NW., Room 4037, Washington, DC
20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503.




The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 

6

; responses per respondent, 

3

; total annual responses, 

18;

 preparation hours per response, 

100;

 and total response burden hours, 

1,800.



OBTAINING COPIES OF PROPOSALS: 

Requester may obtain copies of OMB applications or justifications from the General Services Administration, FAR
Secretariat (VRS), Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, telephone (202) 501-4755. Please cite OMB clearance request
regarding Defense Production Act Amendments, FAR case 93-304, in all correspondence.

 Notice of proposed schedule of arbitration fees and expenses under the Randolph-Sheppard Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes a schedule of fees and expenses associated with arbitration proceedings conducted under
the Randolph-Sheppard Act that will be paid by the Department. The schedule lists the reasonable costs of arbitration
and describes the standards by which the Secretary will support those costs. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 

et seq., 

gives blind persons, who are trained and licensed by State vocational rehabilitation agencies (called ``State licensing
agencies'' or SLAs), a priority to operate vending facilities on Federal property. The Act further provides for arbitration
to resolve disputes that arise under the program between individual vendors and SLAs and between SLAs and Federal
agencies. 20 U.S.C. 107d-1(a) and (b). For each of these two categories of arbitrations, the Secretary authorizes
the convening of an arbitration panel upon receipt of a complaint filed by either a vendor against an SLA or by an SLA
against a Federal agency. 
20 U.S.C. 107d-2(a). 


The Act directs each of the parties to an arbitration to each appoint one arbitrator (or panel member) and directs the
two party-appointed arbitrators to select a neutral chairperson. 20 U.S.C. 107d-2(b) (1) and (2). In order
to facilitate this process, the Department sends to the parties names of potential chairpersons from the Roster of
Arbitrators maintained by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). If the parties seek to appoint
a chairperson who is not listed on the FMCS roster, a biographical sketch of that chairperson is to be sent to the Department.
Once selected, the panel conducts a hearing and renders a decision, which is subject to appeal and review as a ``final
agency action'' for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act. 20 U.S.C. 107d-2(a). 
The Act, in 20 U.S.C. 107d-2(d), requires the Secretary to pay all reasonable costs of arbitration in accordance
with a schedule of fees and expenses that the Secretary publishes in the 

Federal Register

. Pursuant to this requirement, the Department has continued to pay certain costs associated with arbitration proceedings
authorized by the Secretary, but has not published the schedule referred to in the statute. 
The purpose of this notice is to propose a schedule of fees and expenses under section 107d-2(d) of the Act. The
proposed schedule outlines the types of costs that the Secretary considers reasonable costs of arbitration and the
standards by which the Secretary will determine the rate of payment for these costs. Generally, the Secretary considers
reasonable costs of arbitration to include the cost of preparing the official record of arbitration proceedings,
professional fees for arbitration panel members, and food, travel, and lodging expenses of panel members and essential
witnesses. The Secretary does not consider attorneys' fees to be part of the reasonable costs of arbitration, but
rather considers them the responsibility of each party to the arbitration. 

The Department has drawn guidance from information and data supplied by the FMCS in formulating these proposed standards.




Executive Order 12866 



Clarity



Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulatory documents that are easy to understand. 

The Secretary invites comments on how to make this proposed schedule easier to understand, including answers to questions
such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed schedule clearly stated? (2) Does the schedule contain
technical terms or other wording that interferes with its clarity? (3) Does the format of the schedule (grouping and
order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce its clarity? Would the schedule be easier to
understand if it was divided into more (but shorter) sections? (4) Is the description of the schedule in the ``Supplementary
Information'' section of this preamble helpful in understanding the schedule? How could this description be more

Reasonable Costs of Arbitration Under the Randolph-Sheppard Act 



The Secretary proposes that the reasonable costs of arbitration under 20 U.S.C. 107d-2(d) are the following:


(a) 

Stenographic Record. 
(1) General Provisions. 

The Department will pay the costs of the services of the official reporter assigned to the arbitration, including
preparation of the official transcript of the hearing and six copies thereof. The official transcript and one copy
thereof must be submitted to the Department. The remaining five copies of the transcript must be distributed among
the parties as determined by the arbitration panel chairperson. Costs of the services of the official reporter may
not exceed the reasonable and customary costs for those services in the locality in which the services are furnished.


(2) 

Cancellation. 

The official reporter may charge the Department its customary fee for cancellation of an arbitration proceeding
in situations in which a proceeding is canceled within 24 hours of its scheduled date and time. 
(b) 

Fees of Arbitrators. 
(1) Per Diem. 

The Department will pay a per diem fee to arbitration panel members, who are not otherwise employed by the Federal or
State Government, for their services during the course of the arbitration. The per diem fee to be paid by the Department
must be the lesser of_ 
(i) The customary fee charged by the individual panel member; or 
(ii) The reasonable and customary fee charged by arbitrators in the locality where the arbitration will be held. 
(2) 

Postponement or Cancellation within 48 hours. 

If a scheduled arbitration proceeding is postponed or canceled within 48 hours of its scheduled date and time, panel
members may charge the Department_ 
(i) A predetermined, customary, and reasonable postponement or cancellation fee; and 
(ii) That portion of the arbitrator's per diem fee proportional to the actual time the panel member expended in preparing
for the proceeding. 
(3) 

Other Postponements or Cancellations. 

If a scheduled arbitration proceeding is postponed or canceled more than 48 hours prior to its scheduled date, panel
members may charge the Department only that portion of the per diem fee proportional to the actual time expended in
preparing for the proceeding. 
(4) 

Notice. 

The customary per diem and predetermined fees charged by a panel member must be included in a biographical sketch that
is to be sent to the Department following his or her appointment to the panel. 
(c) 

Travel, Lodging, and Meal Expenses of Arbitrators and Witnesses. 

(1) Arbitrators. 

Notwithstanding that the Secretary urges the parties to appoint panel representatives from the locality in which
the dispute arose and the hearing is to be held, the Department will reimburse the travel, lodging, and food expenses
of the arbitration panel members incurred for the purpose of attending hearings and for the purpose of attending any
pre- or post-hearing conferences that cannot be conducted by telephone. These expenses will be reimbursed at the
rate applicable to Federal Government employees traveling on government business to the hearing location. 

The Secretary urges the two panel representatives appointed by the parties to select a neutral chairperson from the
locality in which the dispute arose and the hearing is to be held. 
(2) 

Witnesses. 

The Department will reimburse the travel, lodging, and food expenses of witnesses for the purpose of testifying at
hearings, if the witness does not reside at the locality of the arbitration proceeding and the testimony of the witness
is deemed by the arbitration panel chairperson to be essential to the proper resolution of the dispute. These expenses
will be reimbursed at the rate applicable to Federal Government employees traveling on government business to the
hearing location. 

(d) 

Responsibility of Parties. 

Attorneys' fees are not considered part of the reasonable costs of arbitration supported by the Department, but are
the responsibility of each party to the arbitration.

<DOCTITLE>Award of a Grant, Noncompetitive Financial Assistance</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

DOE Nevada Operations Office.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to award based on an unsolicited application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14(f), DOE announces its intent to award a grant based on an unsolicited application from the
National Urban Coalition, Washington, DC, to provide Clark County School District, Nevada, with the unique approach
of teaching science and math to minority students through the ``Say YES'' project.




Of special importance in the ``Say YES'' approach to teaching science and math to minority students is the highly-developed,
culturally-affirmative, and historically-accurate training curriculum. The curriculum illuminates the dynamic
role of all societies in the development and evolution of math and science. Children, as well as their families and
teachers, learn of the contribution their cultures have made to those fields. They come to see and value themselves
as carrying forward a great tradition within their own group of excellence in math, science, and technology.

The objectives of this project are: (1) to nurture and sustain children's interest in science and math; (2) to train
teachers in better presentation of math and science ideas; (3) to assist students in developing creative and efficient
techniques in problem-solving in science and math through hands-on activity; (4) to aid parents in developing skills
needed for effective partnering with their children in the learning process; (5) to provide appropriate experiences
to assist students in developing an appreciation for the importance of math, science, and critical thinking skills
for successful living; (6) to provide students with information and discuss with them the educational and experimental
requirements for careers in math, science, and related fields; (7) to provide opportunities whereby students will
learn to apply and evaluate communicated ideals relative to relevant issues and current developments in math and
science; (8) to affirm the role of all races and cultures in the history of math and science; (9) to describe and demonstrate
to students the techniques for communicating ideals and issues using the language of math and science with peers and
family members; and (10) to describe and discuss with parents and other interested family members appropriate procedures
for becoming advocates for their children's access to higher level courses, programs, and experience in math and
science.

The project period for the proposed grant award is five years, to be funded annually. The first year funding is $405,068.
The total estimated cost of this award is $1,893,345. This notice is published for public comment at least 14 days prior
to making the award.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Floodplain and Wetlands Involvement for Vancouver Lowlands and Western Pond Turtle Wildlife Mitigation
Projects</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Department of Energy (DOE).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of floodplain and wetlands involvement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

BPA proposes to fund the Vancouver Lowlands Wildlife Mitigation Project located in floodplains and wetlands in Clark
County in the State of Washington and the Western Pond Turtle Wildlife Mitigation Project located in floodplains
and wetlands in Lane, Linn, Marion, Polk, Benton, Clackamas, Yamhill, Washington, Multnomah, and Douglas Counties
within the State of Oregon.



In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements
(10 CFR Part 1022), BPA will prepare a floodplain and wetlands assessment and will perform the proposed actions in
a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplains and wetlands.

The assessment will be included in each of the environmental assessments being prepared for the proposed projects
in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. A floodplain statement of finding
will be included in any findings of no significant impact that may be issued following the completion of the environmental
assessments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Vancouver Lowlands Wildlife Mitigation Project area is located along the western border of Clark County, extending
north and west of the City of Vancouver, Washington. It consists of approximately 2123 hectares (5245 acres) of riparian,
wetland and pasture habitat along the Columbia River floodplain. The Columbia River borders the southern and western
boundaries of the project area (T2N, R1E, Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 20; T2N, R1W, Sections 1 and 12; T3N, R1W, Sections
35, 36, and 37; T3N, R1E, Sections 30 and 31.) Major riparian and wetland features of the area include the Columbia River,
Vancouver Lake, Lake River, Buckmire and Matthew Sloughs, Shillapoo Lakebed, and Post Office, Round, Green, Curtis,
and Campbell lakes. Several smaller wetlands occur throughout the project area. Land ownership within the project
area includes Washington Department of Wildlife, Clark County, Port of Vancouver, Washington Department of Natural
Resources and several private landowners. BPA proposes to fund implementation of a wildlife management strategy
that would protect, enhance and restore wildlife habitat in the Vancouver Lowlands. Existing wetlands would be maintained
or restored where possible, and enhanced to improve wildlife habitat. Enhancement activities could include control
or removal of non-native fish and plant species and agricultural cultivation, planting and irrigation.




The Western Pond Turtle Wildlife Mitigation Project spans the entire Willamette River Hydrographic Basin, thus
including the Willamette River floodplain. the townships and ranges that approximately compose the basin are: T3N,
R5W-R2W; T2N, R5W-R2W; T1N, R5W-R7E; T1S, R5W-R7E; T2S, R5W-R7E; T3S, R5W-R7E;
T4S, R5W-R7E; T5S, R5W-R7E; T6S, R5W-R7E; T7S, R5W-R7E; T8S, R5W-R7E; T9S, R5W-R7E;
T10S, R5W-R7E; T11S, R5W-R7E; T12S, R5W-R7E; T13S, R5W-R7E; T14S, R5W-R7E; T15S, R5W-R7E;
T16S, R5W-R7E; T17S, R5W-R7E; T18S, R5W-R7E; T19S, R5W-R7E; T20S, R5W-R7E; T21S, R5W-R7E;
T22S, R5W-R7E; T23S, R5W-R7E; T24S, R5W-R7E; T25S, R3E-R7E. Within the boundaries of the
Willamette River Hydrographic Basin, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's (ODFW) Western Pond Turtle Management
Plan offers a system of nodes and corridors as potential mitigation lands. This proposal is called the Willamette
Ecosystem Reserve Matrix (WERM). The major WERM nodes that include wetlands are: the Fern Ridge Reservoir area, the
West Eugene Wetlands area, the Finley National Wildlife Refuge area, and the Buckhead Slough-Hospital Creek area.
Land ownership within the project area includes the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Fish
and Wildlife Service, the United States Forest Service, the United States Bureau of Land Management, the State of
Oregon, Lane County, the Nature Conservancy, and several private parties. BPA proposes to fund implementation of
the ODFW Western Pond Turtle Management Plan in order to protect, enhance and restore western pond turtle habitat
in the Willamette River Hydrographic Basin. Enhancement activities could include control or removal of non-native
fish and plant species, the restoration of native vegetation, coalescence and/or augmentations of western pond
turtle populations in secure habitats, application of wire enclosures to protect nests, and/or alterations of current
land management/use patterns.

Maps and further information are available from BPA at the address above.

Federal Reserve Bank Services: Imputed Income on Clearing Balances

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Request for comment. 

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is requesting comment on a proposal to modify the methodology for imputing clearing balance income to more
closely parallel the practices of a private sector service provider. Specifically, the Board is requesting comment
on a proposal to change the rate used to impute clearing balance income from the 90-day Treasury bill coupon equivalent
yield to a longer term Treasury rate based on the earning asset maturity structure of the largest bank holding companies
(BHCs). The intended effect of the proposal is to promote competitive equity with private sector practices by matching
the maturity structure for investment of clearing balances to the structure revealed in bank holding company data
on investments. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Monetary Control Act (MCA) requires the Federal Reserve Banks to establish fees for their services on a basis similar
to private sector service providers. In establishing fees, the Board considers objectives of fostering competition,
improving the efficiency of the payments mechanism, and providing financial services nationwide. 



Accordingly, the Federal Reserve imputes costs in the private sector adjustment factor (PSAF) that are intended
to mirror private sector sales taxes, income taxes, cost of funds, and FDIC assessments. Capital structure, equity
and debt rates, and an income tax rate are derived from a model of the largest (in asset size) 50 bank holding companies.
The Federal Reserve uses the bank holding company model to place Reserve Bank payment service costs on an equal footing
with those costs incurred by the private sector. The banking industry has accepted the BHC model as a proxy for determining
Federal Reserve imputed costs.

In February 1981, the Federal Reserve established procedures to assist depository institutions with clearing arrangements
at Reserve Banks, recognizing that the maintenance of an account relationship is necessary for (a) depository institutions
that do not maintain reserve accounts but desire direct access to some or all Federal Reserve priced services and (b)
depository institutions that do maintain a reserve account but find the reserve balance inadequate for their transactions.


Because clearing balances were established as a result of depository institutions wanting access to Federal Reserve
priced services, it was determined that investment earnings attributable to clearing balances should be ascribed
to the System's priced service operations, comparable to the use of these balances by other service providers. The
1982 annual financial report of the Federal Reserve reflected these earnings. 

This priced service revenue factor, net income on clearing balances (NICB), is the difference between the income
the Federal Reserve imputes on clearing balances held with the Federal Reserve System, less imputed reserve requirements,
and the priced services cost of earnings credits granted to depository institutions, net of expired earnings credits.
(Appendix A illustrates the current NICB calculation.) The private sector recognizes revenue from these balances
in a similar way. 

In 1982, under its delegated authority rules, the Board approved a rate of return equivalent to the yield on the short-term
assets included in the System Open Market Account portfolio for calculating clearing balance income. The Federal
Reserve selected the 90-day Treasury bill coupon equivalent yield to impute income on clearing balances. 

A primary benefit of the 90-day Treasury rate, which is still used today, is that its yield is equivalent to the yield
on short-term assets currently included in the Federal Reserve's System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. Additionally,
use of the short-term 90-day rate was viewed as more closely approximating what would have been realized had clearing
balance funds been held and invested by a private business firm. Lastly, Treasury yield data are available to the public.
This allows the earnings calculation to be replicated by the private sector. 

The Reserve System recently reviewed the methodology used to impute income on clearing balances to determine the
comparability of Federal Reserve practices in this area with practices of correspondent banks. A telephone survey
of bank holding companies was conducted to determine the types of assets in which correspondent banks invest clearing
balance funds. 


Survey results showed that, although correspondent banks pay earnings credits based on a short-term rate (90-day
Treasury bill), their investment of clearing balance funds is determined by the economic environment, their risk
policies, and investment opportunities available. The survey participants identified a range of investment options
including, loans, securities, and overnight funds. 

It was observed that correspondent banks may exercise a broad range of investment opportunities whereas the Federal
Reserve has adopted a more restrictive practice. Since Reserve Bank imputed investments do not reflect correspondent
bank practices, the approach is inconsistent with other areas of priced service accounting. Other areas of priced
service accounting either draw on actual Reserve Bank costs, or are imputed based on BHC data. More important, over
time, by computing clearing balance income in the current fashion, the Federal Reserve may be understating clearing
balance revenue, increasing costs of Federal Reserve priced services, and setting prices higher than necessary
to promote effective competition and efficient payment services. 

The proposal under consideration by the Board of Governors is to determine the maturity structure of short-, intermediate-,
and long-term securities assets from the BHC model and impute income based on published matching term Treasury yields.
The Board is considering the BHC structure/Treasury yields method because it promotes competitive equity with private
sector practices by matching the maturity structure for investment of clearing balances to the structure revealed
in bank holding company data on investments. 

One problem with attempting to match the earnings realized by bank holding companies is that the risk premium for the
private sector is difficult to manage and approximate. Also, the Federal Reserve could not determine administrative
costs from available data. Therefore, the Board believes that the Treasury rate provides a reasonable proxy for the
actual rate realized by bank holding companies on clearing balances, without the risk premium associated with holding
company investments and administrative costs incurred managing portfolio risk. Bank holding company maturity
structures and Treasury yields are publicly available so that the NICB calculation can be replicated by the private
sector. The recommended approach provides longer term investments, which would produce higher earnings, assuming
an upward sloping yield curve. 



Proposed NICB Computation 



An estimate of NICB is prepared annually. Under the recommended methodology, selected earning assets include Federal
funds, repurchase agreements, and securities. These investments were chosen because they most closely represent
the Treasury function investments of the private sector. The earning assets maturity structure of the BHC model would
be defined as follows: less than one year (short-term), one -to -five years (intermediate-term) and greater than
five years (long-term). The maturity structure would be calculated from the most recent four quarters of Y9 data.
The Y9 is a quarterly BHC report filed with the Federal Reserve and is generally available to the public 50 to 60 days
after the close of the quarter. For example, four quarters for 1992 would be used for the 1994 earnings rate estimate,
which would be calculated in the fall of 1993. Similarly, 1992 BHC data are used for the 1994 PSAF calculation. Historical
rates are used because the Board has decided in previous instances to avoid the appearance of forecasting interest
rates. 

Published matching-term Treasury yields would be applied to the maturity percentages and summed to develop the earnings
rate. The Board intends initially to use shorter term Treasury rates. In this regard, a three-month Treasury yield
would be used for the short-term rate maturity portion. A one- year Treasury yield would be used for the intermediate-term,
and a five-year Treasury yield would be applied for the long-term portions. Current year-to-date (approximately
four months) week-ending average Treasury yields from the Federal Reserve H.15 Statistical Release would be used
for the estimate. The recommended maturity structure and applicable Treasury yields are shown below. 



 


Actual NICB results are imputed monthly. Under the recommended methodology, the maturity structure developed in
the calculation of the estimate would be held constant for the year; however, current monthly Treasury yields would
be applied to the percentages to develop the weighted average earnings rate. The week-ending average yields, as published
in the Federal Reserve H.15 Statistical Release, would be used to calculate the monthly rate.

<TEXT>
 

The following table illustrates the result of this recommendation compared with the current methodology using 1994
projections. 





 

Had the recommended approach been in place for the 1994 estimate, clearing balance earnings would have increased
$55.4 million or 33.1 percent, from $167.3 million using the current method to $222.7 million. This is due to a 102 basis
points increase in the earnings rate, from 3.0877 percent in the current method to 4.1109 percent
. NICB would have increased from $25.4 million in the current method to $80.8 million. 





Moreover, the Board believes that investment decisions made by BHCs are not static. Instead, these decisions are
the result of several considerations, including the economic environment, their risk policies, and investment
opportunities available. Consequently, the Board recognizes that the recommended methodology may require further
adjustment based on economic situations or new investment opportunities. Prudent private sector investors would
be aware of changing variables and would make the necessary investment changes to reflect market conditions. 

Accordingly, the Board would propose to make such adjustments, without public comment, unless the adjustment entails
a change in the methodology. Therefore, imputed investment income would be subject to the Board's approval as are
fee schedules for Federal Reserve priced services and the PSAF. 

In summary, the current short term nature of Federal Reserve clearing balance income is not representative of the
behavior of most correspondent banks. Although the recommended methodology still does not purely match BHC activity,
the Board believes that it more closely parallels the practices of a private sector service provider. The recommended
methodology also complies with Federal Reserve pricing principles. The Board also believes that the Treasury rate
provides a reasonable proxy for the actual rate realized by bank holding companies on clearing balances. The Treasury
rate is simpler to administer because it does not incorporate a risk premium or administrative costs of managing portfolio
risk. The Board requests comments on the proposal to: (a) change the methodology for imputing clearing balance income
to more closely parallel the practices of a private sector service provider and (b) change the rate used to impute clearing
balance income from the 90-day Treasury bill coupon equivalent yield to a longer term Treasury rate based on the earning
asset maturity structure of the largest BHCs.

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Betz Laboratories has filed a petition proposing that the
food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of the copolymer of the sodium salt of acrylic acid
with polyethyleneglycol allyl ether in paper mill boilers. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 4B4426) has been filed by Betz Laboratories, 4636 Somerton Rd., Trevose, PA 19053. The petition
proposes that the food additive regulations in  176.170 

Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods

 (21 CFR 176.170) be amended to provide for the safe use of the copolymer of the sodium salt of acrylic acid with polyethyleneglycol
allyl ether in paper mill boilers.


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4 (b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before (

insert date 30 days after date of publication in the 

Federal Register

results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Public notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The north half of the Wood River Ranch, 1,680 acres, acquired by BLM in Klamath County is closed to motorized vehicular
travel from the time of acquisition until completion of the Management Plan. The area will be open for day use only.
Day use is defined as two hours before sunrise and once half hour after sunset. Overnight camping is prohibited. No
fires of any kind are permitted. No personal property such as hunting decoys, tents, etc., can remain on the Wood River
Ranch during the overnight hours. Pit hunting blinds may not be dug on the property.



These restrictions are necessary to prevent resource damage to soil, roads, vegetation, including spread of noxious
weeds and possible damage to cultural resources. Limitations are also necessary to reduce the development of trails/roads
due to unregulated cross country travel. Vehicles used for administrative, emergency, and law enforcement will
be exempt from the motor vehicle restrictions. Adjacent landowners, their agents and employees, with a right-of-way
for access, may use vehicles on the dike roads only to gain access to adjacent private property, may not take vehicles
off of the dike roads, and while on the Wood River Ranch, may not off-load personnel, personal property or equipment.
Motorized boats are not considered motorized vehicles but their use is restricted to the permanently flooded marsh.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Any person who fails to comply with this closure/restriction order is subject to the penalties provided in 8360.0-7.
Violations are punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months.

Consolidated Rail Corporation_Purchase, Lease and Operation_CSX Transportation, Inc._Rail Lines in Jefferson
and Indiana Counties, PA 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of decision accepting application for consideration. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is accepting for consideration the application filed July 21, 1994, by Consolidated Rail Corporation
(Conrail) and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSX), for approval and authorization of Conrail's purchase, lease, and
acquisition of trackage rights with respect to certain railroad lines of CSX in Pennsylvania, and for the grant back
of trackage rights to CSX from Conrail. Under 49 CFR part 1180, the Commission finds this to be a minor transaction.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 By application filed July 21, 1994, Conrail and CSX, collectively ``applicants,'' seek Commission approval under
49 U.S.C. 11343, 

et seq.

, for Conrail to purchase, lease, and acquire trackage rights with respect to certain CSX lines entirely within Pennsylvania.
Conrail will grant back trackage rights to CSX. 



In Finance Docket No. 32544, Conrail proposes to lease from CSX, for a 30-year term with an option to renew for an additional
30 years, a portion of the Indiana Subdivision from the connection with Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc. (B&PR),
at DC Tower (milepost 0.0 at Cloe) to the connection with the Ridge Subdivision at Ridge Branch Junction (milepost
26.74).
 Conrail also proposes to purchase from CSX a portion of the Ridge Subdivision, from its connection with the Indiana
Subdivision at milepost 0.0 to the rail switch into the Keystone electric generating plant at milepost 5.83 near Shelocta.






In Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 1), Conrail will acquire overhead trackage rights from CSX on the portion of the
Indiana Subdivision from its connection with the Ridge Subdivision at Ridge Branch Junction (milepost 26.6)
 near Creekside to a connection to be established at a point to be mutually agreed upon between milepost 41.5 and milepost
44.7 near Josephine. The trackage rights will be for a 30-year term with an option to renew for an additional 30 years.
They are limited to the movement of limestone, limestone substitutes, ammonia, rail materials, transformers, and
coal terminating at Shelocta. 





In Finance Docket No. 32544 (Sub-No. 2), Conrail will grant back to CSX trackage rights over the Indiana and Ridge Subdivisions
that are being acquired and leased, for a coextensive period of time. The trackage rights on the Indiana Subdivision
are overhead. The trackage rights on the Ridge Subdivision are both overhead and local, but the local trackage rights
are restricted to limestone, limestone substitutes, ammonia, transformers and coal terminating at the Keystone
electric generating plant. The limestone and coal transportation will be further restricted to commodities originating
at quarries or mines served by CSX or short line railroads connecting solely with CSX, or originating or transloading
on The Three Rivers Railway, B&PR, Allegheny Railroad, Beech Mountain Railroad, West Virginia Northern Railroad,
Elk River Railroad, or Strouds Creek & Muddlety Railroad. No traffic originating on lines owned or leased by Conrail
may be transported by CSX in local service under these trackage rights. The overhead trackage rights are restricted
to movements to the portion of the Ridge Subdivision between Shelocta and Clarksburg and will terminate if CSX abandons
that portion of track. 

Although these trackage rights are sought under agreements with the track owner, and therefore, fall within the class
exemption procedures of 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7), Conrail and CSX seek their approval as related transactions because
the trackage rights and the other acquisitions are part of one integral transaction. 

Conrail will reach Cloe via trackage rights to be obtained for this purpose. Simultaneously with the filing of this
application, Conrail filed for trackage rights over a line owned by Pittsburg & Shawmut Railroad from the connection
with Conrail at Freeport to a connection with B&PR at West Mosgrove
 and trackage rights over B&PR from West Mosgrove to Cloe.

CSX is a class I rail carrier operating a rail system comprising over 19,000 miles of track in 19 States, the District
of Columbia, and the Province of Ontario, Canada. CSX is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation, a noncarrier
holding company that owns and controls several carriers subject to Commission regulation, including: CSX; American
Commercial Barge Line Company (an inland barge carrier); CSX Intermodal, Inc. (a motor carrier); and various other
wholly owned carrier affiliates. The proposed purchase, lease, and trackage rights involve only CSX's rail operations
in Pennsylvania. The carrier operations of CSX's other Commission regulated affiliates are not affected by the proposed
transaction. 

Conrail is a class I rail carrier operating a rail system comprising over 17,000 miles of track in 13 States, the District
of Columbia, and the Province of Quebec, Canada. Conrail is the wholly owned subsidiary of Conrail Inc.; it is not part
of a larger railroad system. 

Applicants state that all rail service over the Indiana and Ridge Subdivisions has been previously discontinued.
 The Ridge Subdivision provides rail access to the Keystone electric generating plant located at milepost 5.83 near
Shelocta. The plant has never received regular shipments of coal by rail. Prior to the discontinuance of service the
plant occasionally used rail service for shipments of miscellaneous materials, heavy generating equipment for
repair or replacement, and some test shipments of coal. The plant burns approximately 4.5 million tons of coal annually.
It is primarily supplied by coal mined at or near the facility and delivered by conveyor belt or truck, but this coal
is relatively high in sulphur content. Because the plant in the future must comply with the emission standards of the
amended Clean Air Act

7

, it must obtain either lower sulphur coal, limestone for scrubbing, or both. Rail is the preferred mode to deliver
these commodities to the Keystone plant, as these commodities are not available in quantity from local sources.

8 









Conrail serves origins that produce both lower sulphur content coal and limestone. This transaction will give the
Keystone plant the option of receiving coal or limestone in single-line service from Conrail. Because Conrail is
granting back to CSX trackage rights over the line segments being acquired and leased, CSX will also be able to provide
single-line delivery of coal, limestone, and other products to the Keystone plant. Therefore, Keystone will acquire
competitive single-line rail service, an advantage that did not previously exist. 

Conrail expects coal to begin moving to Keystone as soon as service to the plant is authorized. It estimates that approximately
150,000 tons a year will move for the first 3 years of service. It does not expect to move limestone until after the year
2000, when a scrubber is installed. 

Conrail states that the proposed transaction involves only about 31 miles of track and one potentially major rail
shipper. Assertedly, the transaction will have no significant impact on other carriers. No interchange points are
located on the lines, and no additional through routes will be created. Nor do the lines contain any connections that
could be used for overhead traffic or to construct new through routes. 

Applicants contend that the transaction will have no adverse impact on their employees because no rail service is
presently conducted on the line. They do not object to the imposition of conditions for the protection of employees
affected by the purchase, as set forth in 

New York Dock Ry._Control_ Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 

360 I.C.C. 60 (1979), as clarified in 

Wilmington Term. RR, Inc._Pur. & Lease_CSX Transp., Inc., 

6 I.C.C.2d 799 (1990), modified, 7 I.C.C.2d 60 (1990), 

aff'd sub nom. Rail Labor Executives' Ass'n v. ICC,

 930 F.2d 511 (6th Cir. 1991) (

Wilmington

); for the protection of railroad employees adversely affected by the proposed lease, as set forth in 

Mendocino Coast Ry._ Lease & Operation, 

354 I.C.C. 732 (1978) and 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980) (

Mendocino

), as clarified in 

Wilmington, supra; 

and for the protection of railroad employees adversely affected by the proposed trackage rights in the related transactions,
as set forth in 

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 

354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in 

Mendocino. 

Under 49 CFR 1180.4(b)(2)(iv), we must determine whether a proposed transaction is major, significant, minor or
exempt. The proposal here does not involve the control or merger of two or more class I railroads and has no regional
or national significance. 

The transaction involves Conrail's purchase, lease, and acquisition of trackage rights and Conrail's grant back
of trackage rights on the lines now owned by CSX in Pennsylvania. Because service on these lines has been discontinued,
there is no actual, current competition to be lessened. Indeed, were it not for this transaction these lines apparently
would be candidates for abandonment. While CSX's grant back of trackage rights is restricted as to certain types of
traffic, the restrictions introduce the potential for market and geographic competition, if not direct head-to-head
competition, a potential that would not otherwise exist for the Keystone electric generating plant. Because the
proposed transaction would restore rail service, and the potential for rail competition, it clearly represents
a benefit to the public. Accordingly, we find the proposal a minor transaction as defined in 49 CFR 1180.2(c). See RR.
Consolidation Proced. of Significant Transactions, 

9 I.C.C.2d 1198 (1993). Because the application complies with our regulations governing minor transactions, we
are accepting it for consideration.

9 







The application and exhibits are available for inspection in the Public Docket Room at the Offices of the Interstate
Commerce Commission in Washington, DC. In addition, copies may be obtained upon request from applicants' representatives
named above. 

Any interested person, including government entities, may participate in the proceeding by submitting written
comments. Any person who files timely written comments shall be considered a party of record if the person's comments
so request. In this event, no petition for leave to intervene need be filed. 

Consistent with 49 CFR 1180.4(d)(1)(iii), written comments must contain: 

(a) the docket number and title of the proceeding; 

(b) the name, address, and telephone number of the commenting party and its representative upon whom service shall
be made; 

(c) the commenting party's position, i.e., whether it supports or opposes the proposed transaction; 

(d) a statement of whether the commenting party intends to participate formally in the proceeding or merely comment
upon the proposal; 

(e) if desired, a request for oral hearing with reasons supporting this request; the request must indicate the disputed
material facts that can only be resolved at a hearing; and

(f) A list of all information sought to be discovered from applicant carriers. 
Because we have determined that this constitutes a minor transaction, no responsive applications will be permitted.
The time limits for processing a minor transaction are set forth at 49 U.S.C. 11345(d).
 




Discovery may begin immediately. We admonish the parties to resolve all discovery matters expeditiously and amicably.

This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources. 


It is ordered: 
1. This application is accepted for consideration as a minor transaction under 49 CFR 1180.2(c). 
2. The parties shall comply with all provisions stated above.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement; United States of America vs. Microsoft Corporation</DOCTITLE>


Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(b)-(h),
that a proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation, and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia in 

United States 

vs. 

Microsoft Corporation,

 Civ. No. 94-1564 (SS). The proposed Final Judgment is subject to approval by the Court after the expiration of
the statutory 60-day public comment period and compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.
 16(b)-(h).
The Complaint alleges that Microsoft uses exclusionary and anticompetitive contracts to market certain of its personal
computer operating system software products. By these contracts Microsoft has unlawfully maintained its monopoly
of personal computer operating systems and has unreasonably restrained trade thereby violating Sections 1 and 2
of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.   1, 2.
The proposed Final Judgment not only bans Microsoft's unlawful practices, but also contains additional provisions
which are prophylactic in nature, and are intended to ensure that the anticompetitive effects of those practices
are not replicated through use by Microsoft of other exclusionary practices.
The proposed Final Judgment includes four categories of limitations on Microsoft's contracting practices. First,
it limits the duration of license agreements for operating system software between Microsoft and personal computer
manufacturers. Microsoft is prohibited from entering into any such license with a term exceeding one year, except
that a license may include a term permitting the computer manufacturer to renew the agreement for up to one additional
year on the same terms and conditions as those applicable in the original license period.
Second, the proposed Final Judgment restricts the manner in which Microsoft may charge royalties for the distribution
of its operating system software with personal computers. Microsoft may not enter into any ``per processor'' license
(i.e., license requiring the computer manufacturer to pay a royalty for each computer shipped with a specified microprocessor).
Microsoft's revenue from a license may not be calculated on anything other than a per copy basis (i.e., royalty for
each unit of Microsoft operating system software licensed, sold or distributed) or a per system basis (i.e., a royalty
for each computer system bearing a particular model name or number). Should Microsoft enter into a per system agreement
with a licensee it must provide a statement, the text of which is set forth in the Final Judgment, advising the licensee
of its rights under the license.
Third, the proposed Final Judgment bans Microsoft from entering into license agreements that prohibit or restrict
a personal computer manufacturer from licensing, selling, or distributing competing operating system products.
Microsoft may neither condition the licensing of its operating systems on the licensing or use of other products,
nor may it enter into any license containing a minimum commitment, nor may it use lump sum pricing.
Fourth, the proposed Final Judgment places limits on Microsoft's use of non-disclosure agreements for its operating
system products. Microsoft is prohibited from entering into any non-disclosure agreement whose duration extends
beyond (a) the commercial release of the covered product, (b) any prior public disclosure of information covered
by the agreement authorized by Microsoft, or (c) one year from the date of disclosure of information covered by the
agreement to a person subject to the non-disclosure agreement, whichever comes first. Also, non-disclosure agreements
may not restrict persons subject to the agreement from developing software products that will run on competing operating
systems, provided that such development does not entail the disclosure or use of Microsoft proprietary information
during the term of the agreement. Nor may any non-disclosure agreement restrict the activities of persons subject
to the agreement to whom no information covered by the agreement has been disclosed.
Computer manufacturers that currently have licenses that are inconsistent with any provision of the Final Judgment
may, without penalty, terminate the license or negotiate with Microsoft to amend the inconsistent provisions. Otherwise,
Microsoft may enforce the license, subject to the following restrictions: (a) if the license is a per processor license,
it must be treated as a per system license; and (b) Microsoft may not enforce prospectively any minimum commitment.
Public comment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments, and the responses thereto,
will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and filed with the Court. Written comments should be directed to Richard L. Rosen, Chief, Communications & Finance
Section, Antitrust Division, Room 8104, 555 Forth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20001 (202-514-5621).
Copies of the Complaint, proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement are available for inspection
in Room 3233 of the Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, Tenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington.
D.C. 20530 (202-633-2481) and at the office of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia, Third Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20001.

In The United States District Court For The District of Columbia, United States of America, Plaintiff, v. Microsoft
Corporation, Defendant. Civil Action No. 94-1564, Judge Charles R. Richey


July 15, 1994.


Complaint


(For Violations of Sections 1 & 2 of the Sherman Act)


The United States of America, acting under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, brings this
civil action to prevent and restrain the defendant Microsoft Corporation (``Microsoft'') from using exclusionary
and anticompetitive contracts to market its personal computer operating system software. By these contracts, Microsoft
has unlawfully maintained its monopoly of personal computer (``PC'') operating systems and has unreasonably restrained
trade.
Virtually all major PC manufacturers find it necessary to offer Microsoft operating systems on most of their PCs.
Microsoft's monopoly power allows it to induce these manufacturers to enter into anticompetitive, long-term licenses
under which they must pay royalties to Microsoft 

not only 

when they sell PCs containing Microsoft's operating systems, 

but also 

when they sell PCs containing non-Microsoft operating systems.
These anticompetitive contracts help Microsoft maintain its dominance in the PC operating system market. By inhibiting
competing operating systems' access to PC manufacturers, Microsoft's exclusionary contracts slow innovation
and deprive consumers of an effective choice among competing PC operating systems.
These contracts outlined below constitute illegal monopolization and unlawful restraints of trade, and the United
States seeks this Court's order declaring Microsoft's anticompetitive contracts illegal and otherwise remedying
the unlawful effects of Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct.


Jurisdiction, Venue and Commerce


1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Section 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  4, and 28 U.S.C.
  1331, 1337.
2. Venue is proper in this district under Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  22, and under 28 U.S.C.  1391
because defendant Microsoft transacts business and is found within this district.
3. Microsoft sells and licenses operating systems for PCs throughout the United States and the world. Microsoft delivers
copies of its operating systems to PC manufacturers and retail customers across state lines and international borders.
Thus, Microsoft is engaged in, and its activities substantially affect, interstate and foreign commerce. The major
developers of other PC operating systems are exclusively U.S. companies.


The Defendant Microsoft and Its Products


4. Microsoft is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Washington, with its principal
place of business located at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington.
5. Microsoft develops, licenses, sells and supports several types of software products for PCs, including ``operating
systems'' and ``applications.''
6. PC operating systems control the operation of a computer by managing the interaction between the computer's microprocessor,
memory and attached devices such as keyboards, display screens, disk drives, and printers. A PC operating system
functions as the ``central nervous system'' of the PC. PC operating system software is designed to work with specific
microprocessors, the integrated circuits that function as the ``brain'' of the computer.
7. Most of the personal computers in the world today use the x86 class of microprocessors, originally designed by Intel
Corporation. The x86 class includes Intel 286, 386, 486, and Pentium microprocessors, as well as microprocessors
manufactured by other companies that use a substantially similar architecture and instruction set. Unless otherwise
specified, the term ``PC'' refers to personal computers that use the x86 class of microprocessors.
8. In 1980, Microsoft licensed from another company a PC operating system which it modified and introduced in 1981
as the Microsoft Disk Operating System (``MS-DOS''). According to Microsoft's 1993 Annual Report, as of June
30, 1993, approximately 120 million PCs in the world utilized MS-DOS.
9. In 1985, Microsoft introduced a more sophisticated PC operating system product it calls ``Windows.'' Windows
has a ``graphical user interface'' which allows users to give instructions by pointing and clicking on their computer
screen with a ``mouse'' or other similar device. Windows also allows users to run more than one application at a time.
All versions of Windows released to date require the presence of an underlying operating system, either MS-DOS
or a close substitute. Microsoft estimates that over 50 million PCs now use Windows.
10. Applications are software programs that work ``on top of'' PC operating systems to enable users to perform a broad
range of functions. Applications communicate through the PC operating system with the computer's hardware. Commonly
used applications include word processors and spreadsheets, such as WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, and Quattro
Pro among others. At least 50,000 applications now run on MS-DOS and over 5,000 have been written to run on Windows.
Microsoft sells a variety of its own very successful and profitable applications.
11. Microsoft markets its PC operating system primarily through original equipment manufacturers (``OEMs''),
which manufacture PCs. It also markets through independent, non-exclusive distributors. Microsoft has agreements
with virtually all of the major microcomputer OEMs.
12. Microsoft generally distributes MS-DOS 

only 

to OEMs. To retail customers, Microsoft generally offers only upgrades for MS-DOS. In the first half of 1994,
the share of Windows units sold by Microsoft through the OEM channel was approximately 80%.


The Relevant Market and Microsoft's Monopoly Power


13. The relevant product market is personal computer operating systems for the x86 class of microprocessors (hereinafter
the ``PC operating system market''). Because operating systems written for other microprocessors will not work
on machines with an x86 class microprocessor, OEMs who sell x86 machines and customers who buy such machines cannot
use other operating systems.
14. The relevant geographic market is the world.
15. Microsoft has monopoly power in the relevant market and has had monopoly power since at least the mid-1980s. For
almost a decade Microsoft has retained an extremely high market share_consistently in excess of 70%.

<TEXT>
 

16. Substantial barriers to entry and expansion exist in the relevant market. One barrier to entry and expansion is
the considerable time and expense required to develop, test, and market a new PC operating system. Other interrelated
barriers to entry and expansion include:

a. the absence of a variety of high quality applications that run on a new operating system, and the difficulty of convincing
independent software vendors (``ISVs'') to develop such applications;

b. the lack of a sizable installed base of users; and

c. the difficulty in convincing OEMs to offer and promote a non-Microsoft PC operating system, particularly one with
a small installed base and relatively few applications designed to run on it.

17. These barriers magnify and reinforce each other because the value of an operating system to a consumer is directly
related to two factors: the availability of a variety of high quality applications that run on that system, and the
number of users who use that operating system and thus are able to share information and work with the system without
additional training. ISVs, in turn, tend to develop applications for operating systems with a large installed base
of users, and consumers gravitate towards operating systems with a large base of applications.

18. Microsoft's anticompetitive contracting practices described below significantly increase the already high
barriers to entry and expansion facing competitors in the PC operating system market. These practices reduce the
likelihood that OEMs will license and promote non-Microsoft PC operating systems, make it more difficult for Microsoft's
competitors to persuade ISVs to develop applications for their operating systems, and impede the ability of a non-Microsoft
PC operating system to expand its installed base of users.




Microsoft's Exclusionary and Anticompetitive OEM Licenses Foreclose Access to the OEM Channel by Microsoft's PC
Operating System Competitors 



19. In 1980, IBM agreed to license the original version of MS-DOS from Microsoft for IBM's PC, which experienced
considerable success. Other OEMs also used MS-DOS in order better to emulate the IBM PC. Microsoft quickly dominated
and gained a monopoly in the market for PC operating systems. It then entered into a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive
contract terms to maintain its monopoly.

20. Because of Microsoft's monopoly position in the marketplace, OEMs believe that they must offer MS-DOS and
Windows to their customers. Profit margins in the computer hardware industry are very thin and OEMs want to obtain
MS-DOS and Windows at the lowest possible cost. Microsoft has induced many OEMs to execute anticompetitive
``per processor'' contracts for MS-DOS and Windows, even though many would prefer to preserve their freedom
to offer PCs with non-Microsoft operating systems.

Microsoft's Licenses Impose a Penalty or Tax Paid to Microsoft on OEMs' Use of Non-Microsoft PC Operating Systems



21. Microsoft's licenses impose a penalty or ``tax'' paid to Microsoft upon OEMs' use of competing PC operating systems.
``Per processor'' licenses require OEMs to pay a royalty for each computer the OEM sells containing a particular processor
(

e.g.

, an Intel 386 microprocessor) whether or not the OEM has included a Microsoft operating system with that computer.

22. Microsoft's per processor contracts penalize OEMs, during the life of the contract, for installing a non-Microsoft
operating system. OEMs that have signed per processor contracts with Microsoft are deterred from using competitive
alternatives to Microsoft operating systems.



The Contract Length of Microsoft's Anticompetitive Per Processor Contracts Magnifies Its Exclusionary Effects



23. Microsoft further impedes PC operating system competitors by executing long-term contracts with major OEMs,
and by requiring minimum commitments and crediting unused balances to future contracts, which effectively extends
the contract term and makes it economically unattractive for an OEM to install a non-Microsoft operating system.

24. Microsoft's exclusionary licenses are often for a duration of three years or more_a period of time equal to, or
exceeding, the product life cycle of most PC operating system products. Microsoft often extends the term of its OEM
licenses through amendment. Thus, Microsoft's anticompetitive per processor contracts can extend to beyond five
years.



Microsoft's Exclusionary Contracts Foreclose Other PC Operating System Vendors From a Substantial and Critically
Important Segment of the Market



25. Access to the OEM channel is critical to the success of a competing operating system. The overwhelming majority
of PCs are sold with a pre-installed operating system. Thus, to reach the ultimate consumer of an operating system,
it is important that competitors have access to OEMs. Operating system vendors, as well as OEMs, confirm that successful
entry is extremely difficult in the absence of ``proper support'' in the OEM channel in the form of public commitments
to sell a new operating system.

26. Since 1988, Microsoft has induced major OEMs to execute per processor contracts, many of which extend for several
years. These OEMs are critical to the success of a new operating system entrant; it would be virtually impossible for
a new entrant to achieve commercial success solely through license agreements with small OEMs that are not covered
by Microsoft's per processor agreements. According to Microsoft, in fiscal year 1993, per processor agreements
accounted for an estimated 60% of Microsoft's MS-DOS sales to OEMs and 43% of Window sales to OEMs.

27. Competing operating system developers, finding the largest OEMs contractually bound by Microsoft's exclusionary
licenses, are disadvantaged in their efforts to bring to the consumer less expensive and/or better quality operating
system products.

28. The effect of Microsoft's licensing practices has been to exclude competitors by unreasonable and anticompetitive
means and to lessen competition in the relevant market. Microsoft's practices deter OEMs from entering into licensing
agreements with competing operating system providers, discourage OEMs who agree to sell non-Microsoft operating
systems from promoting those products, and raise the price of computers sold with competing operating systems, thereby
depressing the demand and restricting the output of these products. Microsoft's licensing practices have effectively
foreclosed a substantial share of the relevant market; they are exclusionary, anticompetitive, and not justified
by legitimate business considerations. 



Microsoft's Anticompetitive Non-Disclosure Agreements



29. ISVs develop applications, which motivate consumers to purchase PCs. Microsoft has sought to have several commercially
important ISVs and their employees agree to non-disclosure agreements that would restrict their ability to work
with competing PC operating systems as well as restrict their ability to develop competitive products.

30. Microsoft moved to impose these restrictions in connection with its ``beta tests'' of its new operating system,
the next version of Windows, code-named Chicago. Microsoft anticipates commercially releasing Chicago in late
1994 or early 1995. Beta tests of new versions of an operating system, which are conducted prior to the commercial release
of that new version, help both Microsoft and the ISVs.

31. For the ISVs, the beta tests provide, among other things, critical information about the interfaces in the operating
system that connect with applications_information which the ISVs need to write applications that run on the operating
system. Early access to the beta tests is especially valuable to the ISVs if they are to be able to release their applications
within a short time after the commercial release of a new Microsoft operating system, such as Chicago.

32. For Microsoft, the beta tests enable ISVs, informed experts, and selected members of the media to provide important
feedback about the advantages ad drawbacks of the operating system. In addition, the demand for Microsoft's operating
systems depends to a significant extent on the availability of applications designed to work with it. Accordingly,
it is in Microsoft's interest to provide ISVs early access to beta tests.

33. At the same time, because Microsoft necessarily must disclose certain confidential information during the course
of the beta tests, it has legitimate interests in maintaining that confidentiality. In the past, Microsoft has protected
its interests through non-disclosure agreements that prohibit those participating in the beta tests from disclosing
such confidential information.

34. In connection with its beta tests of Chicago, however, Microsoft sought to impose on certain leading software
companies far more restrictive non-disclosure agreements than it had previously used. The terms of these non-disclosure
agreements would preclude developers at these companies from working with operating system companies, other competitors
of Microsoft, and competing technologies for an unreasonably long period of time.

The Anticompetitive Effects of Microsoft's Conduct



35. Microsoft's exclusionary contracting practices have had the effect of excluding competitors on a basis other
than competition on the merits and have thereby allowed Microsoft illegally to perpetuate its monopoly in the PC operating
system market.

36. Through the unlawful acts and practices described above Microsoft has harmed competition, consumers and innovation:

a. Microsoft has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the PC operating system market.

b. Microsoft's exclusionary conduct has significantly impeded the ability of rival operating systems to compete
in the PC operating system market. Competitors find it more difficult to convince OEMs to offer and/or promote their
product and must incur greater marketing expenses to penetrate the market. Microsoft raised hurdles to fair competition
even higher through unreasonably restrictive non-disclosure agreements.

c. Microsoft's exclusionary licenses deprive rival PC operating systems of a significant number of sales that they
might otherwise secure. These lost sales impede the ability of PC operating systems to develop an installed base sufficient
to convince OEMs to bundle the new system with their hardware, to convince ISVs to write applications that run on the
new system, and to convince users that the system is, and will remain, a viable alternative to the existing MS-DOS
and Windows standard.

d. Microsoft's conduct also substantially lengthens the period of time required for competitors to recover their
development costs and earn a profit, and increases the risk that an entry attempt will fail. In combination, all of
these factors deter entry by competitors and thus harm competition.

37. The harm to competition caused by Microsoft's unlawful conduct harms consumers. OEMs that do offer customers
a choice of operating systems may charge customers a higher price for PCs with non-Microsoft operating systems in
order to be able to pay the double royalty necessitated by the Microsoft per processor agreements. Thus, users who
do not receive a Microsoft operating system are still, indirectly, paying Microsoft.

38. In addition, Microsoft's unlawful conduct has deterred the development of competing operating systems, depriving
consumers of a choice of systems with possibly superior features. Similarly, the slower growth of competing operating
systems has slowed the development and diffusion of applications designed to work on non-Microsoft operating systems
and has limited choices of consumers and users of PCs.

39. Those injured by Microsoft's conduct will continue to suffer such injury unless the relief prayed for herein is
granted.



First Claim for Relief_Sherman Act  2



40. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 39
above.

41. By engaging in the acts and practices described above, Microsoft has monopolized the market for PC operating systems
in the United States.

42. Such conduct constitutes monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  2.



Second Claim for Relief_Sherman Act  1



43. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 39 above.

44. The licensing agreements and unnecessarily restrictive non-disclosure agreements described above constitute
contracts and combinations which unreasonably restrain trade in the market for PC operating systems, which affect
interstate trade and commerce, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1.



Prayer for Relief



Wherefore, Plaintiff Prays For Relief As Follows:

1. That the Court adjudge and decree that Microsoft has monopolized the interstate trade and commerce in the market
for PC operating systems in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

2. That the Court adjudge and decree that Microsoft has entered into unlawful contracts and combinations which unreasonably
restrain the trade in interstate commerce in PC operating systems, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

3. That Microsoft and all persons, firms and corporations acting on its behalf and under its direction or control be
permanently enjoined from engaging in, carrying out, renewing or attempting to engage, carry out or renew, any contracts,
agreements, practices, or understandings in violation of the Sherman Act.

4. That plaintiff have such other relief that the Court may consider necessary or appropriate to restore competitive
conditions in the markets affected by Microsoft's unlawful conduct.

In the United States District Court for the District of the District of Columbia. United States of America, Plaintiff,
v. Microsoft Corporation, Defendant. Civil Action No. 94-1564 (SS). Competitive Impact Statement.

Received: July 27, 1994, Clerk, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia.



Competitive Impact Statement



Pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(b)-(h), the United
States submits this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted for entry with
the consent of defendant Microsoft Corporation in this civil antitrust proceeding.



Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding



On July 15, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust Complaint to prevent and restrain Microsoft Corporation
(``Microsoft'') from using exclusionary and anticompetitive contracts to market its personal computer operating
system software, in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1, 2. As alleged in the Complaint, Microsoft
has used these contracts to restrain trade and to monopolize the market for operating systems for personal computers
using the x86 class of microprocessors, which comprise most of the world's personal computers. As used herein, ``PC''
refers to personal computers that use this class of microprocessor.

The Complaint alleges that Microsoft has used its monopoly power to induce PC manufacturers to enter into anticompetitive,
long-term licenses under which they must pay Microsoft not only when they sell PCs containing Microsoft's operating
systems, but also when they sell PCs containing non-Microsoft operating systems. These anticompetitive, long-term
licenses have helped Microsoft to maintain its monopoly. By inhibiting competing operating systems' access to PC
manufacturers, Microsoft's exclusionary licenses slow innovation, raise prices, and deprive consumers of an effective
choice among competing PC operating systems.

The Complaint also alleges that in connection with pre-release testing of a new Microsoft operating system code-named
``Chicago,'' Microsoft sought to impose unreasonably restrictive and anticompetitive non-disclosure agreements
on a number of leading developers of applications software products. These non-disclosure agreements would have
unreasonably restricted the ability of software developers to work with competing operating systems or to develop
competitive products or technologies.

The Complaint seeks to prevent Microsoft from continuing or renewing any of the anticompetitive practices alleged
to violate the Sherman Act, and thus to provide fair opportunities for other firms to compete in the market for PC operating
systems.

The United States and Microsoft have agreed that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with
the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act.
 Entry of the Final Judgment will terminate this civil action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction for further
proceedings that may be required to interpret, enforce, or modify the Judgment, or to punish violations of any of its
provisions.







Description of the Practices Involved in the Alleged Violations



If this case were to proceed to trial, the United State would prove the following:

Microsoft develops, licenses, sells, and supports several types of software products for personal computers, including
operating systems and applications. An operating system is software that controls the basic operations of the personal
computer. Applications software, such as word processing programs and spread sheets, runs ``on top of'' an operating
system to enable the computer to perform a broad range of useful functions. Operating systems are designed to work
with specific microprocessors, the integrated circuits that function as the ``brain'' of the computer. Most of the
personal computers in the world today use the x86 class of microprocessors, originally designed by Intel, and now
including microprocessors manufactured by other companies that use a substantially similar architecture and instruction
set. Original equipment manufacturers (``OEMs'') that sell PCs and customers who buy such machines cannot use operating
systems written for other microprocessors.

In 1981, Microsoft introduced a PC operating system called the Microsoft Disk Operating System (``MS-DOS''),
the original version of which Microsoft licensed to IBM for use in IBM's PC. As IBM's PC experienced considerable commercial
success, other OEMs also used MS-DOS in order better to emulate the IBM PC. In 1985, Microsoft introduced ``Windows,''
a more sophisticated PC operating system product designed for use in conjunction with MS-DOS. Windows allowed
users to give instructions with a ``mouse'' or similar device and also to run more than one application at a time. Microsoft
quickly gained a monopoly in the market for PC operating systems worldwide. For almost a decade, Microsoft's market
share has consistently exceeded 70%.






Development, testing, and marketing of a new PC operating system involves considerable time and expense. A new operating
system faces additional barriers to entry, including the absence of a variety of high quality applications to run
on the system; the small number of people trained on and using the system, which discourages customers from buying
it and software companies from writing applications to run on it; and, since the overwhelming majority of PCs are sold
with a pre-installed operating system, the difficulty of convincing OEMs to offer and promote the system.

Microsoft has used exclusionary and anticompetitive contract terms to maintain its monopoly. OEMs believe that
a substantial portion of their customers will want a PC with MS-DOS and Windows, and therefore feel that they
must be able to offer their customers MS-DOS and Windows. With thin profit margins, OEMs want to obtain these
products at the lowest possible cost.

Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anticompetitive ``per
processor'' licenses. Under a per processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing
a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft
operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty,
or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has
increased. In fiscal year 1993, per processor licenses accounted for an estimated 60% of MS-DOS sales to OEMs
and 43% of Window sales to OEMs.
 Collectively, the OEMs who have such per processor contracts are critical to the success of competing operating system
vendors, but those OEMs effectively are foreclosed to Microsoft's competitors.





Microsoft has further foreclosed the OEM channel through the use of long-term contracts with major OEMs, some expiring
as long as five years from their original negotiation date. In some cases, these contracts have left OEMs with unused
balances on their minimum commitments, which Microsoft can allow to be used if the contract is extended, but which
would be forfeited if the OEM does not extend the contract. These practices have allowed Microsoft to extend the effective
duration of its OEM contracts, further impeding the access of PC operating system competitors to the OEM channel.

In addition to using anticompetitive OEM licenses, Microsoft has also employed anticompetitive restrictions in
certain of its non-disclosure agreements (``NDAs''). Microsoft anticipates commercially releasing Chicago,
the next version of Windows, in late 1994 or early 1995. In preparation for its release, Microsoft has allowed certain
third parties, including independent software vendors (``ISVs'') who write applications, to have access to pre-release
versions of Chicago, a process known in the software industry as ``beta testing.'' This permits Microsoft to receive
feedback from the beta testers, and the ISVs to begin writing applications for Chicago prior to its release.

In connection with beta testing Chicago, Microsoft employed, as it has in prior beta tests, NDAs prohibiting disclosure
of confidential information. In this instance, however, Microsoft sought to impose on certain leading software
companies far more restrictive NDAs than it had previously used. These NDAs would have precluded developers from
working on competitive products and technologies for an unreasonably long period of time.

Through these practices, Microsoft has excluded competitors by unreasonable and anticompetitive means, thereby
lessening competition and maintaining a monopoly in the PC operating system market. Microsoft's licensing practices
deter OEMs from entering into licensing agreements with operating system rivals and discourage OEMs who agree to
sell non-Microsoft operating systems from promoting those systems. By depriving rivals of a significant number
of sales that they might otherwise secure, Microsoft makes it more difficult for its rivals to convince ISVs to write
applications for their systems, for OEMs to offer and promote their systems, and for users to believe that their systems
will remain viable alternatives to MS-DOS and Windows.

Microsoft's exclusionary contracts harm consumers. OEMs that sign Microsoft's exclusionary licenses but offer
consumers a choice of operating systems may charge a higher price, in order to cover the double royalty, for PCs using
a non-Microsoft operating system. Even consumers who do not receive a Microsoft operating system still pay Microsoft
indirectly. Thus, Microsoft's licensing practices have raised the cost of personal computers to consumers.

Microsoft's conduct also substantially lengthens the period of time required for competitors to recover their development
costs and earn a profit, and thereby increases the risk that an entry attempt will fail. In combination, all these factors
deter entry by competitors and thus harm competition. By deterring the development of competitive operating systems,
Microsoft has deprived consumers of a choice of potentially superior products. Similarly, the slower growth of competing
operating systems has retarded the development of applications for such systems.



Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment



The proposed Final Judgment will end Microsoft's unlawful practices that restrain trade and perpetuate its monopoly
power in the market for PC operating systems. In addition, the proposed Final Judgment contains provisions that are
remedial in nature and designed to assure that Microsoft will not engage in the future in exclusionary practices designed
to produce the same or similar effects as those set forth in the Complaint.

In particular, Sections IV (A), (C), and (F) prohibit Mirosoft's use of the specific exclusionary practices alleged
in the complaint_``per processor'' contracts, lengthy terms, and minimum commitments_that foreclose competing
PC operating system vendors from much of the OEM channel. Sections IV (K)-(L) prohibit the use of anticompetitive
non-disclosure agreements in conjunction with Mirosoft's distribution of pre-commercial releases of operating
system software products. Sections IV (B), (E), (G), and (H) impose prohibitions that go beyond the alleged exclusionary
practices in order to ensure that Microsoft's future contracting practices_not challenged here because not yet
used_do not unreasonably impede competition. Sections IV (J) and (M) are designed to bring existing contracts into
immediate compliance with the proposed Final Judgment.



Scope of the Final Judgment



The injunctions in Section IV generally apply to ``covered products'' which are defined, in Section II(A), as the
binary code of MS-DOS 6.22; Microsoft Windows 3.11; Windows for Workgroups 3.11; predecessor versions of those
products; the product currently code-named ``Chicago'' (the planned successor to Microsoft Windows 3.11); and
other successor versions of or products marketed as replacements for the aforementioned products. This definition
includes all Microsoft's PC operating system products in which the defendant currently possesses a substantial
degree of market power. The definition does not encompass and specifically excludes, Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Advanced Server, neither of which has a significant share of a relevant market at this time.

The definition of ``covered product'' was drafted with the recognition that Microsoft will continue to modify its
operating system products throughout the duration of the Final Judgment. The prohibitions in the decree will apply
to the successor and replacement products of those existing operating system products that have substantial market
power. The decree will govern the licensing of such products if they are made available as stand-alone products to
OEMs pursuant to license agreements, or as unbundled products that perform operating system software functions
now embodied in the specifically listed existing products. Moreover, the decree will govern the licensing of successor
versions of or products marketed as replacements for MS-DOS 6.22, Microsoft Windows 3.11, Windows for Workgroups
3.11, and ``Chicago,'' even if such successor or replacement products could also be characterized as successors
or replacements of operating system software products that are not covered, such as windows NT Workstation or Windows
NT Advanced Server.



Prohibition of the Licensing Violations



The three anticompetitive factors of Microsoft's license agreements that are challenged in the complaint_the excessive
duration of those agreements, the requirement of royalty payments on a ``per processor'' basis, and large minimum
commitments_are addressed principally in Sections IV(A), IV(C) and (IV)(F) of the Final Judgment.



Duration:

 Section IV(A) limits the duration of Microsoft's license agreements with OEMs to one year, with OEMs having the option
to renew a license for one additional one year term on the same terms and conditions as in the first year. This limitation
on the duration of license agreements, along with the safeguards provided in Section IV(G), will ensure that vendors
of competing operating systems will have regular and frequent opportunities to attempt to market their products
to OEMs. Absent such opportunities, Microsoft's competitors might be unable to reach the level of market penetration
needed for profitable operation in a reasonable period of time, even if they are offering products that are deemed
superior by those customers who have an opportunity to buy them.



Per Processor Licenses:

 Section IV(C) prohibits the use of per processor licenses.
 Section II(K) defines per processor licenses as licenses that require the OEM to pay a royalty for all personal computer
systems that contain specified microprocessors. As noted above, the requirement to pay a royalty to Microsoft on
the sale of a PC that has a non-Microsoft operating system is comparable, in its economic effect, to the imposition
of a ``tax'' on the competing operating system. Per processor licenses are also very similar to exclusive dealing
or requirements contracts; the OEM in effect is obtaining the right to use Microsoft's operating system, and is paying
an operating system royalty, for all of its operating system ``requirements'' for use on PCs using the designated
microprocessors.







Minimum Commitments:

 Section IV(F) will bar Microsoft from entering into any license agreement containing a minimum commitment.
 While minimum commitments are not in and of themselves illegal, they can be used to achieve a similar effect as that
accomplished through per processor licenses or exclusive dealing contracts. If the minimum commitment is greater
than the number of units of Microsoft software that the OEM expects or would otherwise desire to use at any time during
the term of the contract, the minimum commitment creates a disincentive for an OEM to make incremental purchases of
non-Microsoft operating systems. In that context, the minimum commitment also operates in effect to require a royalty
payment to Microsoft, even for PCs that use a non-Microsoft operating system. This effect will be ended by Section
(IV)(F).





Restoring Competition to the Market Through Prophylactic Additional Relief



The proposed Final Judgment not only bans Microsoft's unlawful practices, but also contains additional provisions
which are prophylactic in nature, and are intended to ensure that the anticompetitive effects of those practices
are not replicated through use by Microsoft of other exclusionary practices.

<DOCNO> FR940819-2-00105 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-2-00066 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Microsoft Prohibited From Limiting OEM Sales of Competing Operating System Products: 

Section IV (B) bars Microsoft from entering into license agreements that prohibit or restrict an OEM from licensing,
selling, or distributing competing operating system products. In addition, Section IV (E) prohibits Microsoft
from expressly or impliedly conditioning its licenses of operating systems on the licensing, purchase, use or distribution
not only of other covered products, but also any other Microsoft product, or non-Microsoft product. Without these
provisions Microsoft could force OEMs to purchase covered products and thus accomplish anticompetitive effects
similar to those achieved through its unlawful licensing practices, or attempt to extend or protect its monopoly
in any covered product by conditioning its licensing, purchase or use of other products.



Microsoft Limited to Per Copy and Per System Licenses: 

Sections IV (D) and IV (G) require Microsoft to use either ``per copy'' or ``per system'' licenses. Per copy licenses,
if used in conjunction with pro-competitive volume discounts, pose few competitive concerns. Per system licenses,
if not carefully fenced in, could be used by Microsoft to accomplish anticompetitive ends similar to ``per processor''
licenses. However, if an OEM easily can designate models not subject to a per system license, it can use non-Microsoft
operating systems on those models without incurring a royalty obligation to Microsoft. If an OEM need not pay a royalty
to Microsoft for anything but the number of copies of the Microsoft operating system that it actually uses, that OEM
will not be deterred from licensing, purchasing or using competing operating system products.



Restriction on Per System Licenses: 

The Final Judgment also places restrictions on the use of per system licenses to ensure that they are not used in an exclusionary
manner. In particular, Section IV (G) specifies that per system licenses must allow the licensee to create ``new systems''
that can be sold without incurring a royalty obligation to Microsoft if they do not utilize a Microsoft product. Under
Section IV (G), an OEM need only designate a new model name or number to create a ``new system.'' Microsoft may not require
the OEM even to notify Microsoft of the creation of a new system; nor may Microsoft impose requirements relating to
the marketing or advertising of a new system, or penalize an OEM for creating a new system. Section IV (G)(4) requires
Microsoft to notify within 30 days following entry of this Final Judgment all existing OEM licensees under per system
licenses and all OEM licensees with per processor licenses who choose to let them to be converted to per system licenses
(a provision discussed below) of their rights to create new systems that will not be subject to any existing per system
license. This notice provision ensures that existing licensees promptly know of their rights to avoid royalty payments
under per system contracts if they choose to create new systems.



Microsoft Prohibited From Using Lump Sum Pricing: 

Section IV (H) also serves a prophylactic function, prohibiting the use of lump sum pricing in license agreements
for covered products. As defined in Section II (F), lump sum pricing is any royalty payment that does not vary with the
number of copies of the covered product (under per copy licenses) or the number of personal computer systems (under
per system licenses) that are licensed, sold, or distributed by the OEM. This restriction, like the prohibitions
on minimum commitments and requirements contracts, restricts conduct that could be used by Microsoft to achieve
effects comparable to the effects of the conduct challenged by the government, and for that reason is enjoined.






Neither Section IV (H) nor any other provision of the proposed Final Judgment prohibits the use of royalty rates, including
rates embodying volume discounts, agreed upon in advance with respect to each individual OEM, each specific version
or language of a covered products, and each designated personal computer system model. Nothing in the Final Judgment,
however, in any way sanctions Microsoft structuring any volume discount whose purpose or effect is to impose de facto
requirements contracts or exclusive arrangements on the OEM. As discussed below in connection with alternatives
to the proposed Final Judgment, given Microsoft's monopoly power in operating systems, such practices can violate
the antitrust laws.



Transition Rules



In the Stipulation consenting to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment, Microsoft agreed to abide by the provisions
of the proposed Final Judgment immediately upon the filing of the Complaint, 

i.e.

, as of July 15, 1994. Among other things, the transition provisions described herein will require Microsoft to abide
by the foregoing limitations and prohibitions when entering into any license agreements with OEMs after July 15,
1994. Certain additional provisions of the proposed Final Judgment also apply to existing license agreements that
are inconsistent with the proposed Final Judgment's requirements for new license agreements. 

Under Section IV (I), existing OEM licensees may terminate or negotiate with Microsoft to amend their agreements
to make them consistent with the requirements of the Final Judgment.

Section IV (J) provides that if an OEM chooses not to exercise either of these options, Microsoft must abide by the following
rules. First, under Section IV (J)(1), a per processor license must be treated as a ``per system'' license' OEM models
that contain the microprocessor(s) specified in such a per processor license will be considered to be covered by the
``per system'' license unless the OEM opts in writing to exclude such model from coverage. As already noted, OEMs may
freely sell PCs with non-Microsoft operating systems, and avoid any obligation to pay royalties to Microsoft under
a per system license, simply by designating such PCs as a new system with a separate model number or name. Second, under
Section IV (J)(2), Microsoft may not enforce any minimum commitment in an existing license agreement.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-2-00106 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-2-00066 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

These provisions further two consistent goals. Opportunities for competition in the PC operating system market
are fostered by a rapid end to the unlawful practices embodied in existing licenses. At the same time, the transition
rules avoid creating hardships for OEMs by not unnecessarily disrupting established commercial relationships
with Microsoft. Indeed, OEMs are not required to terminate or amend their existing contracts with Microsoft; the
choice to do so is theirs alone. Microsoft, however, may not enforce the per processor or minimum commitment features
of any existing contract. Providing OEMs with this choice minimizes the costs of the transition from existing license
agreements that are inconsistent with the decree to new license agreements, while ensuring that any unavoidable
transition costs be borne largely by Microsoft.
To ensure that existing licensees learn of their rights under the proposed Final Judgment, Section IV (M) requires
Microsoft to provide a copy of the Final Judgment to all OEMs with which it has license agreements, except for those
who have licenses only under Microsoft's Small Volume Easy Distribution program or the Delivery Service Partner
program.


Non-Disclosure Agreements


Finally, the proposed Final Judgment contains provisions that prevent Microsoft from imposing unlawfully restrictive
NDAs on developers of applications software.
Sections IV(K)(l) limits the duration of any NDA to the earliest of (a) the commercial release of the product covered
by the NDA, (b) an earlier public disclosure of the information covered by the NDA, or (c) one year after the information
is disclosed to the person subject to the NDA. Section IV(K)(2) provides that NDAs may not restrict subject parties
from developing software products that will run on competing operating systems, if such development does not entail
the use or disclosure of Microsoft proprietary information during the term of the NDA.
In combination, these provisions recognize that whatever Microsoft's legitimate interest in protecting the confidentiality
of proprietary information covered by the NDAs, the need for any such protection must be balanced against the competitive
consequences of any restriction imposed on others concerning disclosure and use of the information. The proposed
Final Judgment ensures that any NDA imposed by Microsoft will not extend beyond the point that the information has
been released to the public or has otherwise been in the hands of parties for more than one year.
Section IV(L) requires that the form of all standard NDAs must be approved by a Microsoft corporate officer, and that
non-standard language in an NDA relating to matters covered in Section (K) must be approved by a Microsoft senior attorney.
These provisions are designed to ensure that NDAs will be reviewed by company officials mindful of the requirements
of the Final Judgment.


Enforcement


Section V of the proposed Final Judgment establishes standards and procedures by which the Department of Justice
may obtain access to documents and information from Microsoft related to its compliance with the Final Judgment.
In particular, Section V(D) contains provisions under which the Department can obtain information and documents
relating to any Undertaking by or Decision against Microsoft arising from parallel antitrust proceedings of the
Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission (``DG-IV''). This provision will allow the
Department to coordinate its monitoring and enforcement of compliance of the Final Judgment with DG-IV's monitoring
and enforcement of parallel provisions contained in an Undertaking with DG-IV signed by Microsoft on July 15,
1994.

Duration


Section VI of the proposed Final Judgment provides that the Final Judgment will expire on the seventy-eighth month
after its entry. Jurisdiction will be retained by the Court to conduct further proceedings relating to the Final Judgment,
as specified in Section VI.



Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants



Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct
prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well
as costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing
of such actions. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(a), the Judgment has no


prima facie

 effect in any subsequent lawsuit that may be brought against the defendant in this matter.



Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Judgment



As provided by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, any person believing that the proposed Final Judgment
should be modified may submit written comments to Richard L. Rosen, Chief, Communications and Finance Section, United
States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street N.W., Room 8104, Washington, D.C. 20001, within
the 60-day period provided by the Act. These comments, and the Department's responses, will be filed with the Court
and published in the 

Federal Register

. All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free to withdraw its consent
to the proposed Final Judgment at any time prior to entry. If the Department does not withdraw its consent to the proposed
Final Judgment, it will file with the Court a Certificate of Compliance after the requirements of the Antitrust Procedures
and Penalties Act have been satisfied. The Court then must determine whether the proposed decree is in the public interest,
pursuant to Section 5(e) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(e).






Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment



In addition to the remedies provided in the proposed Final Judgment, the Department also considered whether to require
limitations on the manner in which Microsoft could structure volume discount pricing arrangements for covered products.
While the Department recognizes that volume discount pricing can be and normally is pro-competitive, volume discounts
also can be structured by a seller with monopoly power (such as Microsoft) in such a way that buyers, who must purchase
some substantial quantity from the monopolist, effectively are coerced by the 

structure

 of the discount schedule (as opposed to the level of the price) to buy all or substantially all of the supplies they need
from the monopolist. Where such a result occurs, the Department believes that the volume discount structure would
unlawfully foreclose competing suppliers from the marketplace_in this case, competing operating systems_and
thus may be challenged.

The Department ultimately concluded that it would not require provisions in the Final Judgment to attempt to proscribe
in advance the various means by which Microsoft could attempt to structure volume discounts as a means to thwart competition
rather than as a means of promoting competition. The Department reached this conclusion because it does not have evidence
that Microsoft has, to date, in fact structured its volume discounts to achieve anticompetitive ends. The Department
did, however, communicate to Microsoft its concern and stated its intent to initiate an investigation and antitrust
enforcement proceeding, if warranted, should Microsoft adopt anticompetitive volume discount structures in its
future license agreements. Given the procompetitive impact of the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment, the
normally procompetitive nature of volume discount pricing, and the absence of any evidence that Microsoft has used
volume discounting in an anticompetitive manner to date, the Department believes that this resolution is appropriate
on the record at this time.

Another alternative to the proposed Final Judgment would be a full trial of this case. The Department of Justice believes
that such a trial would involve substantial cost to the United States and is not warranted since the proposed Final
Judgment provides all of the relief that the United States seeks in its Complaint and includes substantial additional
prophylactic measures as well.



Determinative Materials and Documents



No materials or documents of the type described in Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.
 16(b), were considered in formulating the proposed Final Judgment.

Microsoft may include as a term in any such License Agreement that the OEM may, at its sole discretion, at any time between
90 and 120 days prior to the expiration of the original License Agreement, renew such License Agreement for up to one
additional year on the same terms and conditions as those applicable in the original license period.

The License Agreement shall not impose a penalty or charge of any kind on an OEM for its election not to renew all or any
portion of a License Agreement. In the event that an OEM does not exercise the option to renew a License Agreement as
provided above, and a new License Agreement is entered between Microsoft and the OEM, the arm's length negotiation
of different terms and conditions, specifically including a higher royalty rate(s), will not by itself constitute
a penalty or other charge within the meaning of the foregoing sentence.

The Duration of any License Agreement with an OEM not domiciled in the United States or the European Economic Area that
will not be effective prior to regulatory approval in the country of its domicile may be extended at the option of Microsoft
or the OEM during the time required for any such regulatory approval.

License Agreement provisions that do not bear on the licensing or distribution of the Covered Products may survive
expiration or termination of the License Agreement.

(B) Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement that by its terms prohibits or restricts the OEM's licensing,
sale or distribution of any non-Microsoft Operating System Software product.

(C) Microsoft shall not enter into any Per Processor License.

(D) Except to the extent permitted by Section IV (G) below, Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement other
than a Per Copy License.

(E) Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement in which the terms of that agreement are expressly or impliedly
conditioned upon:

(1) the licensing of any other Covered Product, Operating System Software product or other product (provided, however,
that this provision in and of itself shall not be construed to prohibit Microsoft from developing integrated products);
or

(2) the OEM not licensing, purchasing, using or distributing any non-Microsoft product.

(F) Microsoft shall not enter into any License Agreement containing a Minimum Commitment. However, nothing contained
herein shall prohibit Microsoft and any OEM from developing non-binding estimates of projected sales of Microsoft's
Covered Products for use in calculating royalty payments.

(G) Microsoft's revenue from a License Agreement for any Covered Product shall not be derived from other than Per Copy
or Per System Licenses, as defined herein. In any Per System License:

(1) Microsoft shall not explicitly or implicitly require as a condition of entering into any License Agreement, or
for purposes of applying any volume discount, or otherwise, that any OEM include under its Per System License more
than one of its Personal Computer Systems;

(2) Microsoft shall not charge or collect royalties for any Covered Product on any Personal Computer System unless
the Personal Computer System is designated by the OEM in the License Agreement or in a written amendment. Microsoft
shall not require an OEM which creates a New System to notify Microsoft of the existence of such a New System, or to take
any particular actions regarding marketing or advertising of that New System, other than creation of a unique model
name or model number that the OEM shall use for internal and external identification purposes. The requirement of
external identification may be satisfied by placement of the unique model name or model number on the machine and its
container (if any), without more. The OEM and Microsoft may agree to amend the License Agreement to include any new
model of Personal Computer System in a Per System License. Nothing in this clause shall be deemed to preclude Microsoft
from seeking compensation from an OEM that makes or distributes copies of a Covered Product in breach of its License
Agreement or in violation of copyright law;

(3) The License Agreement shall not impose a penalty or charge on account of an OEM's choosing at any time to create a
New System. Addition of a New System to the OEM's License Agreement so that Covered Products are licensed for distribution
with such New System and royalties are payable with respect thereto shall not be deemed to constitute a penalty or other
charge of any kind within the meaning of the foregoing sentence;

(4) All OEMs with existing Per System Licenses, or Per Processor Licenses treated by Microsoft under Section IV (J)
as Per System Licenses, will be sent within 30 days following entry of this Final Judgment in a separately mailed notice
printed in bold, boxed type which shall begin with the sentence ``You are operating under a Microsoft Per System License,''
and shall continue with the language contained in the first four quoted paragraphs below. All new or amended Per System
Licenses executed after September 1, 1994 shall contain a provision that appears on the top half of the signature page
in bold, boxed type shall begin with the sentence ``This is a Microsoft Per System License,'' and which shall continue
with the language contained in the first four quoted paragraphs below.




``As a Customer, you may create a `New System' at any time that does not require the payment of a royalty to Microsoft
unless the Customer and Microsoft agree to add it to the Licensing Agreement.''

``Any New System created may be identical in every respect to a system as to which the Customer pays a Per System royalty
to Microsoft provided that the New System has a unique model number or model name for internal and external identification
purposes which distinguishes it from any system the Customer sells that is included in a Per System License. The requirement
of external identification may be satisfied by placement of the unique model name or model number on the machine and
its container (if any), without more.''

``If the customer does not intend to include a Microsoft operating system product with a New System, the Customer does
not need to notify Microsoft at any time of the creation, use or sale of any such New System, nor does it need to take any
particular steps to market or advertise the New System.'' 


``Under Microsoft's License Agreement, there is no charge or penalty if a Customer chooses at any time to create a New
System incorporating a non-Microsoft operating system. If the Customer intends to include a Microsoft operating
system product with the New System, the Customer must so notify Microsoft, after which the parties may enter into arm's
length negotiation with respect to a license to apply to the New System.''





In the case of OEMs with Per Processor Licenses treated as Per System Licenses pursuant to Section IV (J), the notice
shall include the following paragraph at the beginning of the notice:





``All models covered by your Per Processor License are now treated as subject to a Per System License. You may exclude
any such model from being treated as subject to a Per System License by notifying Microsoft in writing. Such notice
to Microsoft must include the model designation to be excluded from the Per System License. Such exclusion shall take
effect on the first day of the calendar quarter next following Microsoft's receipt of such notice.''





(H) Microsoft may not use any form of Lump Sum Pricing in any License Agreement of Covered Product(s) executed after
the date of this Final Judgment. It is not a violation of this Final Judgment for Microsoft to use royalty rates, including
rates embodying volume discounts, agreed upon in advance with respect to each individual OEM, each specific version
or language of a Covered Product, and each designated Personal Computer System model subject to the License Agreement.



(I) OEMs that currently have a License Agreement that is inconsistent with any provision of this Final Judgment may,
without penalty, terminate the License Agreement or negotiate with Microsoft to amend the License Agreement to eliminate
such inconsistent provisions. An OEM desiring to terminate or amend such a License Agreement shall give Microsoft
ninety (90) days written notice at any time prior to January 1, 1995. 


(J) If an OEM has a License Agreement that is inconsistent with any provision of this Final Judgment, Microsoft may
enforce that License Agreement subject to the following:

(1) if the License Agreement is a Per Processor License, Microsoft shall treat it as a Per System License for all existing
OEM models that contain the microprocessor type(s) specified in the License Agreement except those models that the
OEM opts in writing to exclude and such exclusion shall take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter net following
Microsoft's receipt of such notice, and 

(2) Microsoft may not enforce prospectively any Minimum Commitment. 

(K) Microsoft shall not enter into any NDA: 

(1) whose duration extends beyond (a) commercial release of the product covered by the NDA, (b) an earlier public disclosure
authorized by Microsoft of information covered by the NDA, or (c) one year from the date of disclosure of information
covered by the NDA to a person subject to the NDA, whichever comes first; or 


(2) that would restrict in any manner any person subject to the NDA from developing software products that will run
on competing Operating System Software products, provided that such development efforts do not entail the disclosure
or use of any Microsoft proprietary information during the term of the NDA; or 

(3) that would restrict any activities of any person subject to the NDA to whom no information covered by the NDA has
been disclosed. 

(L) The form of standard NDAs will be approved by a Microsoft corporate officer and all non-standard language in NDAs
that pertains to matters covered in Section (k) above will be approved by a Microsoft senior corporate attorney. 

(M) Within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Final Judgment, Microsoft will provide a copy of this Final Judgment
to all OEMs with whom it has License Agreements at that time except for those with licenses solely under the Small Volume
Easy Distribution (SVED) program or the Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program.

Charles A. Buscema, M.D.; Continuance of Registration



On December 21, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Charles A. Buscema, M.D. (Respondent), of Albany, New York, proposing to revoke
his DEA Certificate of Registration, BB0636021, and deny any pending applications for registration on grounds that
he had been convicted of a felony related to controlled substances, was not currently licensed to handle controlled
substances in the state in which he practices, and that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the
public interest, as set forth in 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(2), (3), and (4) and 823(f). The Order to Show Cause alleged that:
(1) On January 13, 1989, before the Albany County Court of the State of New York, Respondent was convicted of one felony
count of a violation of falsifying business records in the first degree, which falsification referred to the dispensation
of controlled substances, and Respondent was sentenced to five years probation which included a provision that he
not dispense any controlled substances from his office; (2) on November 12, 1990, Respondent voluntarily surrendered
his DEA Certificate of Registration, AB7544314, for cause; (3) on May 29, 1991, the New York State Board of Health entered
a stipulation and order which found that during the period February 1983 through November 1987, Respondent dispensed
9,850 dosage units of Schedule II controlled substances without preparing a prescription, failed to make records
of dispensing 5,060 dosage units of controlled substances, and made 32 false entries regarding controlled substances
in patient records, and as a result Respondent was assessed a civil penalty and his ability to use official New York
State prescription forms was revoked for two years; (4) on January 22, 1992, the Commissioner, New York Education
Department, Board of Regents, granted Respondent's application for a consent order with the State Board for Professional
Medical Conduct, which consent order suspended his medical license for a period of six years, stayed execution for
five years and placed his license on five years probation. As a result, Respondent was not licensed to practice medicine
in the State of New York for a period of one year beginning January 27, 1992.

Respondent, through counsel, filed a request for a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter
was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held
in Albany, New York on January 13, 1994. On April 18, 1994, in his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended
ruling, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration not be revoked
and that his application for renewal be granted. The Government filed exceptions to Judge Tenney's opinion. On May
23, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Deputy Administrator.

The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67,
hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.

The administrative law judge found that Respondent received a medical degree from Albany Medical College in 1967.
After a surgical internship in Connecticut, he entered a psychiatric residency at Albany Medical Center Hospital
and was subsequently made chief of psychiatry at Saint Peter's Hospital in Albany.

The administrative law judge found that in 1986, a review of controlled substance order forms by New York State officials
indicated that Respondent was receiving large quantities of the Schedule II controlled substance, amphetamine.
In response to a request for medical records, Respondent provided the state with order forms indicating his purchases
and a tabulation to account for his disposal of these drugs. Under New York State law, a practitioner is required to
complete a triplicate prescription form whenever he dispenses any Schedule II controlled substance, and to maintain
a patient record with evidence of examination, complaint, illness, and therapy. Respondent executed no such prescriptions
to account for his disposition of controlled substances. In response to a state request for more documentation, Respondent
claimed that his records were on computer. Respondent subsequently presented an extract of records for 17 patients.
State investigators were unable to locate nine of these patients, four others claimed they had received no such medication,
and one was a relative of Respondent's spouse. Investigators subsequently interviewed 40 other patients, of which
only five patients, all relatives of Respondent, verified that they had received the controlled substances that
Respondent attributed to them.

The administrative law judge found that on January 13, 1989, before the Albany County Court of the State of New York,
Respondent was convicted of one felony count of a violation of falsifying business records in the first degree, which
falsification referred to the dispensation of controlled substances. Respondent was sentenced to five years probation
which included a provision that he not dispense any controlled substances from his office. Subsequently, on November
12, 1990, Respondent voluntarily surrendered his DEA Certificate of Registration, AB7544314, for cause.
On May 29, 1991, Respondent and the New York State Board of Health entered a stipulation and order which found that during
the period February 1983 through November 1987, Respondent dispensed 9,850 dosage units of Schedule II controlled
substances without preparing a prescription; failed to make records of dispensing 5,060 dosage units of controlled
substances, and had made 32 false entries regarding controlled substances in nine patient care records. Respondent
was assessed a civil penalty of $30,000, of which $15,000 was stayed. On January 22, 1992, the Commissioner, New York
Education Department, Board of Regents, granted Respondent's application for a consent order with the State Board
for Professional Medical Conduct. The consent order suspended Respondent's medical license for a period of six years,
stayed execution for five years and placed his license on five years probation. As a result, Respondent was not licensed
to practice medicine in the State of New York for a period of one year beginning January 27, 1992. Respondent's medical
license was restored on January 28, 1993.

At the hearing in this matter, Respondent testified that after his state conviction, he was concerned that his wife
not be prosecuted or charged with any violation of law. He stated that his wife, who had also been his office employee,
had been sick and was having problems with drugs. There was no indication that Respondent used drugs himself. Respondent
claimed that he voluntarily submitted to random drug testing and monitoring, that he never tested positive for drugs;
and that he will continue to be monitored for another four years. Respondent stated that it was his opinion that his
wife had taken the amphetamines, but he did not know how much. Respondent testified that he attempted to counsel his
wife for chemical dependency, and he did not get her help earlier due to the fact that he had a very high profile psychiatric
practice in town. His wife subsequently got involved with a rehabilitative program, now holds a top nursing job, and
has been ``clean'' from drugs for a number of years. Respondent conceded that he made a mistake in the way he handled
things and stated that it was an error in judgment to stonewall or attempt to cover up his wife's abuse of controlled
substances. Respondent felt that he paid for this mistake and is still doing so.

The administrative law judge found that Respondent is currently employed as a staff psychiatrist for the State of
New York. Respondent presented testimony from his peers and supervisor that he was well-liked, extremely motivated,
hard-working, knowledgeable, and that he was considered exceptionally competent, an excellent clinician, and
made positive contributions to the state institution and his patients. Respondent's supervisor was of the opinion
that Respondent could competently assume the responsibilities of a DEA registration.

Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), the Deputy Administrator may revoke a registration if he determines that such registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest,
the following factors shall be considered:



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940819-2-00114 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940819-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.

(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.

(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.''

It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. 

Paul Stepak, M.D., 

51 FR 17556 (1986).

The administrative law judge found that all five factors were relevant in determining whether Respondent's registration
should be revoked. As to the first factor, the administrative law judge found that Respondent has a current license
to practice medicine and handle controlled substances. As to the second factor, Respondent failed to execute prescriptions
to account for the disposition of Schedule II controlled substances, and attributed controlled substances to patients
who had not received them. As to the third factor, Respondent was convicted of one felony count of falsifying records
related to the dispensing of controlled substances. As to the fourth factor, Respondent violated New York State laws
relating to controlled substances, and surrendered his previous DEA Certificate of Registration for cause. As to
the fifth factor, the administrative law judge found that there was no indication that Respondent himself has abused
drugs, but Respondent inferred that his wife took the amphetamines due to her own drug problems.

The administrative law judge found that Respondent's guilty plea to the felony was motivated by his desire to spare
his wife from prosecution. The administrative law judge also found Respondent's testimony to be sincere, and gave
substantial weight to the fact that the State of New York had exacted full and fair retribution for Respondent's conviction.
Respondent was discharged from probation two and one-half years early, and has accepted responsibility for his conduct
and failures regarding his wife's chemical dependency, which has now been successfully treated. Consequently,
the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's registration not be revoked.

The Government filed exceptions to the recommendation of the administrative law judge contending that Respondent's
testimony had failed to respond to the issue of diversion of the controlled substances and his subsequent cover-up
activity; that Judge Tenney had applied undue weight to the character evidence presented by Respondent; and that,
in any event, Respondent has not shown that he does not pose a continuing threat to diversion, especially with regard
to Schedule II controlled substances.

The Deputy Administrator concurs with the administrative law judge's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended
ruling in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant
to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that
DEA Certificate of Registration, BB0636021, issued to Charles A. Buscema, M.D., be and it hereby is, continued, and
that any pending applications, be, and they hereby are, granted. This order is effective on August 19, 1994.

Fort Vancouver Plywood, Vancouver, WA; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration



On July 15, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. The notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 26, 1994 (59 FR 37993).

Investigation findings show that the subject firm is an employee-owned company operating as a cooperative which
produces softwood plywood.

New findings on reconsideration show a substantial decline in employment in fiscal year (FY) 1994 compared to FY 1993.
Sales and production declines occurred in FY 1994 compared to FY 1993.

The subject firms's fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. U.S. aggregate imports of soft plywood increased substantially
in 1993 compared to 1992.

On reconsideration, the Department conducted a survey of Fort Vancouver Plywood's customers to determine whether
the ``contributed importantly'' test of Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was met. The Department's
survey shows that customers accounting for a major portion of the subject firm's sales decline in FY 1994 increased
their imported purchases of plywood while decreasing their purchases from the subject firm.



Conclusion



After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that workers and former
workers of Fort Vancouver Plywood in Vancouver, Washington were adversely affected by increased imports of articles
that are like or directly competitive with the softwood plywood produced at the subject firm. In accordance with the
provisions of the Act, I make the following revised determination for workers of Fort Vancouver Plywood in Vancouver,
Washington.




``All workers of Fort Vancouver Plywood in Vancouver, Washington who became totally or partially separated from
employment on or after March 18, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade
Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Investigations Regarding Certifications of Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



Petitions have been filed with the Secretary of Labor under Section 221(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (``the Act'') and
are identified in the Appendix to this notice. Upon receipt of these petitions, the Director of the Office of Trade
Adjustment Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, has instituted investigations pursuant to Section
221(a) of the Act.

The purpose of each of the investigations is to determine whether the workers are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Title II, Chapter 2, of the Act. The investigations will further relate, as appropriate, to the determination
of the date on which total or partial separations began or threatened to begin and the subdivision of the firm involved.

The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing, provided such request is filed in writing with the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, at the address show below, not later than August 29, 1994.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments regarding the subject matter of the investigations to
the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than August 29, 1994.

The petitions filed in this case are available for inspection at the Office of the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.,

<DOCTITLE>J&G Shake, Forks, WA; Notice of Revised Determination on Reopening </DOCTITLE>



On August 3, 1994, the Department on its own reopened its investigation for workers and former workers of the subject
firm. The initial investigation resulted in a denial for workers of J&G Shake, Forks, Washington. The denial
notice will soon be published in the Federal Register

.

New investigation findings on reopening show a major customer increased its reliance on imported cedar shakes and
shingles in the relevant period. The customer accounted for the preponderance of the subject firm's sales decline
in the relevant period.



Conclusion



After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reopening, it is concluded that increased imports of articles
like or directly competitive with cedar shakes and shingles produced by J&G Shake, Forks, Washington contributed
importantly to the decline in sales and production and to the total or partial separation of workers at J&G Shake,
Forks, Washington.

In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following revised determination:




``All workers and former workers of J&G Shake, Fork, Washington who became totally of partially separated from
employment on or after April 21, 1993 through two years from the date of certification are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974''

<DOCTITLE>Ucar Carbon Company, Inc. Robinson, IL; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



By an application dated July 28, 1994, a former worker requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition
for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on June 23, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36792).

Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:

(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;

(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or

(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.

The former worker stated that increased imports of aluminum ingot adversely affected workers at UCAR Carbon Company
producing calcined petroleum coke which is used to make carbon anodes for the production of aluminum.

The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Worker Group Eligibility
Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. Aluminum is not interchangeable with calcined petroleum coke.

Investigation findings show that UCAR Carbon in Robison, Illinois closed on May 1, 1994. The workers produced calcined
petroleum coke. The findings show that calcined petroleum coke at UCAR Carbon is used to make (1) Carbon anodes which
are used up in the production of aluminum and (2) graphite electrodes used in electric arc furnaces for steelmaking.

Articles which are consumed in the making of a finished article are not like or directly competitive with the finished
article. Calcined petroleum coke and aluminum are not interchangeable. Accordingly, imported aluminum is not like
or directly competitive with calcined petroleum coke within the meaning of Section 222(3) of the Trade Act. Therefore,
aluminum imports cannot be considered in determining import injury to workers engaged in employment related to the
production of calcined petroleum coke.

The Trade Act did not intend to provide TAA benefits for everyone who is in some way affected by foreign competition,
but only for those workers of a firm which has experienced increased imports of articles that are like or directly competitive
with those produced at the subject firm. The increased imports must have ``contributed importantly'' to worker separations
and decreased sales or production at the workers' firm.



Conclusion



After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>




General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.


The determination in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.


Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.



General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedes decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.




Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determination, 200 Constitution
Avenue, N.W., Room S-3014, Washington, D.C. 20210.

<DOCTITLE>Abnormal Occurrences for First Quarter CY 1994; Dissemination of Information</DOCTITLE>



Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, requires NRC to disseminate information on abnormal
occurrences (i.e., unscheduled incidents or events that the Commission determines are significant from the standpoint
of public health and safety). During the first quarter of CY 1994, the following incidents at NRC licensees were determined
to be abnormal occurrences (AOs) and are described below, together with the remedial actions taken. The events are
also being included in NUREG-0090, Vol. 17, No. 1, (``Report to Congress on Abnormal Occurrences: January-March
1994''). This report will be available at NRC's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington,
DC 20555 about three weeks after the publication date of this 

Federal Register

 Notice.



Nuclear Power Plants



94-1 Inoperable Main Steam Line Isolation Valves at Perry Nuclear Power Plant



One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a major reduction in the degree of protection to public health and safety
from a major degradation of essential safety-related equipment can be considered an AO.



Date and Place

_March 1992; Perry Nuclear Power Plant, a General Electric-designed boiling water reactor (BWR), operated by Cleveland
Electric Illuminating Company and located about 11 kilometers (7 miles) northeast of Painesville, Ohio.



Nature and Probable Consequences

_The main steam isolation, leakage control and outboard drain valves in three of four main steam lines penetrating
containment failed to meet the Technical Specifications limiting condition of operation (LCO) for leak tightness.

For many BWRs, the LCO for leakage of each main steam isolation valve (MSIV) is 0.326 standard cubic meters (11.5 standard
cubic feet) per hour. Because it is difficult to measure the leakage of each valve individually, a maximum combined
allowed leakage is specified for the inboard and outboard MSIVs, and the associated control and drain valves. This
LCO is 0.71 standard cubic meters (25 standard cubic feet) per hour. During testing at Perry in 1992, the leakages through
the MSIVs were approximately 12 times allowable. Due to a history of poor performance and multiple main steam line
valve leakage, a detailed analysis of the 1992 MSIV leakage was performed. The analysis is required obtaining detailed
information from the licensee; a number of calculations, reviews, and subsequent reanalyses; and multiple meetings
among the staff to determine the impact on safety.

MSIVs are designed to close and limit the release of radioactivity to the environment in the unlikely event of an accident.
When the Perry facility was issued an operating license, there was reasonable assurance that the MSIVs would operate
as intended, and the potential off-site doses resulting from postulated accidents, which includes assumptions
regarding fuel damage and fission product release, would be below the guideline values for release to the general
public. Because of the excessive leakage, the NRS staff, using conservative assumptions, calculated the potential
off-site doses to the general public that might result from a postulated loss-of-coolant accident. Using the very
conservative licensing basis calculational methodologies, the calculated dose exceeded the guidelines for release
to the general public. A more realistic calculation using the new approach presented in draft NUREG-1465, ``Accident
Source Terms for Light-Water Nuclear Power Plants'' (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NUREG-1465, ``Accident
Source Terms for Light-Water Nuclear Power Plants,'' Draft Report for Comment, June 1992) showed that the potential
off-site doses would not exceed the limits for release to the general public; however, additional measures would
be needed to minimize exposure of control room personnel.

Cause or Causes_The licenses determined the reason for the excessive MSIV leakage during the 1992 tests to be excessive
friction from oxide buildup, which caused end-of-stroke angular misalignment resulting in non-360-degree seat
contact (Licensee Event Report 50-440/92-006-01, ``Local Leak Rate Test Results Exceed Allowable
Primary Containment Leakage for Main Steam Lines A, B, and D,'' August 14, 1992). The reason for the difficulty of the
Perry MSIVs to meet test leakage limits is design geometry. The MSIVs are ``Y'' pattern valves with the valve stem at
45 degrees to the piping axis. To seat properly, translational motion of the poppet at the moment of impact must change
from the direction of the stem to a direction parallel to the axis of the pipe. Seating is made more difficult because
of the large size of the valves (66 centimeters [26 inches] diameter) and the weights involved (4500 kilograms [10,000
pounds]).



Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence





Licensee

_In the early 1980s, Atwood & Morrill, suppliers of the MSIVs, and the BWR Owners Group recognized the need for
better maintenance and for modification of the MSIVs. Modifications included improved poppet nose guides to overcome
eccentricity during seating and poppet anti-rotation devices. During the 1992 refueling outage, these modifications
were installed by the licensee on the six (out of eight) MSIVs which have had leakage problems (Licensee Event Report
50-440/92-006-01, ``Local Leak Rate Test Results Exceed Allowable Primary Containment Leakage
for Main Steam Lines A, B, and D,'' August 14, 1992). Based on leakage tests performed in 1993 and 1994, the modifications
were successful in significantly reducing MSIV leakage.



NRC

_NRC is closely monitoring the licensee's program and progress in reducing the leak rate through the MSIVs.

94-2 Medical Brachytherapy Misadministration at Hospital Metropolitano in R&iacute;o Piedras,
Puerto Rico


One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic exposure to any part of the body not scheduled to receive
radiation can be considered an abnormal occurrence.


Date and Place

_December 11, 1993; Hospital Metropolitano; R&iacute;o Piedras, Puerto Rico.


Nature and Probable Consequences

_On December 9, 1993, at 5:20 p.m., a patient began a gynecological low-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment. The patient
was prescribed a treatment of 3000 centigray (cGy) (3000 rad) by a 48-hours exposure to approximately 2.3 gigabecquerel
(61.3 millicurie [mCi]) of cesium-137 (Cs-137).
On December 11, 1993, at approximately 7:30 a.m. (about 10 hours before the end of the prescribed treatment), the patient
intervened with the procedure by removing the implant containing three Cs-137 sources of approximately 730
megabecquerel (20.4 mCi) each, and placed it next to her thigh. Shortly after removing the implant, the patient showed
the device to the floor nurse. The nurse recognized the implant and understood the need for concern. She did not take
the device from the patient but reported the situation to her supervisor. The patient apparently returned the device
next to her thigh beneath the bed linen.
At the time of being informed, the nursing supervisor was experiencing difficulty with another patient, and was involved
in shift turnover. Due to these distractions, the supervisor failed to realize the urgent nature of the situation
and did not make required notifications.
On several occasions that morning, other licensee personnel entered the patient's room without realizing that the
radioactive source was exposed because it was covered by bed linen; the patient did not notify any additional staff
members that she had removed the implant. Approximately 21/2 hours after the estimated time of the source removal,
the attending physician attempted to perform a routine check of the implant and discovered that it had been removed
and placed next to the patient's thigh.
After properly accounting for and storing the sources, the physician examined and interviewed the patient. Based
on discussions with the patient and review of the exposure received, the attending physician terminated the treatment.
This decision was based on the physician's determination that the treatment received was clinically adequate and
his concern that the patient was a threat to herself and others.
The actual dose delivered to the intended treatment site was calculated to be 2270 cGy (2270 rad). The written directive
was revised to reflect the lower dose delivered. The licensee's evaluation of the incident indicated that assuming
the implant remained in the same location for three hours, the maximum dose to the skin of the patient's thigh (the wrong
treatment site) was 572 cGy (572 rad). The licensee reported that no adverse effects to the patient are expected.
The patient was notified verbally at the time the misadministration was discovered and then notified in writing on
January 13, 1994.


Cause or Causes


The initial cause of the misadministration was the patient's removal of the implant which was compounded by the failure
of the two nurses to follow emergency procedures. The nurses' failure to respond to the emergency resulted in approximately
21/2 hours of unnecessary exposure.


Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence




Licensee

_The licensee determined that the nursing supervisor's failure to make the required notifications was due to the
lack of familiarity with established radiation safety procedures to which he/she had been trained. The licensee's
investigation of the event revealed that the lack of familiarity with radiation safety procedures was caused by the
infrequent handling of patients undergoing therapy with licensed materials (Letter from Hospital Metropolitano,
to H&eacute;ctor Berm&uacute;dez, Senior Inspector, NMI Section, NRC Region II, Forwarding a Misadministration
Report dated December 29, 1993, and an Addendum to the Misadministration Report dated January 11, 1994, Docket No.
030-11155, Licensee No. 52-16033-01). The licensee held a Radiation Safety Committee meeting
in which the incident and corrective actions to prevent recurrence were discussed.
The licensee decided to dedicate one floor of the hospital for all therapies involving NRC-licensed materials. This
will provide additional controls to allow the licensee to better ensure that nurses assigned to the floor are kept
current and familiar with operating and emergency procedures. The licensee is also evaluating the need to increase
patient awareness regarding non-intervention of procedures.
The licensee is revising its procedures for responding to radiological emergencies involving patients undergoing
radiopharmaceutical or sealed source therapy. As a minimum, the procedures will define what is a radiological emergency
and will provide examples of situations which must be considered radiological emergencies or which could result
in misadministrations. The licensee also committed to developing and implementing a retraining program based on
the revised emergency procedures for all hospital employees who may be involved in handling patients receiving radiation
therapy.


NRC

_A special inspection was conducted on December 15 and 17, 1993, to review the circumstances surrounding the misadministration
and the licensee's Quality Management program. A Confirmatory Action Letter (CAL) was issued to the licensee on December
30, 1993 (Letter from J. Philip Stohr, Director, Division of Radiation Safety and Safeguards, NRC Region II, to Hospital
Metropolitano, Attn: Mr. V&iacute;ctor Marrero, Administrator, forwarding a Confirmatory Action Letter, CAL
No. 2-93-14, Docket No. 030-11155, License No. 52-16033-01, dated December 30, 1993).
The CAL confirmed that the licensee would revise its emergency procedures and implement a training program, based
on new procedures, for all licensee employees who may handle patients undergoing radiation therapy. An NRC medical
consultant has been retained to perform a clinical assessment of this misadministration. The medical consultant's
report is expected to be available in time to discuss his findings in the second quarter AO Report. As of the issuance
of this report, NRC is pursuing escalated enforcement action against the licensee.

94-3 Teletherapy Misadministration at Triangle Radiation Oncology Associates in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania


One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic misadministration that affects two or more patients at
the same facility, regardless of any health effects, can be considered an abnormal occurrence.


Date and Place

_December 20, 1993; Triangle Radiation Oncology Associates; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.


Nature and Probable Consequences

_On December 20, 1993, Triangle Radiation Oncology Associates in Beaver, Pennsylvania, notified NRC of two potential
teletherapy misadministrations that occurred between December 13 and 17, 1993, at the licensee's Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
facility. The potential misadministrations were identified during a review of patient records on December 17, 1993,
when the licensee observed calculation errors involving the depth of the dose given to each of the two patients.
Both cases involved breast treatments where the original treatment plan prescribed 28 treatments of 180 centigray
(cGy) (180 rad) from a cobalt-60 teletherapy source (using 2 parallel opposed fields) for a total absorbed dose of
5040 cGy (5040 rad). The primary breast treatments were concluded on December 10, 1993. The physician wrote separate
written directives for each patient to receive an additional 1000 cGy (1000 rad) to the scar in 5 treatments of 200 cGy
(200 rad) per day. One of the written directives indicated that the absorbed dose was to be delivered at d

max

, the maximum extension of the teletherapy unit, which, as stated by the physicist, is typically a depth of 0.5 centimeter
(cm) (0.2 inch). The other written directive did not indicate a depth; however, the physician stated that the intended
depth was d

max

.
As described above, such a treatment plan would typically have been calculated by the teletherapy technologist at
the Pittsburgh facility and communicated by telephone to the teletherapy physicist at the Beaver facility to be checked.
However, this procedure changed when the computer at the Pittsburgh facility was taken out of service on December
1, 1993.
On December 9, 1993, the teletherapy technologist hand wrote a paraphrased request of the written directive for the
two breast-treatment patients needing scar booster dose calculations. Rather than writing d

max

, the technologist stated the tumor dose at a depth of 5 cm (2 inch) and sent the request, via facsimile transmission,
to the teletherapy physicist at the Beaver facility. Hand calculations were performed for 200 cGy (200 rad) treatments
at a 5 cm (2 inch) depth, checked by a certified physicist, and sent back to the technologist, via facsimile transmission,
on December 9, 1993.

The patients were treated from December 13 to 17, 1993, and received doses of 1300 and 1320 cGy (1300 and 1320 rad) respectively,
rather than the 1000 cGy (1000 rad) intended. This resulted in misadministrations of 30 and 32 percent greater than
the intended dose. The licensee's physician stated that no adverse clinical effects are expected as a result of the
overexposures.

After the initial report, the licensee told NRC in subsequent telephone conversations that a recalculation of the
dose averaged over the entire tumor volume did not exceed 30 percent and, therefore, the licensee no longer thought
the definition of a misadministration applied in this case.

NRC performed a special inspection on December 28 and 29, 1993, to review the potential misadministrations. Information
gathered during this inspection, including the calculations of the administered doses, was given to an NRC scientific
consultant to evaluate. The scientific consultant, in his report to NRC, stated that ``the dose prescription was
to d

max

 (i.e., 0.5 cm [0.2 inch] depth on the central axis) and a misadministration can only be judged by considering the dose
given to this point. * * * clearly in both cases a misadministration has taken place.'' On March 25,
1994, the licensee was informed that the doses to both patients were deemed to be misadministrations. The licensee
submitted its report of misadministrations in a letter dated April 7, 1994.

After receiving the scientific consultant's report, an NRC medical consultant was retained to perform a clinical
evaluation of the patients. The medical consultant is still reviewing the potential health effects to the patients.
The consultant's report is expected to be completed in time to update this writeup in the next AO report to Congress.

The referring physician was notified and determined that, based on medical judgment, informing the patients of the
misadministrations would be harmful.



Cause or Causes

_The technologist incorrectly transposed the treatment depth on the facsimile used to prepare the treatment plan.
The technologist failed to make reference to d

max

 and entered the depth value incorrectly as 5.0 cm (2 inch) instead of the intended 0.5 cm (0.2 inch).



Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence





Licensee

_The licensee implemented a requirement for a stamp to be placed on all written directives that prompts a clear documentation
of key treatment parameters such as site, method, daily dose, fractions, total dose
s, depth of calculation, spinal blocks, other blocks, and date. Previously, key parameters had been informally handwritten
directives on patients's treatment charts. The licensee also formalized its requirement to include the written
directive for all dosimetry calculation requests from the Beaver facility, and revised its ``weekly chart check''
procedure to increase chart reviews from once a week to twice a week, as was the practice prior to December 1, 1993.



NRC

_NRC is reviewing the licensee's April 7, 1994, misadministration report and the findings of the December 28 to 29,
1993, NRC inspection. Once the NRC medical consultant's report is received, enforcement action will be considered.

94-4 Lost Reference Sources at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas



One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that any serious deficiency in management or procedural controls in a major

Nature and Probable Consequences

_As prescribed by the licensees's Compliance Accountability and Control Procedures, in 1993, the licensee performed
an audit of all licensed sources at Armstrong Laboratory. During this audit, the licensee identified four missing
strontium-90 (Sr-90) reference sources of approximately 14.8 megabecquerel (400 microcurie) each. The licensee
conducted an extensive physical search for the sources and reviewed all radioactive material permits issued to other
organizations at Brooks AFB. When the disposition of the Sr-90 sealed sources could not be determined, the licensee
reported the loss of the four sealed sources to NRC by telephone on September 22, 1993. The licensee informed NRC that
the United States Air Force (USAF) Inspector General would review this incident. The licensee suspected that the
sources had been inadvertently discarded and transported to a sanitary landfill.

The licensee evaluated possible radiation exposure to members of the general public and concluded that unless the
sources were removed from the container, the radiation levels from the sources would be near background level. Furthermore,
unless a deliberate effort was made to open the source capsules, an individual handling the sources would receive
less exposure than allowed by regulatory limits for the general public.



Cause or Causes

_During 1991, the timeframe during which the sources were apparently lost, a number of individuals were responsible
for the radiation safety program at Brooks AFB. These individuals were temporary or part-time Radiation Safety Officers
(RSOs), and had extensive, temporary duties at other sites.

The results of the USAF Inspector General's investigation determined that ``programmatic issues started to plague
radiation safety at Brooks AFB after the dismantling of the base/clinic program and the inception of additional duty
RSOs.'' The report explained that in 1986, the radiation safety function and responsibility was transferred to the
base clinic at Brooks AFB. Almost simultaneously, a Joint Military Medical Command (JMMC) was established and the
base clinic became a part of JMMC. JMMC was a medical command established to service all branches of the Armed Forces
in the San Antonio, Texas, area. With this action, the radiation safety program was managed by an organization that
was not responsible to any management level at Brooks AFB. Furthermore, the report stated that JMMC dismantled the
clinic's radiation safety program, and ``requested that all organizations previously under the clinic's program
establish and run their own radiation safety program.'' Exacerbating the problem was the appointment of the additional
duty RSOs, who had ``limited to general knowledge of radiation safety,'' and no directives or other guidance to assist
them. Additionally, ``the additional duty RSOs received little management oversight after they had been appointed
to the RSO position.''

The investigation concluded that from 1986 through 1991, there had been a lack of commitment to management oversight,
and a serious disregard for radiation safety issues.



Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence





Licensee

_In 1991, Armstrong Laboratory was placed under a new Air Force Command. The Command committed to increased management
oversight of the radiation safety programs. Additionally, physical inventory procedures were revised.



NRC

_NRC conducted an inspection (Letter from Dwight D. Chamberlain, Acting Director, Division of Radiation Safety
and Safeguards, NRC Region IV, to Lt. Colonel Joseph J. Donnelly, chief of USAF Radioisotope Committee Secretariat,
forwarding Inspection Report No. 030-28641/93-10, Docket No. 030-28641, License No. 42-23539-01AF,
dated January 19, 1994) at Brooks AFB on December 21, 1993, to review the circumstances associated with the loss of
licensed material, after receiving a written report from the licensee on December 10, 1993. NRC also held an Enforcement
Conference with the licensee on February 3, 1994, to review the findings of the inspection and to determine enforcement
action.

On February 11, 1994, NRC issued a Notice of Violation (Letter from L.J. Callan, Regional Administrator, NRC Region
IV, to Department of the Air Force, USAF Radioisotope Committee, forwarding Notice of Violation, Docket No. 030-28641,
License No. 42-23539-01AF, dated February 11, 1994) for violations involving (1) a failure to secure
licensed material and (2) failure to include in one USAF permit a requirement to conduct a periodic physical inventory
of all licensed materials.

These violations were categorized as a Severity Level III and a Severity Level IV, respectively (Severity Level I
through V range from the most significant to the least significant, respectively). No civil penalty was assessed
because of the Air Force's discovery of this violation and the promptness and comprehensiveness of the corrective
actions. The licensee has responded in writing to the Notice of Violation and no additional actions are required.

94-5 Medical Brachytherapy Misadministration at the University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati, Ohio



One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic exposure to a part of the body not scheduled to receive radiation
can be considered an abnormal occurrence.



Date and Place

_January 7, 1994; University of Cincinnati; Cincinnati, Ohio.



Nature and Probable Consequences

_On January 14, 1994, NRC was notified by telephone of a misadministration involving a leaking iodine-125 (I-125)
brachytherapy implant seed. On January 7, 1994, 16 I-125 seeds, each ranging from 370 to 1110 megabecquerel
(MBq) (10 to 30 millicurie [mCi]) activity, were implanted in the brain of a 30-year-old male patient. Following the
explant procedure on January 14, 1994, the licensee identified radioactive contamination in the surgical room and
bathroom used by the patient. Personnel from the licensee's radiation safety office identified the contamination
to be I-125 and confirmed that at least one seed was leaking. Further analysis by the licensee determined that
one seed was damaged during the implant procedure by a surgical staple. The seed originally contained 758 MBq (20.5
mCi) of I-125 and, based on an assay of the explanted source, the licensee estimated that the loss was approximately
74 MBq (2.0 mCi).

Thyroid monitoring of the patient's visitors and hospital employees involved in the care of the patient was performed
by the licensee. One of the licensee's employees was determined to have received a committed dose equivalent to the
thyroid of 50 microsievert ( u Sv) (5 millirem [mrem]). In addition, a visitor was determined to have received a
committed dose equivalent to the thyroid of 540  u Sv (54 mrem), or a total effective dose equivalent of 160  u Sv
(1.6 mrem), which is less than the annual limit for members of the general public of 1000  u Sv (100 mrem).

Through patient monitoring, the licensee estimates that approximately 5 percent of the free I-125 was taken
up in the patient's thyroid. (In a normally functioning, unblocked thyroid, approximately 25 percent of the free
iodine would be taken up in an individual's thyroid.) The licensee estimates that the uptake would result in a radiation
dose to the thyroid of approximately 300 centigray (300 rad). The licensee does not expect any adverse medical effects
to the patient as a result of the misadministration. An NRC medical consultant concluded that the non-radioactive
iodinated contrast agent used during an imaging procedure performed on the patient prior to the implant blocked the
absorption of the I-125. He also concluded that exposure to the radiation levels described has resulted in an
increased probability of developing thyroid tumor(s) in the future.

The licensee notified the referring physician, the patient, and the patient's family of the misadministration.



Cause or Causes

_The seed leaked after being inadvertently crushed by a surgical staple used to secure the catheters during the implant
procedure.



Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence





Licensee

_For future procedures, the licensee plans to ensure that the implanted seeds are located further down the catheter
in order to reduce the likelihood of seed damage from surgical staples. The licensee also plans to examine each I-125
seed for leakage following each explant procedure.



NRC

_NRC dispatched two inspectors on January 16, 1994, to monitor the licensee's decontamination efforts and to obtain
more details on the misadministration. NRC also obtained the services of a medical consultant to review the medical
implications of the incident. A followup NRC inspection (Letter from W.L. Axelson, Director, Division of Radiation
Safety and Safeguards, to Donald Harrison, M.D., Senior Vice President and Provost for Health Affairs, University
of Cincinnati, forwarded Inspection Report No. 030-02764/94001, Docket No. 030-02764, License No.
34-06903-05, dated March 10, 1994) was conducted from February 7 to 11, 1994. On March 16, 1994, NRC held
a telephone Enforcement Conference with the licensee to discuss the safety inspections conducted in January and
February 1994, at the University of Cincinnati.

A Notice of Violation was issued by NRC on March 25, 1994, which imposed a fine of $5000 for a violation not associated
with this misadministration. In the Notice of Violation, NRC determined that the inadvertent opening of the I-125
sealed source did not constitute a violation of the University of Cincinnati's license.

94-6 Medical Brachytherapy Misadministration at Keesler Medical Center at Keesler Air Force Base
in Biloxi, Mississippi



One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic exposure to a part of the body scheduled to receive radiation
such that the actual dose received is greater than 1.5 5imes the prescribed dose can be considered an abnormal occurrence.



Date and Place

_January 13, 1994; Keesler Medical Center, Keesler Air Force Base; Biloxi, Mississippi.



Nature and Probable Consequences

_A patient was prescribed a lung brachytherapy treatment delivered by an Omnitron 2000 high-dose-rate (HDR) remote
afterloader system. The prescribed tumor treatment plan included 1000 centigray (cGy) (1000 rad) absorbed doses
at 5 treatment positions using a 144.3 gigabecquerel (3.9 curie) iridium-192 source within a special needle. At the
end of fifth and last treatment, the source wire retracted 0.5 centimeter (cm) (0.2 inch) and stopped. Alarms immediately
alerted Keesler staff that the source remained inside the patient's body. Licensee personnel followed emergency
procedures, entered the therapy room and removed the needle from the patient. Once outside the patient's body, the
radioactive source retracted to the stored position.

The licensee determined that the source remained stuck at 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) above the fifth position for approximately
21/2 minutes. The treatment plan called for the delivery of 1000 centigray (cGy) (1000 rad) at 1cm from each of the 5
treatment positions. As a result of the additional 21/2 minutes exposure, the last treatment position received 1732
cGy (1732 rad) absorbed dose, or 73.2 percent over the prescribed dose. The treatment plan also predicted an 800 cGy
(800 rad) absorbed dose at 0.5cm (0.2 inch) from each of the 5 treatment positions. The point 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) above
the last treatment position, where the movement of the source stopped, received approximately 1400 cGy (1400 rad),
or 75 percent greater than the absorbed dose stipulated in the prescribed treatment plan. The failure of the source
to retract resulted in a single overexposure, causing an overall absorbed dose of 75 percent greater than that prescribed,
for all the tissue surrounding the position 0.5cm (0.2 inch) above the last treatment site.

The licensee reported that no adverse health effects to the patient are expected. The patient was immediately notified
of the misadministration.



Cause or Causes



The patient had made a sudden move near the end of the treatment causing the special needle to bend at the point where
it extended beyond the biopsy needle. The bend prevented the radioactive source from retracting to the stored position,
causing the misadministration.



Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence





Licensee

_The licensee immediately stopped the use of the HDR device pending a complete check of the system by the manufacturer
(Letter from Omnitron International, Inc. to NRC Document control Desk, forwarding a Report of HDR misadministration,
Part 21- Reporting of Defects and Noncompliance, Omnitron Report No. 102, dated January 19, 1994, Docket No.
030-26841, License No. 42-23539-01AF; and Letter from Omnitron International, Inc. to John W.
Lubinski, Mechanical Engineer, Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, NRC Washington, D.C., forwarding a report
of Inspection of Source Wire, dated April 6, 1994, Docket No. 030-26841, License No. 42-23539-01AF).
The licensee also evaluated the practice of extending special needles beyond biopsy needles and the probability
of patient movement causing damage, and decided to discontinue this practice (Letter from Department of the Army,
HQ AFMOA/SGPR, Brooks AFB, TX to NRC Region IV, forwarding the 15-Day Report of Misadministration at Keesler AFB,
MS, dated February 1, 1994, Docket 030-26841, License No. 42-23539-01AF; and Letter from Department
of the Army, HQ AFMOA/SGPR, Brooks AFB, TX to NRC Region IV, responding to a NRC Confirmatory Action Letter (dated January
18, 1994), dated March 8, 1994, Docket 030-26841, License No. 42-23539-01AF).



NRC

_A special inspection was conducted from January 19 to 21, 1994, to review the circumstances surrounding the misadministration
and the licensee's Quality Management program. A representative of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also
participated in this inspection. No violations of regulatory requirements were identified during the inspection,
but NRC initiated the following actions: (1) A Confirmatory Action Letter (Letter from James L. Milhoan, Regional
Administrator, Region IV, to Department of the Army, USAF Radioisotope Committee, HQ AFMOA/SGPR, Brooks AFB, TX,
forwarding a Confirmatory Action Letter, CAL No. 4-94-01, Docket No. 030-28641, License No. 42-23539-01AF,
dated January 18, 1994) was issued to the licensee on January 18, 1994, which prohibited the use of the HDR unit until
serviced by the manufacturer; (2) a medical consultant was contracted to evaluate the clinical effects and to assess
the events that led to this misadministration; (3) the manufacturer was asked to analyze the source wire involved
in the misadministration for damage as a result of the stresses experienced during this event; (4) Southwest Research
Institute was contracted to analyze the special needle for mechanical failure; (5) a generic communication is being
developed to notify other HDR users of the results of the inspection and related research; and (6) NRC is coordinating
with FDA an evaluation of the generic implications surrounding this event.

Date and Place

_January 27, 1994; Alexandria Hospital; Alexandria, Virginia.



Nature and Probable Consequences

_On January 27, 1994, a patient was scheduled to receive a 500 centigray (cGy) (500 rad) brachytherapy treatment to
the trachea using a Nucletron high-dose-rate (HDR) remote afterloader system. A single catheter was used for this
endobronchial treatment and the licensee performed a routine simulated treatment. During this simulation, the
oncologist established a 3 centimeter (cm) (1.2 inch) tumor treatment site and added a 1 cm (0.4 inch) margin on both
ends of the tumor site.

Normally, at this time the medial physicist and the dosimetrist plot distances, measured in centimeters along the
length of the catheter shown in the simulation film, in order to program the HDR for precise treatment at the prescribed
treatment site. This step was not performed and the procedure was initiated without the HDR being properly programmed.
The unprogrammed source was allowed to travel beyond the treatment site into the left lung area where the catheter
ended. The treatment resulted in the prescribed 500 cGy (500 rad) effective dose equivalent being delivered to the
left lung instead of the trachea target site. Prior to administering the dose, the treatment plan and treatment console
printout were reviewed by the dosimetrist, the medical physicist, and the oncologist. All three individuals failed
to identify the failure to plot the treatment site. Immediately following the treatment, the licensee's medical
physicist realized that the plotting and programming of the treatment site were not performed. After discovery of
the treatment error, the oncologist determined that the patient should be treated again using the correct treatment
parameters.

The licensee has advised NRC that no adverse effects to the patient are anticipated as a result of this misadministration.
The licensee has informed the patient of the misadministration.



Cause or Causes

_The licensee's radiation therapy staff failed to follow the licensee's normal protocol for treatment with the HDR
remote afterloader. The failure to administer the treatment as prescribed resulted from performing the treatment
planning and independent verification in the vicinity of the HDR console, where there were a number of distractions.



Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence





Licensee

_The licensee's corrective actions included immediate retraining of all personnel involved in brachytherapy treatments
and the addition of a checklist for each step in the treatment process. The licensee also added steps to its Quality
Management program for HDR brachytherapy. These steps now require the use of the treatment planning computer with
manual verification of the input parameter and the use of the treatment parameter card generated by the planning computer
to program the HDR rather than programming the HDR treatment parameters manually.



NRC

_NRC conducted a special inspection from February 2 to 4, 1994, to review the circumstances associated with the misadministration,
the licensee's Quality Management program, and the licensee's immediate corrective actions. In addition, on February
25, 1994, NRC employed a medical consultant to provide an assessment of the potential clinical effects of this misadministration
and the events that led to it.

The inspection report, medical consultant's assessment, and enforcement actions for the misadministration are
being completed.

in these submissions when seeking license termination under restricted conditions, and (2) applicants for new licenses
describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination, facilitate
decommissioning, and minimize generation of radioactive waste. Those licensees proposing license termination
under restricted conditions must submit a plan for establishing and supporting a Site Specific Advisory Board, and
develop operating procedures for the Board. All records generated or reviewed by the SSAB become a part of the license
docket. The rulemaking would ensure that decommissioning will be carried out without undue impact on public and occupational
health and safety and the environment and would enhance the existing regulatory framework by providing a clear and
consistent regulatory basis for determining the extent to which lands and structures must be remediated before a
site can be decommissioned. The additional recordkeeping requirements would document the role of public participation
in the licensing process and that sites have been decommissioned in accordance with the regulations.

<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Company (Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station); Issuance of Director's Decision Under
10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that the Director, Office of Enforcement, has issued a decision concerning the Petition filed
by Mr. Thomas J. Saporito, Jr., (Petitioner) on February 1, 1994. The Petition requested that the NRC: (1) Institute
a show cause proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 to modify, suspend or revoke the Licensee's operating licenses for
Palo Verde Generating Station (Palo Verde); (2) initiate `'appropriate actions'' to cause the Licensee to recognize
the Buckeye, Arizona Regional Office of the National Whistleblower Center, as an agency to which Licensee employees
may raise safety concerns about operations a Palo Verde without fear of retaliation by the Licensee; (3) initiate
``appropriate actions'' to cause the Licensee to encourage employees at Palo Verde to contact the Buckeye, Arizona
Regional Office of the National Whistleblower Center, to identify safety concerns about operations at the facility
as part of its procedural requirements to ensure a working environment which is free of hostility and promotes the
raising of safety concerns by employees without fear of retaliation; and (4) initiate ``appropriate actions'' to
cause the Licensee to encourage employees at Palo Verde to contact the NRC to identify safety concerns about operations
at the facility as part of its procedural requirements to ensure a working environment which is free of hostility and
promotes the raising of safety concerns by employees without fear of retaliation.

On May 18, 1994, Petitioner supplemented his Petition by requesting that the NRC require Licensee contractors: (1)
To provide information regarding filing complaints with the Department of Labor (DOL) to their employees ``as part
of their normal employment package'', and (2) to properly post the NRC Form 3 in and around the contractor's place of
business and site business trailers and offices.

After due consideration of Petitioner's assertions, the Licensee's response, and Petitioner's supplemental information,
the Director, Office of Enforcement, has denied the Petition. The reasons for the denial are explained in the ``Director's

<DOCTITLE>Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2); Exemption</DOCTITLE>


I


The Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BG&E/licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DRP-53
and DRP-69, which authorizes operation of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2 (the facilities).
The licenses provide, among other things, that the facilities are subject to all the rules, regulations, and orders
of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter the effect.
The facilities are pressurized water reactors located at the licensee's site in Calvert County, Maryland.


II


The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in
nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), in part, states that ``the licensee shall
establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective
to provide high assurance that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense
and security and do not constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.''
The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that, ``the
licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' The Code of Federal Regulations
at 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also requires that, ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals
who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' It further states that individuals not employed by
the licensee (e.g., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided that the individual,
``receives a picture badge upon entrance into a protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected
area * * *.''
The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access system which would eliminate the need to issue
and retrieve picture badges at the entrance/exit location to the protected area and would allow all individuals,
including contractors, to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the Calvert Cliffs site.
By letter dated March 23, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5).
Specifically, the requested exemption would allow contractors who have unescorted access to retain possession
of their picture badges instead of returning them as they exit the protected area.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may upon application of any interested person or
upon its own initiative, grant such exemption in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger
life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. The Code of Federal Regulations
at 10 CFR 73.55 allows the Commission to authorize a licensee to provide alternative measures for protection against
radiological sabotage provided the licensee demonstrates that the alternative measures have the same ``high assurance''
objective, that the proposed measures meet the general performance requirements of the regulation, and that the
overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological sabotage equivalent to that which
would be provided by the regulation.

Currently, unescorted access into the protected area for both employee and contractor personnel into the Calvert
Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, is controlled through the use of picture badges. Positive identification
of personnel which are authorized and request access into the protected area is established by security personnel
making a visual comparison of the individual requesting access and that individual's picture badge. In accordance
with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractor personnel are not allowed to take their picture badges offsite. In addition,
in accordance with the plant's physical security plan, the licensee's employees are also not allowed to take their
picture badges offsite.

The proposed system will require that all individuals with authorized unescorted access have the physical characteristics
of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their picture badge number in a computerized access control system.
Therefore, all authorized individuals must not only have their picture badge to gain access to the protected area,
but must also have their hand geometry confirmed. All individuals, including contractors, who have authorized unescorted
access into the protected area will be allowed to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the
Calvert Cliffs site.

All other access processes, including search function capability and access revocation, will remain the same. A
security officer responsible for access control will continue to be positioned within a bullet-resistant structure.
It should also be noted that the proposed system is only for individuals with authorized unescorted access and will
not be used for those individuals requiring escorts.

Sandia National Laboratories conducted testing which demonstrated that the hand geometry equipment possesses
strong performance characteristics. Details of the testing performed are in the Sandia report, ``A Performance
Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices,'' SAND91-0276 UC-906 Unlimited Release, June 1991.
Based on the Sandia report and the licensee's experience using the current photo picture identification system,
the false acceptance rate for the proposed hand geometry system would be at least equivalent to that of the current
system. To assure that the proposed system will continue to meet the general performance requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5),
the licensee will implement a process for testing the system The site security plans will also be revised to allow implementation
of the hand geometry system and to allow employees and contractors with unescorted access to keep their picture badges
in their possession when leaving the Calvert Cliffs site.



IV



For the foregoing reasons, the NRC staff has determined that the proposed alternative measures for protection against
radiological sabotage meet the same high assurance objective and the general performance requirements of 10 CFR
73.55. In addition, the staff has determined that the overall level of the proposed system's performance will provide
protection against radiological sabotage equivalent to that which is provided by the current system in accordance
with 10 CFR 73.55.

Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, this exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants the following exemption:




The requirement of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) that individuals who have been granted unescorted access and are not employed
by the licensee are to return their picture badges upon exit from the protected area is no longer necessary. Thus, these
individuals may keep their picture badges in their possession upon leaving the Calvert Cliffs site.




Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 38214).

This Exemption is effective upon issuance.




Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 29th day of July.

<DOCTITLE>Wisconsin Electric Power Company; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-24 and DPR-27, issued to Wisconsin Electric Power Company (the licensee), for operation
of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant (PBNP), Units 1 and 2, located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin.

The proposed amendments would modify Point Beach Nuclear Plant Technical Specifications (TS) 15.3.4, ``Steam and
Power Conversion System,'' and 15.3.7, ``Auxiliary Electrical Systems,'' to increase the allowed outage times
for one motor driven auxiliary feedwater pump and for the standby emergency power for the Unit 1 Train B 4160 Volt safeguards
bus (A06) from 7 to 12 days. The proposed amendments would also modify TS 15.3.3, ``Emergency Core Cooling System,
Auxiliary Cooling Systems, Air Recirculation Fan Coolers, and Containment Spray,'' to provide the clarification
that the service water pump (P-32E) operating with power supplied by the Alternative Shutdown System is operable
from offsite power. The changes are one-time extensions of specific allowed outage times.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not; (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the license
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's
analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's review is presented below:

Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The probability of an accident previously evaluated
will not be significantly increased because no changes are being made to the facility or to its operation which can
significantly affect the potential for an accident. The only change is an extension of an already acceptable allowed
outage time. The consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not be significantly increased because the
licensee is taking compensatory measures to offset the increased outage time. These measures include verified operability
of the gas turbine generator, cessation of maintenance and test activities that could cause loss of required equipment,
assurance of at least three offsite power sources, and on-call status of a senior reactor operator with detailed knowledge
of the planned evolutions.

Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The amendment only extends the allowed outage time. The
changes do not affect the manner in which equipment can fail such that a new or different kind of accident can occur.

Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a
margin of safety because compensatory measures are being taken (discussed above) to compensate for the increase
in the allowed outage time.

Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By September 19, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Joseph P. Mann Library, 1516 Sixteenth Street,
Two Rivers, Wisconsin 54241. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John Hannon, Director, Project Directorate III-3: petitioner's name
and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts, and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20037, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated August 9, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,

<DOCTITLE>Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 1); Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I



On June 4, 1985, the Commission issued Facility Operating License No. NPF-42 to Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating
Corporation (the licensee) for Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 1. The license provides, among other things,
that it is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now
and hereafter in effect.



II



Section III.D.1(a) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires, ``* * * a set of three Type A tests
[Overall Integrated Containment Leakage Rate Tests, or ILRTs] shall be performed, at approximately equal intervals
during each 10-year service period. The third test of each set shall be conducted when the plant is shutdown for the
10-year plant inservice inspections.'' By letter dated October 27, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from
this requirement of the Commission's regulations.

The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, that (1) Are authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) present special circumstances. Section 50.12(a)(2) of 10 CFR Part 50 describes special circumstances
as including cases that would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or are not necessary to achieve the underlying
purpose of the rule.

In a letter also dated October 27, 1993, the licensee applied for an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF-42
to change related provisions of the Wolf Creek Generating Station Technical Specifications.



III



The Type A test is defined in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section II.F, as a ``test intended to measure the primary reactor
containment overall integrated leakage rate (1) After the containment has been completed and is ready for operation,
and (2) at periodic intervals thereafter.'' The licensee conducted ILRTs during October 1988 and September 1991
that satisfied the requirements of Appendix J and related technical specifications. The measured leakage rates
during these tests were well below the acceptance criteria with the majority of leakage being from containment penetrations
and not the containment barrier itself. The requested exemption does not affect the performance of local leakage
rate testing which would be expected to detect the most probable sources of containment leakage.

In order to schedule the next ILRT such that it coincides with the 10-year inservice inspections, as required by Appendix
J, the licensee has requested a one-time exemption and related technical specification changes to perform the test
during the eighth refueling outage. The eighth refueling outage is currently scheduled for Spring 1996 and would
result in a test interval of approximately 54 months with the test being performed approximately six months after
the end of the first 10-year service period. In the absence of the exemption and related technical specification changes,
the licensee would be required to perform an ILRT during both the seventh and eighth refueling outages. This discrepancy
results from the circumstances related to the operating cycle schedules and their correlation with the end of the
10-year service period. Performance of a fourth ILRT coincident with the 10-year inservice inspections is clearly
beyond the intent of the regulations or technical specifications which specifically require three tests during
10-year service intervals.

For the reasons set forth above, the NRC staff concludes that this one-time relief from the requirement to perform
the third ILRT within a 10-year service is not significant in terms of complying with the intent of Appendix J, Section
III.D.1(a). Accordingly, the staff finds that the performance of ILRTs during both the seventh and eighth refueling
outages would not result in a commensurate increase in the confidence of containment integrity. Therefore, the subject
exemption request meets the special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12, in that the fourth test is not necessary to achieve
the underlying purpose of the rule.

On this basis, the NRC staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that special circumstances are present as required
by 10 CFR 50.12. Further the staff also finds that extending the schedule for the third ILRT to beyond the 10-year service
period will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety.



IV



Accordingly, the Commission has determined pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption is authorized by law and will
not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR
part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1(a).

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 27076).

Publication of Guidance on Certification of Metropolitan Planning Processes; Notification of FY 94 Reviews 



AGENCIES: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), DOT.




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 28, 1994, the FHWA and the FTA Administrators jointly issued guidance to their respective regional administrators
on the implementation of the Federal certification of the metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) (transportation
management area (TMA)) planning process. This guidance outlines the principles and interim procedures that will
be utilized in implementing the certification process required under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act (ISTEA) and as further articulated in the US DOT regulations. 



This notice also announces the schedule of FY 1994 reviews as known at this time. As indicated in the attached certification
guidance, the FHWA and FTA are planning approximately twenty reviews for FY 1994, approximately half of which will
be pilots for the purpose of testing and refining the review process. Interested parties are invited to submit comments
on the individual planning processes to be reviewed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Sections 1024, 1025, and 3012 of the ISTEA, Pub. L. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914, 1955, 1962, and 2098, amended title
23, U.S.C., and the Federal Transit Act by revising sections 134 and 135 of title 23 and section 8 of the Federal Transit
Act (49 U.S.C. app. 1607) which require a continuing, comprehensive, and coordinated transportation planning process
in metropolitan areas and States. The FHWA and the FTA revised their previous metropolitan planning regulations
to implement these changes and published the final regulations on October 28, 1993 (58 FR 58040). 



As part of an ongoing commitment to public involvement in the planning process, the FHWA and FTA are soliciting comments
on this guidance. As the agencies conduct certification reviews in FY 1994 we will be looking at possible modifications
based both on the experience of having conducted the reviews and on the comments received on the guidance and during
the reviews. Specifically, the FHWA and FTA are interested in comments regarding the process of review, appropriate
sources of information to be considered during the review, and the role of key government officials and the public
in providing input to the review. 



General



Additional Public Involvement in Certification Process 



The FHWA and FTA are soliciting public comment on the planning processes of the FY 1994 certification review sites
identified below. The agencies are particularly interested in input regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the
planning process in light of the requirements identified in 23 CFR 450 Subpart C. Additionally, the views of local
officials and the public are welcomed regarding the use of the planning process in transportation investment decisions.

Schedule of FY 1994 Certification Reviews 



The following schedule is subject to revision. Changes will be announced in the 

Federal Register

. Parties interested in providing comments on the metropolitan transportation planning processes in the identified
areas should submit them directly to the Docket 94-19 identified above, clearly identifying the metropolitan
area that the comments address. Except where the certification review was completed prior to this 

Federal Register

 Notice, comments on metropolitan planning processes under review must be received within 30 days of the scheduled
review in order to be considered during the certification review process. Where the review was completed prior to
publication of this notice, interested parties wishing to make comments on a particular certification, must contact
Sheldon Edner within two weeks of the date of this notice to assure that their comments will be considered. Where dates
for a planned certification review have not been established, please contact Sheldon Edner for the dates. 

The site visits are intended to provide an opportunity for the FHWA and FTA review team to solicit information from
the MPO, State DOT and transit agency regarding the implementation of the planning process. In addition, the team
will be experimenting with alternative mechanisms for soliciting public and local official input. The relevant
MPO is being asked to provide public notice, through its regular public notice processes, of the review and the opportunity
to provide public input to the review team. Public officials should contact the MPO to identify processes set up to
solicit local government input. 

The results of the certification reviews will be made public through the regular MPO public information process at
a time to be set by the MPO policy board.

ACTION:

 Federal Certification of the MPO (TMA) Planning Process 


To: FTA Regional Administrators; FHWA Regional Administrators 
From: Federal Transit Administrator; Federal Highway Administrator



The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) has significantly enhanced the stewardship
role of the FTA and FHWA in the implementation of the changes it mandates in the transportation planning process. Inherent
within the approval of Statewide Transportation Improvement Programs (STIP), planning findings, conformity determinations
and certification of the transportation planning process in Transportation Management Areas (TMA) is the fundamental
leadership responsibility of FTA and FHWA in ensuring that the transportation planning process addresses the policy
goals of the ISTEA. This memorandum articulates our general agency expectations with regard to this planning stewardship
and the specific function that certification plays within this broader framework. While certification of the Metropolitan
Planning Organization (MPO) TMA planning processes falls within the purview of the metropolitan planning regulations,
the basic principles apply to both the statewide and metropolitan planning requirements. 
We view certification of the planning process within TMAs as one of a number of the critical mechanisms for ensuring
the satisfactory implementation of the planning requirements identified in 23 U.S.C. l34 and 49 U.S.C. 1602. It is
perhaps most critical in the sense that it will be a very visible action and formal indication that we have exercised
our legal responsibility in meeting this stewardship function. However, the individual planning findings, necessary
conformity determinations and STIP approvals provide critical input to this triennial action. We expect our regions
to establish procedures for implementing this joint responsibility. While the substance of these decisions must
remain consistent across regions, the variation in workload posed by the distribution of TMAs will dictate procedural
accommodations by region. 
The attached statement of principles and guidance provides a framework for addressing the implementation of the
certification requirement. We expect the responsibility for issuing certification determinations to rest jointly
with our field offices, working in partnership with Headquarters. The effective implementation of the certification
process will require a significant allocation of resources which you should address in the development of regional
staffing and travel budgets. 
Especially in this initial effort and in recognition of the phase-in provisions of the metropolitan planning regulations
(Section 45.336), we expect the emphasis to rest on ensuring a good faith effort to implement plan updates and the priorities
indicated in the attachment. We also expect that the message conveyed to MPOs, state DOTs and transit operators collectively
will be that they are mutually responsible for the continuing enhancement and improvement of the planning process
to meet the objectives of the ISTEA planning requirements. 
We expect the primary responsibility for implementing our stewardship role to rest with FTA and FHWA field staff.
However, this is manifested not only in the certification process, but also in STIP approvals, Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP) and STIP planning findings, conformity findings, and unified planning work program approvals. In
recognition of our national stewardship role and mandate from the ISTEA, we plan to conduct Enhanced Planning Reviews
(EPR) in selected metropolitan areas which will be integrated with the certification processes for the respective
metropolitan areas. These EPRs will be done at the request of states, MPOs, transit operators or FTA/FHWA field or
Headquarters offices to pursue more complex planning process questions and to assist MPOs in improving their procedures.
As a supplement to these EPRs, we plan to develop and implement an overall assessment of the planning process and its
implementation under the ISTEA requirements over the next three fiscal years. The results of the planning reviews
will provide input to this analysis. The challenge and the expectations are such that we believe that a very visible
and substantial assessment is necessary to demonstrate our joint commitment and success in providing the leadership
expected of both agencies. You will be hearing more about this initiative as it is developed.

We will be discussing the attached certification procedures and guidance with your offices at opportunities over
the next several weeks. In conjunction with FHWA's Advance Planning Seminar which is scheduled for the week of April
10, we expect to have FHWA and FTA field staff participating in this seminar assist us in refining the attached certification
procedures and guidance. Additionally, we will meet with field staff during May to discuss the certification process
in more detail after additional guidance has been developed. As indicated in the attached paper, once this meeting
has been held and the guidance refined, Headquarters staff will participate with field staff in conducting a pilot
certification review in each region. Certification reviews should not be initiated by field staff pending the issuance
of the additional guidance and/or completion of the pilot certification reviews. If you have questions on certification,
please contact Deborah Burns, Office of Planning, TGM-21, at (202) 366-1637 or Sheldon Edner, Office
of Environment and Planning, HEP-21, at (202) 366-4066.

Guidance Certification of the Metropolitan Planning Process in TMAs 


Principles/Process 


 Must be a joint action by FHWA and FTA.
 Must be based on a serious examination of the planning process that documents the adequacy of the planning process.
However, the workload involved in reviewing the planning process for approximately 135 MPOs once every 3 years combined
with other oversight and administrative responsibilities demands a process that utilizes and builds on the other
oversight functions including TIP findings, Unified Planning Work Program approvals and conformity findings.

 The certification process must recognize the differences among areas and not expect each area to respond to
the requirements to some predefined minimum level/standard. The goal should be to encourage an improved planning
process in each area rather than a process that only minimally meets the requirements. 
 Process must recognize that certification is likely to involve negotiated improvements and schedules rather
than pass or fail ratings. In this vein, the ISTEA sanction provisions are viewed as a ``last resort'' action to be used
in situations where the parties involved are unresponsive to needed corrections or there are very serious inadequacies
in the planning process. In almost all cases, it is likely that the ``planning finding'' process discussed below would
probably have identified deficiencies and may have already affected the advancement of projects. 
 While certification is the formal mechanism provided by ISTEA for determining the adequacy of the planning
process in TMAs, a ``once-every-three-years-look'' at the planning process is not sufficient to ensure that the
planning process, its products, and our actions related to the planning process meet the requirements. Fortunately,
the regulations provide additional mechanisms for assuring the adequacy of the planning process, i.e., the planning
finding that must be made on each TIP/TIP amendment in all metropolitan planning areas prior to its inclusion in an
approved STIP, the air quality conformity determination process in nonattainment and maintenance areas, and the
review and approval of the planning work programs for all metropolitan areas. 
The planning finding provides a mechanism for identifying problems and requiring immediate corrective action without
going through the more formal certification process. In addition, the planning finding process can provide an early
warning mechanism for initiating a certification review prior to end of the normal 3 year certification period as
well as in highlighting parts of the planning process that need to be examined in more depth as part of regularly scheduled
certification reviews (and conversely identifying those
