Procedures for Importing Animals Through the Harry S. Truman Animal Import Center 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are giving notice of the date and location of the lottery for authorization of the use of the Harry S Truman Animal
Import Center (HSTAIC) in calendar year 1995. We are also giving notice of the period during which applications must
reach the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in order to be included in the lottery.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 9 CFR part 92,   92.430, 92.431, 92.522, and 92.523 (referred to below as the regulations),
set forth the conditions under which importers may qualify animals to enter the United States through the Harry S Truman
Animal Import Center (HSTAIC) in Fleming Key, FL. 



Because the demand for quarantine space at HSTAIC has traditionally exceeded the space available, the regulations
provide that a lottery will be held each year during the first 7 days of December, to determine the priority of applications
for the following calendar year. To be included in the December lottery, applications must reach the Import-Export
Animals Staff of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) no earlier than October 1, and no later than
October 15 of the year of the lottery. Additionally, applicants must send a deposit in the form of a certified check
or money order in the amount of $32,000, payable to the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, for each application. APHIS will not consider an application unless we receive this deposit
from the applicant on or before November 29, 1994. In the event that the Import-Export Animals Staff receives no more
than one application between October 1, 1994, and October 15, 1994, the lottery will not be held, and APHIS will grant
exclusive right to use HSTAIC during calendar year 1995 in the order applications are received. 

Applicants should be aware that certain improvements are being made to the HSTAIC facility in order to meet standards
set by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The availability of HSTAIC for use for 1995 lottery applicants
will be dependent upon satisfactory completion of these projects.






Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 1622; 19 U.S.C. 1306; 21 U.S.C. 102-105, 111, 114a, 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134f, 135, 136, and 136a;

5. Revise the ``Export Trade Activities and Methods of Operation'' in NFE's Export Trade Certificate of Review. The

a. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members advise and cooperate with the United States Government in (i)
establishing procedures regulating the export of the Products, and (ii) fulfilling the phytosanitary and/or funding
requirements imposed by foreign governments for export of the Products. 
b. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members participate in negotiations and enter into agreements with foreign
buyers (including governments and private persons) regarding: 
(i) fumigating, packing and other quality control and/or phytosanitary procedures to be followed in the export of
the Products. Such procedures may include activities related to insect and disease detection, certification, inspection,
storage and treatment protocols required to qualify goods for export shipment and to meet the import requirements
of the foreign government; 
(ii) the quantities, time periods, prices and terms and conditions, in connection with actual or potential bona fide
export opportunities, upon which NFE's Members will export the Products. 
c. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members establish and operate fumigation facilities for use in the export
of the Products. 
d. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members establish and administer phytosanitary protocols for the purpose
of qualifying the Products for Export Markets. 
e. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members provide market entry and development assistance, including
related administrative and promotional services, to its Members. 
f. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members negotiate and enter into agreements with providers of transportation
services for export of the Products. 
g. NFE may recover administrative expenses and costs related to qualifying and preparing Members' Products for export
through fees and assessments allocated to each Member on a pro-rata share basis or any other non discriminatory method.
If a Member objects to the method of allocating expenses and costs, the Member shall be entitled to be charged on the
basis of actual expenses incurred. 
h. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members develop internal operational procedures and disseminate information
to Members to assist the membership in meeting the criteria established by foreign governments for exportation of
the Products. 
i. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members engage in such activities as are necessary to ensure that the activities
of growers and packers during the various stages of growing, harvesting, grading, packing, packaging, labeling,
storage, and treatment meet the requirements established by a relevant foreign government so that the Members' goods
will qualify for importation into the country subject to such requirements. 
j. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members allocate the capacity of facilities, time of domestic and foreign
inspection personnel, and other resources of NFE amongst the Members engaged in the shipment of Products for export,
provided that such allocations are based on shipment quantities or other non-discriminatory criteria.

k. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members conduct quality control studies and inspections of goods for
export at point of shipment, point of arrival, and through the retail level. 
2. With respect to fresh sweet cherries only, NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members establish export prices
and quotas and allocate export quotas among growing regions and its Members. In allocating export quotas among growing
regions and its Members, NFE, through employees or agents of NFE who are not also employees of a Member, may receive,
and each Member may supply to such employees or agents of NFE, information as to such Member's actual total export shipments
of fresh sweet cherries in any previous growing season or seasons, provided that such information is not disclosed
by NFE to any other Member. 
3. With respect to fresh apples only: 
a. NFE may on behalf and with the advice of its Members establish export prices and quotas and allocate export quotas
among growing regions and its Members, in connection with actual or potential bona fide export opportunities, provided
that each Member shall remain free to deviate from established prices by whatever amount it sees fit. 
b. In allocating export quotas among growing regions and its Members, NFE, through employees or agents of NFE who are
not also employees of a Member, may receive, and each Member may supply, information as to such Member's actual total
export shipments of fresh apples in any previous growing season or seasons, provided that such information is not
disclosed by NFE to any other Member, except in a coded form to members of the Board of Directors for use only at meetings
and in connection with other official activities of the Board. 
c. NFE, through employees or agents of NFE who are not also employees of a Member, may receive, and each Member shall
supply, the quantity it will offer for export, without the Member or NFE intentionally disclosing, directly or indirectly,
the quantity to any other Member, except in a coded form to members of the Board of Directors for use only at meetings
and in connection with other official activities of the Board. 
6. Revise ``Terms and Conditions of Certificate'' to read as follows: 
(a) Except as provided in the second sentence of paragraph 2 and in paragraphs 3(b) and 3(c) of the Export Trade Activities
and Methods of Operation, a Member of NFE shall not intentionally disclose, directly or indirectly, to NFE or to any
other Member any information about its own costs, output, capacity, inventories, domestic prices, domestic sales,
domestic orders, terms of domestic marketing or sale, or U.S. business plans, strategies or methods that is not already
generally available to the trade or public. 
(b) Export prices for the Products established by NFE shall not be expressed by NFE to individual Members in a form that
sets out separately the values of components of such prices, except that export-specific components of export prices
such as fees, commissions and charges payable to NFE, foreign sales agents, and transportation companies may be set
out separately. 
(c) Meetings at which the Board of Directors of NFE establishes quotas, the allocation of quotas among Members, and
export prices shall not be open to the public or to Members of NFE not represented on the Board of Directors. 
(d) NFE and its Members will comply with requests made by the Secretary of Commerce on behalf of the Secretary or the
Attorney General for information or documents relevant to conduct under the Certificate. The Secretary of Commerce
will request such information or documents when either the Attorney General or the Secretary of Commerce believes
that the information or documents are required to determine that the Export Trade, Export Trade Activities, or Methods
of Operation of a person protected by this Certificate of Review continue to comply with the standards of section 303(a)
of the Act. 
(e) Participation by a Member in any Export Trade Activity or Method of Operation under the Certificate shall be entirely
voluntary as to that Member, subject to the honoring of all phytosanitary and/or funding requirements by foreign
governments for specific export transactions. A member may withdraw from coverage under the Certificate at any time
by giving written notice to NFE. NFE will give notice of any such withdrawal by a Member to the Secretary of Commerce
and the Attorney General in the next annual report by NFE. 
(f) With respect to fresh apples only: 
a. Each Member shall determine independently of other Members the quantity of fresh apples it will offer to export
or sell through NFE; 
b. NFE may not solicit from any Member specific quantities for export or require any Member to export any minimum quantity
of fresh apples. 
7. Revise ``Definitions'' to read as follows: 
``Member'' within the meaning of  325.2(

l

) of the Regulations means the member companies of NFE set out in Attachment A and incorporated by reference. 
``Coded form'' means a form that does not disclose the identity of a Member.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>

 Notice of availability of guidelines and request for comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy is publishing and requests comments on its draft guidelines for its Mentor-Protege Pilot
Initiative. The Mentor-Protege Pilot Initiative is designed to encourage Department of Energy management and operating
contractors to assist energy related small disadvantaged and women-owned businesses in enhancing their business
and technical capabilities to ensure full participation in the mission of the Department.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Purpose and Program Overview


The Department Energy Mentor-Protege Pilot Initiative is designed to encourage Department of Energy management
and operating contractors to assist energy related small disadvantaged businesses in enhancing their business
and technical capabilities to ensure full participation in the mission of the Department. The use of this integrated
working arrangement between companies will promote economic and technological growth, foster the establishment
of long term business relationships and increase the number of small disadvantaged businesses that receive Department
of Energy, other Federal and commercial contracts.


B. General Policy


(a) Department of Energy management and operating contractors who are approved as mentor firms may enter into agreements
with eligible small disadvantaged businesses as protege firms to provide appropriate developmental assistance
to enhance the business and technical capabilities of small disadvantaged businesses to perform as contractors,
subcontractors and suppliers.
(b) The mentor-protege initiatives described in these regulations constitutes a pilot program that will have a duration
of two years with a one year option commencing from the date of the published final rule. During this period, management
and operating contractors, which have received approval by the Department of Energy to participate in the program
may enter into agreements with protege firms.


C. Incentives for Mentor Participation


(a) Active participation in the Department of Energy Mentor Protege Initiative may be a source selection factor in
the awarding of Department of Energy contracts.
(b) The award fee evaluation plans contained in all Department of Energy Performance-Based Management contracts
may include a factor for evaluation of a contractor's performance associated with Mentor-Protege initiative participation.
(c) Mentor firms shall receive credit toward Department of Energy subcontracting goals contained in their subcontracting
plan.


D. Mentor Firms


Department of Energy mentor candidates must be:
(1) Management and operating contractors (M&Os) of Department of Energy facilities.


E. Protege Firms


Department of Energy Protege candidates must be:
(1) A small disadvantaged or women-owned small business concern as defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation;
(2) Certified as small in the Standard Industrial Classification code for the services or supplies to be provided
by the protege to the mentor;
(3) Eligible for receipt of government contracts, and;
(4) In operation and actively engaged in an energy related, technical or construction business field for two years
prior to applying for participation in the Mentor-Protege Initiative.


F. Selection of Protege Firms


(a) Protege selection will be implemented through a tier development plan as provided in subsection (b) below. This
tier development plan is intended as a guide from which an ``individualized'' plan can be developed for each protege.
The tier development structure recognizes the protege firms current business capacity and sets the parameters of
assistance for monitoring purposes.
(b) Mentor firms are encouraged to select proteges from each of the following areas:
(1) Small disadvantaged businesses that presently have contracts or subcontracts with the Department;
(2) Small disadvantaged businesses that are presently 8(a) or 8(a) graduates under the Small Business Administration
Program that have been actively engaged in business for at least five years; and
(3) Emerging small disadvantaged business firms that possess energy related or technical capability and have been
actively engaged in business for at least two years.
(c) Once a protege firm has been selected for participation in the program, a Mentor-Protege Plan signed by the respective
firms should be submitted to the Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization for approval. At the minimum,
the Plan should contain a description of the developmental assistance that is mutually agreed upon and in the best
developmental interest of the protege firm. Such assistance may not include payment of any monies.

<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Mentor-Protege Plan shall also include information on the mentor's ability to provide developmental assistance,
schedule for providing such assistance, and criteria for evaluating the protege's developmental success. The Plan
shall include termination provisions complying with Notice and due process rights of both parties and a statement
agreeing to submit periodic report reviews and cooperate in any studies or surveys as may be required by the Department
in order to determine the extent of compliance with the terms of the agreement. 



G. Measurement of Program Success 



The overall success of the pilot program will be measured by the extent to which it results in: 

(a) An increase in the protege firm's technical and business capability, industrial competitiveness, client base
expansion and improved financial stability. 

(b) An increase in the number of value of contracts, subcontracts and suppliers by small disadvantaged business protege
firms in industry categories where small disadvantaged businesses have not traditionally participated within
the mentor firm's activity. 

(c) The overall enhancement and development of protege firms as a competitive contractor, subcontractor, or supplier
to the Department of Energy, other Federal agencies or commercial markets. 

(d) Proteges after successfully completing one year under the Mentor-Protege Initiative program may seek multiple
mentors provided conflict of interest provisions would not prevent such an arrangement and the approval of the Office
of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization is received. 



H. Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization



(a) All information submitted shall be reviewed and approved by the Department of Energy's Office of Small and Disadvantaged
Business Utilization. The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization will provide a copy of the submitted
information to the cognizant Department of Energy program manager and contracting officer for a parallel review
and concurrence. 

(b) Upon agreement approval, the mentor may implement the developmental assistance under the program. 



I. Internal Controls by the Department 



(a) The Department of Energy's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization will manage the program and
establish internal controls to achieve the stated program objectives. Controls will include: 

(1) Reviewing and evaluating mentor-protege applications for realism, validity and accuracy of provided information;
and 

(2) Reviewing semi-annual progress reports submitted by mentors and proteges on protege development to measure
protege progress against the master plan contained in the approved agreement. 

(3) Assurance from the mentor and protege firms that they will submit periodic reports and cooperate in any studies
or surveys as may be required by the Department in order to determine the extent of compliance with the terms of their
agreement. 

(b) Failure of the mentor to meet the terms of the Mentor-Protege Plan may have an adverse affect on future award fee
evaluation plans. 

(c) Failure of the protege to meet the terms of the Mentor-Protege Plan may result in exclusion from future participation
in the Mentor-Protege Program. 



J. Program Review 



At the conclusion of each year in the Mentor-Protege Initiative the mentor prime contractor and protege will formally
brief the Department of Energy Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, the head of the contracting
activity, and the contracting officer during a formal program review regarding program accomplishments as it pertains
to the approved agreement. The Briefing may be held at either the Department of Energy Headquarters or the Mentor or
Protege's site.

CIPCO will provide electric energy to the steel mill. However, to deliver the electric energy to the steel mill, utilization
of Iowa-Illinois' transmission facilities and the construction of new transmission facilities by CIPCO will be
required. The Facilities Schedules provide for the utilization, construction and modification of these facilities.

CIPCO plans to serve IPSCO's steel mill through two transmission sources utilizing Iowa-Illinois' transmission
facilities. One source will require CIPCO to convert an existing 69 kV line between Iowa-Illinois' Substation 56
and CIPCO's Fair Station to 161 kV, disconnect the line at Fair Station and connect it to the IPSCO Substation. The other
source will require CIPCO to construct a new 345 kV transmission line extending from the new Walcott Substation and
terminating at the IPSCO Substation adjacent to the steel mill. Under Facilities Schedule No. 3, CIPCO's new line
will interconnect at the Walcott Substation with Iowa-Illinois's 345 kV transmission line which extends from Hills
Substation to Substation 56. CIPCO will own Walcott Substation and Iowa-Illinois will operate and maintain the substation
at CIPCO's expense.

The portion of the transmission service which uses the interconnection at Substation 56 will be provided pursuant
to the Agreement for Interconnection of Transmission Facilities dated March 4, 1963 entered into by Iowa-Illinois,
Iowa Electric Light and Power Company (predecessor in interest to IES Utilities Inc.) and Eastern Iowa Light and Power
Cooperative (predecessor in interest to CIPCO). The remaining transmission service will be provided as required
by Facilities Schedule No. 3.

Under Facilities Schedule No. 4, Iowa-Illinois will supply all energy required at CIPCO's Blue Grass REC Substation
to the Point of Connection between CIPCO and Iowa-Illinois. CIPCO will deliver an equivalent amount of energy including
losses on a scheduled basis to Iowa-Illinois at the Point of Connection.

The Facilities Schedules provide that they will be effective upon their acceptance for filing by the Commission.
Iowa-Illinois requests the Commission to accept the Facilities Schedules for filing by November 30, 1994.

Copies of the filing were served upon the Illinois Commerce Commission, the Iowa Utilities Board and CIPCO.

284.3(c) of the Commission's Regulations. Texas Gas states that Farmland has recently indicated a need for greater
flexibility in the services that can be provided at this delivery point on Texas Gas's system. In particular, Farmland
would like to be able to receive at the Wintershall_Farmland Meter gas transported not only pursuant to Section 311,
but also pursuant to Texas Gas's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP88-686-000. By this filing,
Texas Gas is requesting authorization to change the status of this delivery point in order to be able to transport and
deliver gas on a jurisdictional basis. 
Texas Gas states that the quantity of gas to be delivered through this meter will vary; however, the design capacity
of the Wintershall_Farmland Meter is approximately 78,200 Mcf per day under normal operating conditions.

Texas Gas states that this proposal will have no impact on its peak day and annual deliveries as the addition of this
point as a jurisdictional delivery station will not increase or decrease Texas Gas's main line capacity.

Take notice that on August 8, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002,
filed in Docket No. CP94-706-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon certain facilities
in Louisiana and Oklahoma under NGT's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-384-000, 

et al

., pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission

NGT proposes to abandon in place: 1) Line 632 having 30,071 feet of 2 to 6-inch pipe located in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma;
2) Line 632-12 having 4,421 feet of 2-inch pipe located in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma; and 3) a segment of Line
634 having 18,648 feet of 2 to 6-inch pipe located in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma. All lines are operated at low pressure
to provide service to rural domestic customers of ARKLA, a division of NorAm Energy Corporation (formerly Arkansas
Louisiana Gas Company) and ARKLA's Ada Townborder Station No. 2. NGT says that these lines are old, deteriorated,
and are no longer necessary for the delivery of gas to ARKLA. NGT proposes to transfer, by sale, minor segments of these

<DOCTITLE>Black Marlin Pipeline Co.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


August 16, 1994.




Take notice that on August 12, 1994, Black Marlin Pipeline Company (Black Marlin) tendered for filing to become part
of Black Marlin's FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, proposed to be effective
September 1, 1994:






First Revised Sheet No. 314





Black Marlin states that in conjunction with its implementation of Order 636 and in compliance with the Commission's
order dated October 14, 1993, in Docket No. RS92-56-002, Black Marlin filed its form of Electronic Bulletin
Board Subscriber Agreement (Subscriber Agreement) to become part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No.
1. Paragraph 3 of the Subscriber Agreement provides that EBB Customers will reimburse Black Marlin $135.61 plus applicable
taxes for licensing charges Black Marlin incurs to provide service. The licensing fees incurred by Black Marlin for
new customers have risen to $157.42 plus applicable taxes and will continue to change periodically.

Black Marlin states that it is filing herein to remove the fixed dollar amount from the form of Subscriber Agreement
in its tariff. Black Marlin states that it will continue to charge new EBB Customers only the actual charges incurred
by Black Marlin on their behalf, with no administrative or handling fees or other forms of consideration. The change
proposed herein will eliminate the need for a tariff filing each time the licensing fees are changed.

Black Marlin requests that the Commission grant any and all waivers of its rules, regulations, and orders as may be
necessary, specifically (but not limited to) Section 154.22 of the Commission's Regulations, so as to permit the
tariff sheets submitted herewith to become effective September f1, 1994.


Black Marlin further states that copies of the filing have been mailed to each of its customers affected by this filing
and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
August 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken,
but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public
reference room.

<DOCTITLE>Black Marlin Pipeline Co.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff </DOCTITLE>



August 16, 1994. 



Take notice that on August 12, 1994, Black Marlin Pipeline Company (Black Marlin) tendered for filing to become part
of Black Marlin's FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, proposed to be effective
September 1, 1994: 


 


Second Revised Sheet No. 212 
Second Revised Sheet No. 213




Black Marlin states that in Order No. 636, et seq. the Commission permitted pipelines to allocate capacity on the basis
of economic value to shippers rather than on a first-come, first-served basis which had been established as the standard
under Order No. 436. 

Virtually all pipelines now schedule and curtail interruptible capacity based on the price, or rate, being paid for
such capacity with a pro rata allocation, if necessary, among shippers paying the same price. 

Although Black Marlin is not a capacity constrained pipeline and scheduling and curtailment priorities have not
been issues in the Black Marlin proceedings, Black Marlin states that it is filing herein to change and clarify the
operation of the scheduling and curtailment provisions of its tariff. 

The currently effective Section 9, Scheduling and Curtailment, of the General Terms and Conditions (GTC) of Black
Marlin's FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1 provides that scheduling and curtailment will be based on the
rate being paid for capacity within each scheduling and curtailment category. 

However, this Section also retains language regarding the first-come, first-served basis and priority dates which
were originally established pursuant to Order No. 436. 

Black Marlin states that it is filing herein to eliminate language regarding the first-come, first-served methodology
and priority dates so that it is clear that scheduling and curtailment, within each scheduling and/or curtailment
category, on Black Marlin is done by price, and pro rata at each price level. 

Black Marlin requests that the Commission grant any and all waivers of its rules, regulations, and orders as may be
necessary, specifically (but not limited to) Section 154.22 of the Commission's Regulations, so as to permit the
tariff sheets submitted herewith to become effective September 1, 1994. 

Black Marlin further states that copies of the filing have been mailed to each of its customers affected by this filing
and interested state commissions. 

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. 

All such motions or protests should be filed on or before August 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.


Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission
and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.

<DOCTITLE>Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>


August 16, 1994.


Take notice that on August 15, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco), P.O. Box 1396, Houston,
Texas 77251-1396, filed in Docket No. CP94-714-000 an application pursuant to Sections 7(c) and
7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for (1) a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing certain river crossings,
and (2) an order permitting and approving the abandonment of existing facilities at the same location, all as more
fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
Transco states that it has three pipelines which cross the Amite River in Louisiana: (1) 30-inch diameter Main Line
A, (2) 36-inch diameter Main Line B and (3) 36-inch Maine Line C. Transco states that all gas produced onshore and offshore
Texas and Louisiana which flows through Transco's system to Transco's markets in the deep south, atlantic seaboard
and eastern markets flows through the Amite River crossing (with the exception of the gas attached to Transco's mainline
by way of the Southeast Louisiana Gathering System, which interconnects with Transco's mainline at Compressor Station
No. 65, located approximately 11 miles north of the Amite River).
Transco states that because of river scouring, bank washing and channel meander/realignment, Main Line A is exposed.
It is indicated that Line A has been taken out of service because Transco is concerned that a significant flood event
could occur and rupture the line. It is also indicated that Main Lines B and C are not yet exposed, but Transco is concerned
that they would become exposed because the river is realigning in a southward direction.
Transco states that it cannot perform these replacements pursuant to Section 2.55(b) of the Commission's Regulations
because of the Commission's recent clarification of Section 2.55(b) in the order issued on May 12, 1994, in 

Arkla Energy Resources Company, 

Docket No. CP91-2069-000 (67 FERC  61,173), involving the issue of replacements outside of existing
right-of-way. Transco states that it is imperative that it complete the new crossings in time to provide service during
the upcoming winter heating season.
Transco states that it proposes to install approximately 2,700 feet of new 36-inch diameter Main Line B by horizontal
directional drilling under the Amite River, at the location of its existing pipeline crossing of the Amite River.
Transco indicates that directionally drilled pipeline are more secure than the older pipelines which were installed
by way of trenching the river bed. It is stated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch diameter pipe would be conventionally
installed from the entrance of the bore on the east side of the river and tied in to existing Main Lines A and B by means
of a new manifold. It is also indicated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch diameter pipe would be conventionally
installed from the exit of the bore on the west bank of the river and tied into existing Main Lines A and B by means of a new
manifold.
Transco states that it also proposes to install approximately 2,700 feet of new 36-inch diameter Main Line C by horizontal
directional drilling under the Amite River. It is indicated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch diameter pipe
will be conventionally installed from the entrance of the bore on the east side of the river and tied into existing Main
Line Lines A, B, and C by means of the manifold mentioned above. It is also stated that approximately 225 feet of 36-inch
diameter pipe would be conventionally installed from the exit of the bore on the west side of the river and tied into
Main Lines A, B, and C by means of the manifold mentioned above.
Transco states that proposed replacements would restore the long-term integrity of Transco's transmission system
at the Amite River crossings. It is stated that system capacity across the Amite River after installation of the two
new river crossings would be 2,361,000 Mcf per day compared with a current capacity of 2,369,000 Mcf per day. Transco
states that the three existing pipelines would be retired and removed. Transco estimates the cost of installing both
new lines at approximately $6,000,000, to be financed initially through short-term loans and funds on hand, with
permanent financing to be undertaken at a later date. Transco estimates the cost of the removal work at $280,000.
Transco states that issuance of a certificate and construction clearance by September 15, 1994, is justified for
three reasons: (1) The need for security of gas service during the upcoming winter heating season, (2) historically,
during the months of August and September, it is expected that the Amite River floodplain would be dryer than at any
time of the year, and thus provide the most favorable conditions for the contractor's equipment, and (3) the 

de minimis 

impact on the environment of the crossing project.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before August
31, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate and permission for abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Transco to appear or
be represented at the hearing.

Title:

 Information Collection Request (ICR) for Customer Satisfaction Surveys (EPA ICR No. 1711.01).


Abstract:

 This is a new information collection request seeking generic clearance for EPA customer surveys, in accordance with
the objectives of Executive Order (E.O.) 12862 ``Setting Customer Standards'' (September 11, 1993). The E.O. states
that ``...Federal agencies shall take steps to survey their customers for the purposes of determining the kind and
quality of services they want and measure the level of satisfaction with existing services.'' A subsequent OMB memorandum
to Federal agencies (September 29, 1993) encourages agencies to seek generic clearance through OMB for information
collection activities associated with customer surveys. This ICR fulfills the EPA's obligations under the E.O.
by providing an efficient, expedited clearance process within the EPA for customer surveys. 
EPA services (such as hotlines, information clearinghouses, public affairs offices) conducting customer service
surveys may request their customers to provide: (1) Identification information; and (2) opinion information related
to the quality, timeliness and value of their service. The EPA may gather this information through mail or telephone
questionnaires, or through focus interviews with selected customers. In addition, EPA programs that provide materials
(software, guidance documents, manuals, brochures) to the public may seek customer feedback through short self-addressed
customer feedback forms on distributed materials. 
The information will be used by the EPA to establish a baseline of information for developing strategies to improve
Agency services, and as a yardstick for measuring the success of these strategies over time.


Burden Statement:

 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 20 minutes for mail surveys, 10
minutes for customer feedback forms, 15 minutes for telephone surveys, and 2 hours for focus sessions, for an average
burden of 15 minutes per response including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and compiling the information,
and completing and reviewing the response.

Availability of the Presidential Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on Environmentally
and Economically Beneficial Practices on Federal Landscaped Grounds 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Federal Environmental Executive, EPA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice, Review & Comment. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 26, 1994, President Clinton signed a Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies encouraging
Environmentally and Economically Beneficial Practices on Federal Landscaped Grounds. 


The Memorandum calls for the establishment of an interagency work group by the Federal Environmental Executive to
recommend guidance to all Federal agencies in the implementation of the Memorandum. This notice and request for comment
is provided at the request of the Federal Environmental Executive in order to provide for the maximum amount of public
input into the guidance. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 ``Reinventing Environmental Management'' an Accompanying Report of the National Performance Review (NPR), clearly
makes the case that the Federal government's daily operation_how it manages the lands, buildings, and other facilities
that it owns or operates, has a significant impact on the environment. 


The National Performance Review recommended that the President issue a directive to require the use of environmentally
and economically beneficial landscaping for Federal lands and facilities and federally funded projects. The NPR
called upon the directive to increase the use of native plant species and to reduce the amount of chemicals applied
to Federal landscapes. The NPR also called for the use of water efficient technologies in Federal landscaping projects;
to provide educational and conservation opportunities to the public and to establish a government wide environmentally
sound landscape program. 
In response to the NPR, on April 26, 1994, President Clinton signed a Presidential Memorandum. The Memorandum called
for the establishment of guidelines for Federal facility managers on how to increase the use of native species, reduce
the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and implement water conservation techniques. Those guidelines
will be proposed by a Federal Inter-Agency workgroup established by the Federal Environmental Executive. The purpose
of this notice is to request input from interested parties on factors that should be included in the guidance. This
notice provides a brief discussion of the particular sections of the Memorandum and issues which will be considered
when the guidance is proposed. The guidelines should allow for climatic and geographic differences, and should provide
a framework for agencies to consider as they plan their landscape requirements. 
The Landscape Memorandum identifies five (5) priorities. Each of these have raised questions. 



(a) Use Regionally Native Plants 




Intent:

 to incorporate native plants wherever practicable into landscape projects. 


Discussion:

 The use of native plants is encouraged because regionally native plants are believed to be regionally adapted to environmental
conditions, i.e. soils, precipitation, light, extreme cold or heat, etc. By planting native plants we are using plants
that are therefore more hardy and more likely to be self-reliant than non-native alternatives. 


Concerns:

 (1) What is a native plant? Executive Order 11987 on Exotic Organisms, signed by President Carter on May 24, 1977, used
the following definition: ``all species of plants (and animals) naturally occurring, either presently or historically,
in any ecosystem in the United States.'' It has been suggested that the word ``presently'' be eliminated from the definition,
so as to avoid naturalized plants from being considered native. An alternative definition could be: ``all species,
indigenous to, or known to exist in a region at the time of European settlement.'' 
(2) Do commercial sources of native plants and seed exist to meet this new demand? It is believed that a substantial
group of native plant and seed sources exists in the Midwest, Southwest and Southeast regions. However, other regions
cannot meet the new demand. How can we develop more sources for native plants and seeds? 
(3) Does the public understand the use of native plants enough to support this project? Can the public understand that
all cemeteries operated by the United States Government should not be covered with lush Kentucky Blue Grass? Can the
public understand that the government cannot afford to maintain roadsides as if they were the nation's front yards?
Can the public accept a new ecological aesthetic? 
(4) How will agencies be provided training in the use and maintenance of planted native landscapes? Do the Agencies
currently have resources that could be diverted to this new training, or is the new program going to require additional
resources? 
(5) Under what conditions is the planting of native species practicable and appropriate? Should native species be
used primarily outside urban areas? 
(6) How do we avoid weed free seeds, to avoid accidental introduction of non-natives, or aggressive exotic species
to a project? Are state agricultural seed standards strong enough? 


(b) Design, Use, or Promote Construction Practices that Minimize Adverse Effects on the Natural Habitat 




Intent:

 The language here seeks to: (1) Maintain and promote the existing natural habitat; (2) Minimize disturbance to the
natural habitat; and (3) Integrate design and construction of Federal projects with the surrounding natural habitat.



Discussion:

 These principals are to be applied to federally funded projects where cost effective and to the extent practicable.
We do not envision major restoration of natural habitats to be accomplished under this executive memorandum, nor
do we envision that cost and time considerations will be sublimated in that effort. Instead, we envision that through
thoughtful design work, proper planning and quality construction, these goals will be achieved. Although first-cost
construction may be higher, overall costs may prove lower as costs for irrigation, maintenance, fertilization and
pest control may decline. 


Concerns: 


(1) What is the definition of `natural habitat'? This definition could embrace both ``native'' and ``existing''
habitat with the determination being site specific and made on a case-by-case basis. Is a ``Natural Habitat'' the
local association of plants adapted to the soil, topography and climate of an area that provide food and cover for indigenous
species of the area? 
(2) To what extent should we expend additional revenue in support of minimizing adverse impacts to the natural habitat?
Clearly, if the implementation of these principles produces lower costs and minimal or no impact to time delivery,
it will be readily accepted, but, measuring costs and cost-effectiveness can be subjective. Record keeping will
be imperative.

<TEXT>
 

(3) What is the best method for getting appropriate design principles incorporated into Federal agency design specifications
and guidance, etc? In particular, how can we get landscape designs integrated with the natural habitat, incorporating
native plants, xeriscaping principles and water efficient irrigation? 
(4) How can we ensure that the principles and practices identified in the Executive Memorandum are implemented by
Federal agencies? Should this be the responsibility of each Agency's Environmental Executive (designated under
Executive Order 12873)? 


(c) Seek to Prevent Pollution By, Among Other Things, Reducing Fertilizer and Pesticide Use, Using Integrated Pest
Management Techniques, Recycling Green Waste, and Minimizing Runoff. Landscaping Practices that Reduce the Use
of Toxic Chemicals Provide One Approach for Agencies to Reach Reduction Goals Established in Executive Order No.
12856, ``Federal Compliance with Right-To-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements;'' 




Discussion: 

Landscaping practices which do not require, or require only limited, application of fertilizer and/or pesticides
may result in significant prevention of pollution in several ways. First, and most conspicuous, any decreased need
for application decreases the likelihood that adverse environmental impacts associated with runoff of these chemicals
will occur. In addition, reduced need for chemical substances will decrease the amount of energy expended to produce
these chemicals. One practice, the use of integrated pest management, not only serves to reduce or eliminate the need
for pesticide application and thus prevent pollution, it generally results in significant reductions in unintended
impacts to non-target species, resulting in an secondary environmental benefit beyond pollution prevention. Additionally,
recycling of ``green waste'' results in a range of environmental benefits linked to pollution prevention. The collection,
composting and ultimate reuse of green wastes not only reduces the amount of materials placed in landfills, it decreases
and can eliminate the need for man-made fertilizers and thus reaps the same benefits as other such landscaping practices.
Finally, landscaping practices may serve a vital role in pollution prevention through the use of plants as barriers
to pollution and to absorb natural or man made pollutants which may otherwise enter natural systems such as waterbodies.
For example, buffer plantings along waterways act to absorb excess nutrients and chemical pollutants which might
otherwise enter waterways. 


Concerns: 

(1) How can the Federal community best accomplish this task? Non-traditional landscaping practices such as integrated
pest management not only require training to be effective, they require acceptance on the part of facility managers.



(d) Implement Water-Efficient Practices, Such As the Use of Mulches, Efficient Irrigation Systems, Audits to Determine
Exact Landscaping Water-Use Needs, and Recycled or Reclaimed Water and the Selecting and Siting of Plants in A Manner
that Conserves Water and Controls Soil Erosion. Landscaping practices, Such As Planting Regionally Native Shade
Trees Around Buildings to Reduce Air Conditioning Demands, Can Also Provide Innovative Measures to Meet the Energy
Consumption Reduction Goal Established in Executive Order No. 12902, ``Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation
at Federal Facilities;'' 




Discussion:

 Certain landscaping practices by design result in elimination or reduction of supplementary water needed to sustain
landscaped areas and prevent or reduce soil erosion. Practices such as the use of mulches which reduce evaporation
from landscaped areas and effective siting of landscape plantings can decrease the need for supplemental water and
prevent physical erosion of the soil. Other practices, such as efficient irrigation systems and water audits, ensure
that supplemental water is used most effectively and only when necessary. Additionally, the use of recycled or reclaimed
water offers an alternative to the use of potable water which both satisfies landscaping water needs and conserves
energy by decreasing the need for treated water. Finally, consideration of the natural shading effect associated
with landscape plantings can serve to reduce heat loadings on buildings and result in energy conservation. These
landscaping practices can conserve valuable water resources and energy and provide significant environmental
benefits to affected Federal property managers. 


Concerns: 

(1) Since the use of non-traditional landscaping practices will require training to ensure success, how can the Federal
government ensure that facility managers are aware of, and accept, non-traditional water-efficient landscaping
practices? 
(2) Are there potential problems with the use of recycled or reclaimed water? 
(3) Likewise, are there potential problems with the use of recycled materials, i.e. newspaper and sludge? 


(e) Create Outdoor Demonstrations Incorporating Native Plants, As Well As Pollution Prevention and Water Conservation
Techniques, to Promote Awareness of the Environmental An Economic Benefits of Implementing This Directive. Agencies
are Encouraged to Develop Other Methods for Sharing Information on Landscaping Advances With Interested Nonfederal
Parties 




Discussion: 

Many Federal facilities have a significant acreage of open land which remains unused for facility buildings and infrastructure.
In many instances, the public is actively invited to use these lands for passive recreational purposes such as bird
watching, picnicking, or hiking. These areas, therefore present a significant opportunity to showcase the aesthetic
and economic effectiveness of environmentally beneficial landscaping. Demonstration projects allow both public
and private interests to experience the benefits of landscaping practices and apply those practices to their own
landscaping activities. Other technology and information transfer methods such as workshops and brochures can
also provide this benefit. 


Concerns: 

(1) In this era of restricted resources, will the public understand the use of public funds for landscaping demonstration
projects? 
The text of the Presidential Memorandum follows: 


Memorandum on Environmentally Beneficial Landscaping 


April 26, 1994. 


Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies 


Subject: Environmentally and Economically Beneficial Practices on Federal Landscaped Grounds 




The Report of the National Performance Review contains recommendations for a series of environmental actions, including
one to increase environmentally and economically 
beneficial landscaping practices at Federal facilities and federally funded projects. Environmentally beneficial
landscaping entails utilizing techniques that complement and enhance the local environment and seek to minimize
the adverse effects that the landscaping will have on it. In particular, this means using regionally native plants
and employing landscaping practices and technologies that conserve water and prevent pollution. 
These landscaping practices should benefit the environment, as well as generate long-term costs savings for the
Federal Government. For example, the use of native plants not only protects our natural heritage and provides wildlife
habitat, but also can reduce fertilizer, pesticide,and irrigation demands and their associated costs because native
plants are suited to the local environment and climate.

Because the Federal Government owns and landscapes large areas of land, our stewardship presents a unique opportunity
to provide leadership in this area and to develop practical and cost-effective methods to preserve and protect that
which has been entrusted to us. Therefore, for Federal grounds, Federal projects, and federally funded projects,
I direct that agencies shall, where cost-effective and to the extent practicable: 



(a) Use regionally native plants for landscaping; 
(b) Design, use, or promote construction practices that minimize adverse effects on the natural habitat; 
(c) Seek to prevent pollution by, among other things, reducing fertilizer and pesticide use, using integrated pest
management techniques, recycling green waste,and minimizing runoff. Landscaping practices that reduce the use
of toxic chemicals provide one approach for agencies to reach reduction goals established in Executive Order No.
12856 ``Federal Compliance with Right-To-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements;'' 
(d) Implement water-efficient practices, such as the use of mulches, efficient irrigation systems, audits to determine
exact landscaping water-use needs,and recycled or reclaimed water and the selecting and siting of plants in a manner
that conserves water and controls soil erosion. Landscaping practices, such as planting regionally native shade
trees around buildings to reduce air conditioning demands, can also provide innovative measures to meet the energy
consumption reduction goal established in Executive Order No. 12902, ``Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation

(e) Create outdoor demonstrations incorporating native plants, as well as pollution prevention and water conservation
techniques, to promote awareness of the environmental and economic benefits of implementing this directive. Agencies
are encouraged to develop other methods for sharing information on landscaping advances with interested nonfederal
parties. 



In order to assist agencies in implementing this directive the Federal Environmental Executive shall: 



(a) Establish an interagency working group to develop recommendations for guidance, including compliance with
the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C.4321, 4331-4335, and 4341-4347,
and training needs to implement this directive. The recommendations are to be developed by November 1994; and 
(b) Issue the guidance by April 1995.To the extent practicable, agencies shall incorporate this guidance into their
landscaping programs and practices by February 1996. In addition, the Federal Environmental Executive shall establish
annual awards to recognize outstanding landscaping efforts of agencies and individual employees. Agencies are
encouraged to recognize exceptional performance in the implementation of this directive through their awards programs.
Agencies shall advise the Federal Environmental Executive by April 1996 on their progress in implementing this directive.
To enhance landscaping options and awareness, the Department of Agriculture shall conduct research on the suitability,
propagation, and use of native plants for landscaping. The Department shall make available to agencies and the public
the results of this research.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces a workshop sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Office of Health
and Environmental Assessment (OHEA) and Risk Assessment Forum. OHEA and the Risk Assessment Forum will convene a
panel of experts to review a draft document entitled, Draft Revisions to the Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment
(External Review Draft, August 1994). Discussion will focus on the proposed revisions to the Agency's cancer risk
assessment guidelines.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In 1986, EPA published Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (51 FR 33992; September 24, 1986). Scientific advances
in both risk assessment and carcinogenesis have led EPA and the broader scientific community to new perspectives
on cancer risk assessment and related new perspectives on EPA's Cancer Risk Assessment Guidelines. 




As part of its efforts to update and revise the 1986 Guidelines, the Agency will hold a workshop in Reston, Virginia,
on September 12-14, 1994, to discuss the major changes contemplated for these guidelines. At this meeting,
experts on cancer risk assessment and its associated sciences will comment on and discuss a working draft for revising
the 1986 cancer risk assessment guidelines. The workshop aims to produce recommendations to the Agency on the use
of default assumptions and wider application of mechanistic data in cancer risk assessment, among other things.

Elehue Kawika Freemon and Lucille K. Freemon v. American Telephone and Telegraph Company; Designation for Hearing



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Designation for Hearing.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This 

Hearing Designation Order 

designates for hearing a formal complaint proceeding to resolve material questions of fact surrounding the American
Telephone and Telegraph Company's (AT&T's) handling of an operator-assisted telephone call involving the
complainants in this case, Elehue Kawika Freemon and Lucille K. Freemon (together the Freemons or complainants).
The issue to be decided in the proceeding is whether AT&T's actions violated Section 705 of the Communications
Act and, if so, whether the Freemons suffered any measurable harm as a consequence of such violations and are entitled
to an award of damages from AT&T.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's 

Hearing Designation Order 

in CC Docket No. 94-89, adopted July 20, 1994, and released August 11, 1994.



The complete text of this 

Hearing Designation Order 

is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (Room 230), 1919 M Street,
NW., Washington, DC, and also may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., at (202) 857-3800, 1919 M Street, NW., room 246, Washington, DC 20554.



Synopsis of Hearing Designation Order



1. The Freemons filed a formal complaint with the Commission pursuant to Section 208 of the Act alleging that AT&T
had violated Section 705 of the Act by monitoring the complainants' telephone conversation and disclosing its contents
or meaning. AT&T disputes the legal and factual bases of the Freemons' claims.

2. After submission of numerous pleadings and motions to the Commission and discovery by the parties directed at clarifying
the basis of their respective claims, both the facts and circumstances surrounding AT&T's handling of the Freemons'
call are sharply disputed. Although neither AT&T nor the Freemons has formally requested that the complaint
be designated for hearing, both have informally advised Commission staff that they view a hearing as the most appropriate
and expeditious way to resolve the issues raised by the complaint.

3. Based on review of the record adduced in this matter, the Commission concluded that further proceedings are necessary
to resolve material questions of fact bearing on whether AT&T violated Section 705 of the Communications Act
in connection with its handling of the complainants' operator-assisted call as described in the complaint.

4. Accordingly, 

it is ordered, 

pursuant to Sections 4(i), 4(j), 201, 206, 207, 208, and 209 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.
  154(i), 154(j), 201, 206, 207, 208 and 209, that the above-captioned complaint proceeding is designated
for hearing in a proceeding to be held before an Administrative Law Judge at a time and place to be specified in a subsequent

<DOCTITLE>Final Criteria for Meeting the General Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships
for Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final criteria for meeting the general statutory
funding preference for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships under the authority
of section 831(b), title VIII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice
Improvement Amendments of 1992, title II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public
Law 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. 


Purpose 


Section 831(b) of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to make grants to provide financial assistance
to certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA) who are faculty members in accredited programs to enable such
nurse anesthetists to obtain advanced education relevant to their teaching functions. 



Statutory Funding Preference 


Section 860(e) of the PHS Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992, title
II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, enacted on October
13, 1992, provides for the following statutory preference for this program of Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty
Fellowships, as well as for certain other programs under titles VII and VIII of the PHS Act. 

Statutory preference will be given to qualified applicants that: (1) Have a high rate for placing graduates in practice
settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (2) have achieved,
during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, a significant increase in the
rate of placing graduates in such settings. 
This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of applications that have
been recommended for approval. 



Final Criteria for Meeting the General Statutory Funding Preference 


A notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 25463 on May 16, 1994 to announce the FY 1994 grant cycle for this program and to propose the criteria for meeting
the general statutory funding preference. No comments were received during the 30 day comment period. Therefore,
the criteria for meeting the general statutory funding preference remain as proposed. 
For Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships, qualified applicants will meet the general statutory funding
preference if a minimum of 50% of the nurse anesthetist faculty are teaching in medically underserved communities.

Study Program and the Joint Community Development Program, under Section 107 of Title I of the Housing and Community

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In order to achieve the goal of increasing the communication and collaboration among HUD, universities and local
communities, the Secretary has determined to create a new Office of University Partnerships within the Office of
the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. The purpose of this office is to strengthen HUD's ties
with academic institutions because of the ideas and research they can offer in the making of policy, and because of
their role in training the next generation of urban scholars and professionals.


Due to the creation of this new office, certain HUD programs which belong within it need to be relocated under the Assistant
Secretary for Policy Development and Research. These programs include the Work Study Program, the Community Outreach
Partnerships Program, and the Joint Community Development Program. Prior to when these delegations have taken,
and will take, effect, they were administered within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning
and Development. It is noted that the power and authority of the Secretary under the Work Study Program shall not be
delegated to the Assistant Secretary for PD&R until September 6, 1994. This is in order to best serve the needs
of the public due to the present stage of the funding and review process for this program.
Accordingly, the Secretary delegates, and revokes in part, authority as follows:


Section A. Authority Delegated


The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development delegates to the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research
(PD&R) the power and authority of the Secretary with respect to the programs listed below:

5307 note, and Section 107 of the Housing Development Act of 1974, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 5307.
Such delegated authority includes all existing and current grants and agreements for which Community Planning and
Development is relieved of administration and liability.


Section B. Authority to Redelegate


The authority granted pursuant to Section A., above, may be further redelegated pursuant to this delegation.


Section C. Authority Revoked in Part


The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development revokes in part the Delegation of Authority from the Secretary to the
Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development and the General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community
Planning and Development, published in the Federal Register at 48 FR 49384 on October 25, 1983. In Section A.1., with
regard to the authority delegated under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, the Secretary
revokes the delegation to exercise the power and authority of the Secretary with respect to the Work Study Program,
under Section 107(c), and the Joint Community Development Program, under 107(b)(5). The Secretary further revokes
any and all authority delegated to the Assistant Secretary and General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community
Planning and Development under Section 107 or Title I pertaining to the Community Outreach Partnerships Program,

Proposed Class Exemption for Certain Transactions Involving Insurance Company General Accounts


<AGENCY>

Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed class exemption.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains a notice of pendency before the Department of Labor (the Department) of a proposed class exemption
from certain prohibited transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA or the Act)
and from certain taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code). If granted, the proposed exemption
would exempt prospectively and retroactively to January 1, 1975, certain transactions engaged in by insurance company
general accounts in which an employee benefit plan has an interest, if certain specified conditions are met. Additional
exemptive relief is proposed for plans to engage in transactions with persons who provide services to insurance company
general accounts. The proposal would also permit transactions relating to the origination and operation of certain
asset pool investment trusts in which a general account has an interest as a result of the acquisition of certificates
issued by the trust. The proposed exemption, if granted, would affect participants and beneficiaries of employee
benefit plans, insurance company general accounts, as well as other persons engaging in the described transactions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This document contains a notice of pendency before the Department of a proposed class exemption from certain of the
restrictions of sections 406 and 407 of ERISA and from certain taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code,
by reason of section 4975(c)(1) of the Code. The proposed exemption was requested in an application dated March 25,
1994, submitted by the American Council of Life Insurance (the ACLI)
 pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with procedures set forth
in 29 CFR section 2570 subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). In addition, the Department is proposing additional
relief on its own motion pursuant to the authority described above.








Background






Life insurance companies issue a variety of group contracts for use in connection with employee pension benefit plans,
some of which provide benefits the amount of which is guaranteed, some of which provide benefits that may fluctuate
with the investment performance of the insurance company, and some of which offer elements of both. Under section
401(b)(2) of ERISA, if an insurance company issues a ``guaranteed benefit policy'' to a plan, the assets of the plan
are deemed to include the policy, but do no, solely by reason of the issuance of the policy, include any of the assets
of the insurance company. Section 401(b)(2)(B) defines the term ``guaranteed benefit policy'' to mean an insurance
policy or contract to the extent that such policy or contract provides for benefits the amount of which is guaranteed
by the insurer. In addition, in ERISA Interpretive Bulletin 75-2, 29 CFR 2509.75-2, the Department stated
that if an insurance company issues a contract or policy of insurance to a plan and places the consideration for such
contract or policy in its general asset account, the assets in such account shall not be considered to be plan assets.




On December 13, 1993, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in 

John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. 

v. 

Harris Trust & Savings Bank, 

114 S. Ct. 517 (1993) (

Harris Trust.)

 The Supreme Court held that those funds allocated to an insurer's general account pursuant to a contract with a plan
that vary with the investment experience of the insurance company are ``plan assets'' under ERISA. As a result, the
Court concluded that Hancock was a fiduciary with respect to the management and disposition of such funds. Under the
reasoning of this decision, a broad range of activities involving insurance company general accounts are subject
to ERISA's fiduciary standards.




Prior to the 

Harris Trust 

decision, the insurance industry, following adoption of IB 75-2, operated under the assumption that general
account assets were not plan assets, and thus, were not subject to ERISA's fiduciary responsibility provisions.
As a result of the retroactive effect of the Supreme Court decision, numerous transactions engaged in by insurance
company general accounts may have violated ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions. The insurance industry
believes that, absent exemptive relief, it will be subject to significant additional litigation with respect to
the operation of its general accounts.




If the underlying assets of a general account include plan assets, persons who have engaged in transactions with such
general account may be viewed as parties in interest, including fiduciaries, with respect to plans which have interests
as contractholders in the general account. Lastly, the underlying assets of an entity in which a general account acquired
an equity interest may include plan assets as a result of the 

Harris Trust

 decision.







Summary of the Application






The application contains facts and representations with regard to the requested exemption that are summarized below.
Interested persons are referred to the application on file with the Department for the complete representations
of the Applicant.

The ACLI represents that presently, of the $1.5 trillion in general account assets of domestic life insurance companies,
more than $558 billion relate to life insurance, health insurance and a broad variety of annuity products purchased
by employee benefit plans. General account contracts, unlike all other investment and funding vehicles offered
to plans, provide risk pooling, guarantees of principal and rates of return, as well as benefit guarantees, all of
which are backed by every dollar in the general account. The Applicant further states that it is this pooling and assumption
of risk that distinguish insurance companies from typical investment firms and for which the state insurance regulatory
agencies impose stringent reserve and capital requirements.
Like any other business, insurance companies have developed new products to compete in an ever changing marketplace.
In the pension area, various forms of participating general account contracts, especially deposit administration
and immediate participation guarantee contracts, were specifically developed to be responsive to the expressed
needs of plan sponsors. The ACLI states that even before enactment of ERISA, participating general account contracts
provided a unique balance of investment participation and protection, as well as many billions of dollars of benefits
to plan participants and beneficiaries. Participating contracts allow contractholders to share in the general
accounts' favorable investment, mortality and morbidity experience, to obtain protection from unfavorable experience,
and to provide certainty and dependability for the payment of benefits to participants and beneficiaries. According
to the ACLI, these factors have enabled plan sponsors to fund their benefit promises and to increase the benefits to
plan participants and beneficiaries.
Since the Supreme Court rendered its decision in 

Harris Trust

, the legal landscape applicable to general account activities has been significantly altered. The ACLI represents
that the Court's decision has created uncertainty regarding the status of general account operations and activities
under ERISA-governed plans and will have a long-term adverse effect on plan participants, the U.S. economy and the
insurance industry in the absence of exemptive relief.
The ACLI notes that insurance companies invest approximately $675 billion of general account assets in the economy
each year and that this is one of the largest sources of capital available in the United States, particularly for smaller
and medium-sized businesses which are the source of most of the new job creation in our country. The Applicant states
that the decision in 

Harris Trust

 has begun to slow, if not totally disrupt, the nation's capital markets. Investment bankers, brokers and banks, as
well as insurance companies, are all now hesitant to engage in common, commercially reasonable and economically
beneficial business transactions for fear of inadvertently violating ERISA's prohibited transaction restrictions.
The Applicant believes that without the relief requested in its application, many ordinary practices of the insurance
industry could be called into question.
The ACLI has requested unconditional retroactive relief from January 1, 1975, for all transactions that may be viewed
as having been prohibited because insurance company general accounts may have held plan assets, as well as certain
other transactions that may be viewed as having become prohibited merely as the result of an ERISA covered plan's purchase
of a participating general account contract. The ACLI states that, although it is not possible to identify with specificity
the types of transactions to be covered by the proposed exemption, such transactions would include (but are not limited
to) the following:
(A) all internal operations of the general account (internal transactions); (B) all investment transactions involving
general account assets, including transactions between the general account and a party in interest with respect
to a plan that has purchased a general account contract; and (C) the purchase by the general account of securities issued
by and real property leased to employers of employees covered by plans that have purchased general account contracts.


Internal Transactions


The ACLI represents that general accounts engage in a variety of internal activities which, given the application
of ERISA, could potentially be viewed as prohibited. For example, income and losses generated by general account
investments are allocated among lines of business (or, where applicable, among segments) or to surplus. Decisions
must be made regarding the use of surplus, i.e., whether and to what extent to use surplus to pay dividends to policyholders
or stockholders. In addition, general operational business decisions relating to salaries and benefits for the
employees of the insurer, the provision of office space and materials, advertising expenses, charitable contributions,
etc., could also be transactions subject to ERISA due to the pooled nature of general account assets. Thus, the ACLI
represents that conceivably any of the myriad of decisions made by an insurance company regarding the structuring
or internal operation of its business would need exemptive relief. In addition, the ACLI notes that many insurance
companies use affiliates to provide investment management or property management services with regard to general
account properties and assets.

Investment Transactions With Third Parties



The Applicant represents that due to the pooled nature of general account assets, it is conceivable that general account
investment transactions with persons who are parties in interest with respect to ERISA-governed plans which have
purchased participating general account contracts (external transactions) could be viewed as subject to the prohibited
transaction rules of ERISA. For example insurance companies are currently the most significant source of loans for
smaller and mid-sized companies in today's market. Many, if not all, of those companies have party in interest relationships
with plans that have purchased general account contracts. Application of ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions
would have an adverse impact on the primary source of credit for these companies. The ACLI further represents that
application of the prohibited transaction rules in this case could, therefore, call into question almost every investment
transaction by insurance company general accounts since the January 1, 1975, effective date of the ERISA fiduciary
provisions.

The Applicant states that the relief needed for general account investment transactions would be similar to the broad
relief provided in Prohibited Transaction Exemption 78-19, 43 Fed. Reg. 59915 (December 22, 1978), as amended
and redesignated in PTE 90-1, 55 Fed. Reg. 2891, (January 29, 1990). PTE 90-1 provides conditional relief
for certain transactions between insurance company pooled separate accounts in which plans have an interest and
parties in interest with respect to those plans.







Additional Transactions



In addition to broad relief for transactions between parties in interest and general accounts, the ACLI represents
that various other transactions would need retroactive relief as a result of the potential plan asset treatment of
general account assets.

<TEXT>
 

Over the years, there have been literally thousands of persons and entities that have provided services to insurance
companies. According to the ACLI, because of the size of insurance company general accounts, the number of service
providers raises the possibility of countless, technical prohibited transactions which have posed no possibility
of abuse. Thus, the ACLI requests relief for transactions that would be prohibited merely because a person is deemed
to be a party in interest to a plan solely by reason of providing services to the general account (or who has a relationship
with such service providers described in sections 3(14) (F), (G), (H), or (I) of ERISA).

The ACLI further represents that, under the Department's plan assets regulation, 29 CFR  2510.3-101(f)(2)(iii),
an insurance company investing general account assets could be viewed as a ``benefit plan investor'' for the purposes
of calculating the 25 percent significant participation test in section 2510.3-101(f)(1) of the regulation.
This could increase the number of entities that would hold plan assets as the result of a general account equity investment
in an entity, and thereby also increase the number of possible prohibited transactions.
 The ACLI notes that, as a further consequence of the general account's investment in an entity, the manager of the entity
(and other service providers to the entity) might be deemed to be fiduciaries or other parties in interest under section
3(14) of ERISA. Therefore, the ACLI requests broad relief for transactions that would be prohibited solely because
an entity has significant participation by benefit plan investors as a result of equity investments by general account(s).





Employer Securities and Employer Real Property



The Applicant represents that the breadth of general account investment activities over the last 20 years makes it
likely that insurance companies have purchased and continued to hold for their general accounts, securities issued
by or properties leased to employers of employees covered by plans that purchased general account contracts. Because
insurance companies have made such investments with the understanding that general account assets were not plan
assets, it is possible that general account investments include securities issued by employers, and real property
leased to employers, that do not meet the standards set forth in section 407(a) of ERISA. The ACLI also believes that
relief is necessary for the acquisition or holding of qualifying employer securities or qualifying real property
by a plan under circumstances where the acquisition or holding contravenes sections 406 and 407(a) solely by reason
of being aggregated with employer securities or employer real property held by an insurance company general account
in which the plan holds an interest as a contractholder. The Applicant notes that the relief requested for such ``excess
holdings'' is similar to the relief provided for pooled separate accounts in section I(c) of PTE 90-1.






The Proposed Exemption



The scope of the exemption being proposed by the Department differs from that requested by the Applicant. As previously
noted, the Department has granted a class exemption for insurance company pooled separate accounts that provides
relief from ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions for a variety of transactions between separate accounts
and parties in interest with respect to plans participating in such accounts. The Department has decided to propose
similar relief, as described below, with respect to insurance company general account transactions to the extent
that it believes that the requirements of section 408(a) of ERISA would be met. On its own motion, the Department is
also proposing relief for certain transactions involving the operation of certain asset pool investment trusts.
However, as more fully discussed below, the Department is not prepared at this time to propose several additional
exemptions requested by the Applicant.



Internal Transactions



After considering the ACLI's requested exemption for activities in connection with the internal operation of general
accounts, the Department has determined that it does not have sufficient information regarding the operation of
such accounts to make the findings required by section 408(a)
 of ERISA. In a letter dated May 20, 1994, the Department has requested from the ACLI the necessary information by posing
a number of questions concerning the internal operations of general accounts. In that letter, the Department indicated
that it would proceed with its review of their application as it pertains to the external transactions while awaiting
their response to the questions.

<PARENT> FR940822-2-00048 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Therefore, the Department is not proposing relief for transactions involving the internal operation of general
accounts at this time.



Additional Transactions



In addition to requesting broad retroactive relief for general account transactions, the ACLI application also
requests relief for certain other transactions that may be viewed as being prohibited under the Supreme Court's analysis
in 

Harris Trust

 merely as a result of a plan's purchase of a participating general account contract. As previously noted, the significant
participation test contained in the plan asset regulation (section 2510.3-101) is a ``safe harbor'' provision
which provides that the assets of an entity will be considered to include plan assets only if equity participation
by ``benefit plan investors'' is ``significant''. The ACLI represents that, under regulation section 2510.3-101(f)(2),
an insurance company investing general account assets in an entity could be viewed as a benefit plan investor for the
purposes of calculating the 25 percent significant participation test. As a result, transactions between the entity
and a party in interest to a plan with an interest in the general account could be prohibited under section 406 of ERISA.
 Accordingly, the ACLI seeks broad exemptive relief for transactions that would be prohibited solely because an entity
is deemed to hold plan assets under the significant participation test as the result of an insurance company general
account investment in such entity.





Based upon its consideration of the ACLI application and supporting documentation, the Department does not believe
that it has sufficient information regarding the impact of the 

Harris Trust

 decision on entities that conducted their business operations in accordance with the significant participation
exception contained in the plan asset regulation. Specifically, while the ACLI application generally identifies
the potential impact of the 

Harris Trust

 decision on such entities, the application provides no specific information, either from the affected entities
themselves or other independent sources concerning the makeup of such entities, a description of the transactions
for which exemptive relief is necessary, or the standards and safeguards upon which exemptive relief for such transactions
should be conditioned.

The Department believes that it is important that the standards and safeguards incorporated in any class exemption
be feasible, effective, and protective of plans, participants and beneficiaries. Accordingly, this notice is intended
to provide interested persons with an opportunity to submit written comments which will be considered by the Department
in deciding whether to propose additional exemptive relief.

The following is a list of some of the issues that have been identified by the Department. The list does not purport to
identify all issues relevant to the development of exemptive relief, and comments on other matters raised by this
portion of the ACLI request are also invited.



A. Need for Exemptive Relief



1. A description of the entities that may be affected by the 

Harris Trust

 decision in operating under the significant participation test by reason of an insurance company's investment of
general account assets in such entity.

2. What types of transactions would require exemptive relief if the underlying assets of the entity include plan assets
as a result of the 

Harris Trust

 decision? In this regard, please distinguish between transactions involving the internal operation of the entity
and external transactions involving the entity and parties in interest with respect to plan contractholders of the
general account investor.

3. What costs or hardships, if any, would result for plans if the Department does not provide relief for these transactions?



B. Standards and Safeguards



1. Describe whether any of such entities are subject to federal or state regulatory oversight. The response should
include a brief description of the specific regulatory environment applicable to the entity and how the particular
regulatory scheme serves as a constraint on the exercise of discretion by the persons responsible for the management
of the entity.

2. What limitations or safeguards should a class exemption contain in order to reduce the potential for abuse of discretionary
authority? For example, what limitations, if any, should be included with respect to:

(i) The types of transactions for which relief is provided?

(ii) Transactions which inure to the direct or indirect benefit of the entity manager or an affiliated person?

(iii) The scope of discretion exercised by the entity manager?



C. Miscellaneous



1. Describe any agreements that limit the discretionary authority of the entity manager with respect to the management
or operation of the entity. For example, to what extent do investors independent of the manager retain any decision-making
responsibility or authority?

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00069 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00048 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Describe the methods used to determine the compensation of the entity manager and related persons for services
provided to the entity. For example, does the manager have the ability to affect the timing and/or amount of its compensation?

3. To what extent would transactions prohibited as a result of the 

Harris Trust

 decision be covered by any existing statutory or administrative exemptions?

4. Describe whether the entity managers are affiliated with general account investors or other fiduciaries of plans
that are accountholders of such general account investors.

5. What information does the entity provide to investors? For example, does the entity provide information regarding
the internal operation of the entity prior to investment, and periodic disclosures during the period of investment?

6. What other standards should be included in a class exemption in addition to an arm's-length requirement? For example,
should an exemption condition relief upon some degree of sophistication and financial accountability on the part
of the entity manager?



General Exemption



The proposed exemption consists of six separate parts. Section I sets forth the basic exemption and enumerates certain
conditions applicable to transactions described therein. Sections II and III of the proposal set forth three specific
exemptions. Section IV contains the general conditions applicable to transactions described in sections I and II.
Section V contains definitions for certain terms used in the proposed exemption. Section VI sets forth the effective
date of the exemption.



Section I



The general exemption set forth in section I would provide an exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a) and
407(a) for: (1) any transaction between a party in interest with respect to a plan and an insurance company general
account, in which the plan has an interest as a contractholder; (2) any acquisition or holding by the general account
of employer securities or employer real property; and (3) any acquisition or holding of qualifying employer securities
or qualifying employer real property by a plan (other than through an insurance company general account) if the acquisition
or holding contravenes the restrictions of sections 406(A)(1)(E), 406(a)(2) and 407(a) of ERISA solely by reason
of being aggregated with employer securities or employer real property held by an insurance company general account.
The above exemptions are subject to the requirement that the plan's participation in the general account as measured
by the amount of the reserves arising from the contract held by the plan, (determined under section 807(d) of the Code)
does not exceed 10% of all liabilities of the general account.

The ACLI stated that it would be unfair to retroactively impose a percentage limitation in the requested exemption.
In this regard, the Applicant represents that the level of insurance company general account investments activities
and the breadth of general account holdings are so great that it would effectively preclude any single plan contractholder
from exerting any undue influence over the decisions of an insurance company. Nevertheless, the Department has decided
to reject the ACLI's recommendation that a percentage limitation not be imposed as a condition to broad exemptive
relief. In the past, the Department has conditioned the availability of a number of class exemptions providing similar
broad relief on a plan's interest in a collective fund or account not exceeding a specified percentage amount. The
Department continues to believe that a plan that provides a significant percentage of an entity's business would,
in many cases, be in a position to improperly influence the investment decisions of the entity. In any event, it does
not appear that compliance with such a condition would be difficult in light of the apparent size of most general accounts.



Section II



Section II is divided into two subparts. Section II(a) of the proposed exemption would permit transactions involving
persons who are parties in interest to a plan solely by reason of providing services to an insurance company general
account in which the plan has an interest as a contractholder.

Based on precedents established in several class and individual exemptions the Department is proposing an exemption,
in section II(b), that permits the furnishing of services, facilities and any goods incidental to such services and
facilities by a place of public accommodation owned by an insurance company general account to parties in interest
if the services, facilities and incidental goods are furnished on a comparable basis to the general public.

In the regular operations of places of public accommodation, such as hotels and motels, that may be purchased by an
insurance company general account, many people, including parties in interest with respect to plans which have participating
contracts with the general account, may receive use of such rooms, service, food, etc. Such hotels and motels will
typically be managed by hotel management companies who probably would not be aware of the relationship of the hotel
and motel guests to the insurance company and the plans who purchased general account contracts.



Section III



Subsequent to the filing of the ACLI exemption application, the Department has received several suggestions with
respect to any exemption that may result from the Department's consideration of the ACLI request. While expressing
general endorsement for the exemption requested by the ACLI with respect to the operation of entities that are deemed
to hold plan assets under section 2510.3-101(f) as a result of an insurance company general account investment,
one commenter specifically focused on the impact of the 

Harris Trust

 decision on a number of exemptions previously granted by the Department for the operation of asset pool investment
trusts that issue asset-backed, pass-through certificates to plans.

PTE 83-1 (48 FR 895, January 7, 1983) provides conditional relief for the operation of certain mortgage pool
investment trusts and the acquisition and holding by plans of certain mortgage-backed pass-through certificates
evidencing interests therein. The Department also granted a large number of individual exemptions (e.g., PTE 89-88
[54 FR 42581, October 17, 1989]), each of which provides substantially identical relief for the operation of certain
asset pool investment trusts and the acquisition and holding by plans of certain asset-based pass-through certificates
representing interests in those trusts (collectively, the Underwriter Exemptions).

PTE 83-1 and the Underwriter Exemptions are conditioned, among other things, upon the certificates purchased
by plans not being subordinated to other classes of certificates issued by the same trust. The commenter further noted
that, in a typical asset pool investment trust, one or more classes of subordinated certificates are often issued.
Underwriters and issuers will sell senior certificates to plans in reliance on PTE 83-1 and the Underwriter
Exemptions, but will not knowingly sell any of the subordinated certificates to plans. Thus, the Above-described
exemptions provide relief for the operation of a pool that sells senior certificates to plans, but provide no relief
for the same acts of the pool trustee and servicer if plans purchase subordinated certificates issued by the same trust.

The commenter stated that life insurance companies have been significant purchasers of subordinated certificates.
The 

Harris Trust

 decision raises the potential for servicers and trustees of pools to be subject to excise taxes and civil penalty liability
for the same acts involving the operation of trusts which would be exempt if the certificates were not subordinated.
Accordingly, the commenter believes that exemptive relief is especially appropriate in situations where insurance
company general account investments in subordinated classes of certificates causes plan ownership of such classes
to equal or exceed 25 percent.
 In support of this request for specific relief, the commenter provided the following reasons: (1) asset pool investment
trusts are fixed pools, the assets of which are generally not subject to change once the certificates are sold; (2)
the pool sponsor's discretion and the servicer's discretion with respect to assets included in a trust are severely
limited and are governed by a written pooling and servicing agreement that is available to investors prior to purchasing
a certificate; (3) the assets in the trusts represent secured obligations; and (4) trustees of asset pool investment
trusts must be independent of the pool sponsors. Moreover, the commenter argued that the fact that the certificates
acquired by a general account are subordinated should not preclude the Department from providing exemptive relief
since the certificates will have been analyzed by insurance company purchasers, who are presumptively sophisticated
investors.





The Department believes that the commenter's recommendation has merit and has determined to propose exemptive relief
on its own motion. Section III of the proposal would provide relief from sections 406(a), 406(b), and 407(a) of ERISA
for the operation of asset pool investment trusts in which the insurance general account has an interest as a result
of the acquisition of subordinated certificates.
 The proposal requires that the conditions of either PTE 83-1 or an applicable Underwriter Exemption be met other
than the requirements that the certificates acquired by the general account not be subordinated and receive a rating
that is in one of the three highest generic rating categories from an independent rating agency. In addition, the Department
has proposed additional relief for the operation of such trusts where a plan acquired subordinated certificates
in a transaction that was not prohibited or otherwise satisfied the conditions of PTE 75-1. The department has
proposed this exemption in recognition that no relief would be available for the operation of a trust if a plan purchased
subordinated certificates in a transaction that was not prohibited (or was otherwise covered by PTE 75-1) and
the underlying assets of the trust includes plan assets under the analysis adopted in the 

Harris Trust

 decision as a result of the application of the significant participation test under the plan asset regulation (section
2510.3-101(f)) to the general account's investment in such subordinated certificates.





Section IV contains general conditions which are applicable to all transactions described in sections I and II of
the proposed exemption. Transactions must be at least as favorable to the insurance company general account as arm's-length
transactions between unrelated parties. The proposal would also require that the transaction not be part of any agreement,
arrangement, or understanding designed to benefit a party in interest. Lastly, the party in interest entering into
the transaction cannot be the insurance company, any pooled separate account of the insurance company, or any affiliate
of the insurance company.



General Information



The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and
the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act which require, among other things, that
a fiduciary discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries;

<TEXT>
 

(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries, and protective of the rights of the participant and beneficiaries;
(3) If granted, the proposed class exemption will be applicable to a particular transaction only if the transaction
satisfies the conditions specified in the class exemption; and
(4) The proposed exemption, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Code and Act, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the face
that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction
is in fact a prohibited transaction.


Written Comments and Hearing Requests


All interested persons are invited to submit comments or requests for a hearing on the proposed exemption to the address
and within the time period set forth above. All comments will be made a part of the record. Comments and requests for
a hearing should state the reasons for the writer's interest in the proposed exemption. Comments received will be
available for public inspection with the application for exemption at the address set forth above.

exemption providing similar relief to the extent that the Department expressly determines, as part of the proceeding
to grant such exemption, to include the exemption within this definition.

(i) For purposes of this exemption, the time as of which any transaction, acquisition, or holding occurs is the date
upon which the transaction is entered into, the acquisition is made or the holding commences. In addition, in the case
of a transaction that is continuing, the transaction shall be deemed to occur until it is terminated. If any transaction
is entered into, or acquisition made, on or after January 1, 1975, or any renewal that requires the consent of the insurance
company occurs on or after January 1, 1975, and the requirements of this exemption are satisfied at the time the transaction
is entered into or renewed, respectively, or at the time the acquisition is made, the requirements will continue to
be satisfied thereafter with respect to the transaction or acquisition and the exemption shall apply thereafter
to the continued holding of the securities or property so acquired. This exemption also applies to any transaction
or acquisition entered into or renewed, or holding commencing prior to January 1, 1975, if either the requirements
of this exemption would have been satisfied on the date the transaction was entered into or acquisition was made (or
on which the holding commenced), or the requirements would have been satisfied on January 1, 1954 if the transaction
had been entered into, the acquisition was made, or the holding had commenced, on January 1, 1975. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this exemption shall cease to apply to a transction or holding exempt by virtue of section I(a) or section
I(b) at such time as the interest of the plan in the insurance company general account exceeds the percentage interest
limitation contained in section I(a), unless no portion of such excess results from an increase in the assets allocated
to the insurance company general account by the plan. For this purpose, assets allocated do not include the reinvestment
of general account earnings. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as exempting a transaction entered into
by an insurance company general account which becomes a transaction described in section 406 of the Act or section
4975 of the Code while the transaction is continuing, unless the conditions of the exemption were met either at the
time the transaction was entered into or at the time the transaction would have become prohibited but for this exemption.

(j) The term ``reserves'' has the same meaning as the term ``life insurance reserves'' as described in section 816(b)
of the Code.



Section VI_Effective date.

 If granted, the exemption would be effective January 1, 1975.

<DOCTITLE>Advisory Council on Employee Welfare and Pension Benefits Plan; Notice of Meeting</DOCTITLE>




Pursuant to the authority contained in Section 512 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),
29 U.S.C. 1142, a public meeting of the Advisory Council on Employee Welfare and Pension Benefit Plans will be held
on Friday, September 9, 1994, in Suite S-4215 AB, U.S. Department of Labor Building, Third and Constitution Avenue,

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Georgia Power Company, et al; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-68 and NPF-81 issued to Georgia Power Company, Ogelthorpe Power Corporation Municipal
Electric Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Vogtle Electric Generating
Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Burke County, Georgia.

The proposed amendment would revise the values of Z and S for the Pressurized Pressure-Low and -High reactor trip setpoints
(Technical Specification Table 2.2-1, Functional Units 9 and 10, respectively) to allow the use of alternate
types of pressure transmitters.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:

1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The proposed change revises the allowances Z and S in Technical Specification Table 2.2-1 for the Pressurizer
Pressure-Low and -High trip setpoints (Table 2.2-1, Functional Units 9 and 10) to allow the use of Tobar, Veritrak,
or Rosemount pressure transmitters. Also, the corresponding values of Z and S for the Pressurizer Pressure-Low setpoint
for safety injection actuation (Table 3.3-3, Functional Unit 1d) are bounding for these pressure transmitters.
The allowances for Z and S are not assumed in any of the initiating events for the accident analyses. Therefore, the
probability of any accident previously evaluated will not be affected by the proposed changes. Furthermore, the
setpoints, allowable values, and total allowances are not affected. Since the total allowances are not affected,
it is ensured that the safety analysis limits for the trips are not affected. Therefore, the proposed change does not
involve a significant increase in the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The safety function provided by the reactor trips and safety injection actuation and the manner in which the plant
is operated are not affected. The setpoints, allowable values, and total allowances are not affected. Since the total
allowances are not affected, it is ensured that the safety analysis limits for the trips are not affected. Thus, this
change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Does this change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

For both the reactor trips and safety injection actuation, there are no changes to the setpoints. The total allowance
for each setpoint is the difference between the safety analysis limit and the setpoint. Since the total allowances
are not affected, there are no changes to the safety analysis limits. Therefore the proposed change will not involve
a reduction in margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By September 21, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Burke County Library, 412 Fourth Street,
Waynesboro, Georgia 30830. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition
for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how
that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons
why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's
right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,
or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding
on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the
proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or
who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the
first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity
requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding,
a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which
are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or
fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the
contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which
the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references
to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely
to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine
dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within
the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven,, would entitle the petitioner
to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least
one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Herbert N. Berkow: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mr. Arther H. Domby, Troutman Sanders, NationsBank Plaza, 600 Peachtree Street, NE.,
Atlanta, Georgia 30308, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)_(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendments dated June 24, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Burke County Public Library, 412 Fourth Street, Waynesboro,
Georgia 30830.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Partial Accelerated Approval to Amendments to Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Limited Partnership Rollup Transactions


August 15, 1994.


I. Introduction


On February 3, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The proposal subsequently was amended eight times. On April 14, 1993, May 7, 1993, May 13, 1993, May 14, 1993, August
26, 1993, October 21, 1993,
 April 14, 1994, and July 27, 1994, the NASD filed Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively, to the proposed
rule change.
 The proposed rule change would amend Article III, Section 34 of the Rules of Fair Practice to include rules which prevent
NASD members or persons associated with an NASD member from participating in any ``limited partnership rollup transaction''
(as defined in the proposed rule change) unless the transaction includes certain specified provisions designed
to protect the rights of limited partners. The proposed rule change also would amend Article III, Section 34(b)(6)
to narrow the scope of transactions in which members are forbidden to receive differential compensation (``Differential
Compensation Amendment''). Finally, the proposed rule change would amend Schedule D of the By-Laws (``Schedule
D'') to prohibit the authorization for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market (``Nasdaq/NM'') of any security which
results from a covered partnership rollup transaction unless the transaction was conducted in accordance with certain
specified procedures designed to protect the rights of dissenting limited partners.







Notice of the proposed rule change, together with the substance of the proposal as amended by Amendment Nos. 1-4,
was provided by the issuance of a Commission release (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32312, May 17, 1993) and
by publication in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 29655, May 21, 1993). Seven comment letters were received in response to the Commission release. Three comment
letters expressed support for the proposed rule change.
 One comment letter stated that the proposed rule change should not be adopted ``in the absence of a legislative mandate.''
 Three comment letters neither supported nor opposed the proposed rule change but offered suggestions on how to enhance
the NASD's rule.







The Rollup Reform Act was enacted on December 17, 1993, as part of the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993.
Section 3(a) of the Rollup Reform Act added subparagraph (12) to Section 15A(b) of the Exchange Act to require that
the rules of a registered securities association prevent members of the association from participating in any limited
partnership rollup transaction unless the transaction provides procedures to protect certain rights of limited
partners. Section 3(c) of the Rollup Reform Act amended Section 15A(b) of the Exchange Act to require that the rules
of a registered securities association prohibit the authorization for quotation on an automated interdealer quotation
system sponsored by the association of any security designated by the SEC as a national market system security resulting
from a rollup transaction, unless the transaction provides certain rights for limited partners.
 The NASD subsequently amended the proposed rule change to conform the language of the rule to the Rollup Reform Act.






By this release, the Commission: (i) solicits comment on the Differential Compensation Amendment; (ii) approves
the proposed rule change as amended by Amendment Nos. 1-4; and (iii) grants approval on an accelerated basis
to Amendment Nos. 5, 6 and 8, and grants approval on an accelerated basis to Amendment No. 7,
 except for that portion of that Amendment proposing the Differential Compensation Amendment, which the Commission
is not approving by this release.






The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary of the NASD and at the Commission.
 With respect to the Differential Compensation Amendment, language proposed to be added to Subsections (b)(6)(A)
and (B) of Article III, Section 34 is in italics; proposed deletions are in brackets.

During the 1980s, over $150 billion of public limited partnership interests were sold to U.S. investors.
 Sources have estimated that 11 million investors have purchased limited partnership interests, of which approximately
eight million are small investors, with an average investment of about $10,000.
 Limited partnership interests typically are risky and illiquid, due to the lack of an active trading market for such
interests. 






A. Structure of A Limited Partnership 



In the typical publicly-offered limited partnership, a sponsoring organization solicits funds from investors
to use in the purchase of real estate, oil and gas facilities, high technology research, or other enterprises. The
sponsor usually serves as the general partner and is required to manage the assets and fulfill any obligations to the
investors imposed under the terms of the partnership agreement. The investors are the limited partners. A partnership
agreement typically will provide for limited partners to receive periodic payments during the term of their investment,
a return of their principal, and a specified return or profit and a portion of any additional proceeds upon the liquidation
of the partnership assets. 



B. Reasons to Invest in a Limited Partnership 



Investors purchased limited partnerships for several reasons. Perhaps most important, in the case of real estate
partnerships prior to the 1986 amendments to the Internal Revenue Code (''1986 Tax Act''), limited partnership investors
enjoyed significant tax benefits.
 Limited partnerships permitted small investors to participate in commercial and multi-family real estate, oil
and gas facilities, and other investments previously limited to institutional or other large investors.
 Investors in limited partnerships were promised that they would realize a return on their investment within a finite
period of time. Investors also were promised that sponsors would not realize any return on partnership assets until
investors received their share of the profits. 






C. Advantages for partnership sponsors 



Sponsors have a financial incentive to organize limited partnerships for at least two reasons. First, the sponsor/general
partner expects to realize a profit on any appreciation of the assets after the limited partners receive their share.
Second, the sponsor/general partner derives income on an on-going basis for the management services provided in
maintaining and operating the property. The general partner also may receive up-front fees for organizing the limited
partnership. 



D. Recent partnership performance 



In the late 1980s, the financial climate for limited partnership deteriorated dramatically. Several factors contributed
to limited partnerships' poor performance. The 1986 Tax Act took away any tax benefit for limited partnership investors.
Real estate and oil and gas markets also declined precipitously. This, together with a series of other circumstances,
caused many general partners to face a decreasing revenue base and a growing number of financial problems.
 Since January 1, 1985, the number of limited partnership offerings filed with the Commission has decreased substantially
each year, from a high of 428 in 1985 to a low of 39 in 1991.
 Interests in limited partnerships investing in real estate lost some or all of their economic value due to the dramatic
decline in real estate values during the late 1980s. 







Several consequences flowed from the deteriorating climate for limited partnerships. Many general partners stopped
raising new capital altogether. Sales of assets from existing partnerships exceeded any new capital raised, thereby
eroding assets under management and significantly reducing general partner management fees.
 Some general partners responded to their predicament by changing the original partnership agreements and restructuring
the limited partnerships by proposing to reorganize or, in many cases, ``roll up'' existing limited partnership
interests into new, publicly-traded securities. 






E. Rollups 



From January 1, 1985 to June 30, 1994, approximately 82 limited partnership rollup transactions involving two or
more entities were registered with the Commission. These rollups have involved over 1,900 separate limited partnerships
with an estimated aggregate value well over seven billion dollars. 



1. Rollup structure 



A typical ``rollup'' will combine several non-traded individual limited partnerships into a single new entity that
publicly trades on a national securities exchange or on Nasdaq/NM. This entity generally is an infinite life vehicle
which is designed continually to reinvest proceeds from asset sales, unlike the provisions limited partnerships,
which are investments with a limited or finite term that, at some point in time, distribute proceeds, if any, to investors.
A rollup also can involve the reorganization of a single partnership into a new entity. 



2. Benefits of rollups 



In some cases, reorganizing non-traded public limited partnerships that have lost substantial value and creating
a new publicly-traded, infinite life vehicle can enhance the value of the investments of the limited partners.
 For example, the new entity may offer investors liquidity previously unavailable, create economies of scale and
reduce administrative costs to improve performance, and create broader diversification of assets which will improve
investment safety. 






3. Criticism of rollup 



Critics have said that the vast majority of limited partnership rollups result in the newly-traded security immediately
falling to a discount to its net asset value, as cash flow from the stronger partnerships is used to support losses from
the weaker partnerships.
 They further argue that ongoing asset management fees and expenses assessed by the general partners offset, and in
fact may exceed, the promised reduced administrative costs.
 As a result, the limited partners' equity is substantially diluted. One industry witness testified before Congress
that, in the large rollup transactions, limited partners have realized, on average, a drop of 45 percent from the exchange
value on the first day of trading in their newly issued rollup securities.
 Congressional testimony also disclosed estimates that these limited partners when taken as a whole have lost approximately
$2 billion in equity, while rollup sponsors have earned over $250 million in fees.
 By one estimate, when compared to original exchange values, investors involved in public limited partnership rollups
have experience a decline of approximately 70 percent in limited partner equity.
 










While investor complaints have been sparked by the enormous declines in the value of the rollup security compared
with the ``exchange value'' stated in the prospectus, rollup sponsors have argued that the stated exchange value
is not intended to be the trading price of the security, and thus, such comparisons tend to overstate the magnitude
of investor losses.
 However, rollup disclosure documents generally have proven to be almost incomprehensible and it is likely that sponors
did not clearly disclose to investors that the stated exchange value is not intended to be the trading price of the security.
 








Congressinonal testimony revealed at least three other forms of abuses in connection with rollup transactions.
First, financially sound partnerships are merged with partnerships that are experiencing financial difficulty,
thereby diluting the interest of the limited partners of the sound partnerships.
 Second, some general partners have modified the original partnership's fee structure in order to give much larger
equity interests or fees to themselves, to the detriment of the limited partners.
 Finally, when the unattractive terms of the new rolled up security become apparent, the market further discounts
the newly traded security, pushing its price even lower. 







F. The Rollup Reform Act 




The seriousness of the problem with rollup disclosure documents was underscored by Commission Chairman Richard
Breeden when he stated in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in the Spring of 1991 that, ``I have taken a
look at some of the documents filed with us in these roll-up transactions and I would like to meet the person who can understand
all of the disclosures in some of those documents.'' The Committee notes that a disclosure document which the Chairman
of the Securities and Exchange Commission has difficulty understanding is likely to prove daunting in complexity
to the average small investor in a limited partnership.

As noted above, Section 3(a) of the Rollup Reform Act amended Section 15A(b) of the Exchange Act to require that the
NASD rules that promote just and equitable principles of trade include rules to prevent NASD members from participating
in any limited partnership rollup transaction that does not provide procedures to protect certain specified rights
of limited partners. Such rights include:




(A) The right of dissenting limited partners to:
(i) an appraisal and compensation;
(ii) retention of a security under substantially the same terms and conditions of the original issue;
(iii) approval of the limited partnership rollup transaction by at least 75 percent of the outstanding interests
of each participating limited partnership; or
(iv) other rights designed to protect dissenting limited partners;
(B) The right not to have their voting power unfairly reduced or abridged;
(C) The right not to bear an unfair portion of the costs of a proposed rollup transaction that is rejected; and
(D) Restrictions on the general partner's conversion of contingent interests or fees into non-contingent interests
or fees and restrictions on the general partner's receipt of a non-contingent equity interest in exchange for fees
for services which have not yet been provided.




The Rollup Reform Act defines a ``dissenting limited partner'' as a person who, on the date on which rollup soliciting
material is mailed to investors, holds a beneficial interest in a limited partnership that is the subject of a limited
partnership rullup transaction and who votes against the transaction and complies with procedures established
by the NASD to perfect dissenter's rights.
Section 3(c) of the Rollup Reform Act amended Section 15A(b) of the Exchange Act to require that the rules of a registered
securities association prohibit the authorization for quotation on an automated interdealer quotation system
sponsored by that association of any security designated by the Commission as a national market system security resulting
from a rollup transaction, unless such transaction provides certain rights for limited partners. The rights set
forth under this section are identical to those set forth in Section 3(a) for registered securities associations.


III. Description of Proposed Rule Change and Comments Received


The NASD's proposed rule change would prevent its members from participating in any ``limited partnership rollup
transaction'' as that term is defined in the Rollup Reform Act if the transaction does not provide those procedures
to protect the rights of limited partners that are mandated by the Rollup Reform Act. The proposed rule change also
would narrow the scope of transactions in which members are forbidden to receive differential compensation. Finally,
the proposed rule change would prohibit the authorization for quotation on Nasdaq of any security designated by the
Commission as a national market system security resulting from a rollup transaction, unless the transaction provides
certain rights for dissenting limited partners.


Proposed Rule Change to Article III, Section 34


A. Definitions


Subsequent to publication of notice of the proposed rule change, the NASD proposed to amend the definitions of ``dissenting
limited partner'' and ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' to be added to Subsection (b)(2)(B).

``

Dissenting Limited Partner

'' is defined in new Subsection (b)(2)(B)(iii), in accordance with the Rollup Reform Act, as a person who, on the date
on which rollup soliciting material is mailed to investors, is a holder of a beneficial interest in a limited partnership
that is the subject of a limited partnership rollup transaction and who votes against the transaction and complies
with procedures established by the NASD to assert dissenters' rights, except that for purposes of an exchange or tender
offer, a person must file an objection in writing with the party responsible for tabulating votes or tenders during
the period in which the offer is outstanding.

31







``

Limited Partnership Rollup Transaction

'' is defined in new Subsection (b)(2)(B)(vii), in accordance with the Rollup Reform Act, as a transaction involving
the combination or reorganization of limited partnerships, either directly or indirectly, where some or all investors
in the limited partnerships receive new securities or securities in another entity. The definition provides exceptions
for certain kinds of private transactions or other transactions which do not require the application of the protections
of the Exchange Act. In addition, the term ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' is defined to include the reorganization
of a single limited partnership, directly or indirectly, in which some or all investors receive new securities or
securities in another entity, if the transaction meets certain specified criteria in the Rollup Reform Act. The definition
covers both transactions in which securities received in single or multiple partnership rollups are received directly,
and transactions in which securities are received indirectly through a step transaction.

32









Exclusions 

The definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' also incorporates six exclusions, in accordance
with the Rollup Reform Act. A transaction will not be deemed to be a limited partnership rollup transaction of it: (1)
involves only a limited partnership or partnerships having an operating policy or practice of retaining cash available
for distribution and reinvesting proceeds from the sale, financing, or refinancing of assets in accordance with
such criteria as the Commission determines appropriate; (2) involves only limited partnerships wherein the interests
of the limited partners are repurchased, recalled, or exchanged in accordance with the terms of the preexisting limited
partnership agreements for securities in an operating company specifically identified at the time of the formation
of the original limited partnership; (3) involves only securities to be issued or exchanged that are not required
to be and are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''); (4) involves only issuers that
are not required to register or report under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, both before and after the transaction;
(5) involves the combination or reorganization of one or more limited partnerships in which a non-affiliated party
succeeds to the interests of a general partner or sponsor, except those types of transactions as the Commission may
by rule deem to fall within the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction,'' if: (a) such action is approved
by not less than 662/3 percent of the outstanding units of each of the participating limited partnerships; and (b)
as a result of the transaction, the existing general partners will receive only compensation to which they are entitled
as expressly provided for in the preexisting limited partnership agreements; or (6) involves a transaction, except
as the Commission may by rule deem to fall within the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction,'' in
which the securities offered to investors are securities of another entity that are reported under a transaction
reporting plan declared effective by the Commission under Section 11A of the Exchange Act before the date of enactment
of the Rollup Reform Act, if: (a) such other entity was formed, and such class of securities was reported and regularly
traded, not less than 12 months before the date on which soliciting material is mailed to investors; and (b) the securities
of that entity issued to investors in the transaction do not exceed 20 percent of the total outstanding securities
of the entity, exclusive of any securities of such class held by or for the account of the entity or a subsidiary of the
entity.



B. Participation in Rollups



The Commission is soliciting comment on the Differential Compensation Amendment. As noted above, the Differential
Compensation Amendment would amend Subsection (b)(6) to: (i) limit the scope of the prohibition upon receipt of differential
compensation to transactions constituting ``limited partnership rollup transactions'' instead of transactions
constituting ``rollups of direct participation programs'';

33

 and (ii) prohibit the participation of members and persons associated with members in a limited partnership rollup
transaction unless the transaction includes provisions designed to protect the rights of limited partners.

1. 

Receipt of Differential Compensation in DPP Rollups Not Also Constituting Limited Partnership Rollup Transactions.

 Congress began to focus on investor protection, fairness and disclosure issues related to rollup transactions in
1990. One of the early abuses on which Congress focussed was payment of compensation to soliciting broker-dealer
only when an investor voted in favor of a rollup transaction. The Rollup Reform Act requires the NASD to adopt rules
proscribing the receipt by members of ``differential compensation'' when soliciting votes for a limited partnership
rollup transaction. The Commission previously had approved an NASD rule regulating its members' receipt of differential
compensation in DPP rollups.
 





Current Subsections (b)(6) (A) and (B) were adopted in that rule change to regulate the participation of members in
the solicitation of votes or tenders from participants in a rollup of a DPP. The NASD stated in Amendment No. 7 that at
the time of its adoption, the SEC and NASD were aware that the definition of ``rollup of a direct participation program''
was broader than the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' then pending in Congress (and proposed
to be amended in this proposed rule change) because it applies to ``direct participation programs'' rather than ``limited
partnerships'' and does not include all of the exclusions that are available from the ``limited partnership rollup''
definition.
 









The NASD continues to be concerned that it may be confusing to have two definitions of a rollup transaction which are
different in scope set forth in Subsection 34(b).
 Therefore, the NASD is proposing to amend Subsections (b)(6) (A) and (B) by replacing the special rollup definition
in those Subsections with the new definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' and by substituting
the term ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' wherever the term ``rollup of a direct participation program''
currently appears. The NASD notes that the result of this amendment would be to limit the scope of these Subsections
as they would not longer be applicable to almost any DPP rollup, but only to ``limited partnership rollup transactions''
as defined in the proposed rule change. 





The Commission notes that its rules governing roll-up transactions
 apply to transactions that involve the combination or reorganization of one of more finite-life limited partnerships
or similar entities. The Commission is soliciting comment from interested persons concerning the potential impact
of the Differential Compensation Amendment on the investing public.

2. When a Limited Partnership Rollup Transaction is Presumed Not to be Unfair or Unreasonable. 

Pursuant to new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i), the NASD proposes to define a series of circumstances with respect to limited
partnership rollup transactions which are presumed not to be unfair or unreasonable. In accordance with the Rollup
Reform Act, it is presumed not to be unfair or unreasonable if dissenting limited partners are offered one of the following:
an appraisal and compensation, retention of a security with substantially the same terms and conditions as the original
limited partnership, approval of the rollup transaction by not less than 75 percent of the outstanding units of each
participating limited partnership, or other comparable rights designed to protect dissenting limited partners.
Protections for limited partners also include the right of limited partners not to have their voting power unfairly
reduced, the right of limited partners not to bear unfair costs associated with a rollup transaction that is rejected,
and certain restrictions on abusive changes in management fees and compensation. As noted above, dissenters' rights
may be asserted only by a person who, on the date that rollup soliciting material is mailed to investors, is a holder
of a beneficial interest in the limited partnership that is the subject of the rollup. The proposed rule change would
require a transaction constituting a ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' to include one of the provisions
set forth in Subsections (b)(6)(C)(i) a., b., or c., discussed below.


a. Compensation Based on Appraisal: 

New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)a. provides that dissenting limited partners must receive compensation based on an
appraisal made by an independent appraiser, unaffiliated with the sponsor or general partner of the program. The
appraisal provided should consist of an accurate measure of the present financial value of the dissenting investor's
ownership interest in the underlying assets of the limited partnership.
Forms of compensation based on appraisal may include cash, secured or unsecured debt instruments, or freely-tradable
securities. Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i) imposes several conditions upon the issuance of debt instruments to ensure
that the debt issued is equivalent in value to the cash payment and, if readily marketable, would likely trade in an
aftermarket at such value.
 This is intended to prevent dissenting investors from being forced to accept debt instruments which, reflecting
their below-market value, would immediately trade at a substantial discount.




Freely-tradable securities may be utilized as compensation only if issued by a company which has been listed on a national
securities exchange or traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market prior to the transaction. The number of freely-tradable
securities offered in return for partnership interests would be determined in relation to the average last sale price
of the securities in the 20-day period following the date of the meeting at which the vote on the rollup occurs.
 If the issuer of the freely-tradable securities and the sponsor or general partner are affiliated (

i.e.,

 if it receives any material compensation from the issuer or its affiliates in conjunction with the rollup transaction
or the purchase of the general partner's interest), and the securities issued as compensation are new securities,
such securities must not represent more than 20% of the issued and outstanding securities of that class after issuance.
The 20% limitation on the amount of securities offered as compensation by an affiliate helps to establish a threshold
below which significant dilution could be presumed not to have not occurred.






b. Receipt of a Security With Substantially the Same Terms and Conditions: 

New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)b. provides that dissenting limited partners may receive or retain a security with substantially
the same terms and conditions as the original issue if certain conditions are met. Retention of a security under the
same terms and conditions as the original issue means the provision of a security that has the same characteristics
as the dissenting limited partners' original limited partnership interest.


c. Comparable Rights: Supermajority Approval, Review by Independent Committee, and Other Comparable Rights: 

New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)c. permits members and persons associated with members to participate in a limited partnership
rollup transaction as long as the transaction includes ``other comparable rights'' provisions designed to protect
the rights of limited partners. This Subsection is intended to provide flexibility for sponsors and general partners
in structuring rollups, while at the same time providing protections for limited partners. ``Comparable rights''
may include the right to supermajority approval of the transaction, the right to review of the transaction by an independent
committee, or such other rights as the NASD deems comparable.


(i) Supermajority Approval.

 General partners will not be required to provide the right of compensation, as provided in new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)
where at least 75% of the outstanding units of each of the individual limited partnerships participating approve
the rollup transaction. Any limited partnership that fails to reach the 75% threshold must be excluded from the rollup
transaction. The proposed rule change, however, would permit a limited partnership rollup transaction to be consummated
even though individual partnerships did not approve the transaction.


(ii) Review by Independent Committee.

 The proposed rule change relating to review by an independent committee will require that the committee: (1) Be approved
by a majority of the outstanding securities of each participating limited partnership; (2) have access to the books
and records of the partnership; (3) prepare a report to the limited partners that are the subject of the rollup presenting
its findings and recommendations, including any minority views; (4) have the authority to negotiate the proposed
transaction with the general partner or sponsor on behalf of the limited partners, but not the authority to approve
the transaction; (5) deliberate for a period no longer than 60 days unless unanimously agreed upon by the members of
the independent committee or if approved by the NASD; (6) may be compensated and reimbursed by the partnerships subject
to the limited partnership rollup transaction and have the ability to retain independent counsel and financial advisors
to represent all limited partners at the limited partnerships' expense; and (7) be entitled to indemnification to
the maximum extent permitted by law from the general partners, sponsors, limited partnerships, and rolled-up entities
against claims, causes of action or lawsuits initiated by any party in interest, including limited partnerships
or limited partners, related to any action or decision made in furtherance of their responsibilities.


(iii) Other Comparable Rights.

 Comparable rights for dissenting limited partners are not limited to supermajority approval or the establishment
of an independent committee, but may include any other comparable right proposed by general partners or sponsors,
provided that the general partners or sponsors demonstrate to the satisfaction of the NASD, or if the NASD determines
appropriate, to the satisfaction of an independent committee, that the rights proposed are comparable.







3. When a Rollup Transaction is Presumed to be Unfair or Unreasonable.

 Regardless of compliance with Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i), a limited partnership rollup transaction will be presumed
to be unfair or unreasonable, pursuant to new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)
 if: (1) Certain actions taken by the general partner result in the unfair conversion and valuation of general partner
interests in a limited partnership rollup transaction; (2) a limited partnership rollup transaction fails to protect
the voting rights of the limited partners; (3) the transaction costs of a rejected limited partnership rollup transaction
are unfairly apportioned or allocated; or (4) the payment of fees to general partners in connection with limited partnership
rollup transactions are unfair, unreasonable, or inappropriate.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



a. Actions Taken By the General Partner: 

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)a. provides that it presumptively unfair and unreasonable for general partners, when
determining their interest in the new entity resulting from a limited partnership rollup transaction, to: (1) convert
an equity interest for which consideration has not been paid into a voting interest in the new entity if the equity interest
was not otherwise provided for in the limited partnership agreement and disclosed to limited partners; (2) fail to
follow the valuation methods, if any, in the partnership agreements when valuing their partnership interests;

43

 or (3) utilize a projected value of their equity interest rather than the appraised current value of their equity interest
when determining their interest in the new entity. 







b. Voting Rights: 

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b. contains four provisions for the protection of investors with respect to voting rights.
New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.1. provides that it is presumptively unfair if the voting rights in the entity resulting
from the limited partnerships rollup transaction do not follow the original voting rights of the limited partnerships
participating in the transaction. However, the NASD recognizes that certain material changes to voting rights may
be necessary to conform disparate rights that may exist among participating partnerships. Material changes may
be effected only if the NASD determines that the changes are not unfair or if an independent committee approves such
changes.

44

 





New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.2. provides that it is presumptively unfair if a majority

45

 of the interests in an entity resulting from a limited partnership rollup transaction is unable to vote to cause the
entity to take certain actions which are ordinarily the prerogative of the owners rather than management. Thus, it
is presumptively unfair not to permit a vote to amend the limited partnership agreement, articles of incorporation,
bylaws, or indenture. It is also presumptively unfair not to permit a vote to dissolve the entity. It is also presumptively
unfair not to permit a vote to remove and elect the general partners, board of directors, trustee, or similar governing
entity. Finally, it is presumptively unfair not to permit a vote to approve or disapprove the sale of substantially
all the assets of the entity, without concurrence by the sponsor, general partner(s), board of directors, trustee,
or similar governing entity, unless such actions would be inconsistent with state law.

46

 






New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.3. provides that it is presumptively unfair if the sponsor or general partner proposing
a limited partnership rollup transaction is not required to provide a document which clearly delineates instructions
and procedures of voting against or dissenting from a proposed transaction. 

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.4. provides that it is presumptively unfair if the general partner or sponsor fails
to utilize an independent third party to receive and tabulate all votes and dissents or fails to require the third party
to make the tabulation available to the general partner and any limited partner upon request at any time during and
after voting occurs. 



c. Transaction Costs: 

Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)c. provides that it is presumptively unfair if transaction costs of a rejected limited partnership
rollup transaction are not apportioned between the general and limited partners in accordance with the final vote
as follows: (1) in the case of a limited partnership rollup transaction which is not approved, the general partner
or sponsor bears transaction costs in proportion to the total number of abstentions and votes to reject the transaction,
and the limited partners bear transaction costs in proportion to the number of votes to approve the transaction; or
(2) in the case of a rollup transaction which is approved, but where some individual partnerships do not approve and
are not included in the approved transaction, the general partner is required to pay costs on behalf of the limited
partnerships who have voted not to approve the transaction. 

With respect to allocating total costs for a rejected limited partnership rollup transaction, the NASD believes
that subsections (b)(6(B) and (b)(6(C)(ii)d. taken together require the general partner to pay all the solicitation
expenses in addition to transaction costs in proportion to the total number of abstentions and votes to reject the
transaction. Additionally, limited partnerships which vote to reject and which are not included in a limited partnership
rollup transaction which is ultimately consummated, may not be assessed any transaction costs. 



d. Fees of the General Partners: 

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d. protects limited partners against the assessment of fees by a general partner which
are unfair, unreasonable, or inappropriate. New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d.1. provides that it is presumptively
unfair for general partners to receive or convert unearned management fees discounted to a present value while also
proposing to receive new asset-based fees. A similar presumption of unfairness applies if property management fees
and other fees are inappropriate, unreasonable, greater than or not competitive with the fees that would be paid to
third parties for performing similar services under proposed Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d.2. Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d.3.
provides that substantial and adverse changes in fees are presumed unreasonable if not submitted to and approved
by an independent committee.

The NASD is proposing to amend Part I and III to Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws to establish listing standards for Nasdaq/NM
securities resulting from a limited partnership rollup transaction, as required by new Section 15A(b)(13) of the
Exchange Act. The rule language is the same as that proposed for inclusion in Subsection (b) of Article III, Section
34 of the Rules of Fair Practice with two minor exceptions. When the term ``direct participation program'' is used
in the definition section, a cross-reference is provided to the definition of that term in Article III, Section 34
of the Rules of Fair Practice. In addition, the term ``management fee'' is modified to refer only to such fees related
to a ``limited partnership.'' In comparison, the definition in Article III, Section 34(b) of the Rules of Fair Practice
substituted the term ``direct participation program'' because the term ``management fee'' is used elsewhere in
Article III, Section 34(b) of the Rules of Fair Practice and the definition, therefore, should be applicable to any

Application of Proposed Rule Change to UPREITs



UPREIT transactions have certain general characteristics. A limited partnership or partnerships are consolidated
into an operating limited partnership. The consolidation is generally conducted as a private placement. In order
to effect a non-taxable exchange, the individual limited partnership interests or the properties are exchanged
for the operating limited partnership units.
 The general partner of the operating limited partnership, a real estate investment trust (``REIT''), issues beneficial
interests to investors in exchange for cash to raise capital that will purchase some of the operating partnership
units. The operating partnership, in turn, may use the proceeds to pay the debts of the limited partnerships included
in the operating partnership. It may use the proceeds for other purposes, such as buying additional properties. The
REIT shares may be listed on a national securities exchange or Nasdaq/NM and, thus, reported under a transaction reporting
plan. As part of the transaction, the unitholders of the new operating partnership are generally given an open-ended
option after one year to redeem their operating partnership units for cash from the REIT. Instead of offering cash,
the typical REIT may, at its option, offer unitholders REIT units for the operating partnership units pursuant to
a private exchange offering or a registered exchange offering, depending on how the offering is structured. It is,
however, optional to the operating partnership unitholders as to whether to exercise the redemption right.





A. UPREIT Structures



UPREIT transactions have varying structures. The NASD is currently aware of at least three structures. First, UPREITs
can be structured so that both the consolidation of limited partnership interests into the operating partnership
and the issuance of REIT shares to investors are effected pursuant to 

bona fide 

private placement exemptions under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act (``private placement exemption''), after
which the operating partnership units may be redeemed for cash or, at the REIT's option, exchanged for REIT shares
in a private exchange offering.

A second structure involves the consolidation of limited partners' interests into the operating limited partnership
in a registered transaction, with a simultaneous public offering of REIT units. The REIT shares are listed on a national
securities exchange or authorized for quotation on Nasdaq/NM and are reported under a transaction reporting plan.
The offer by the REIT to the limited partners in the operating partnership to exchange their operating partnership
units for REIT shares is effected as a registered exchange offer.

A third structure involves the consolidation of limited partners' interests into the operating limited partnership
pursuant to a 

bona fide 

private placement exemption, along with a public offering of units by the REIT general partner. The REIT is listed
on a national securities exchange or Nasdaq/NM. The REIT is thus a reporting company prior to any exchange offer of
REIT shares for operating partnership units. The offer by the REIT to the limited partners in the operating partnership
to exchange their operating partnership units for REIT shares is effected as a separate 

bona fide 

private placement with the shares then registered by the REIT for the benefit of new holders through a shelf-registration
statement or as a registered exchange offer.



B. Applicability of the Proposed Rule Change to UPREIT Transactions



As a result of an understanding reached between the staffs of the NASD and the SEC, the NASD's Corporate Financing Department
intends to work closely with the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance to review all direct, indirect and multi-step
limited partnership rollup transactions in their entirety, including UPREIT transactions, for an initial determination
of whether a transaction constitutes a ``limited partnership rollup transaction.''

The NASD believes that the first type of UPREIT transaction described above 

is not

 

 subject to the proposed rule change where the claim of a private placement exemption for the exchange offer is 

bona fide. 

Such a transaction does not meet the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' because the original
limited partners are receiving securities in the operating partnership that are not required to be registered under
the Securities Act. 

The NASD believes that the second type of UPREIT transaction described above 

is 

subject to the coverage of the proposed rule change because the transaction viewed in its entirety meets the definition
of ``limited partnership rollup transaction'' and does not qualify for any of the exemptions from the definition.

Regarding the third type of UPREIT transaction described above, the NASD will conduct its review of applicability
of the proposed rule change in conjunction with the SEC's review for an initial determination of whether the entire
transaction should be reviewed as a roll-up because it is a step transaction that indirectly involves a roll-up.
 In the case of a valid private placement of operating partnership units followed by a registered exchange of units
for REIT shares in a short period of time, the two transactions may be stepped together and therefore subject to full
review under the proposed rule change. Another situation where the proposed rule change might be applicable to the
third type of UPREIT transaction is if the claim of a private placement for the consolidation into the operating partnership
is not 

bona fide 

and the operating partnership transaction is required to be registered with the Commission and conducted as a public
offering at the same time that the public REIT offering occurs. In this instance also, the NASD would review the transaction
for compliance with the terms of the proposed rule change.





Comments Received on Proposed Rule Change



The Commission received seven comment letters. The comment letters from the IPA, DeMott, and the ABA expressed support
for the proposed rule change. One comment letter, from Kelley, stated that the NASD rules should not be adopted ``in
the absence of a legislative mandate.'' The comment letters from Baker & Botts, Kutak Rock, and Hogan & Hartson
neither supported nor opposed the proposed rules but offered suggestions on how to enhance the NASD's rule.

<PARENT> FR940822-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


As noted above, Congress passed the Rollup Reform Act subsequent to the receipt of the comment letters. The Rollup
Reform Act rendered moot many of the issues raised by commenters. The significant issues that were raised and not subsequently
mooted by the Rollup Reform Act are addressed below. In addition, the NASD also made several technical amendments
in response to the comment letters.







A. Right of Compensation Based on Appraisals





Kelly noted that some partnerships, 

e.g.

 oil and gas, already include requirements for a supporting appraisal underlying the exchange value determination.
Therefore, according to Kelley, the NASD's requirement that dissenters' rights of compensation be based on appraisal,
would give the dissenters the right to a second appraisal which would be ``redundant and wasteful.''



The NASD has stated that ``an appraisal that functions to determine the transaction's exchange value could also be
used to determine the value of dissenters's compensation so long as the appraisal is done in a manner consistent with
the appropriate industry practice.''



Hogan & Hartson argues that the appraisal rights provisions under new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i) should be clarified
to permit one partnership participating in a rollup to offer one type of right while another partnership may offer
another type of right, stating that such an option would be satisfactory from a fairness perspective.



New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i) does not by its terms prohibit structuring a rollup offering such that different rights
may be offered to different partnerships involved in the same transaction. Further, the ``other comparable rights''
provision in Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)c.3. allows for variations in structuring that, subject to NASD approval,
are indeed comparable to rights provided in the proposed rule change, including variations in form as well as substance.



B. Compensation of Dissenters





Two commentators
 expressed concern about the use of ``freely-tradable securities'' as compensation for dissenting limited partners,
pursuant to new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)a.







The use of a ``freely-tradable security'' as compensation is reasonable. The listing standards of the exchanges
and of Nasdaq should provide adequate protection against dilution when ``freely-tradable securities'' are offered
as compensation.



One the issue of valuation of the ``freely-tradable securities,'' the ABA voiced concern about the method that the
NASD will use to calculate the value of the securities that will be used as compensation. New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)
provides that the value of the freely-tradable security must be determined in relation to the last sale price ``in
the 20-day period following the effective date.'' The ABA noted that the ``effective date'' must refer to the effective
date of the registration statement rather than to the closing of the rollup occurs.''








C. Valuation Provisions





Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.2. provides that a rollup is presumed to be unfair if the general partner fails to follow
the valuation provision in the limited partnership agreement. The ABA pointed out that partnership agreements do
not contain such valuation provisions, and suggested revised language to accommodate such a contingency and permit
reliance on ``more favorable'' valuation provisions than those in limited partnership agreements ``if any.''



The NASD stated that it does not want to make determinations as to whether a proposed valuation method is more favorable
than those contained in limited partnership agreements to which investors have previously agreed. However, the
NASD amended its rule to clarify that Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)b.1. applies to rollups which contain valuation provisions.



Hogan & Hartson argues that the valuation requirements in new Subsections (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.2. and 3. should be
clarified by explanations of how valuation provisions of limited partnership agreements and utilization of current
value methodology can be both followed in the event of inconsistency, and requests that the NASD explain the meaning
of the terms ``current value'' and ``future value'' in new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.3.



The NASD believes that the use of a ``current value'' for evaluating equity interests of the roll-up partnerships
when determining the general partner's/sponsor's interest in the new entity is fair because the guesswork involved
in arriving at any ``future value'' estimate may prejudice the limited partners in favor of the general partners,
especially if the estimated value is exaggerated. However, the NASD also believes that the valuation of partnership
interests should be appropriate to the particular industry, and that is permissible, for example, to interpret ``current
value'' on a ``going concern'' or ``liquidation'' basis.



With regard to Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.2., the NASD generally believes that the fairest valuation method of all
is that method which reflects, as much as possible, the original agreement or contract between the general partner/sponsor
and limited partners. However, the NASD believes that if the valuation provisions of the existing partnership agreements
require a future valuation of general partner interests which would be inconsistent with the proposed rule change's
requirement that current value be used, then the requirement to use current value supersedes the requirement to follow
valuation models in the original partnership agreements.




D. Voting Rights





When the proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 the Commission specifically sought comment on any potential conflicts between the NASD's proposal and state contract
or corporate law. The Commission received four comment letters concerning a conflict between the voting rights provision
of proposed Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)b.2. and state corporate law.
 The NASD amended its rule to make it clear that it would not conflict with or supersede state corporate law. In response
to the Commission's concerns and the comment letters received, the NASD amended its rule to make it clear that the rule
would not conflict with or preempt state corporate law.









Hogan & Hartson argued that the Rollup Reform Act did not mandate that the NASD impose specific voting rights,
especially for the operating partnership in UPREITs, because very few partnership agreements provide for such rights
in any case.



The Commission believes that the proposed rule change does not impose specific voting rights. First, as noted above,
the rule is drafted in a manner that defers to applicable state law. Second, if the NASD staff determines that a particular
voting arrangement is presumptively unfair or unreasonable, the member may nonetheless rebut the presumption if
it demonstrates that the arrangement is not unfair or unreasonable or that the arrangement does not come within one
of the enumerated unfair and unreasonable arrangement provisions.




E. Transaction Costs





New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)c. requires that transaction costs be apportioned according to voting so that, in a
rejected rollup transaction, the general partner bears the costs of the transaction in proportion to the total number
of rejections and abstentions. the IPA suggested that it was inappropriate to require the general partner to bear
the cost of a rejected rollup transaction in proportion to abstentions.








The Commission disagrees. In proposing Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)c., the NASD stated that it intended to ``encourage
general partners to structure a fair transaction that will be approved by limited partners.'' By placing the transaction
costs of a rejected rollup on the general partner or the sponsor, the NASD is imposing the appropriate burden on the
general partner or sponsor to structure a rollup in a manner intended to secure as many favorable votes as possible.




F. Fees to the General Partner





New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)d. sets forth criteria to use in determining whether fees paid to the general partner
in a rollup are presumptively unfair. Subsection (b)(6)(C)(iv)3. provides that changes in fees which are substantial
and adverse to limited partners are presumed unreasonable if not submitted to or approved by an independent party.
In order to simplify compliance with the terms of Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)(4)(C), the IPA suggested that the NASD,
in addition to an independent committee, be permitted to approve changes in fees which are substantial and adverse
to limited partners.



In its response to this comment the NASD stated that it is not appropriate for the NASD to make a determination to approve
fees that are substantial or adverse to the limited partners.




G. UPREITs

Hogan & Hartson argues that UPREIT transactions do not trigger the application of the proposed rule change because
such transactions either do not come under the definition of ``limited partnership rollup transaction,'' or, conceding
the application of the definition, meet the requirements of one or more transactional exemptions from the definition.
Hogan & Hartson concludes that the only part of the entire UPREIT transaction under consideration is the potential
redemption/exchange of operating units for cash or REIT shares, not the initial consolidation of individual partnership
interests into operating partnership units, nor the initial consolidation in conjunction with the redemption/exchange.
Hogan & Hartson argues that the initial consolidation of limited partnership interests into an operating partnership
that does not have its shares traded on an exchange or authorized for quotation on Nasdaq/NM does not come within the
definition of a limited partnership rollup transaction and, thus, falls outside the purview of the proposed rule
change.
The Commission disagrees. UPREIT transactions should not be viewed in discrete stages, as if each stage in the transaction
were isolated from any other stage, with no contemplated interrelationship between the partners, promoters, investors
and financing plans of the partnership consolidation stage and the partners, promoters, investors and financing
plans of the exchange offering stage.


V. Discussion


The Commission finds good cause for partially approving Amendments 5-8 on an accelerated basis.
 As indicated above, the Commission recognizes that the rule change will provide important benefits to investors
who may be subject to limited partnership rollup transactions in that the amended proposed rule change will ensure
that investors' rights are protected in accordance with the intent of Congress as embodied in the Rollup Reform Act.
In addition, the Commission finds that notice in advance of approval of those Amendments intended to conform the proposed
rule change with the Rollup Reform Act is unnecessary because the Rollup Reform Act itself has given interested parties
constructive notice of pertinent terms of the Amendments. The Commission also finds that, except as noted above,
those amendments to the proposed rule change not intended to conform the proposed rule change with the Rollup Reform
Act are intended merely to clarify the rule change. The NASD will implement the rule change on November 1, 1994. The
Commission believes that accelerated approval will avoid unnecessary delay in requiring members to ensure that
they participate in limited partnership rollup transactions only if those transactions provide for fair treatment
of limited partnership investors, protect the rights of all limited partners, including dissenting limited partners,
and do not contain unfair or unreasonable terms. 




The Commission finds that, with the exception of the Differential Compensation Amendment, the proposed rule change
is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6)
 of the Exchange Act, which require, in pertinent part, that the rules of a registered securities association be designed
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, promote just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors
and the public interest; the provisions of Section 15A(b)(12)
 of the Exchange Act, which require the rules of a registered securities association to promote just and equitable
principles of trade include rules to prevent members of the association from participating in any limited partnership
rollup transaction that does not provide procedures to protect certain specified rights of limited partners; and
the provisions of Section 15A(b)(13)
 of the Exchange Act, which require that the rules of a registered securities association prohibit the authorization
for quotation on an automated interdealer quotation system sponsored by the association any security designated
by the SEC as a national market system security resulting from a limited partnership rollup transaction, unless such
transaction provides certain rights for limited partners. The proposed rule change will restrict member participation
in unfair rollup transactions and prohibit inclusion in Nasdaq/NM of any securities resulting from an unfair rollup
transaction.






The Rollup Reform Act reflects a brief that partnership rollup transactions, when properly structured, may offer
significant benefits to investors and for businesses that have used these structures to raise capital. However,
Congress has determined that abusive limited partnership rollup transactions harm investors, undermine investor
confidence and threaten capital formation.
 The proposed rule change will permit rollups to take place but will curtail the abusive practices that have occurred
in the past. The proposed rule change is designed to ensure the fairness of partnership rollup to the limited partners
by giving dissenters the right to compensation, based on appraisal, rather than being forced into a rollup. In addition
the proposed rule change contains provisions which prevent the unfair conversion and valuation of the general partner's
interests in a rollup transaction, prevent investors' voting rights from being unfairly reduced or abridged, prevent
the limited partners from having to bear an unfair portion of the cost of a transaction that has been rejected, and prevent
the payment of fees to general partners in connection with a rollup that are unfair, unreasonable, or inappropriate.




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 5-8.
Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection an copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to SR-NASD-93-03 and should be submitted by September
12, 1994.


It Is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
 of the Exchange Act, that the proposed rule change SR-NASD-93-3 be, and hereby is approved, except
with respect to that portion of Amendment No. 7 that proposes amendments to Subsections (b)(6)(A) and (b)(6)(B) of
Article III, Section 34 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation,
pursuant to delegated authority.

<USDEPT>STATE JUSTICE INSTITUTE </USDEPT>




Grant Guideline 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 State Justice Institute. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed grant guideline.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Guideline sets forth the proposed administrative, programmatic, and financial requirements attendant to
Fiscal Year 1995 State Justice Institute grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the State Justice Institute Act of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 10701, et seq., as amended, the Institute is authorized
to award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to State and local courts, nonprofit organizations, and
others for the purpose of improving the administration of justice in the State courts of the United States. Approximately
$111/2 million is available for award in FY 1995. 



Types of Grants Available and Funding Schedules 



The SJI grant program is designed to be responsive to the most pressing needs of the State courts. The Institute accordingly
offers six different types of grants, each of which responds to an important need of the State judiciaries. The types
of grants available in FY 1995 and the funding cycles for each program are provided below: 



Project Grants



These grants are awarded to support education, research, demonstration and technical assistance projects to improve
the administration of justice in the State courts. With limited exceptions (see sections II.B.2.b.i. and II.C.),
project grants are intended to support innovative projects of national significance. As provided in chapter V. of
the Guideline, project grants, with limited exceptions, may not exceed $200,000 a year. Applicants must ordinarily
submit a concept paper (see chapter VI.) and an application (see chapter VII.) in order to obtain a project grant. 

As indicated in section VI.C., the Board may make an ``accelerated'' project grant of less than $40,000 on the basis
of the concept paper alone when the need for the project is clear and little additional information would be provided
in an application. 

The FY 1995 mailing deadline for project grant concept papers is November 23, 1994. Papers must be postmarked or bear
other evidence of submission by that date. With two exceptions noted immediately below, the FY 1995 funding cycle
will be substantially similar to the FY 1994 cycle: the Board will meet in early March, 1995 to invite formal applications
based on the most promising concept papers; applications will be due in May; and awards will be approved by the Board
in July. 

The first exception to this schedule pertains to proposals to follow up on the National Conference on Mass Tort Litigation
to be in November, 1994. Applicants interested in participating in this special round of funding may submit concept
papers proposing projects addressing the findings and recommendations of that conference by March 10, 1995. The
papers will be considered by the Board at its meeting in April, 1995. Invited applications will be reviewed at the Board's
July, 1995 meeting. See section II.B.2.l. 

The second exception is for projects to follow up on the National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in
the Courts to be held March 2-5, 1995. Concept papers for projects to implement the State action plans developed
at the conference must be mailed by October 6, 1995.

Package Grants



This grant program permits applicants to submit one concept paper (or application) for a ``package'' of related grants
rather than separate proposals for each related component of the package. Package grants of up to $750,000 per year
may be awarded to support projects that address interrelated topics or the core elements of a multifaceted program,
or that require the services of all or some of the same key staff persons. Package grants must enhance (not merely maintain)
an applicant's services and must otherwise meet the Institute's grant criteria. The Board retains the discretion
to support all, none, or selected portions of the proposed package. Package grant concept papers and applications
will be considered on the same schedule as project grants. See sections III.J., V.C. and D., VI.A.2.b. and 3.b., VII.A.3.,
VII.C., and VII.D. for more information about package grants. 




Technical Assistance Grants



Under this program, a State or local court may receive a grant of up to $30,000 to engage outside experts to provide technical
assistance to diagnose, develop, and implement a response to a jurisdiction's problems. The Guideline allocates
up to $600,000 in FY 1995 funds to support technical assistance grants. 



Curriculum Adaptation Grants



A grant of up to $20,000 may be awarded to a State or local court to replicate or modify a model training program developed
with SJI funds. The Guideline allocates up to $350,000 for these grants in FY 1995, the same amount allocated in FY 1994.
See section II.B.2.b.i.(b). 

Like Technical Assistance grant applications, letters requesting Curriculum Adaptation grants may be submitted
at any time during the fiscal year. However, in order to permit the Institute sufficient time to evaluate these proposals,
letters must be submitted no later than 90 days before the projected date of the training program. See section II.B.2.b.i.(b).




Scholarships



The Guideline allocates up to $250,000 of FY 1995 funds for scholarships to enable judges and court managers to attend
out-of-State education and training programs. See section II.B.2.b.v. 

The Guideline establishes four deadlines for scholarship requests: November 1, 1994 for training programs beginning
between February 1, 1995 and April 30, 1995; February 1, 1995 for programs beginning between May 1, 1995 and July 31,
1995; May 1, 1995 for programs beginning between August 1, 1995 and October 31, 1995; and August 1, 1995 for programs
beginning between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1996. 

As in past years, the proposed Guideline provides that each scholarship application must be accompanied by a concurrence
signed by the chief justice of the applicant's State. The purpose of this requirement has been to assure that: the applicant's
participation in the program benefits the State; the applicant's absence to attend the program would not present
an undue hardship to the court; and receipt of a scholarship would not diminish the amount of funds made available by
the State for judicial education. Because this requirement has caused some confusion among applicants and there
are variations among States in the manner in which the concurrence request is considered, the Institute is particularly
interested in receiving comments regarding the benefits and drawbacks of continuing the concurrence requirement.




Renewal Grants



There are two types of renewal grants available from SJI: Continuation grants (see sections III.H., V.C. and D., and
IX.A.) and on-going support grants (see sections III.I., V.C. and D., and IX.B.). Continuation grants are 
intended to support limited duration projects that involve the same type of activities as the original project. On-going
support grants may be awarded for up to a three-year period to support national-scope projects that provide the State
courts with critically needed services, programs, or products. 

The Guideline establishes a target for renewal grants of no more than $3 million, a little more than 25% of the total
amount available for grants in FY 1995. See section IX. Grantees should accordingly be aware that the award of a grant
to support a project does not constitute a commitment to provide either continuation funding or on-going support.

<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An applicant for a continuation or on-going support grant must submit a letter notifying the Institute of its intent
to seek such funding, no later than 120 days before the end of the current grant period. The Institute will then notify
the applicant of the deadline for its renewal grant application. See section IX. 


Special Interest Categories 


The Guideline contains 12 Special Interest categories, i.e., those project areas that the Board has identified as
being of particular importance to the State courts. Four new categories have been added this year: ``Children and
Families in Court'' (section II.B.2.e.); ``Resolution of Current Evidentiary Issues'' (section II.B.2.g.); ``Eliminating
Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts'' (section II.B.2.i.); and ``Improving the Courts' Response to Gender-Related
Crimes of Violence'' (section II.B.2.k.). 
Five of FY 1994's Special Interest categories have been eliminated: ``Court Financing;'' ``Delay Reduction'' (although
section II.B.2.b.iv. of the 1995 Guideline solicits applications for a National Symposium on Reducing Litigation
Delay) (see also section II.B.2.d.); ``Intermediate Sanctions;'' ``Improving the Use of Juries'' (jury issues
are now addressed in the ``Enhancing Court-Community Relations'' Special Interest category (section II.B.2.a.);
and ``Family Violence and the Courts'' (although the issues addressed by that category are now addressed by new Special
Interest categories e. and k. noted above). 
The Guideline also solicits proposals to conduct two major national conferences: the National Symposium on Reducing
Litigation Delay noted above and a National Symposium on Sentencing Issues. See section II.B.2.b.iv. 


Consultant Rates 


The Institute is strongly committed to assuring that the compensation paid to consultants working under SJI grants
is reasonable in terms of both the total amount paid to an individual consultant, and the amount paid for individual
tasks. A recent internal review of consultant rates found that the number of consultants charging in excess of $300
a day has risen significantly in recent years. 
The Board of Directors is concerned about both the level of compensation paid consultants, and the increase in the
number of consultants receiving compensation under SJI-supported projects. Although no changes in the Grant Guideline
are required, the Institute will be undertaking changes in procedure (including Board participation in the review
process and more detailed reports from applicants and grantees) to assure that the compensation paid consultants
is commensurate with the nature and quality of the services to be performed; reasonable, in terms of the tasks performed
and in total; and consistent with the public service mission of the Institute.

Recommendations to Grant Writers 


Over the past seven years, Institute staff have reviewed approximately 2,700 concept papers and 1,300 applications.
On the basis of those reviews, inquiries from applicants, and the views of the Board, the Institute offers the following
recommendations to help potential applicants present workable, understandable proposals that can meet the funding
criteria set forth in this Guideline.
The Institute suggests that applicants make certain that they address the questions and issues set forth below when
preparing a concept paper or application. Concept papers and applications should, however, be presented in the formats
specified in sections VI. and VII. of the guideline, respectively. 
1. 

What is the subject or problem you wish to address?
Describe the subject or problem and how it affects the courts and the public. Discuss how your approach will improve
the situation or advance the state of the art or knowledge, and explain why it is the most appropriate approach to take.
When statistics or research findings are cited to support a statement or position, the source of the citation should
be referenced in a footnote or a reference list. 
2. What do you want to do? 

Explain the goal(s) of the project in simple, straightforward terms. The goals should describe the intended consequences
or expected overall effect of the proposed project (e.g., to enable judges to sentence drug-abusing offenders more
effectively, or to dispose of civil cases within 24 months), rather than the tasks or activities to be conducted (e.g.,
hold three training sessions, or install a new computer system). 
To the greatest extent possible, an applicant should avoid a specialized vocabulary that is not readily understood
by the general public. Technical jargon does not enhance a paper. 
3. 

How will you do it? 

Describe the methodology carefully so that what you propose to do and how you would do it are clear. All proposed tasks
should be set forth so that a reviewer can see a logical progression of tasks and relate those tasks directly to the accomplishment
of the project's goal(s). When in doubt about whether to provide a more detailed explanation or to assume a particular
level of knowledge or expertise on the part of the reviewers, err on the side of caution and provide the additional information.
A description of project tasks also will help identify necessary budget items. All staff positions and project costs
should relate directly to the tasks described. The Institute encourages applicants to attach letters of cooperation
and support from the courts and related agencies that will be involved in or directly affected by the proposed project.

4. 

How will you know it works? 

Include an evaluation component that will determine whether the proposed training, procedure, service, or technology
accomplished the objectives it was designed to meet. Concept papers and applications should describe the criteria
that will be used to evaluate the project's effectiveness and identify program elements which will require further
modification. The description in the application should include how the evaluation will be conducted, when it will
occur during the project period, who will conduct it, and what specific measures will be used. In most instances, the
evaluation should be conducted by persons not connected with the implementation of the procedure, training, service,
or technique, or the administration of the project. 
The Institute has also prepared a more thorough list of recommendations to grant writers regarding the development
of project evaluation plans. Those recommendations are available from the Institute upon request. 
5. 

How will others find out about it? 

Include a plan to disseminate the results of the training, research, or demonstration beyond the jurisdictions and
individuals directly affected by the project. The plan should identify the specific methods which will be used to
inform the field about the project, such as the publication of law review or journal articles, or the distribution
of key materials. A statement that a report or research findings ``will be made available to'' the field is not sufficient.
The specific means of distribution or dissemination as well as the types of recipients should be identified. Reproduction
and dissemination costs are allowable budget items. 
6. 

What are the specific costs involved? 

The budget in both concept papers and applications should be presented clearly. Major budget categories such as personnel,
benefits, travel, supplies, equipment, and indirect costs should be identified separately. The components of ``Other''
or ``Miscellaneous'' items should be specified in the application budget narrative, and should not include set-asides
for undefined contingencies. 
7. 

What, if any, match is being offered? 

Courts and other units of State and local government (not including publicly-supported institutions of higher education)
are required by the State Justice Institute Act to contribute a match (cash, non-cash, or both) of not less than 50 percent
of the grant funds requested from the Institute. All other applicants also are encouraged to provide a matching contribution
to assist in meeting the costs of a project. 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00101 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The match requirement works as follows: If, for example, the total cost of a project is anticipated to be $150,000,
a State or local court or executive branch agency may request up to $100,000 from the Institute to implement the project.
The remaining $50,000 (50% of the $100,000 requested from SJI) must be provided as match. 

Cash match includes funds directly contributed to the project by the applicant, or by other public or private sources.
It does not include income generated from tuition fees or the sale of project products. Non-cash match refers to in-kind
contributions by the applicant, or other public or private sources. This includes, for example, the monetary value
of time contributed by existing personnel or members of an advisory committee (but not the time spent by participants
in an educational program attending program sessions). When match is offered, the nature of the match (cash or in-kind)
should be explained and, at the application stage, the tasks and line items for which costs will be covered wholly or
in part by match should be specified. 

8. 

Which of the two budget forms should be used?

 Section VII.A.3. of the SJI Grant Guideline encourages use of the spreadsheet format of Form C1 if the funding request
exceeds $100,000. Form C1 also works well for projects with discrete tasks, regardless of the dollar value of the project.
Form C, the tabular format, is preferred for projects lacking a number of discrete tasks, or for projects requiring
less than $100,000 of Institute funding. Generally, use the form that best lends itself to representing most accurately
the budget estimates for the project. 

9. 

How much detail should be included in the budget narrative?

 The budget narrative of an application should provide the basis for computing all project-related costs, as indicated
in section VII.D. of the SJI Grant Guideline. To avoid common shortcomings of application budget narratives, include
the following information: 

 Personnel estimates that accurately provide the amount of time to be spent by personnel involved with the project
and the total associated costs, including current salaries for the designated personnel (e.g., Project Director,
50% for one year, annual salary of $50,000 = $25,000). If salary costs are computed using an hourly or daily rate, the
annual salary and number of hours or days in a work-year should be shown. 

 Estimates for supplies and expenses supported by a complete description of the supplies to be used, nature
and extent of printing to be done, anticipated telephone charges, and other common expenditures, with the basis for
computing the estimates included (e.g., 100 reports x 75 pages each x .05/page = $375.00). 
Supply and expense estimates offered simply as ``based on experience'' are not sufficient. 

In order to expedite Institute review of the budget, make a final comparison of the amounts listed in the budget narrative
with those listed on the budget form. In the rush to complete all parts of the application on time, there may be many last-minute
changes; unfortunately, when there are discrepancies between the budget narrative and the budget form or the amount
listed on the application cover sheet, it is not possible for the Institute to verify the amount of the request. A final
check of the numbers on the form against those in the narrative will preclude such confusion. The Institute will provide
an illustrative budget and budget form upon request. 

10. 

What travel regulations apply to the budget estimates?

 Transportation costs and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicant organization, and a copy of
the applicant's travel policy should be submitted as an appendix to the application. If the applicant does not have
a travel policy established in writing, then travel rates must be consistent with those established by the Institute
or the Federal Government (a copy of the Institute's travel policy is available upon request). The budget narrative
should state which regulations are in force for the project and should include the estimated fare, the number of persons
traveling, the number of trips to be taken, and the length of stay. The estimated costs of travel, lodging, ground transportation,
and other subsistence should be listed separately. When combined, the subtotals for these categories should equal
the estimate listed on the budget form. 

11. 

May grant funds be used to purchase equipment?

 Generally, grant funds may be used to purchase only the equipment that is necessary to demonstrate a new technological
application in a court, or that is otherwise essential to accomplishing the objectives of the project. Equipment
purchases to support basic court operations ordinarily will not be approved. The budget narrative must list the equipment
to be purchased and explain why the equipment is necessary to the success of the project. Written prior approval of
the Institute is required when the amount of computer hardware to be purchased or leased exceeds $10,000, or the software
to be purchased exceeds $3,000. 

12. 

To what extent may indirect costs be included in the budget estimates?

 It is the policy of the Institute that all costs should be budgeted directly; however, if an applicant has an indirect
cost rate that has been approved by a Federal agency within the last two years, an indirect cost recovery estimate may
be included in the budget. A copy of the approved rate agreement should be submitted as an appendix to the application.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00102 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If an applicant does not have an approved rate agreement, an indirect cost rate proposal should be prepared in accordance
with Section XI.H.4. of the Grant Guideline, based on the applicant's audited financial statements for the prior
fiscal year. (Applicants lacking an audit must budget all project costs directly.) If an indirect cost rate proposal
is to be submitted, the budget should reflect estimates based on that proposal. Obviously, this requires that the
proposal be completed at the time of application so that the appropriate estimates may be included; however, grantees
have until three months after the project start date to submit the indirect cost proposal to the Institute for approval.
An indirect cost rate worksheet on computer diskette is available from the Institute upon request. 

13. 

Does the budget truly reflect all costs required to complete the project?

 After preparing the program narrative portion of the application, applicants may find it helpful to list all the major
tasks or activities required by the proposed project, including the preparation of products, and note the individual
expenses, including personnel time, related to each. This will help to ensure that, for all tasks described in the
application (e.g., development of a videotape, research site visits, distribution of a final report), the related
costs appear in the budget and are explained correctly in the budget narrative. 



Recommendations To Grantees 



The Institute's staff works with grantees to help assure the smooth operation of the project and compliance with the
SJI Guidelines. On the basis of monitoring more than 800 grants, the Institute staff offers the following suggestions
to aid grantees in meeting the administrative and substantive requirements of their grants. 

1. 

After the grant has been awarded, when are the first quarterly reports due?

 Quarterly Progress Reports and Financial Status Reports must be submitted within 30 days after the end of every calendar
quarter_i.e. no later than January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30_regardless of the project's start date. The
reporting periods covered by each quarterly report end 30 days before the respective deadline for the report. When
an award period begins December 1, for example, the first Quarterly Progress Report describing project activities
between December 1 and December 31 will be due on January 30. A Financial Status Report should be submitted even if funds
have not been obligated or expended. 

By documenting what has happened over the past three months, Quarterly Progress Reports provide an opportunity for
project staff and Institute staff to resolve any questions before they become problems, and make any necessary changes
in the project time schedule, budget allocations, etc. Thus, the Quarterly Project Report should describe project
activities, their relationship to the approved timeline, and any problems encountered and how they were resolved,
and outline the tasks scheduled for the coming quarter. It is helpful to attach copies of relevant memos, draft products,
or other requested information. An original and one copy of a Quarterly Progress Report and attachments should be
submitted to the Institute. 

Additional Quarterly Progress Report or Financial Status Report forms may be obtained from the grantee's Program
Manager at SJI, or photocopies may be made from the supply received with the award. 


2. 

Do reporting requirements differ for renewal grants or package grants?

 Recipients of a continuation, on-going support, or package grant are required to submit quarterly progress and financial
status reports on the same schedule and with the same information as recipients of a grant for a single new project.


A continuation or an on-going support grant should be considered as a supplement to and extension of the original award,
and the reports numbered accordingly. For example, if the last quarterly report filed under the original award is
report number six, the first report including a portion of the renewal grant should be report number seven. 

Recipients of a package grant should file a summary Financial Status Report covering the entire package as well as
separate financial reports for each of the projects in the package, identified by letter of the alphabet (e.g., SJI-93-15R-J-001-A;
SJI-93-15R-J-001-B; SJI-93-15R-J-001-C). 

3. 

What information about project activities should be communicated to SJI?

 In general, grantees should provide prior notice of critical project events such as advisory board meetings or training
sessions so that the Institute Program Manager can attend if possible. If methodological, schedule, staff, budget
allocations, or other significant changes become necessary, the grantee should contact the Institute's program
monitor prior to implementing any of these changes, so that possible questions may be addressed in advance. Questions
concerning the financial requirements section of the Guideline, quarterly financial reporting or payment requests,
should be addressed to the Chief or Deputy Chief of the Institute's Finance and Management Division. 

It is helpful to include the grant number assigned to the award on all correspondence to the Institute.

4. 

Why is it important to address the special conditions that are attached to the award document?

 In some instances, a list of special conditions is attached to the award document. The special conditions are imposed
to establish a schedule for reporting certain key information, to assure that the Institute has an opportunity to
offer suggestions at critical stages of the project, and to provide reminders of some, but not all of the requirements
contained in the Grant Guideline. Accordingly, it is important for grantees to check the special conditions carefully
and discuss with their Program Manager any questions or problems they may have with the conditions. Most concerns
about timing, response time, and the level of detail required can be resolved in advance through a telephone conversation.
The Institute's primary concern is to work with grantees to assure that their projects accomplish their objectives,
not to enforce rigid bureaucratic requirements. However, if a grantee fails to comply with a special condition or
with other grant requirements, the Institute may, after proper notice, suspend payment of grant funds or terminate
the grant. 

Sections X., XI., and XII. of the Grant Guideline contain the Institute's administrative and financial requirements.
Institute Finance and Management Division staff are always available to answer questions and provide assistance
regarding these provisions. 

5. 

What is a Grant Adjustment?

 A Grant Adjustment is the Institute's form for acknowledging the satisfaction of special conditions, or approving
changes in grant activities, schedule, staffing, sites, or budget allocations requested by the project director.
It also may be used to correct errors in grant documents, add small amounts to a grant award, or deobligate funds from
the grant. 

6. 

What schedule should be followed in submitting requests for reimbursements or advance payments?

 Requests for reimbursements or advance payments may be made at any time after the project start date and before the
end of the 90-day close-out period. However, the Institute follows the U.S. Treasury's policy limiting advances
to the minimum amount required to meet immediate cash needs. Given normal processing time, grantees should not seek
to draw down funds for periods greater than 30 days from the date of the request. 

7. 

Do procedures for submitting requests for reimbursement or advance payment differ for renewal grants or package
grants?

 The basic procedures are the same for any grant. A continuation or an on-going support grant should be considered as
a supplement to and extension of the original award, and the payment requests numbered accordingly. For example,
if the last payment request under the original award is number nine, then the first request for funds from the continuation
award should be number ten. 

Recipients of a package grant should file separate requests for each project in the package. For example, if there
are three projects within a package grant, a grantee should prepare three separate payment requests, each identified
by the letter of the alphabet designated in the award document (e.g., SJI-93-15R-J-001-A;
SJI-93-15R-J-001-B; SJI-93-15R-J-001-C). Subsequent
payment requests should be numbered consecutively for each project within the package (e.g., project SJI-93-15R-J-001-A
payment number 2; SJI-93-15R-J-001-B payment number 4; etc.). 

8. 

If things change during the grant period, can funds be reallocated from one budget category to another?

 The Institute recognizes that some flexibility is required in implementing a project design and budget. Thus, grantees
may shift funds among direct cost budget categories. When any one reallocation or the cumulative total of reallocations
are expected to exceed five percent of the approved project budget, a grantee must specify the proposed changes, explain
the reasons for the changes, and request Institute approval. 

The same standard applies to renewal grants and package grants. In addition, prior written Institute approval is
required to shift leftover funds from the original award to cover activities to be conducted under the renewal award,
or to use renewal grant monies to cover costs incurred during the original grant period. Prior written Institute approval
also is needed to shift funds between projects included in a package grant. 

9. 

What is the 90-day close-out period?

 Following the last day of the grant, a 90-day period is provided to allow for all grant-related bills to be received
and posted, and grant funds drawn down to cover these expenses. No obligations of grant funds may be incurred during
this period. The last day on which an expenditure of grant funds can be obligated is the end date of the grant period.
Similarly, the 90-day period is not intended as an opportunity to finish and disseminate grant products. This should
occur before the end of the grant period. 

Starting the day after the end of the award period, and during the following 90 days, all monies that have been obligated
should be expended. All payment requests must be received by the end of the 90-day ``close-out-period.'' Any unexpended
monies held by the grantee that remain after the 90-day follow-up period must be returned to the Institute. Any funds
remaining in the grant that have not been drawn down by the grantee will be deobligated. 

10. 

Are funds granted by SJI ``Federal'' funds?

 The State Justice Institute Act provides that, except for purposes unrelated to this question, ``the Institute shall
not be considered a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government.'' 42 U.S.C.  10704(c)(1).
Because SJI receives appropriations from Congress, some grantee auditors have reported SJI grants funds as ``Other
Federal Assistance.'' This classification is acceptable to SJI but is not required. 

11. 

If SJI is not a Federal Agency, do OMB circulars apply with respect to audits?

 Except to the extent that they are inconsistent with the express provisions of the SJI Grant Guideline, OMB Circulars
A-110, A-21, A-87, A-88, A-102, A-122, A-128 and A-133 are incorporated
into the Grant Guideline by reference. Because the Institute's enabling legislation specifically requires the
Institute to ``conduct, or require each recipient to provide for, an annual fiscal audit'' [see 42 U.S.C.  10711(c)(1)],
the Grant Guideline sets forth options for grantees to comply with this statutory requirement. (See Section XI.J.)


Prior to FY 1994, the Institute did not require grantees to comply with the audit-related provisions of OMB circulars
A-110, A-128, or A-133, but did require that grantees, lacking an audit report prepared for a Federal
agency, conduct an independent audit in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00104 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The current Guideline makes it clear that SJI will accept audits conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act
of 1984 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-128, or A-133, in satisfaction of the annual
fiscal audit requirement. Grantees who are required to undertake these audits in conjunction with Federal grants
may include SJI funds as part of the audit even if the receipt of SJI funds would not require such audits. This approach
gives grantees an option to fold SJI funds into the governmental audit rather than to undertake a separate audit to
satisfy SJI's Guideline requirements. 

The Institute requires that non-profit grantees perform an A-133 type of audit if they receive payments totalling
more than $50,000. These audits must be conducted in accordance with the Government Accounting Standards issued
by the Comptroller General of the United States and must include: 

a. An opinion on whether the financial statements of the grantee present fairly its financial position and the results
of its financial operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 

b. A report on the grantee's internal control structure over financial reporting; and 

c. A report on the tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations that have a direct and material effect on
the financial statement amounts. 

For grantees receiving SJI grant payments totalling $50,000 or less during their fiscal year, the annual fiscal audit
may be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. 

In sum, grantees that receive payments from the Institute of more than $50,000 in a fiscal year must have their annual
audit conducted in accordance with Government Accounting Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United
States rather than with generally accepted auditing standards. Grantees that receive $50,000 or less from SJI in
a fiscal year must also submit an annual audit to SJI, but they would have the option to conduct an audit of the entire
grantee organization in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards; include SJI funds in an audit of
Federal funds conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 and OMB Circular A-128 or A-133;
or conduct an audit of only the SJI funds in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. (See Guideline
Section XI.J.2.) 

12. 

Does SJI have a CFDA number?

 Auditors often request that a grantee provide the Institute's Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number
for guidance in conducting an audit in accordance with Government Accounting Standards. Because SJI is not a Federal
agency, it has not been issued such a number, and there are no additional compliance tests to satisfy under the Institute's
audit requirements beyond those of a standard governmental audit. 

Moreover, because SJI is not a Federal agency, SJI funds should not be aggregated with Federal funds to determine if
$50,000 or more in assistance was received in a fiscal year. For example, if in fiscal year 1994 grantee ``X'' received
$10,000 in Federal funds from a Department of Justice (DOJ) grant program and $20,000 in grant funds from SJI, the new
SJI requirements would not be triggered. The same distinction would preclude an auditor from considering the additional
SJI funds in determining what Federal requirements apply to the DOJ funds. 

Grantees who are required to satisfy either the Single Audit Act, OMB Circular A-128, or A-133, and who
include SJI grant funds in those audits, need to remember that because of its status as a private non-profit corporation,
SJI is not on routing lists of cognizant Federal agencies. Therefore, the grantee needs to submit a copy of the audit
report prepared for such a cognizant Federal agency directly to SJI. The Institute's audit requirements may be found
in Section XI.J.2. of the Grant Guideline.

Summary 


This Guideline sets forth the proposed programmatic, financial, and administrative requirements of grants, cooperative
agreements, and contracts awarded by the State Justice Institute. The Institute, a private, nonprofit corporation
established by an Act of Congress, is authorized to award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to improve
the administration and quality of justice in the State courts. 

Grants may be awarded to State and local courts and their agencies; national nonprofit organizations controlled
by, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branch of State governments; and national nonprofit
organizations for the education and training of judges and support personnel of the judicial branch of State governments.
The Institute may also award grants to other nonprofit organizations with expertise in judicial administration;
institutions of higher education; individuals, partnerships, firms, or corporations; and private agencies with
expertise in judicial administration if the objectives of the funded program can be better served by such an entity.
Funds may be awarded, as well, to Federal, State or local agencies and institutions other than courts for services
that cannot be provided adequately through nongovernmental arrangements. In addition, the Institute may provide
financial assistance in the form of interagency agreements with other grantors. 

The Institute will consider applications for funding support that address any of the areas specified in its enabling
legislation as amended. However, the Board of Directors of the Institute has designated certain program categories
as being of special interest. 

The Institute has established one round of competition for FY 1995 funds. The concept paper submission deadline for
all but two funding categories is November 23, 1994. Concept papers proposing projects that follow up on the November
1994 National Conference on the Management of Mass Tort Cases must be mailed by March 10, 1995. Concept papers to implement
the plans developed at the March 1995 National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts must be
mailed by October 6, 1995. 

It is anticipated that between $11 million and $11.5 million will be available for award. This Guideline applies to
all concept papers and applications submitted, as well as grants awarded in FY 1995. 

The awards made by the State Justice Institute are governed by the requirements of this Guideline and the authority
conferred by Pub. L. 98-620, Title II, 42 U.S.C. 10701, 

et seq

., as amended.

I. Background 


The State Justice Institute (``Institute'') was established by Pub. L. 98-620 to improve the administration
of justice in the State courts in the United States. Incorporated in the State of Virginia as a private, nonprofit corporation,
the Institute is charged, by statute, with the responsibility to: 
A. Direct a national program of financial assistance designed to assure that each citizen of the United States is provided
ready access to a fair and effective system of justice; 
B. Foster coordination and cooperation with the Federal judiciary; 
C. Promote recognition of the importance of the separation of powers doctrine to an independent judiciary; and 
D. Encourage education for judges and support personnel of State court systems through national and State organiza-tions,
including universities. 
To accomplish these broad objectives, the Institute is authorized to provide funds to State courts, national organiza-tions
which support and are supported by State courts, national judicial education organizations, and other organizations
that can assist in improving the quality of justice in the State courts. 
The Institute is supervised by an eleven-member Board of Directors appointed by the President, by and with the consent
of the Senate. The Board is statutorily composed of six judges, a State court administrator, and four members of the
public, no more than two of whom can be of the same political party. 
Through the award of grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements, the Institute is authorized to perform the following
activities: 
A. Support research, demonstrations, special projects, technical assistance, and training to improve the adminis-tration
of justice in the State courts; 
B. Provide for the preparation, publication, and dissemination of information regarding State judicial systems;

C. Participate in joint projects with Federal agencies and other private grantors;

State court proceedings. 
Funds will 

not

 be made available for the ordinary, routine operation of court systems or programs in any of these areas. 


B. Special Interest Program Categories 


1. General Description 


The Institute is interested in funding both innovative programs and programs of proven merit that can be replicated
in other jurisdictions. Although applications in any of the statutory program areas are eligible for funding in FY
1995, the Institute is especially interested in funding those projects that: 
a. Formulate new procedures and techniques, or creatively enhance existing arrangements to improve the courts;

b. Address aspects of the State judicial systems that are in special need of serious attention; 
c. Have national significance in terms of their impact or replicability in that they develop products, services and
techniques that may be used in other States; and 
d. Create and disseminate products that effectively transfer the information and ideas developed to relevant audiences
in State and local judicial systems or provide technical assistance to facilitate the adaptation of effective programs
and procedures in other State and local jurisdictions. 
A project will be identified as a ``Special Interest'' project if it meets the four criteria set forth above and (1)
it falls within the scope of the ``special interest'' program areas designated below, or (2) information coming to
the attention of the Institute from the State courts, their affiliated organizations, the research literature,
or other sources demonstrates that the project responds to another special need or interest of the State courts. 
Concept papers and applications which address a ``Special Interest'' category will be accorded a preference in the
rating process. (See the selection criteria listed in sections VI.B., ``Concept Paper Submission Requirements
for New Projects,'' and VIII.B., ``Application Review Procedures.'')

2. Specific Categories. 


The Board has designated the areas set forth below as ``Special Interest'' program categories. The order of listing
does not imply any ordering of priorities among the categories. 
a. 

Improving Public Confidence in the Courts. 

This category includes research, demonstration, evaluation and education projects designed to improve the public's
confidence in the State courts' ability to administer justice fairly, and to test innovative methods for eliminating
economic, racial, ethnic, cultural or gender-based barriers to justice. 
Applicants should be aware that the Institute is supporting two national conferences addressing issues on the relationship
between the courts and the communities they serve. The National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in
the Courts will be held March 2-5, 1995 in Albuquerque, New Mexico; the National Videoconference Town Hall Meeting
on Enhancing Public Confidence in the Courts is scheduled for June, 1995 at sites to be selected. (See also, section
II.B.2.i, infra.) 
The Institute is particularly interested in supporting innovative projects that examine, develop, and test methods
that trial or appellate courts may use to: 
 respond to the needs of the culturally, demographically, economically and physically diverse public the
courts serve; 
 address court-community problems resulting from the influx of legal and illegal immigrants, including projects
to define the impact of immigration on State courts; design and assess procedures for use in custody, visitation,
and other domestic relations cases when key family members or property are outside the United States; facilitate
communication with Federal authorities when illegal aliens are involved in State court proceedings; and develop
protocols to facilitate service of process, the enforcement of orders of judgment, and the disposition of criminal
and juvenile cases when a non-U.S. citizen or corporation is involved; 
 handle cases involving pro se litigants fairly and effectively; and

<TEXT>
 

 increase public understanding of jury decisions and the juror selection and service process; foster positive
attitudes toward jury service; and enhance the attractiveness of juror service through, e.g., incentives to participate,
modifications of terms of service, and/or juror orientation and education programs. 

Institute funds may not be used to directly or indirectly support legal representation of individuals in specific
cases. In addition, it is unlikely that the Institute will support development or testing of additional automated
kiosks such as those being used by the courts in Arizona, California, and Florida. 

Previous SJI-supported projects that address these issues include: evaluation of an experimental community court
in New York City; development of a manual for management of court interpretation services and materials for training
and assisting court interpreters; development of touchscreen computer systems, videotapes and written materials
to assist pro se litigants; a demonstration of the use of volunteers to monitor guardianships; studies of effective
and efficient methods of providing legal representation to indigent parties in criminal and family cases and the
applicability of various dispute resolution procedures to different cultural groups; guidelines for court-annexed
day care systems; and development of a manual for implementing innovations in jury selection, use, and management;
technical assistance and training to facilitate implementation of the Standards on Jury Management; development
of a guide for making juries accessible to persons with disabilities. 

b. 

Education and Training for Judges and Other Key Court Personnel. 

The Institute continues to be interested in supporting an array of projects to strengthen and broaden the availability
of court education programs at the State, regional, and national levels. Accordingly, this category is divided into
five subsections: (i) State Initiatives; (ii) National and Regional Education Programs; (iii) Judicial Education
Technical Assistance; (iv) Conferences; and (v) Scholarships. All Institute-supported conferences and education
and training seminars should be accessible to persons with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities
Act. 

i. 

State Initiatives. 

This category includes support for training projects developed or endorsed by a State's courts for the benefit of
judges and other court personnel in that State. Funding of these initiatives does not include support for training
programs conducted by national providers of judicial education unless such a program is designed specifically for
a particular State and has the express support of the State Chief Justice, State Court Administrator, or State Judicial
Educator. The types of programs to be supported within this category should be defined by individual State need but
may include: 

(a) 

Development of State Court Education Programs. 

Projects to assist development of State court education programs include, but are not limited to: 

 Seed money for the creation of an ongoing State-based entity for planning, developing, and administering
judicial education programs; 

 Seed money for innovative interdisciplinary and, as appropriate, interbranch educational programs, such
as those addressing: (1) The development of better working relationships across court divisions and between courts
and criminal justice, social service, and treatment agencies; (2) organizational and leadership development,
including team-building; and (3) the specific educational needs of nonsupervisory staff as well as those filling
more direct managerial roles; and (4) the development and implementation of strategies for coping with the gap between
resources and the demand for services; and 

 The development of the expertise, information, and commitment required for the preparation and implementation
of State court education plans, including model plans for career-long education of the judiciary (e.g., new judge
training and orientation followed by continuing education and career development) and for the career-long education
of court managers, clerks, and other court personnel.

(b) 

Curriculum Adaptation Projects. 

(1) Description of the Program. 

The Board is reserving up to $350,000 to provide support for adaptation and implementation of model curricula and/or
model training programs previously developed with SJI support. The exact amount to be awarded for curriculum adaptation
grants will depend on the number and quality of the applications submitted in this category and other categories of
the Guideline. The program is designed to provide State and local courts with sufficient support to prepare and conduct
a State-specific or regional modification of a model curriculum, course module, national or regional conference
program, or other model education program developed with SJI funds by any other State or national organization. An
illustrative list of the curricula that may be appropriate for the adaptation is contained in Appendix VII. 

Only State or local courts may apply for Curriculum Adaptation funding. Grants to support adaptation of educational
programs previously developed with SJI funds are limited to no more than $20,000 each. As with other awards to State
or local courts, cash or in-kind match must be provided equal to at least 50% of the grant amount requested. 

(2) 

Review Criteria. 

Curriculum Adaptation grants will be awarded on the basis of criteria including: the need for the educational program;
the need for outside funding to support the program; the likelihood of effective implementation; and expressions
of interest by the judges and/or court personnel who would be directly involved in or affected by the project. In making
implementation awards, the Institute will also consider factors such as the reasonableness of the amount requested,
compliance with the statutory match requirements, diversity of subject matter, geographic diversity, the level
of appropriations available in the current year, and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years.



(3) 

Application Procedures. 

In lieu of concept papers and formal applications, applicants for grants may submit, at any time, a detailed letter,
and three photocopies. Although there is no prescribed form for the letter nor a minimum or maximum page limit, letters
of application should include the following information to assure that each of the criteria for evaluating applications
is addressed: 

 

Project Description. 

Why is this education program needed at the present time? What is the model curriculum or training program to be tested?
How will it be adapted for State use, and who will be responsible for adapting the model curriculum? Who will the participants
be, how will they be recruited, and from where will they come (e.g., from across the State, from a single local jurisdiction,
from a multi-State region)? How many participants are anticipated? 

 

Need for funding. 

Why cannot State or local resources fully support the modification and presentation of the model curriculum? What
is the potential for replicating or integrating the program in the future using State or local funds, once it has been
successfully adapted and tested? 

 

Likelihood. 

What is the proposed date for presenting the program? What types of modifications in the length, format, and content
of the model curriculum are anticipated? How will the presentation of the program be evaluated and by whom? (Ordinarily,
an outside evaluation is not necessary.) What measures will be taken to facilitate subsequent presentations of the
adapted program?

<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 

Expressions of Interest By Judges and/or Court Personnel. 

Does the proposed program have the support of the court system leadership, and of judges, court managers, and judicial
education personnel who are expected to attend? (This may be demonstrated by attaching letters of support.)

 

Budget and matching State contribution. 

A copy of budget Form E (see Appendix IV) and a budget narrative (see Section VII.B) that describes the basis for the
proposed costs and the source of the match offered.

 Local courts should attach a concurrence signed by the Chief Justice of the State or his or her designee. (See
Form B, Appendix V.)

Letters of application may be submitted at any time. However, applicants should allow at least 90 days between the
date of submission and the date of the proposed program to allow sufficient time for needed planning. The Board of Directors
has delegated its authority to approve Curriculum Adaptation grants to its Judicial Education Committee. The committee
anticipates acting upon applications within 45 days after receipt. Formal grant awards will be made only after committee
approval and negotiation of the final terms of the grant.

(4) 

Grantee Responsibilities. 

A recipient of a Curriculum Adaptation grant must:

(a) Comply with the same quarterly reporting requirements as other Institute grantees (see Section X.L., infra);

(b) Include in each grant product a prominent acknowledgement that support was received from the Institute, along
with the ``SJI'' logo, and a disclaimer paragraph based on the example provided in section X.Q. of the Guideline; and

(c) Submit two copies of the manuals, handbooks, or conference packets developed under the grant at the conclusion
of the grant period, along with a final report that explains how it intends to replicate the program in the future.

Applicants seeking other types of funding for developing and testing educational programs must comply with the requirements
for concept papers and applications set forth in Sections VI and VII or the requirements for renewal applications
set forth in Section IX.

ii. 

National and Regional Education Programs. 

This category includes support for national or regional training programs developed by any provider, e.g., national
organizations, State courts, universities, or public interest groups. Within this category, priority will be given
to training projects which address issues of major concern to the State judiciary and other court personnel. Ordinarily,
national and regional education projects are expected to develop curricula (as defined in Section III.K.) that may
be adapted by State and local courts. Programs to be supported may include:

<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00114 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Training programs or seminars on topics of interest and concern that transcend State lines including the factors
that should be considered in deciding child custody and termination of parental rights; 
 Multi-State or regional training programs sponsored by national organizations, non-profit groups, State
courts or universities; 
 Interdisciplinary and, as appropriate, interbranch educational programs for State trial and appellate
court judges, State and local court managers including clerks of court, and non-supervisory staff or other court
personnel, including seminars based on Institute-supported research, and programs designed to develop better
working relationships across court divisions and between courts and criminal justice, social service, and treatment
agencies; and 
 Innovative independent study models that would enhance the availability of judicial education, especially
for judges and court personnel who do not have ready access to training programs, and possible models for the credentialing
of this type of continuing judicial education.

iii. 

Judicial Education Technical Assistance. 

Unlike the preceding categories which support direct training, ``Technical Assistance'' refers to services necessary
for the development of effective educational projects for judges and other court personnel. Projects in this category
should focus on the needs of the States, and applicants should demonstrate their ability to work effectively with
State judicial educators.

The Institute is currently funding the following judicial education technical assistance projects: the Judicial
Education Reference Information and Technology Transfer Project (JERITT), which collects and disseminates information
(as well as providing technical assistance) on continuing education programs for judges and court personnel; the
Judicial Education/Adult Education Project (JEAEP), which provides expert assistance on the application of adult
and continuing education theory and practices to court education programs; the Leadership Institute in Judicial
Education, which offers an annual training program and follow-up assistance to State judicial education leadership
teams to help them develop improved approaches to court education; and NASJE NEWS, a newsletter of the National Association
of State Judicial Educators.

iv. 

Conferences.

 This category includes support for regional or national conferences on topics of major concern to the State judiciary
and court personnel. Applicants are encouraged to consider the use of videoconference and other technologies to
increase participation and limit travel expenses in planning and presenting conferences. Applicants also are reminded
that conference sites should be accessible to persons with disabilities in accordance with the Americans With Disabilities
Act. In planning a conference, applicants should provide for a written, video, or other product that would widely
disseminate the information, findings, and any recommendations resulting from the conference.

The Institute is particularly interested in supporting:

(a) 

National Symposium on Sentencing

: 

The Judicial Response to Crime,

 to enable State and Federal judges, legislators, prosecutors, defense counsel, corrections officials, legal academics,
social science researchers, media representatives, and members of the public to: 
 Evaluate what is known about the impact of current sentencing practices on adult offenders, juvenile offenders
tried as adults, and juvenile offenders, the criminal and juvenile justice systems, and the public's perception
of justice; 
 Explore how changes in sentencing legislation and judicial practices might better accomplish the goals of
sentencing; 
 Identify changes in procedure, new sources of information or education, and other innovations that might
better assure that a sentence serves the judge's intended sentencing goal(s) in a particular case; and 
 Recommend specific changes in law, policy, and procedure that would help courts better accomplish the goals
of sentencing and improve the public's confidence in the justice system. 
Among the topics which could be addressed at the Symposium would be: the impact that Federal and State sentencing guidelines,
mandatory minimums, and other determinate sentencing approaches have had on the courts and other components of the
criminal justice system, the public, and offenders; whether these approaches have fulfilled their envisioned purposes;
whether sentencing innovations (e.g., giving judges greater access to information about the offender, the victim,
and available sentencing options; changed plea bargaining practices; and greater use of intermediate sanctions)
might better assure just and effective sentencing; and whether current sentencing legislation, processes, and
decisions adequately reflect the public's expectations of justice. 
(b) 

National Symposium on Reducing Litigation Delay.

 The Institute has supported over 20 projects examining methods for improving caseflow in various types and levels
of courts, or training judges and court managers on pretrial and trial management. The Institute is interested in
supporting a symposium that would bring together litigation delay researchers, technical assistance providers,
trial and appellate court judges and managers both from courts that have not successfully implemented programs for
improving caseflow and reducing the time to disposition as well as those that have, State court administrators, attorneys,
scholars, and others to synthesize and share the information resulting from the projects funded by the Institute
and others; determine the approaches to pretrial, trial, and individual docket management that appear to be most
effective and the best methods for implementing them; identify the programs that may be needed to assist courts in
further reducing litigation delay; define and prioritize the topics for further research on improving caseflow
management; and encourage and assist courts that are experiencing litigation delay to undertake measures to ensure
the prompt and fair disposition of cases. 
v. 

Scholarships for Judges and Court Personnel.

 The Institute is reserving up to $250,000 (in addition to any scholarship funds remaining from Fiscal Year 1994) to
support a scholarship program for State court judges and court managers. 
(a) 

Program Description/Scholarship Amounts.

 The purposes of the Institute scholarship program are to: enhance the knowledge, skills, and abilities of judges
and court managers; enable State court judges and court managers to attend out-of-State educational programs sponsored
by national and State providers that they could not otherwise attend because of limited State, local and personal
budgets; and provide States, judicial educators, and the Institute with evaluative information on a range of judicial
and court-related education programs. 
Scholarships will be granted to individuals only for the purpose of attending an out-of-State educational program
within the United States. The annual or midyear meeting of a State or national organization of which the applicant
is a member does not qualify as an out-of-State educational program for scholarship purposes, even though it may include
workshops or other training sessions.

<TEXT>
 

A scholarship may cover the cost of tuition and travel up to a maximum total of $1,500 per scholarship. (Transportation
expenses include roundtrip coach airfare or train fare, or up to $.25/mile if the recipient drives to the site of the
program.) Funds to pay tuition and transportation expenses in excess of $1,500, and other costs of attending the program
such as lodging, meals, materials, and local transportation (including rental cars) at the site of the education
program, must be obtained from other sources or be borne by the scholarship recipient. 
Scholarship recipients are encouraged to check with their tax advisor to determine whether the scholarship constitutes
taxable income under Federal and State law. 
(b) 

Eligibility Requirements.

 Because of the limited amount of funds available, scholarships are limited to full-time judges of State or local trial
and appellate courts, to full-time professional, State or local court personnel with management responsibilities,
and to supervisory and management probation personnel in judicial branch probation offices. Senior judges, part-time
judges, quasi-judicial hearing officers, State administrative law judges, staff attorneys, law clerks, line staff,
law enforcement officers and other executive branch personnel will not be eligible to receive a scholarship. 
(c) 

Application Procedures.

 Judges and court managers interested in receiving a scholarship must submit the Institute's Judicial Education
Scholarship Application Form (Form S1, see Appendix III). Applications must be submitted by:

 

November 1, 1994, for programs beginning between February 1, 1995 and April 30, 1995; 
February 1, 1995, for programs beginning between May 1 and July 31, 1995; 
May 1, 1995, for programs beginning between August 1, and October 31, 1995; and 
August 1, 1995, for programs beginning between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1996.

 

No exceptions or extensions will be granted. 


(d) 

Concurrence Requirement. All scholarship applicants must obtain the written concurrence of the Chief Justice of
his or her State's Supreme Court (or the Chief Justice's designee) on the Institute's Judicial Education Scholarship
Concurrence (Form S2, see Appendix III).

 Court managers, other than elected clerks of court, also should submit a letter of support from their supervisor.
The Concurrence (Form S2) may accompany the application or be sent separately. However, the original signed Concurrence
form must be received by the Institute within one week after the appropriate application mailing deadline (i.e. by
November 8, 1994, or February 8, May 8, or August 8, 1995). No application will be reviewed if a signed Concurrence has
not been received by the required date. 
(e) 

Review Procedures/Selection Criteria.

 The Board of Directors has delegated the authority to approve or deny scholarships to its Judicial Education Committee.
The Institute intends to notify each applicant whose scholarship has been approved within 60 days after the relevant
application deadline. In order to assure the availability of scholarship funds throughout the year, the Committee
will limit the amount of the scholarship support awarded in any quarter to no more than $62,500 (in addition to scholarship
funds that may not have been awarded in previous quarters). 
The factors that the Institute will consider in selecting scholarship recipients are: 
 The applicant's need for training in the particular course subject and how the applicant would apply the information/skills
gained; 
 The benefits to the applicant's court or the State's court system that would be derived from the applicant's
participation in the specific educational program, including a description of current legal, procedural, administrative
or other problems affecting the State's courts, related to topics to be addressed at the educational program (in addition
to submission of a signed Form S2);

<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The absence of educational programs in the applicant's State addressing the particular topic;
 How the applicant will disseminate the knowledge gained (e.g., by developing/teaching a course or providing
in-service training for judges or court personnel at the State or local level);
 The length of time that the applicant intends to serve as a judge or court manager, assuming reelection or reappointment,
where applicable;
 The likelihood that the applicant would be able to attend the program without a scholarship;
 The unavailability of State or local funds to cover the costs of attending the program;
 The quality of the educational program to be attended as demonstrated by the sponsoring organization's experience
in judicial education, evaluations by participants or other professionals in the field, or prior SJI support for
this or other programs sponsored by the organization;
 Geographic balance;
 The balance of scholarships among types of applicants and courts;
 The balance of scholarships among educational programs; and 
 The level of appropriations available to the Institute in the current year and the amount expected to be available
in succeeding fiscal years. 

(f) 

Responsibilities of Scholarship Recipients. 

In order to receive the funds authorized by a scholarship award, recipients must submit Scholarship Payment Voucher
(Form S3) together with a tuition statement from the program sponsor, and a transportation fare receipt (or statement
of the driving mileage to and from the recipient's home to the site of the educational program). Recipients also must
submit to the Institute a certificate of attendance at the program and an evaluation of the educational program they
attended. A copy of the evaluation also must be sent to the Chief Justice of their State. 
A State or a local jurisdiction may impose additional requirements on scholarship recipients that are consistent
with SJI's criteria and requirements, e.g., a requirement to serve as faculty on the subject at a State- or locally-sponsored
judicial education program. 
c. 

Dispute Resolution and the Courts. 

This category includes research, evaluation, and demonstration projects addressing the findings and recommendations
developed at the National Symposium on Court-Connected Dispute Resolution Research, conducted in Orlando in October
1993. The Institute is interested in projects that enhance the courts' ability to compare findings among research
studies; address the nature and operation of ADR programs within the context of the court system as a whole; compare
dispute resolution processes to attorney settlement as well as trial; and promote the ability of the courts to move
toward on-going self-evaluation of court-connected dispute resolution programs. Among the topics of greatest
interest are: 
i. The Structure of Court-Connected Dispute Resolution Programs including such issues as the appropriate timing
for referrals to dispute resolution services and the effects implementing such referrals at various stages during
litigation; the effect of different referral methods including any differences in outcome between voluntary and
mandatory referrals; cultural issues, including the nature of cultural conflict and its effect on outcomes; and
approaches that provide rural courts and other under-served areas with adequate court-connected dispute resolution
services. 
ii. The Selection, Qualifications and Training of Court-Connected Neutrals including what selection procedures
are most effective; what standards should be used to qualify a neutral; what constitutes effective dispute resolution
training; on what basis and when people should be eliminated from the training process; how courts can maintain and
improve neutrals' skills; and how ineffective neutrals should be removed from the pool.

In previous funding cycles, grants have been awarded to support evaluation of the use of mediation in civil, domestic
relations, juvenile, medical malpractice, appellate, and minor criminal cases. SJI grants also have supported
assessments of the impact of early neutral evaluation of motor vehicle cases, the impact of private judging on State
courts, multi-door courthouse programs, arbitration of civil cases, and civil settlement programs. In addition,
SJI has supported the creation of a consumer guide to choosing a mediator; the development of training programs for
judges; and technical assistance on implementation of multi-door courthouse programs, developing standards for
court-annexed mediation programs, examination of the applicability of various dispute resolution procedures
to different cultural groups, and creation of a national database of court-connected dispute resolution programs.

Applicants should be aware that the Institute will not provide operational support for on-going ADR programs. Courts
also should be advised that it is preferable for the applicant to support operational costs of a new program, with Institute
funds targeted to support related technical assistance, training, and evaluation needs. 
d. 

Planning and Managing the Future of the Courts. 

The Institute is interested in supporting activities that would enable courts to implement and evaluate long-range
strategic planning processes and complementary innovative management approaches in their own jurisdictions.

The types of projects that fall within this category are: 
 Development, implementation, institutionalization, and evaluation of long-range planning approaches
in individual States and local jurisdictions, e.g., the development or inclusion of strategic planning techniques,
environmental scanning, trends analysis, benchmarking, and other comprehensive long-range, strategic planning
methods as components of courts' current planning processes or as part of the initiation of such a process; 
 Adaptation, implementation and evaluation of innovative management approaches, such as total quality management,
designed to complement, enhance or support use of a long-range strategic planning process. This includes the development
and testing of performance standards and other techniques to enable trial and appellate court officials to conduct
user evaluations of the quality of court services and to measure public, internal, and supplier satisfaction as a
means to improve court performance. Also included is the planning, implementation, and evaluation of innovative
delay and cost reduction programs including assessments of the advantages and disadvantages of privatizing court
activities; 
 Development, implementation, and evaluation of mechanisms for linking assessments of effectiveness such
as the Trial Court Performance Standards to fiscal planning and budgeting, including service efforts and accomplishments
approaches (SEA), performance audits, and performance budgeting; 
 Development, presentation and evaluation of training necessary to enable judges and court staff to participate
productively in the implementation or institutionalization of the planning process and/or related innovative
management approaches, including training to enhance the ability of courts to develop effective plans for coping
with natural other disasters. 
The Institute has supported futures commissions in seven States. Because the Board of Directors believes that a sufficient
variety of commission models now exists, the Institute will not support the development or implementation of any
State futures commissions in FY 1995. 
The Institute also has supported planning, futures, and innovative management projects including: national and
Statewide ``future and the courts'' conferences and training; development of curricula, guidebooks and a video
on visioning, and a long-range planning guide for trial courts; the provision of technical assistance to courts conducting
futures and long-range planning activities, including development of a court futures network on Internet; a test
of the feasibility of implementing the Trial Court Performance Standards in four States; the development of Appellate
Court Performance Standards; the application of total quality management principles to court operations, and the
development of TQM guidebook for trial courts; and the development of service efforts and accomplishments (SEA)
measures for municipal courts. 

e. 

Children and Families in Court. 

This category includes education, evaluation, technical assistance, and research projects to identify and inform
judges of appropriate and effective approaches for:

 Adjudicating child custody litigation in which family violence may be involved; 
 Determining and addressing the service needs of children exposed to family violence including the short-
and long-term effects on children of exposure to family violence and the methods for mitigating those effects when
issuing protection, custody, visitation, or other orders; 
 Adjudicating and monitoring child abuse and neglect litigation and reconciling the need to protect the child
with the requirement to make reasonable efforts to maintain or reunite the family; 
 Adjudicating and developing dispositions for cases involving elder abuse; 
 Determining when it may be appropriate to refer a case involving family violence for mediation, and what procedures
and safeguards should be employed; 
 Coordinating multiple cases involving members of the same family, and obtaining and appropriately using
social and psychological information gathered in one case involving a family member in a case involving another family
member; and 
 Handling the criminal and civil aspects of interstate and international parental child abductions. 
In previous funding cycles, the Institute supported a national and a State symposium on courts, children, and the
family; a national symposium on enhancing coordination of cases involving the same family that are being heard in
different courts; development and evaluation of a curriculum addressing the adjudication of allegations of child
sexual abuse when custody is in dispute; and the development and testing of curricula to enhance judges' understanding
of the dynamics of family violence and guide them in adjudication family violence cases and custody cases in which
spousal abuse is involved. In addition, the Institute has supported studies of the appropriate use of mediation in
child abuse cases and in divorce, custody, and visitation cases involving family violence; development of a video
and other materials for parties and children awaiting a court hearing in domestic relations cases involving family
violence; a benchbook for judges on child abuse and neglect caws stemming from parental substance abuse; curricula
to fairly adjudicate child abuse and neglect cases; an examination of the effectiveness of probation as a sanction
for child sexual abuse offenders; and the development of guidelines for courts in handling elder abuse cases. 
f. 

Application of Technology. 

This category includes the testing of innovative applications of technology to improve the operation of court management
systems and judicial practices at both the trial and appellate court levels. 
The Institute seeks to support local experiments with promising but untested applications of technology in the courts
that include a structured evaluation of the impact of the technology in terms of costs, benefits, and staff workload.
In this context, ``untested'' refers to novel applications of technology developed for the private sector and other
fields that have not previously been applied to the courts. 
The Institute is particularly interested in supporting efforts to determine what benefits and problems may occur
as a result of courts entering the ``information superhighway,'' including projects to establish standards for
judicial electronic data interchange (EDI); local, Statewide, and/or interstate demonstrations of the courts'
use of EDI (i.e., the exchange of documents or data in a computerized format that enables courts to process or perform
work electronically on the documents received) beyond simple image transfer (facsimile or computer-imaging);
and demonstrations and evaluations of innovative judicial/court uses of electronic communications networks including
those required to meet the reporting mandates contained in recent Federal legislation such as the Brady Act and the
National Child Protection Act. In addition, the Institute is interested in demonstrations and evaluation of the
effective use of management information systems to monitor, assess, and predict evolving court needs; and evaluations
of innovative technologies highlighted at the Fourth National Conference on Court Technology held in Nashville
in October 1994. 
Ordinarily, the Institute will not provide support for the purchase of equipment or software in order to implement
a technology that has been thoroughly tested in other jurisdictions such as the establishment of videolinks between
courts and jails, the use of optical imaging for recordkeeping, and the creation of an automated management information
system. (See section XI.H.2.b. regarding other limits on the use of grant funds to purchase equipment and software.)

In previous funding cycles, grants have been awarded to support:

throughout a State without replacement of the various hardware and software environments which support individual
courts; a compu-terized voice information system permitting parties to access by telephone information pertaining
to their cases; an automated public information directory of courthouse facilities and services; an automated appellate
court bulletin board; and a computer-integrated courtroom that provides full access to the judicial system for hearing-impaired
jurors, witnesses, crime victims, litigants, attorneys, and judges. 
Demonstration and evaluation of records techno-logy, including: the development of a court management information
display system; the integration of bar-coding technology with an existing automated case management system; an
on-bench automated system for generating and processing court orders; an automated judicial education management
system; testing of a document management system for small courts that uses imaging technology, and of automated telephone
docketing for circuit-riding judges; and evaluation of the use of automated teller machines for paying jurors; and

Court technology assistance services, e.g., circulation of a court technology bulletin designed to inform judges
and court managers about the latest developments in court-related technologies; creation of a court technology
laboratory to provide judges and court managers with the opportunity to test automated court-related systems; enhancement
of a data base documenting automated systems currently in use in courts across the country; establishment of a technical
information service to respond to specific inquiries concerning court-related technologies; development of court
automation performance standards; and an assessment of programs that allow public access to electronically stored
court information. 
Grants also provided support for national court technology conferences; preparation of guidelines on privacy and
public access to electronic court information; the testing of a computerized citizen intake and referral service;
development of an ``analytic judicial desktop system'' to assist judges in making sentencing decisions; implementation
and evaluation of a Statewide automated integrated case docketing and record-keeping system; a prototype computerized
benchbook using hypertext technology; and computer simulation models to assist State courts in evaluating potential
strategies for improving civil caseflow. 
g. 

Resolution of Current Evidentiary Issues. 

This category includes educational programs and other projects to assist judges in deciding questions regarding:

 The admissibility of new forms of demonstrative evidence, including computer simulations; 

 The application of the standards set forth in 

Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

governing the admissibility of scientific and technical evidence;

 Determining what constitutes clear and convincing evidence of a person's wish not to initiate or continue
life-sustaining treatment, including the implications of the Federal Patient Self-Determination Act; and 

 Other complex evidentiary issues. 

In previous funding cycles, the Institute has supported the development of a computer-assisted training program
on evidentiary problems for juvenile and family court judges; training on medical/legal and scientific evidence
issues; regional seminars on evidentiary questions; and development of protocols for handling child victim cases.


h. 

Substance Abuse.

 This category includes the development and evaluation of innovative techniques for courts to handle the increasing
volume of substance abuse-related criminal, civil, juvenile and domestic relations cases fairly and expeditiously;
and the planning and presentation of seminars or other educational forums for judges, probation officers, caseworkers,
and other court personnel to examine court-related issues concerning alcohol and other drug abuse and develop specific
plans for how individual courts can respond effectively to the impact of substance abuse-related cases on their ability
to manage their overall caseloads fairly and efficiently. 

The Institute is particularly interested in funding innovative projects which evaluate the applicability of court-enforced
treatment programs to substance abuse-related cases involving juveniles and cases requiring treatment services
in addition to substance abuse treatment (e.g., spousal abuse, child abuse, or mental health cases); establish coordinated
efforts between local courts and treatment providers for the effective disposition of cases involving substance
abuse; or evaluate the effectiveness of various court responses to treating substance abuse. Proposals should demonstrate
a direct impact on the ability of State courts to handle cases involving substance abuse fairly and effectively. 

The Institute will not fund projects focused on developing additional assessment tools, establishing court-enforced
treatment programs for adult substance abusers, or providing support for basic court or treatment services. 

The Institute is currently supporting the presentation of a National Symposium on the Implementation and Operation
of Court-Enforced Drug Treatment Programs. In previous funding cycles, the Institute has sponsored a National Conference
on Substance Abuse and the Courts, and State efforts to implement the plans developed at that Conference. It has also
supported projects to evaluate court-enforced treatment programs initiated by the Dade County, Florida, Pulaski
County, Arkansas, and New York City courts, and the effectiveness of other court-based alcohol and drug assessment
programs; replicate the Dade County program in non-urban sites; assess the impact of legislation and court decisions
dealing with drug-affected infants, and strategies for coping with increasing caseload pressures; develop a benchbook
to assist judges in child abuse and neglect cases involving parental substance abuse; test the use of a dual diagnostic
treatment model for domestic violence cases in which substance abuse was a factor; and present local and regional
educational programs for judges and other court personnel on substance abuse and its treatment. 

The Institute and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) also are supporting two technical assistance projects:
one by the National Center for State Courts to assist courts in implementing the plans developed at the National Conference;
and the other by the American University Court Technical Assistance Project to identify successful drug case management
strategies, conduct seminars on drug case management, and develop a guidebook for implementing drug case processing
initiatives. In addition, the Institute and the Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance Abuse
Treatment (CSAT) have entered into inter-agency agreement to conduct regional training programs for State judges
and legislators on substance abuse treatment. 

i. 

Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts.

 This category includes State and local court projects to implement the action plans and strategies developed by the
teams that participated in the Institute-supported National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the
Courts, to be held in Albuquerque, New Mexico in March, 1995, and projects designed to assist teams in implementing
their plans.

the special cycle, concept papers proposing implementation projects must be mailed by October 6, 1995. They will
be considered by the Institute's Board of Directors at its meeting in November, 1995. Applications based on those
concept papers will be considered by the Board at its meeting in March, 1996. 

j. 

Assessing the Impact of Health Care-Related Issues on the State Courts.

 This category includes projects to develop educational curricula and other materials to assist judges in: 

 Determining and preparing approaches for dealing with the impact on the State Courts of proposed or enacted
changes in the State and Federal health care systems, including the anticipated increase in the number of disputes
regarding the scope and nature of insurance coverage; 

 Understanding and responding to the scientific, legal and ethical issues raised by the continuing advances
in the application of biotechnology to health care, including the use of gene therapy and genetic testing; and 

 Using effective innovative remedies in long-term environmental and toxic substance exposure cases such

In previous funding cycles, the Institute has supported projects to: develop guidelines for judges in cases regarding
the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment; prepare benchbooks, handbooks, videotapes, and training materials
on guardianship, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and AIDS; conduct a series of health science-law workshops
for judges and judicial educators; and develop a deskbook for judges on medical-legal issues arising in juvenile
and family cases. 

k. 

Improving the Courts' Response to Gender-Related Crimes of Violence.

 This category includes the development, testing, presentation, and dissemination of education programs for judges
and court personnel on: 

 The nature and incidence of stalking and gender-related crimes of violence (e.g., rape, sexual assault, partner
abuse), and their impact on the victim and society; 

 Sentencing decision-making in cases involving gender-related crimes of violence; 

 The use of self-defense and provocation defenses by alleged victims of gender-related violence accused of
assaulting or killing their alleged abusers; and 

 The effective use and enforcement of protective orders and the implications of mutual orders of protection.


In previous funding cycles, the Institute supported a national conference on family violence and the courts, and
follow-up conferences in several States; development of a comprehensive curriculum on handling stranger and non-stranger
rape and sexual assault cases; evaluation of the effectiveness of court-ordered treatment for family violence offenders;
a demonstration of ways to improve court processing of injunctions for protection and a study of ways to improve the
effectiveness of civil protection orders for family violence victims; an examination of state-of-the-art court
practices for handling family violence cases and of ways to improve access to rural courts for victims of family violence;
and a manual for judges on the use of expert testimony regarding the battered woman syndrome. 

 
l. 

The Relationship Between State and Federal Courts.

 This category includes education, research, demonstration, and evaluation projects designed to facilitate appropriate
and effective communication, cooperation, and coordination between State and Federal courts. The Institute is
particularly interested in innovative education, evaluation, demonstration, technical assistance and research
projects that: 

i. Build upon the findings and recommendations gained at the Institute-supported National Conference on the Management
of Mass Tort Cases to be held in Cincinnati on November 10-13, 1994. Concept papers proposing projects addressing
these issues must be mailed by March 10, 1995. Concept papers following up on the Mass Tort Conference will be reviewed
by the Board of Directors at its April 1995 meeting. (A summary of the recommendations and findings from the conference
will be published in SJI NEWS in December, 1994.) 

ii. Develop and test curricula and other educational materials to: 

 Enhance the operation of State-Federal Judicial Councils; 

 Illustrate effective methods being used at the trial court, State and Circuit levels to coordinate cases and
administrative activities; and

has also supported a clearinghouse of information on State constitutional law decisions, educational programs
for State judges on coordination of Federal bankruptcy cases with State litigation, and a seminar examining the implications
of the ``Federalization'' of crime. 



C. Single Jurisdiction Projects 



The Board will consider supporting a limited number of projects submitted by State or local courts that address the
needs of only the applicant State or local jurisdiction. It has established two categories of Single Jurisdiction
Projects: 



1. Programs Addressing a Critical Need of a Single State or Local Jurisdiction



a. 

Description of the Program.

 The Board will set aside up to $600,000 to support projects submitted by State or local courts that address the needs
of only the applicant State or local jurisdiction. A project under this section may address any of the topics included
in the Special Interest Categories or Statutory Program Areas, and may, but need not, seek to implement the findings
and recommendations of Institute supported research, evaluation, or demonstration programs. Concept papers for
single jurisdiction projects may be submitted by a State court system, an appellate court, or a limited or general
jurisdiction trial court. All awards under this category are subject to the matching requirements set forth in section
X.B.1. 

b. 

Application Procedures.

 Concept papers and applications requesting funds for projects under this section must meet the requirements of sections
VI. (``Concept Paper Submission Requirements for New Projects'') and VII. (``Application Requirements''), respectively,
and must demonstrate that:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00124 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

i. The proposed project is essential to meeting a critical need of the jurisdiction; and 

ii. The need cannot be met solely with State and local resources within the foreseeable future. 



2. Technical Assistance Grants 



a. 

Description of the Program.

 The Board will set aside up to $600,000 of Fiscal Year 1995 funds (in addition to any technical assistance funds remaining
from Fiscal Year 1994) to support the provision of technical assistance to State and local courts. The exact amount
to be awarded for these grants will depend on the number and quality of the applications submitted in this category
and other categories of the Guideline. It is anticipated, however, that at least $150,000 will be available each quarter
to support Technical Assistance grants. The program is designed to provide State and local courts with sufficient
support to obtain technical assistance to diagnose a problem, develop a response to that problem, and initiate implementation
of any needed changes. 

Technical Assistance grants are limited to no more than $30,000 each, and may cover the cost of obtaining the services
of expert consultants, travel by a team of officials from one court to examine a practice, program or facility in another
jurisdiction that the applicant court is interested in replicating, or both. 

The technical assistance must be completed within 12 months after the start-date of the grant. Only State or local
courts may apply for Technical Assistance grants. As with other awards to State or local courts, cash or in-kind match
must be provided equal to at least 50% of the grant amount.
Technical Assistance grant recipients also are subject to the same quarterly reporting requirements as other Institute
grantees. 

At the conclusion of the grant period, a Technical Assistance grant recipient must complete a Technical Assistance
Evaluation Form. The grantee also must submit to the Institute two copies of a final report that explains how it intends
to act on the consultant's recommendations as well as two copies of the consultant's written report. 

b. 

Review Criteria.

 Technical Assistance grants will be awarded on the basis of criteria including: whether the assistance would address
a critical need of the court; the soundness of the technical assistance approach to the problem; the qualifications
of the consultant(s) to be hired, or the specific criteria that will be used to select the consultant(s); commitment
on the part of the court to act on the consultant's recommendations; and the reasonableness of the proposed budget.
The Institute will also consider factors such as the level and nature of the match that would be provided, diversity
of subject matter, geographic diversity, and the level of appropriations available to the Institute in the current
year and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years. 

c. 

Application Procedures.

 In lieu of concept papers and formal applications, applicants for Technical Assistance grants may submit, at any
time, an original and three copies of a detailed letter describing the proposed project and addressing the criteria
listed above. Letters from an individual trial or appellate court must be signed by the presiding judge or manager
of that court. Letters from the State court system must be signed by the Chief Justice or State Court Administrator.


Although there is no prescribed form for the letter nor a minimum or maximum page limit, letters of application should
include the following information to assure that each of the criteria is addressed: 

i. 

Need for Funding.

 What is the critical need facing the court? How will the proposed technical assistance help the court to meet this critical
need? Why cannot State or local resources fully support the costs of the required consultant services? 

ii. 

Project Description.

 What tasks would the consultant be expected to perform? Who (organization or individual) would be hired to provide
the assistance and how was this consultant selected? If a consultant has not yet been identified, what procedures
and criteria would be used to select the consultant? (Applicants are expected to follow their jurisdiction's normal
procedures for procuring consultant services.) What is the time frame for completion of the technical assistance?
How would the court oversee the project and provide guidance to the consultant? 

If the consultant has been identified, a letter from that individual or organization documenting interest in and
availability for the project, as well as the consultant's ability to complete the assignment within the proposed
time period and for the proposed cost, should accompany the applicant's letter. The consultant must agree to submit
a detailed written report to the court and the Institute upon completion of the technical assistance.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00125 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If the support or cooperation of agencies, funding bodies, organizations, or courts other than the applicant, would
be needed in order for the consultant to perform the required tasks, written assurances of such support or cooperation
must accompany the application letter. Support letters also may be submitted under separate cover; however, to ensure
that there is sufficient time to bring them to the attention of the Board's Technical Assistance Committee, letters
sent under separate cover must be received not less than two weeks prior to the Board meeting at which the technical
assistance requests will be considered (i.e., by November 4, 1994; February 17, 1995; April 28, 1995; and July 14,
1995). 
iii. 

Likelihood of implementation. 

What steps have been/will be taken to facilitate implementation of the consultant's recommendations upon completion
of the technical assistance? For example, if the support or cooperation of other agencies, funding bodies, organizations,
or a court other than the applicant will be needed to adopt the changes recommended by the consultant and approved by
the court, how will they be involved in the review of the recommendations and development of the implementation plan?

iv. 

Budget and matching State contribution. 

A completed Form E, ``Preliminary Budget'' (see Appendix IV to the Grant Guideline), must be included with the applicant's
letter requesting technical assistance. Please note that the estimated cost of the technical assistance services
should be broken down into the categories listed on the budget form rather than aggregated under the Consultant/Contractual
category. In addition, the budget should provide for submission of three copies of the consultant's final report
to the Institute. 
v. 

Support for the project from the State supreme court or its designated agency or council. 

Written concurrence on the need for the technical assistance must be submitted. This concurrence may be a copy of SJI
Form B (see Appendix V.) signed by the Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court or the Chief Justice's designee, or a
letter from the State Chief Justice or designee. The concurrence may be submitted with the applicant's letter or under
separate cover prior to consideration of the application. The concurrence also must specify whether the State Supreme
Court would receive, administer, and account for the grant funds, if awarded, or would designate the local court or
a specified agency or council to receive the funds directly. 
Letters of application may be submitted at any time; however, all of the letters received during a calendar quarter
will be considered at one time. Applicants submitting letters between October 1, 1994, and January 15, 1995, will
be notified of the Board's decision by March 31, 1995; those submitting letters between January 16, and March 15, 1995,
will be notified by May 31, 1995. Notification of the Board's decisions concerning letters received between March
16 and June 15, 1995, will be made by August 31, 1995; and applicants submitting letters between June 16 and September
29, 1995, will be notified by November 30, 1995. The Board has delegated its authority to approve these grants to its
Technical Assistance Committee. 
The Technical Assistance grant program described in this section should not be confused with the Judicial Education
Technical Assistance projects described in Section II.B.2.b.iii.

III. Definitions 


The following definitions apply for the purposes of this guideline: 


A. Institute 


The State Justice Institute. 


B. State Supreme Court 


The highest appellate court in a State, unless, for the purposes of the Institute program, a constitutionally or legislatively
established judicial council that acts in place of that court. In States having more than one court with final appellate
authority, State Supreme Court shall mean that court which also has administrative responsibility for the State's
judicial system. State Supreme Court also includes the office of the court or council, if any, it designates to perform
the functions described in this guideline. 


C. Designated Agency or Council 


The office or judicial body which is authorized under State law or by delegation from the State Supreme Court to approve
applications for funds and to receive, administer, and be accountable for those funds. 


D. Grantee 


The organization, entity, or individual to which an award of Institute funds is made. For a grant based on an application
from a State or local court, grantee refers to the State Supreme Court or its designee. 


E. Subgrantee 


A State or local court which receives Institute funds through the State Supreme Court. 


F. Match 


The portion of project costs not borne by the Institute. Match includes both in-kind and cash contributions. Cash
match is the direct outlay of funds by the grantee to support the project. In-kind match consists of contributions
of time, services, space, supplies, etc., made to the project by the grantee or others (e.g., advisory board members)
working directly on the project. Under normal circumstances, allowable match may be incurred only during the project
period. When appropriate, and with the prior written permission of the Institute, match may be incurred from the date
of the Institute Board of Directors' approval of an award. Match does not include project-related income such as tuition
or revenue from the sale of grant products, or the time of participants attending an education program. Amounts contributed
as cash or in-kind match may not be recovered through the sale of grant products during or following the grant period.



G. Continuation Grant 


A grant of no more than 24 months to permit completion of activities initiated under an existing Institute grant or
enhancement of the programs or services produced or established during the prior grant period. 


H. On-going Support Grant 


A grant of up to 36 months to support a project that is national in scope and that provides the State courts with services,
programs or products for which there is a continuing important need. 


I. Package Grant 


A single grant that supports two or more closely-related projects which logically should be viewed as a whole or would
require substantial duplication of effort if administered separately. Closely-related projects may include those
addressing interrelated topics, or those requiring the services of all or some of the same key staff persons, or the
core elements of a multifaceted program. Each of the components of a package grant must operate within the same project
period.

IV. Eligibility for Award 


In awarding funds to accomplish these objectives and purposes, the Institute has been authorized by Congress to award
grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to State and local courts and their agencies (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(A));
national nonprofit organizations controlled by, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branches
of State governments (42 U.S.C. 10705 (b)(1)(B)); and national nonprofit organizations for the education and training
of judges and support personnel of the judicial branch of State governments (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(C)). 
An applicant will be considered a national education and training applicant under section 10705(b)(1)(C) if: (1)
The principal purpose or activity of the applicant is to provide education and training to State and local judges and
court personnel; and (2) the applicant demonstrates a record of substantial experience in the field of judicial education
and training. 
The Institute also is authorized to make awards to other nonprofit organizations with expertise in judicial administration,
institutions of higher education, individuals, partnerships, firms, corporations, and private agencies with
expertise in judicial administration, provided that the objectives of the relevant program area(s) can be served
better. In making this judgment, the Institute will consider the likely replicability of the projects' methodology
and results in other jurisdictions. For-profit organizations are also eligible for grants and cooperative agreements;
however, they must waive their fees. 
The Institute may also make awards to Federal, State or local agencies and institutions other than courts for services
that cannot be adequately provided through nongovernmental arrangements. 
Finally, the Institute may enter into inter-agency agreements with other public or private funders to support projects
consistent with the purpose of the State Justice Institute Act. 

Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved, consistent with State law, by the State's
Supreme Court or its designated agency or council. The latter shall receive all Institute funds awarded to such courts
and be responsible for assuring proper administration of Institute funds, in accordance with section XI.B.2. of
this Guideline. A list of persons to contact in each State regarding approval of applications from State and local
courts and administration of Institute grants to those courts is contained in Appendix I. 


V. Types of Projects and Grants; Size of Awards 


A. Types of Projects 


Except as expressly provided in section II.B.2.b. and II.C. above, the Institute has placed no limitation on the overall
number of awards or the number of awards in each special interest category. The general types of projects are: 

1. Education and training; 
2. Research and evaluation; 
3. Demonstration; and 
4. Technical assistance. 


B. Types of Grants 


The Institute has established the following types of grants: 
1. New grants (See sections VI. and VII.). 
2. Continuation grants (See sections III.H. and IX.A). 
3. On-going Support grants (See sections III.I. and IX.B.).

will have a significant impact nationally. 
2. Applications for on-going support grants may request funding in amounts up to $600,000, except as provided in paragraph
V.C.3. At the discretion of the Board, the funds to support on-going support grants may be awarded either entirely
from the Institute's appropria-tions for the fiscal year of the award or from the Institute's appropriations for
successive fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year of the award. When funds to support the full amount of an on-going
support grant are not awarded from the appropriations for the fiscal year of award, funds to support any subsequent
years of the grant will be made available upon (1) the satisfactory performance of the project as reflected in the quarterly
Progress Reports required to be filed and grant monitoring, and (2) the availability of appropriations for that fiscal
year. 
3. An application for a package grant may request funding in an amount up to a total of $750,000 per year. 
4. Applications for technical assistance grants may request funding in amounts up to $30,000. 
5. Applications for curriculum adaptation grants may request funding in amounts up to $20,000.

VI. Concept Paper Submission Requirements for New Projects 


Concept papers are an extremely important part of the application process because they enable the Institute to learn
the program areas of primary interest to the courts and to explore innovative ideas, without imposing heavy burdens
on prospective applicants. The use of concept papers also permits the Institute to better project the nature and amount
of grant awards. This requirement and the submission deadlines for concept papers and applications may be waived
for good cause (e.g., the proposed project would provide a significant benefit to the State courts or the opportunity
to conduct the project did not arise until after the deadline). 


A. Format and Content 


All concept papers must include a cover sheet, a program narrative, and a preliminary budget, regardless of whether
the applicant is proposing a single project or a ``package of projects,'' or whether the applicant is requesting accelerated
award of a grant of less than $40,000. 


1. The Cover Sheet 


The cover sheet for all concept papers must contain: 
a. A title describing the proposed project; 

b. The name and address of the court, organization or individual submitting the paper; 
c. The name, title, address (if different from that in b.), and telephone number of a contact person(s) who can provide
further information about the paper; 
d. The letter of the Special Interest Category (see section II.B.2.) or the number of the statutory Program Area (see
section II.B.1.) that the proposed project addresses most directly; and 
e. The estimated length of the proposed project. 
Applicants requesting the Board to waive the application requirement and approve a grant of less than $40,000 based
on the concept paper, should add APPLICATION WAIVER REQUESTED to the information on the cover page. 


2. The Program Narrative 


a. 

Concept Papers Proposing a Single Project. 

The program narrative of a concept paper describing a single project should be no longer than necessary, but 

in no case should exceed eight (8) double-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not be less than 1 inch and
type no smaller than 12 point and 12 cpi must be used. 

The narrative should describe: 
i. 

Why this project is needed and how it will benefit State courts? 

If the project is to be conducted in a specific location(s), applicants should discuss the particular needs of the
project site(s) to be addressed by the project, why those needs are not being met through the use of existing materials,
programs, procedures, services or other resources, and the benefits that would be realized by the proposed sites(s).

If the project is not site specific, applicants should discuss the problems that the proposed project will address,
why existing materials, programs, procedures, services or other resources do not adequately resolve those problems,
and the benefits that would be realized from the project by State courts generally. 
ii. 

What will be done if a grant is awarded? 

A summary description of the project to be conducted and the approach to be taken, including the anticipated length
of the grant period. Applicants requesting a waiver of the application requirement for a grant of less than $40,000
should explain the proposed methods for conducting the project as fully as space allows. 
iii. 

How the effects and quality of the project will be determined? 

A summary description of how the project will be evaluated, including the evaluation criteria. 
iv. 

How others will find out about the project and be 
able to use the results? 

A description of the products that will result, the degree to which they will be applicable to courts across the nation,
and the manner in which the products and results of the project will be disseminated. 

b. 

Concept Papers Requesting a Package Grant Covering More Than One Project. 

The program narrative of a concept paper requesting a package grant (see definition in section III.I.) should be no
longer than necessary, but in no case should exceed 15 double-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not
be less than 1 inch, and type no smaller than 12-point and 12 cpi must be used. 
In addition to addressing the issues listed in paragraph VI.A.2.a., the program narrative of a package grant concept
paper must describe briefly each component project, as well as how its inclusion enhances the entire package; and
explain: 
i. How are the proposed projects related? 
ii. How would their operation and administration be enhanced if they were funded as a package rather than as individual
projects; and 
iii. What disadvantages, if any, would accrue by considering or funding them separately. 


3. The Budget 


a. 

Concept Papers Proposing a Single Project. 

A preliminary budget must be attached to the narrative that includes the estimates and information specified on Form
E included in Appendix IV of this Guideline.

<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. 

Concept Papers Requesting a Package Grant Covering More Than One Project.

 A separate preliminary budget for each component project of the package, as well as a combined budget that reflects
the costs of the entire package, must be attached to the narrative. Each project budget must be identified by the title
that corresponds to the narrative description of the project in the program narrative and a letter of the alphabet
(i.e. A, B, C). Each of these budgets must include the estimates and information specified on Form E included in Appendix
IV of this Guideline. 
c. 

Concept Papers Requesting Accelerated Award of a Grant of Less than $40,000.

 Applicants requesting a waiver of the application requirement and approval of a grant based on a concept paper under
section VI.C., must attach to Form E (see Appendix IV) a budget narrative explaining the basis for each of the items
listed, and whether the costs would be paid from grant funds or through a matching contribution or other sources. The
budget narrative is not counted against the eight-page limit for the program narrative. 
4. The Institute encourages concept paper applicants to attach letters of cooperation and support from the courts
and related agencies that will be involved in or directly affected by the proposed project. Letters of support also
may be sent under separate cover. However, in order to ensure that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's
attention, support letters sent under separate cover must be received no later than January 13, 1995. 
5. The Institute will not accept concept papers with program narratives exceeding the limits set in sections VI.A.2.a.
and b. The page limit does not include the cover page, budget form, the budget narrative if required under section VI.A.3.c.,
and any letters of cooperation or endorsements. Additional material should not be attached unless it is essential
to impart a clear understanding of the project. 
6. Applicants submitting more than one concept paper may include material that would be identical in each concept
paper in a cover letter, and incorporate that material by reference in each paper. The incorporated material will
be counted against the eight-page limit for each paper. A copy of the cover letter should be attached to each copy of
each concept paper. 
7. Sample concept papers from previous funding cycles are available from the Institute upon request. 


B. Selection Criteria 


1. All concept papers will be evaluated by the staff on the basis of the following criteria: 
a. The demonstration of need for the project; 
b. The soundness and innovativeness of the approach described; 
c. The benefits to be derived from the project; 
d. The reasonableness of the proposed budget; 
e. The proposed project's relationship to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B; and

f. The degree to which the findings, procedures, 
training, technology, or other results of the project can be transferred to other jurisdictions. 
2. ``Single jurisdiction'' concept papers submitted pursuant to section II.C. will be rated on the proposed project's
relation to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B., and on the special requirements
listed in section II.C.1. 
3. In determining which concept papers will be selected for development into full applications, the Institute will
also consider the availability of financial assistance from other sources for the project; the amount and nature
(cash or in-kind) of the applicant's anticipated match; whether the applicant is a State court, a national court support
or education organization, a non-court unit of government, or another type of entity eligible to receive grants under
the Institute's enabling legislation (see 42 U.S.C. 10705(b) (as amended) and section IV above); the extent to which
the proposed project would also benefit the Federal courts or help the State courts enforce Federal constitutional
and legislative requirements, and the level of appropriations available to the Institute in the current year and
the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years. 


C. Review Process 


Concept papers will be reviewed competitively by the Board of Directors. Institute staff will prepare a narrative
summary and a rating sheet assigning points for each relevant selection criterion for those concept papers which
fall within the scope of the Institute's funding program and merit serious consideration by the Board. Staff will
also prepare a list of those papers that, in the judgment of the Executive Director, propose projects that lie outside
the scope of the Institute's funding program or are not likely to merit serious consideration by the Board. The narrative
summaries, rating sheets, and list of non-reviewed papers will be presented to the Board for their review. Committees
of the Board will review concept paper summaries within assigned program areas and prepare recommendations for the
full Board. The full Board of Directors will then decide which concept paper applicants should be invited to submit
formal applications for funding. 
The decision to invite an application is solely that of the Board of Directors. With regard to concept papers requesting
a package grant, the Board retains discretion to invite an application including all, none, or selected portions
of the package for possible funding. 
The Board may waive the application requirement and approve a grant based on a concept paper for a project requiring
less than $40,000, when the need for and benefits of the project are clear, and the methodology and budget require little
additional explanation.

D. Submission Requirements 


An original and three copies of all concept papers submitted for consideration in Fiscal Year 1995 must be sent by first
class or overnight mail or by courier no later than November 23, 1994, except for concept papers proposing projects
that follow-up on the National Conference on the Managment of Mass Tort Cases which must be sent by March 10, 1995 (see
section II.B.2.l.), and concept papers proposing to implement an action plan developed during the National Conference
on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts which must be sent by October 6, 1995 (see section II.B.2.i.). A postmark
or courier receipt will constitute evidence of the submission date. All envelopes containing concept papers should
be marked CONCEPT PAPER and should be sent to: State Justice Institute, 1650 King Street, Suite 600, Alexandria, Virginia
22314. 
It is preferable for letters of cooperation and support to be appended to the concept paper when it is submitted. If
support letters are sent under separate cover, they must be received no later than January 13, 1995 in order to ensure
that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's attention. 
The Institute will send written notice to all persons submitting concept papers of the Board's decisions regarding
their papers and of the key issues and questions that arose during the review process. A decision by the Board not to
invite an application may not be appealed, but does not prohibit resubmission of the concept paper or a revision thereof
in a subsequent round of funding. The Institute will also notify the designated State contact listed in the Appendix
when the Board invites applications that are based on concept papers which are submitted by courts within their State
or which specify a participating site within their State. 
Receipt of each concept paper will be acknowledged in writing. Extensions of the deadline for submission of concept
papers will not be granted.


VII. Application Requirements for New Projects 


Except as specified in section VI., a formal application for a new project is to be submitted only upon invitation of
the Board following review of a concept paper. An application for Institute funding support must include an application
form; budget forms (with appropriate documentation); a project abstract and program narrative; a disclosure of
lobbying form, when applicable; and certain certifications and assurances. These documents are described below.



A. Forms 


1. Application Form (Form A) 


The application form requests basic information regarding the proposed project, the applicant, and the total amount
of funding support requested from the Institute. It also requires the signature of an individual authorized to certify
on behalf of the applicant that the information contained in the application is true and complete, that submission
of the application has been authorized by the applicant, and that if funding for the proposed project is approved,
the applicant will comply with the requirements and conditions of the award, including the assurances set forth in
Form D.

2. Certificate of State Approval (Form B) 


An application from a State or local court must include a copy of Form B signed by the State's Chief Justice or Chief Judge,
the director of the designated agency, or the head of the designated council. The signature denotes that the proposed
project has been approved by the State's highest court or the agency or council it has designated. It denotes further
that if funding for the project is approved by the Institute, the court or the specified designee will receive, administer,
and be accountable for the awarded funds. 


3. Budget Forms (Form C or C1) 


Applicants may submit the proposed project budget either in the tabular format of Form C or in the spreadsheet format
of Form C1. Applicants requesting more than $100,000 are strongly encouraged to use the spread-sheet format. If the
proposed project period is for more than a year, a separate form should be submitted for each year or portion of a year
for which grant support is requested. 
In addition to Form C or C1, applicants must provide a detailed budget narrative providing an explanation of the basis
for the estimates in each budget category. (See section VII.D.) 
Applications for a package grant must include a separate budget and budget narrative for each project included in
the proposed package, as well as a combined budget that reflects the total costs of the entire package. 
If funds from other sources are required to conduct the project, either as match or to support other aspects of the project,
the source, current status of the request, and anticipated decision date must be provided. 


4. Assurances (Form D) 


This form lists the statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements and conditions with which recipients of Institute
funds must comply. 


5. Disclosure of Lobbying Activities 


This form requires applicants other than units of State or local government to disclose whether they, or another entity
that is part of the same organization as the applicant, have advocated a position before Congress on any issue, and
to identify the specific subjects of their lobbying efforts. (See section X.D.) 


B. Project Abstract 


The abstract should highlight the purposes, goals, methods and anticipated benefits of the proposed project. It
should not exceed one single-spaced page on 81/2 by 11 inch paper. 


C. Program Narrative 


The program narrative for an application proposing a single project should not exceed 25 double-spaced pages on 81/2
by 11 inch paper. The program narrative for an application requesting a package grant for more than one project should
not exceed 40 double-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not be less than 1 inch, and type no smaller than
12-point and 12 cpi must be used. The page limit does not include the forms, the abstract, the budget narrative, and
any appendices containing resumes and letters of cooperation or endorsement. Additional background material should
be attached only if it is essential to obtaining a clear understanding of the proposed project. Numerous and lengthy
appendices are strongly discouraged. 
The program narrative should address the following topics: 


1. Project Objectives 


A clear, concise statement of what the proposed project is intended to accomplish. In stating the objectives of the
project, applicants should focus on the overall programmatic objective (e.g., to enhance understanding and skills
regarding a specific subject, or to determine how a certain procedure affects the court and litigants) rather than
on operational objectives (e.g., provide training for 32 judges and court managers, or review data from 300 cases).



2. Program Areas To Be Covered 


A statement which lists the program areas set forth in the State Justice Institute Act, and, if appropriate, the Institute's
Special Interest program categories that are addressed by the proposed projects.

<TEXT>
 

3. Need for the Project 


If the project is to be conducted in a specific location(s), a discussion of the particular needs of the project site(s)
to be addressed by the project and why those needs are not being met through the use of existing materials, programs,
procedures, services or other resources. 
If the project is not site specific, a discussion of the problems that the proposed project will address, and why existing
materials, programs, procedures, services or other resources do not adequately resolve those problems. The discussion
should include specific references to the relevant literature and to the experience in the field. 
An application requesting a package grant to support more than one project also must describe how the proposed projects
in the package are related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced if they were funded as a package
rather than as individual projects; and what disadvantages, if any, would accrue by considering or funding them separately.



4. Tasks, Methods and Evaluation 


a. 

Tasks and Methods.

 A delineation of the tasks to be performed in achieving the project objectives and the methods to be used for accomplishing
each task. For example: 
i. 

For research and evaluation projects,

 the data sources, data collection strategies, variables to be examined, and analytic procedures to be used for conducting
the research or evaluation and ensuring the validity and general applicability of the results. For projects involving
human subjects, the discussion of methods should address the procedures for obtaining respondents' informed consent,
ensuring the respondents' privacy and freedom from risk or harm, and the protection of others who are not the subjects
of research but would be affected by the research. If the potential exists for risk or harm to the human subjects, a discussion
should be included of the value of the proposed research and the methods to be used to minimize or eliminate such risk.

ii. 

For education and training projects,

 the adult education techniques to be used in designing and presenting the program, including the teaching/ learning
objectives of the educational design, the teaching methods to be used, and the opportunities for structured interaction
among the participants; how faculty will be recruited, selected, and trained; the proposed number and length of the
conferences, courses, seminars or workshops to be conducted; the materials to be provided and how they will be developed;
and the cost to participants. 
iii. 

For demonstration projects,

 the demonstration sites and the reasons they were selected, or if the sites have not been chosen, how they will be identified
and their cooperation obtained; how the program or procedures will be implemented and monitored. 
iv. 

For technical assistance projects,

 the types of assistance that will be provided; the particular issues and problems for which assistance will be provided;
how requests will be obtained and the type of assistance determined; how suitable providers will be selected and briefed;
how reports will be reviewed; and the cost to recipients.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00133 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An application requesting a package grant for more than one project must describe separately the tasks associated
with each project in the proposed package. Each project must be identified by a separate letter of the alphabet (i.e.,
A, B, C) and a descriptive title. 

b. 

Evaluation. 

Every project design must include an evaluation plan to determine whether the project met its objectives. The evaluation
should be designed to provide an objective and independent assessment of the effectiveness or usefulness of the training
or services provided; the impact of the procedures, technology or services tested; or the validity and applicability
of the research conducted. In addition, where appropriate, the evaluation process should be designed to provide
ongoing or periodic feedback on the effectiveness or utility of particular programs, educational offerings, or
achievements which can then be further refined as a result of the evaluation process. The plan should present the qualifications
of the evaluator(s); describe the criteria, related to the project's programmatic objectives, that will be used
to evaluate the project's effectiveness; explain how the evaluation will be conducted, including the specific data
collection and analysis techniques to be used; discuss why this approach is appropriate; and present a schedule for
completion of the evaluation within the proposed project period. 

The evaluation plan should be appropriate to the type of project proposed. For example: 

i. An evaluation approach suited to many 

research 

projects is a review by an advisory panel of the research methodology, data collection instruments, preliminary
analyses, and products as they are drafted. The panel should be comprised of independent researchers and practitioners
representing the perspectives affected by the proposed project. 

ii. The most valuable approaches to evaluating 

educational or training 

programs will serve to reinforce the participants' learning experience while providing useful feedback on the impact
of the program and possible areas for improvement. One appropriate evaluation approach is to assess the acquisition
of new knowledge, skills, attitudes or understanding through participant feedback on the seminar or training event.
Such feedback might include a self-assessment on what was learned along with the participant's response to the quality
and effectiveness of faculty presentations, the format of sessions, the value or usefulness of the material presented
and other relevant factors. Another appropriate approach would be to use an independent observer who might request
verbal as well as written responses from participants in the program. When an education project involves the development
of curricular materials an advisory panel of relevant experts can be coupled with a test of the curriculum to obtain
the reactions of participants and faculty as indicated above. 

iii. The evaluation plan for a 

demonstration 

project should encompass an assessment of program effectiveness (e.g., how well did it work?); user satisfaction,
if appropriate; the cost-effectiveness of the program; a process analysis of the program (e.g., was the program implemented
as designed? did it provide the services intended to the targeted population?); the impact of the program (e.g., what
effect did the program have on the court? what benefits resulted from the program?); and the replicability of the program
or components of the program. 

iv. For 

technical assistance 

projects, applicants should explain how the quality, timeliness, and impact of the assistance provided will be determined,
and should develop a mechanism for feedback from both the users and providers of the technical assistance. 

v. Evaluation plans involving 

human subjects 

should include a discussion of the procedures for obtaining respondents' informed consent, ensuring the respondents'
privacy and freedom from risk or harm, and the protection of others who are not the subjects of evaluation but would
be affected by it. Other than the provision of confidentiality to respondents, human subjects protection issues
ordinarily are not applicable to participants evaluating an education program. 

vi. The evaluation plan in a package grant application should address the issues listed above for the particular types
of projects included in the package, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the individual components as well
as the benefits and limitations of the projects as a package.

5. Project Management 



A detailed management plan including the starting and completion date for each task; the time commitments to the project
of key staff and their responsibilities regarding each project task; and the procedures that will be used to ensure
that all tasks are performed on time, within budget, and at the highest level of quality. In preparing the project time
line, Gantt Chart, or schedule, applicants should make certain that all project activities, including publication
or reproduction of project products and their initial dissemination will occur within the proposed project period.
The management plan must also provide for the submission of Quarterly Progress and Financial Reports within 30 days
after the close of each calendar quarter (i.e., no later than January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30). 

Package grant applications must include a management plan for each project included in the package with the same project
title and alphabetic identifier describing the project in the program narrative, as well as a plan embracing the package
as a whole. 



6. Products 



A description of the products to be developed by the project (e.g., training curricula and materials, videotapes,
articles, manuals, or handbooks), including when they will be submitted to the Institute. The application must explain
how and to whom the products will be disseminated; describe how they will benefit the State courts including how they
can be used by judges and court personnel; identify development, production, and dissemination costs covered by
the project budget; and present the basis on which products and services developed or provided under the grant will
be offered to the courts community and the public at large (i.e. whether products will be distributed at no cost to recipients,
or if costs are involved, the reason for charging recipients and the estimated price of the product). Ordinarily,
applicants should schedule all product preparation and distribution activities within the project period. Applicants
also should provide for the preparation of a one-page abstract summarizing products resulting from a project for
inclusion on the Institute's electronic bulletin board. 

Package grant applications must discuss these issues with regard to the products that would result from each of the
projects included in the package. 

The type of products to be prepared depend on the nature of the project. For example, in most instances, the products
of a research, evaluation, or demonstration project should include an article summarizing the project findings
that is publishable in a journal serving the courts community nationally, an executive summary that will be disseminated
to the project's primary audience, or both. Applicants proposing to conduct empirical research or evaluation projects
with national import should describe how they will make their data available for secondary analysis after the grant
period. (See section X.W.) 

The curricula and other products developed by education and training projects should be designed for use outside
the classroom so that they may be used again by original participants and others in the course of their duties. 

Applicants must provide for submitting a final draft of the final grant product(s) to the Institute for review and
approval at least 30 days before the product(s) are submitted for publication or reproduction. No grant funds may
be obligated for publication or reproduction of a final grant product without the written approval of the Institute.


Applicants must also provide for including in all project products a prominent acknowledgment that support was received
from the Institute and a disclaimer paragraph based on the example provided in section X.Q. of the Guideline. The ``SJI''
logo must appear on the front cover of a written product, or in the opening frames of a video product, unless the Institute
approves another placement. 

Twenty copies of all project products, including videotapes, must be submitted to the Institute. In addition, a copy
of each product must be sent to the library established in each State to collect the materials developed with Institute
support. (A list of these libraries is contained in Appendix II.) To facilitate their use, all videotaped products
should be distributed in VHS format. For all wordprocessed products, grantees must submit a diskette of the text in
ASCII. For non-text products, a copy of the summary or a brief abstract in ASCII must be submitted.

7. Applicant Status 


An applicant that is not a State or local court and has not received a grant from the Institute within the past two years
should include a statement indicating whether it is either a national non-profit organization controlled by, operating
in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branches of State governments; or a national non-profit organization
for the education and training of State court judges and support personnel. See section IV. If the applicant is a non-judicial
unit of Federal, State, or local government, it must explain whether the proposed services could be adequately provided
by non-governmental entities. 


8. Staff Capability 


A summary of the training and experience of the key staff members and consultants that qualify them for conducting
and managing the proposed project. Resumes of identified staff should be attached to the application. If one or more
key staff members and consultants are not known at the time of the application, a description of the criteria that will
be used to select persons for these positions should be included. 


9. Organizational Capacity 


Applicants that have not received a grant from the Institute within the past two years should include a statement describing
the capacity of the applicant to administer grant funds including the financial systems used to monitor project expenditures
(and income, if any), and a summary of the applicant's past experience in administering grants, as well as any resources
or capabilities that the applicant has that will particularly assist in the successful completion of the project.

If the applicant is a non-profit organization (other than a university), it must also provide documentation of its
501(c) tax exempt status as determined by the Internal Revenue Service and a copy of a current certified audit report.
For purposes of this requirement, ``current'' means no earlier than two years prior to the current calendar year.
If a current audit report is not available, the Institute will require the organization to complete a financial capability
questionnaire which must be signed by a Certified Public Accountant. Other applicants may be required to provide
a current audit report, a financial capability questionnaire, or both, if specifically requested to do so by the Institute.

Unless requested otherwise, an applicant that has received a grant from the Institute within the past two years should
describe only the changes in its organizational capacity, tax status, or financial capability that may affect its
capacity to administer a grant. 


10. Statement of Lobbying Activities 


Non-governmental applicants must submit the Institute's Disclosure of Lobbying Activities Form that requires
them to state whether they, or another entity that is a part of the same organization as the applicant, have advocated
a position before Congress on any issue, and identifies the specific subjects of their lobbying efforts. 


11. Letters of Support for the Project 


If the cooperation of courts, organizations, agencies, or individuals other than the applicant is required to conduct
the project, written assurances of cooperation and availability should be attached as an appendix to the application,
or they may be sent under separate cover. In order to ensure that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's
attention, letters of support sent under separate cover must be received at least four weeks before the meeting of
the Board of Directors at which the application will be considered (i.e., no later than October 17, 1994, February
1, 1995, March 31, 1995, June 23, 1995, or August 18, 1995, respectively). 


D. Budget Narrative 


The budget narrative should provide the basis for the computation of all project-related costs. An application for
a package grant for more than one project must include a separate budget narrative for each project component, with
the same alphabetic identifier and project title used to describe each component project in the program narrative.
Additional background or schedules may be attached if they are essential to obtaining a clear understanding of the
proposed budget. Numerous and lengthy appendices are strongly discouraged. 
The budget narrative should cover the costs of all components of the project and clearly identify costs attributable
to the project evaluation. Under OMB grant guidelines incorporated by reference in this Guideline, grant funds may
not be used to pay for coffee breaks during seminars or meetings, or to purchase alcoholic beverages. 


1. Justification of Personnel Compensation 


The applicant should set forth the percentages of time to be devoted by the individuals who will serve as the staff of
the proposed project, the annual salary of each of those persons, and the number of work days per year used for calculating
the percentages of time or daily rate of those individuals. The applicant should explain any deviations from current
rates or established written organization policies. If grant funds are requested to pay the salary and related costs
for a current employee of a court or other unit of government, the applicant should explain why this would not constitute
a supplantation of State or local funds in violation of 42 U.S.C. 10706 (d)(1). An acceptable explanation may be that
the position to be filled is a new one established in conjunction with the project or that the grant funds will be supporting
only the portion of the employee's time that will be dedicated to new or additional duties related to the project. 


2. Fringe Benefit Computation 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00136 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The applicant should provide a description of the fringe benefits provided to employees. If percentages are used,
the authority for such use should be presented as well as a description of the elements included in the determination
of the percentage rate. 


3. Consultant/Contractual Services and Honoraria 


The applicant should describe the tasks each consultant will perform, the estimated total amount to be paid to each
consultant, the basis for compensation rates (e.g., number of days  x  the daily consultant rates), and the method
for selection. Rates for consultant services must be set in accordance with section XI.H.2.c. Honorarium payments
must be justified in the same manner as other consultant payments. 


4. Travel 


Transportation costs and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicant organization. If the applicant
does not have an established travel policy, then travel rates shall be consistent with those established by the Institute
or the Federal Government. (A copy of the Institute's travel policy is available upon request.) The budget narrative
should include an explanation of the rate used, including the components of the per diem rate and the basis for the estimated
transportation expenses. The purpose for travel should also be included in the narrative. 


5. Equipment 


Grant funds may be used to purchase only the equipment that is necessary to demonstrate a new technological application
in a court, or that is otherwise essential to accomplishing the objectives of the project. Equipment purchases to
support basic court operations ordinarily will not be approved. The applicant should describe the equipment to be
purchased or leased and explain why the acquisition of that equipment is essential to accomplish the project's goals
and objectives. The narrative should clearly identify which equipment is to be leased and which is to be purchased.
The method of procurement should also be described. Purchases for automatic data processing equipment must comply
with section XI.H.2.b. 


6. Supplies 


The applicant should provide a general description of the supplies necessary to accomplish the goals and objectives
of the grant. In addition, the applicant should provide the basis for the amount requested for this expenditure category.



7. Construction 


Construction expenses are prohibited except for the limited purposes set forth in section X.H.2. Any allowable construction
or renovation expense should be described in detail in the budget narrative. 


8. Telephone 


Applicants should include anticipated telephone charges, distinguishing between monthly charges and long distance
charges in the budget narrative. Also, applicants should provide the basis used in developing the monthly and long
distance estimates. 


9. Postage 


Anticipated postage costs for project-related mailings should be described in the budget narrative. The cost of
special mailings, such as for a survey or for announcing a workshop, should be distinguished from routine operational
mailing costs. The bases for all postage estimates should be included in the justification material. 


10. Printing/Photocopying 


Anticipated costs for printing or photocopying should be included in the budget narrative. Applicants should provide
the details underlying these estimates in support of the request. 


11. Indirect Costs 


Applicants should describe the indirect cost rates applicable to the grant in detail. If costs often included within
an indirect cost rate are charged directly (e.g., a percentage of the time of senior managers to supervise product
activities), the applicant should specify that these costs are not included within their approved indirect cost
rate. These rates must be established in accordance with section XI.H.4. If the applicant has an indirect cost rate
or allocation plan approved by any Federal granting agency, a copy of the approved rate agreement should be attached
to the application.

12. Match 


The applicant should describe the source of any matching contribution and the nature of the match provided. Any additional
contributions to the project should be described in this section of the budget narrative as well. If in-kind match
is to be provided, the applicant should describe how the amount and value of the time, services or materials actually
contributed will be documented sufficiently clearly to permit them to be included in an audit of the grant. Applicants
should be aware that the time spent by participants in education courses does not qualify as in-kind match. (Samples
of forms used by current grantees to track in-kind match are available from the Institute upon request.) 
Applicants that do not contemplate making matching contributions continuously throughout the course of the project
or on a task-by-task basis must provide a schedule within 30 days after the beginning of the project period indicating
at what points during the project period the matching contributions will be made. (See sections III.F., VIII.B.,
X.B. and XI.D.1.) 


E. Submission Requirements 


1. An application package containing the application, an original signature on FORM A (and on FORM B, if the application
is from a State or local court, or on the Disclosure of Lobbying Form if the applicant is not a unit of State or local government),
and four photo-copies of the application package must be sent by first class or overnight mail, or by courier no later
than May 10, 1995. A postmark or courier receipt will constitute evidence of the submission date. Please mark application
on all application package envelopes and send to: State Justice Institute, 1650 King Street, Suite 600, Alexandria,
Virginia 22314. 
Receipt of each proposal will be acknowledged in writing. Extensions of the deadline for receipt of applications
will not be granted. 
2. Applicants invited to submit more than one application may include material that would be identical in each application
in a cover letter, and incorporate that material by reference in each application. The incorporated material will
be counted against the 25-page (or in the case of package grant applications, the 40-page) limit for the program narrative.
A copy of the cover letter should be attached to each copy of each application. 
3. It is preferable for letters of cooperation or support to be appended to the application when it is submitted. If
support letters are sent under separate cover, they must be received no later than four weeks before the meeting of
the Board of Directors at which the application will be considered (i.e. no later than October 17, 1994, February 1,
1995, March 31, 1995, June 23, 1995, or August 18, 1995, respectively) in order to ensure that there is sufficient time
to bring them to the Board's attention.

VIII. Application Review Procedures


A. Preliminary Inquiries 


The Institute staff will answer inquiries concerning application procedures. The staff contact will be named in
the Institute's letter inviting submission of a formal application. 


B. Selection Criteria 


1. All applications will be rated on the basis of the criteria set forth below. The Institute will accord the greatest
weight to the following criteria: 
a. The soundness of the methodology; 
b. The appropriateness of the proposed evaluation design; 
c. The qualifications of the project's staff; 
d. The applicant's management plan and organizational capabilities; 
e. The reasonableness of the proposed budget; 
f. The demonstration of need for the project; 
g. The products and benefits resulting from the project; 
h. The demonstration of cooperation and support of other agencies that may be affected by the project; 
i. The proposed project's relationship to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B.;
and 
j. The degree to which the findings, procedures, training, technology, or other results of the project can be transferred
to other jurisdictions. 
2. ``Single jurisdiction'' applications submitted pursuant to section II.C.1. will also be rated on the proposed
project's relation to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B. and on the special requirements
listed in section II.C.1.b. 
3. In determining which applicants to fund, the Institute will also consider whether the applicant is a State court,
a national court support or education organization, a non-court unit of government, or other type of entity eligible
to receive grants under the Institute's enabling legislation (see 42 U.S.C. 10705(6) (as amended) and Section IV
above); the availability of financial assistance from other sources for the project; the amount and nature (cash
or in-kind) of the applicant's match; the extent to which the proposed project would also benefit the Federal courts
or help the State courts enforce Federal constitutional and legislative requirements; and the level of appropriations
available to the Institute in the current year and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years.



C. Review and Approval Process 


Applications will be reviewed competitively by the Board of Directors. The Institute staff will prepare a narrative
summary of each application, and a rating sheet assigning points for each relevant selection criterion. When necessary,
applications may also be reviewed by outside experts. Committees of the Board will review applications within assigned
program categories and prepare recommendations to the full Board. The full Board of Directors will then decide which
applications to approve for a grant. The decision to award a grant is solely that of the Board of Directors. 
Awards approved by the Board will be signed by the Chairman of the Board on behalf of the Institute. 


D. Return Policy 


Unless a specific request is made, unsuccessful applications will not be returned. Applicants are advised that Institute
records are subject to the provisions of the Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. 


E. Notification of Board Decision 


The Institute will send written notice to applicants concerning all Board decisions to approve or deny their respective
applications and the key issues and questions that arose during the review process. A decision by the Board to deny
an application may not be appealed, but does not prohibit resubmission of a concept paper based on that application
in a subsequent round of funding. The Institute will also notify the designated State contact listed in Appendix I
when grants are approved by the Board to support projects that will be conducted by or involve courts in their State.


F. Response to Notification of Approval 


Applicants have 30 days from the date of the letter notifying them that the Board has approved their application to
respond to any revisions requested by the Board. If the requested revisions (or a reasonable schedule for submitting
such revisions) have not been submitted to the Institute within 30 days after notification, the approval will be automatically
rescinded and the application presented to the Board for reconsideration.

IX. Renewal Funding Procedures and Requirements 


The Institute recognizes two types of renewal funding as described below_``continuation grants'' and ``on-going
support grants.'' The award of an initial grant to support a project does not constitute a commitment by the Institute
to renew funding. The Board of Directors anticipates allocating no more than $3 million of available FY 1995 grant
funds for renewal grants. 


A. Continuation Grants 


1. Purpose and Scope 


Continuation grants are intended to support projects with a limited duration that involve the same type of activities
as the previous project. They are intended to enhance the specific program or service produced or established during
the prior grant period. They may be used, for example, when a project is divided into two or more sequential phases,
for secondary analysis of data obtained in an Institute-supported research project, or for more extensive testing
of an innovative technology, procedure, or program developed with SJI grant support. 
In order for a project to be considered for continuation funding, the grantee must have completed the project tasks
and met all grant requirements and conditions in a timely manner, absent extenuating circumstances or prior Institute
approval of changes to the project design. Continuation grants are not intended to provide support for a project for
which the grantee has underestimated the amount of time or funds needed to accomplish the project tasks. 

A continuation grant may be awarded for either a single project or for more than one project as a package grant (see sections
III.J., V.C.1 and 3, and V.D.1 and 3). 


2. Application Procedures_Letters of Intent 


In lieu of a concept paper, a grantee seeking a continuation grant must inform the Institute, by letter, of its intent
to submit an application for such funding as soon as the need for renewal funding becomes apparent but no less than 120
days before the end of the current grant period. 
a. A letter of intent must be no more than 3 single-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper and must contain a concise but
thorough explanation of the need for continuation; an estimate of the funds to be requested; and a brief description
of anticipated changes in scope, focus or audience of the project. 
b. Letters of intent will not be reviewed competitively. Institute staff will review the proposed activities for
the next project period and, within 30 days of receiving a letter of intent, inform the grantee of specific issues to
be addressed in the continuation application and the date by which the application for a continuation grant must be
submitted. 


3. Application Format 


An application for a continuation grant must include an application form, budget forms (with appropriate documentation),
a project abstract conforming to the format set forth in section VII.B., a program narrative, a budget narrative,
a disclosure of lobbying form from (applicants other than units of State or local government), and certain certifications
and assurances. 

The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirements set forth in section VII.C. However, rather
than the topics listed in section VII.C., the program narrative of an application for a continuation grant should
include: 
a. 

Project Objectives. 

A clear, concise statement of what the continuation project is intended to accomplish. 
b. 

Need for Continuation. 

An explanation of why continuation of the project is necessary to achieve the goals of the project, and how the continuation
will benefit the participating courts or the courts community generally. That is, to what extent will the original
goals and objectives of the project be unful-filled if the project is not continued, and conversely, how will the findings
or results of the project be enhanced by continuing the project? 
A continuation application requesting a package grant to support more than one project should explain, in addition,
how the proposed projects are related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced by the grant; the
advantages of funding the projects as a package rather than individually; and the disadvantages, if any, that would
accrue by considering or funding them separately.

<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. 

Report of Current Project Activities. 

A discussion of the status of all activities conducted during the previous project period. Applicants should identify
any activities that were not completed, and explain why. A continuation application requesting a package grant must
describe separately the activities undertaken in each of the projects included within the proposed package. 
d. 

Evaluation Findings. 

The key findings, impact, or recommendations resulting from the evaluation of the project, if they are available,
and how they will be addressed during the proposed continuation. If the findings are not yet available, applicants
should provide the date by which they will be submitted to the Institute. Ordinarily, the Board will not consider an
application for continuation funding until the Institute has received the evaluator's report. 
e. 

Tasks, Methods, Staff and Grantee Capability. 

A full description of any changes in the tasks to be performed, the methods to be used, the products of the project, how
and to whom those products will be disseminated, the assigned staff, or the grantee's organizational capacity. Applicants
should include, in addition, the criteria and methods by which the proposed continuation project would be evaluated.

A continuation application for a package grant must address these issues separately for each project included in
the proposed package, using the same alphabetic identifiers and project titles as in the original application. 
f. 

Task Schedule.

 A detailed task schedule and time line for the next project period. A continuation application for a package grant
should include a separate task schedule and timeline for each project included in the proposed package, as well as
a schedule and time line that covers the package of projects as a whole. The same alphabetic identifiers and project
titles used in the original application should be used to identify the component projects in the renewal application.

g. 

Other Sources of Support. 

An indication of why other sources of support are inadequate, inappropriate or unavailable. 


4. Budget and Budget Narrative 


Provide a complete budget and budget narrative conforming to the requirements set forth in paragraph VII.D. Changes
in the funding level requested should be discussed in terms of corresponding increases or decreases in the scope of
activities or services to be rendered. 
A continuation application for a package grant must include a separate budget narrative identified alphabetically
(i.e. A, B, C) and by project title for each project component. 


5. References to Previously Submitted Material 


An application for a continuation grant should not repeat information contained in a previously approved application
or other previously submitted materials, but should provide specific references to such materials where appropriate.



6. Submission Requirements, Review and Approval Process, and Notification of Decision 


The submission requirements set forth in section VII.E., other than the deadline for mailing, apply to applications
for a continuation grant. Such applications will be rated on the selection criteria set forth in section VIII.B. The
key findings and recommendations resulting from an evaluation of the project and the proposed response to those findings
and recommendations will also be considered. The review and approval process, return policy, and notification procedures
are the same as those for new projects set forth in sections VIII.C.-VIII.E. 


B. On-Going Support Grants 


1. Purpose and Scope 


On-going support grants are intended to support projects that are national in scope and that provide the State courts
with services, programs or products for which there is a continuing important need. An on-going support grant may
also be used to fund longitudinal research that directly benefits the State courts. On-going support grants are subject
to the limits on size and duration set forth in V.C.2 and V.D.2. A project is eligible for consideration for an on-going
support grant if: 
a. The project is supported by and has been evaluated under a grant from the Institute; 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00141 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. The project is national in scope and provides a significant benefit to the State courts; 

c. There is a continuing important need for the services, programs or products provided by the project as indicated
by the level of use and support by members of the court community; 

d. The project is accomplishing its objectives in an effective and efficient manner; and 

e. It is likely that the service or program provided by the project would be curtailed or significantly reduced without
Institute support. 

Each project supported by an on-going support grant must include an evaluation component assessing its effectiveness
and operation throughout the grant period. The evaluation should be independent, but may be designed collaboratively
by the evaluator and the grantee. The design should call for regular feedback from the evaluator to the grantee throughout
the project period concerning recommendations for midcourse corrections or improvement of the project, as well
as periodic reports to the Institute at relevant points in the project. 

An interim evaluation report must be submitted 18 months into the grant period. The decision to obligate Institute
funds to support the third year of the project will be based on the interim evaluation findings and the applicant's
response to any deficiencies noted in the report. 

A final evaluation assessing the effectiveness, operation of, and continuing need for the project must be submitted
90 days before the end of the three-year project period. 

In addition, a detailed annual task schedule must be submitted not later than 45 days before the end of the first and
second years of the grant period, along with an explanation of any necessary revisions in the projected costs for the
remainder of the project period. (See also section IX.B.3.h.) 



2. Application Procedures_Letters of Intent 



The Board will consider awarding an on-going support grant for a period of up to 36 months. The total amount of the grant
will be fixed at the time of the initial award. Funds ordinarily will be made available in annual increments as specified
in section V.C.2. 

In lieu of a concept paper, a grantee seeking an on-going support grant must inform the Institute, by letter, of its
intent to submit an application for such funding as soon as the need for renewal funding becomes apparent but no less
than 120 days before the end of the current grant period. The letter of intent should be in the same format as that prescribed
for continuation grants in section IX.A.2.a. 



3. Application Procedures and Format 



An application for an on-going support grant must include an application form, budget forms (with appropriate documentation),
a project abstract conforming to the format set forth in section VII.B., a program narrative, a budget narrative,
and certain certifications and assurances. 

The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirements set forth in section VII.C. However, rather
than the topics listed in section VII.C., the program narrative of applications for on-going support grants should
address: 

a. 

Description of Need for and Benefits of the Project. 

Provide a detailed discussion of the benefits provided by the project to the State courts around the country, including
the degree to which State courts, State court judges, or State court managers and personnel are using the services
or programs provided by the project. 

An application for on-going support of a package grant should explain, in addition, how the proposed projects are
related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced by the grant; the advantages of funding the projects
as a package rather than individually; and the disadvantages, if any, that would accrue by considering or funding
them separately. 

b. 

Demonstration of Court Support. 

Demonstrate support for the continuation of the project from the courts community. 

c. 

Report on Current Project Activities. 

Discuss the extent to which the project has met its goals and objectives, identify any activities that have not been
completed, and explain why. An application for on-going support of a package grant must describe separately the activities
undertaken in each of the projects included within the proposed package. 

d. 

Evaluation Findings. 

Attach a copy of the final evaluation report regarding the effectiveness, impact, and operation of the project, specify
the key findings or recommendations resulting from the evaluation, and explain how they will be addressed during
the proposed renewal period. Ordinarily, the Board will not consider an application for on-going support until the
Institute has received the evaluator's report. 

e. 

Objectives, Tasks, Methods, Staff and Grantee Capability. 

Describe fully any changes in the objectives; tasks to be performed; the methods to be used; the products of the project;
how and to whom those products will be disseminated; the assigned staff; and the grantee's organizational capacity.


An application for on-going support of a package grant must address these issues separately for each project included
in the proposed package, using the same alphabetic identifiers and project titles as in the original application.

f. 

Task Schedule

. Present a general schedule for the full proposed project period and a detailed task schedule for the first year of
the proposed new project period. An application for on-going support of a package grant should include a separate
task schedule and timeline for each project included in the proposed package, as well as a schedule and time line that
covers the package of projects as a whole. The same alphabetic identifiers and project titles used in the original
application should be used to identify the component projects in the renewal application. 

g. 

Other Sources of Support

. Indicate why other sources of support are inadequate, inappropriate or unavailable. 



4. Budget and Budget Narrative 



Provide a complete three-year budget and budget narrative conforming to the requirements set forth in paragraph
VII.D. Changes in the funding level requested should be discussed in terms of corresponding increases or decreases
in the scope of activities or services to be rendered. A complete budget narrative should be provided for each year,
or portion of a year, for which grant support is requested. Changes in the funding level requested should be discussed
in terms of corresponding increases or decreases in the scope of activities or services to be rendered. The budget
should provide for realistic cost-of-living and staff salary increases over the course of the requested project
period. Applicants should be aware that the Institute is unlikely to approve a supplemental budget increase for an
on-going support grant in the absence of well-documented, unanticipated factors that clearly justify the requested
increase. 

A continuation application for a package grant must include a separate budget narrative identified alphabetically
(i.e. A, B, C) and by project title for each project component. 



5. References to Previously Submitted Material 



An application for an on-going support grant should not repeat information contained in a previously approved application
or other previously submitted materials, but should provide specific references to such materials where appropriate.




6. Submission Requirements, Review and Approval Process, and Notification of Decision 



The submission requirements set forth in section VII.E., other than the deadline for mailing, apply to applications
for an on-going support grant. Such applications will be rated on the selection criteria set forth in section VIII.B.
The key findings and recommendations resulting from an evaluation of the project and the proposed response to those
findings and recommendations will also be considered. The review and approval process, return policy, and notification
procedures are the same as those for new projects set forth in sections VIII.C.-VIII.E.

X. Compliance Requirements 


The State Justice Institute Act contains limitations and conditions on grants, contracts and cooperative agreements
of which applicants and recipients should be aware. In addition to eligibility requirements which must be met to be
considered for an award from the Institute, all applicants should be aware of and all recipients will be responsible
for ensuring compliance with the following: 


A. State and Local Court Systems 


Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved, consistent with State law, by the State's
Supreme Court, or its designated agency or council. The latter shall receive, administer, and be accountable for
all funds awarded to such courts. 42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(4). Appendix I to this Guideline lists the agencies, councils
and contact persons designated to administer Institute awards to the State and local courts. 


B. Matching Requirements 


1. All awards to courts or other units of State or local government (not including publicly supported institu-tions
of higher education) require a match from private or public sources of not less than 50% of the total amount of the Institute's
award. For example, if the total cost of a project is anticipated to be $150,000, a State court or executive branch agency
may request up to $100,000 from the Institute to implement the project. The remaining $50,000 (50% of the $100,000
requested from SJI) must be provided as a match. A cash match, non-cash match, or both may be provided, but the Institute
will give preference to those applicants who provide a cash match to the Institute's award. (For a further definition
of match, see section III.F.) 
The requirement to provide match may be waived in exceptionally rare circumstances upon approval of the Chief Justice
of the highest court in the State and a majority of the Board of Directors. 42 U.S.C. 10705(d). 
2. Other eligible recipients of Institute funds are not required to provide a match, but are encouraged to contribute
to meeting the costs of the project. In instances where match is proposed, the grantee is responsible for ensuring
that the total amount proposed is actually contributed. If a proposed contribution is not fully met, the Institute
may reduce the award amount accordingly, in order to maintain the ratio originally provided for in the award agreement
(see sections VIII.B. above and XI.D.). 


C. Conflict of Interest 


Personnel and other officials connected with Institute-funded programs shall adhere to the following requirements:

1. No official or employee of a recipient court or organization shall participate personally through decision, approval,
disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise in any proceeding, application,
request for a ruling or other determination, contract, grant, cooperative agreement, claim, controversy, or other
particular matter in which Institute funds are used, where to his/her knowledge he/she or his/her immediate family,
partners, organi-zation other than a public agency in which he/she is serving as officer, director, trustee, partner,
or employee or any person or organization with whom he/she is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective
employment, has a financial interest. 
2. In the use of Institute project funds, an official or employee of a recipient court or organization shall avoid any
action which might result in or create the appearance of: 
a. Using an official position for private gain; or 
b. Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of the Institute program. 
3. Requests for proposals or invitations for bids issued by a recipient of Institute funds or a subgrantee or subcontractor
will provide notice to prospective bidders that the contractors who develop or draft specifications, requirements,
statements of work and/or requests for proposals for a proposed procurement will be excluded from bidding on or submitting
a proposal to compete for the award of such procurement. 


D. Lobbying 


Funds awarded to recipients by the Institute shall not be used, indirectly or directly, to influence Executive orders
or similar promulgations by Federal, State or local agencies, or to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation
by Federal, State or local legislative bodies. 42 U.S.C. 10706(a). 
It is the policy of the Board of Directors to award funds only to support applications submitted by organizations that
would carry out the objectives of their applications in an unbiased manner. Consistent with this policy and the provisions
of 42 U.S.C. 10706, the Institute will not knowingly award a grant to an applicant that has, directly or through an entity
that is part of the same organization as the applicant, advocated a position before Congress on the specific subject
matter of the application. 


E. Political Activities 


No recipient shall contribute or make available Institute funds, program personnel, or equipment to any political
party or association, or the campaign of any candidate for public or party office. Recipients are also prohibited
from using funds in advocating or opposing any ballot measure, initiative, or referendum. Finally, officers and
employees of recipients shall not intentionally identify the Institute or recipients with any partisan or nonpartisan
political activity associated with a political party or association, or the campaign of any candidate for public
or party office. 42 U.S.C. 10706(a).

F. Advocacy 


No funds made available by the Institute may be used to support or conduct training programs for the purpose of advocating
particular nonjudicial public policies or encouraging nonjudicial political activities. 42 U.S.C. 10706(b).



G. Prohibition Against Litigation Support 


No funds made available by the Institute may be used directly or indirectly to support legal assistance to parties
in litigation, including cases involving capital punishment. 


H. Supplantation and Construction 


To ensure that funds are used to supplement and improve the operation of State courts, rather than to support basic
court services, funds shall not be used for the following purposes: 
1. To supplant State or local funds supporting a program or activity (such as paying the salary of court employees who
would be performing their normal duties as part of the project, or paying rent for space which is part of the court's
normal operations); 
2. To construct court facilities or structures, except to remodel existing facilities or to demonstrate new architectural
or technological techniques, or to provide temporary facilities for new personnel or for personnel involved in a
demonstration or experimental program; or 
3. Solely to purchase equipment. 


I. Confidentiality of Information 


Except as provided by Federal law other than the State Justice Institute Act, no recipient of financial assistance
from SJI may use or reveal any research or statistical information furnished under the Act by any person and identifiable
to any specific private person for any purpose other than the purpose for which the information was obtained. Such
information and copies thereof shall be immune from legal process, and shall not, without the consent of the person
furnishing such information, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action, suit, or other judicial,
legislative, or administrative proceedings. 



J. Human Research Protection 


All research involving human subjects shall be conducted with the informed consent of those subjects and in a manner
that will ensure their privacy and freedom from risk or harm and the protection of persons who are not subjects of the
research but would be affected by it, unless such procedures and safeguards would make the research impractical.
In such instances, the Institute must approve procedures designed by the grantee to provide human subjects with relevant
information about the research after their involvement and to minimize or eliminate risk or harm to those subjects
due to their participation. 


K. Nondiscrimination 


No person may, on the basis of race, sex, national origin, disability, color, or creed be excluded from participation
in, denied the benefits of, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity supported by Institute
funds. Recipients of Institute funds must immediately take any measures necessary to effectuate this provision.



L. Reporting Requirements 


Recipients of Institute funds, other than scholarships awarded under section II.B.2.b.v., shall submit Quarterly
Progress and Financial Reports within 30 days of the close of each calendar quarter (that is, no later than January
30, April 30, July 30, and October 30). Two copies of each report must be sent. The Quarterly Progress Reports shall
include a narrative description of project activities during the calendar quarter, the relationship between those
activities and the task schedule and objectives set forth in the approved application or an approved adjustment thereto,
any significant problem areas that have developed and how they will be resolved, and the activities scheduled during
the next reporting period. 
The quarterly financial status report shall be submitted in accordance with section XI.G.2. of this guideline. A
final project progress report and financial status report shall be submitted within 90 days after the end of the grant
period in accordance with section XI.K.2. of this Guideline.

M. Audit



Each recipient must provide for an annual fiscal audit which shall include an opinion on whether the financial statements
of the grantee present fairly its financial position and financial operations are in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. For grantees receiving more than $50,000 in Institute grant payments during their fiscal
year, the audit shall also include reports on the grantee's internal control structure and compliance with applicable
regulations. (See section XI.J. of the Guideline for the requirements of such audits.)



N. Suspension of Funding



After providing a recipient reasonable notice and opportunity to submit written documentation demonstrating why
fund termination or suspension should not occur, the Institute may terminate or suspend funding of a project that
fails to comply substantially with the Act, Institute guidelines, or the terms and conditions of the award. 42 U.S.C.
10708(a).



O. Title to Property



At the conclusion of the project, title to all expendable and nonexpendable personal property purchased with Institute
funds shall vest in the recipient court, organization, or individual that purchased the property if certification
is made to the Institute that the property will continue to be used for the authorized purposes of the Institute-funded
project or other purposes consistent with the State Justice Institute Act, as approved by the Institute. If such certification
is not made or the Institute disapproves such certification, title to all such property with an aggregate or individual
value of $1,000 or more shall vest in the Institute, which will direct the disposition of the property.



P. Original Material



All products prepared as the result of Institute-supported projects must be originally-developed material unless
otherwise specified in the award documents. Material not originally developed that is included in such products
must be properly identified, whether the material is in a verbatim or extensive paraphrase format.



Q. Acknowledgment and Disclaimer

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00146 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Recipients of Institute funds shall acknowledge prominently on all products developed with grant funds that support
was received from the Institute. The ``SJI'' logo must appear on the front cover of a written product, or in the opening
frames of a video product, unless another placement is approved in writing by the Institute. A camera-ready logo sheet
is available from the Institute upon request. 
Recipients also shall display the following disclaimer on all grant products:

 

This [document, film, videotape, etc.] was developed under [grant/cooperative agreement, number SJI-(insert
number)] from the State Justice Institute. The points of view expressed are those of the [author(s), filmmaker(s),
etc.] and do not necessarily represent the official position or policies of the State Justice Institute. 


R. Institute Approval of Grant Products 


No grant funds may be obligated for publication or reproduction of a final product developed with grant funds without
the written approval of the Institute. Grantees shall submit a final draft of each such product to the Institute for
review and approval. These drafts shall be submitted sufficiently before the product is scheduled to be sent for publication
or reproduction to permit Institute review and incorporation of any appropriate changes agreed upon by the grantee
and the Institute. 


S. Distribution of Grant Products to State Libraries 


Grantees shall send 20 copies of each final product developed with grant funds to the Institute, unless the product
was developed under either a curriculum adaptation or a technical assistance grant, in which case submission of 2
copies is required. 
Grantees shall send one copy of each final product developed with grant funds to the library established in each State
to collect materials prepared with Institute support. (A list of these libraries is contained in Appendix II. Labels
for these libraries are available from the Institute upon request.) Recipients of curriculum adaptation and technical
assistance grants are not required to submit final products to State libraries. 


T. Copyrights 


Except as otherwise provided in the terms and conditions of an Institute award, a recipient is free to copyright any
books, publications, or other copyrightable materials developed in the course of an Institute-supported project,
but the Institute shall reserve a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise
use, and to authorize others to use, the materials for purposes consistent with the State Justice Institute Act. 


U. Inventions and Patents 


If any patentable items, patent rights, processes, or inventions are produced in the course of Institute-sponsored
work, such fact shall be promptly and fully reported to the Institute. Unless there is a prior agreement between the
grantee and the Institute on disposition of such items, the Institute shall determine whether protection of the invention
or discovery shall be sought. The Institute will also determine how the rights in the invention or discovery, including
rights under any patent issued thereon, shall be allocated and administered in order to protect the public interest
consistent with ``Government Patent Policy'' (President's Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies,
February 18, 1983, and statement of Government Patent Policy). 


V. Charges for Grant-Related Products/Recovery of Costs

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00147 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

When Institute funds fully cover the cost of developing, producing, and disseminating a product, (e.g., a report,
curriculum, videotape or software), the product should be distributed to the field without charge. When Institute
funds only partially cover the development, production, or dissemination costs, the grantee may recover its costs
for developing, reproducing, and disseminating the material to those requesting it, to the extent that those costs
were not covered by Institute funds or grantee matching contributions. 
Applicants should disclose their intent to sell grant-related products in both the concept paper and the application.
Grantees must obtain the written, prior approval of the Institute of their plans to recover project costs through
the sale of grant products. 
Written requests to recover costs ordinarily should be received during the grant period and should specify the nature
and extent of the costs to be recouped, the reason that such costs were not budgeted (if the rationale was not disclosed
in the approved application), the number of copies to be sold, the intended audience for the products to be sold, and
the proposed sale price. If the product is to be sold for more than $25.00, the written request also should include a
detailed itemization of costs that will be recovered and a certification that the costs were not supported by either
Institute grant funds or grantee matching contributions. 
If, following the end of the grant period, the sale of grant products results in revenues that exceed those costs, the
revenue must continue to be used for the authorized purposes of the Institute-funded project or other purposes consistent
with the State Justice Institute Act that have been approved by the Institute. See sections III.G. and XI.F. for requirements
regarding project-related income. 


W. Availability of Research Data for Secondary Analysis 


Upon request, grantees must make available for secondary analysis a diskette(s) or data tape(s) containing research
and evaluation data collected under an Institute grant and the accompanying code manual. Grantees may recover the
actual cost of duplicating and mailing or otherwise transmitting the data set and manual from the person or organization
requesting the data. Grantees may provide the requested data set in the format in which it was created and analyzed.



X. Approval of Key Staff 


If the qualifications of an employee or consultant assigned to a key project staff position are not described in the
application or if there is a change of a person assigned to such a position, a recipient shall submit a description of
the qualifications of the newly assigned person to the Institute. Prior written approval of the qualifications of
the new person assigned to a key staff position must be received from the Institute before the salary or consulting
fee of that person and associated costs may be paid or reimbursed from grant funds.

XI. Financial Requirements 


A. Accounting Systems and Financial Records 


All grantees, subgrantees, contractors, and other organizations directly or indirectly receiving Institute funds
are required to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for funds
they receive. These records shall include total program costs, including Institute funds, State and local matching
shares, and any other fund sources included in the approved project budget. 


1. Purpose 


The purpose of this section is to establish accounting system requirements and to offer guidance on procedures which
will assist all grantees/subgrantees in: 
a. Complying with the statutory requirements for the awarding, disbursement, and accounting of funds; 
b. Complying with regulatory requirements of the Institute for the financial management and disposition of funds;

c. Generating financial data which can be used in the planning, management and control of programs; and 
d. Facilitating an effective audit of funded programs and projects. 


2. References 


Except where inconsistent with specific provisions of this Guideline, the following regulations, directives and
reports are applicable to Institute grants and cooperative agreements. These materials supplement the requirements

all funds. Responsibilities include accounting for receipts and expenditures, maintaining adequate financial
records and refunding expenditures disallowed by audits.

2. Responsibilities of State Supreme Court 


Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved, consistent with State law, by the State's
Supreme Court, or its designated agency or council. 
The State Supreme Court shall receive all Institute funds awarded to such courts and shall be responsible for assuring
proper administration of Institute funds. The State Supreme Court is responsible for all aspects of the project,
including proper accounting and financial recordkeeping by the subgrantee. The responsibilities include: 
a. 

Reviewing Financial Operations. 

The State Supreme Court should be familiar with, and periodically monitor, its subgrantees' financial operations,
records system and procedures. Particular attention should be directed to the maintenance of current financial
data. 
b. 

Recording Financial Activities. 

The subgrantee's grant award or contract obligation, as well as cash advances and other financial activities, should
be recorded in the financial records of the State Supreme Court in summary form. Subgrantee expenditures should be
recorded on the books of the State Supreme Court 

OR 

evidenced by report forms duly filed by the subgrantee. Non-Institute contributions applied to projects by subgrantees
should likewise be recorded, as should any project income resulting from program operations. 
c. 

Budgeting and Budget Review. 

The State Supreme Court should ensure that each subgrantee prepares an adequate budget as the basis for its award commitment.
The detail of each project budget should be maintained on file by the State Supreme Court. 
d. 

Accounting for Non-Institute Contributions. 

The State Supreme Court will ensure, in those instances where subgrantees are required to furnish non-Institute
matching funds, that the requirements and limitations of this guideline are applied to such funds. 
e. 

Audit Requirement. 

The State Supreme Court is required to ensure that subgrantees have met the necessary audit requirements as set forth
by the Institute (see sections X.M. and XI.J). 
f. 

Reporting Irregularities. 

The State Supreme Court and its subgrantees are responsible for promptly reporting to the Institute the nature and
circumstances surrounding any financial irregularities discovered. 


C. Accounting System 


The grantee is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of accounting and internal controls
for itself and for ensuring that an adequate system exists for each of its subgrantees and contractors. An acceptable
and adequate accounting system is considered to be one which: 
1. Properly accounts for receipt of funds under each grant awarded and the expenditure of funds for each grant by category
of expenditure (including matching contributions and project income); 
2. Assures that expended funds are applied to the appropriate budget category included within the approved grant;

3. Presents and classifies historical costs of the grant as required for budgetary and evaluation purposes; 
4. Provides cost and property controls to assure optimal use of grant funds; 
5. Is integrated with a system of internal controls adequate to safeguard the funds and assets covered, check the accuracy
and reliability of the accounting data, promote operational efficiency, and assure conformance with any general
or special conditions of the grant; 
6. Meets the prescribed requirements for periodic financial reporting of operations; and 
7. Provides financial data for planning, control, measurement, and evaluation of direct and indirect costs. 


D. Total Cost Budgeting and Accounting 


Accounting for all funds awarded by the Institute shall be structured and executed on a ``total project cost'' basis.
That is, total project costs, including Institute funds, State and local matching shares, and any other fund sources
included in the approved project budget shall be the foundation for fiscal administration and accounting. Grant
applications and financial reports require budget and cost estimates on the basis of total costs.

1. Timing of Matching Contributions 


Matching contributions need not be applied at the exact time of the obligation of Institute funds. However, the full
matching share must be obligated during the award period, except that with the prior written permission of the Institute,
contributions made following approval of the grant by the Institute's Board but before the beginning of the grant
may be counted as match. Grantees that do not contemplate making matching contributions continuously throughout
the course of a project or on a task-by-task basis, are required to submit a schedule within 30 days after the beginning
of the project period indicating at what points during the project period the matching contributions will be made.
In instances where a proposed cash match is not fully met, the Institute may reduce the award amount accordingly, in
order to maintain the ratio originally provided for in the award agreement. 


2. Records for Match 


All grantees must maintain records which clearly show the source, amount, and timing of all matching contributions.
In addition, if a project has included, within its approved budget, contributions which exceed the required matching
portion, the grantee must maintain records of those contributions in the same manner as it does the Institute funds
and required matching shares. For all grants made to State and local courts, the State Supreme Court has primary responsibility
for grantee/subgrantee compliance with the requirements of this section. (See section XI.B.2.) 


E. Maintenance and Retention of Records 


All financial records, supporting documents, statistical records and all other records pertinent to grants, subgrants,
cooperative agreements or contracts under grants shall be retained by each organization participating in a project
for at least three years for purposes of examination and audit. State Supreme Courts may impose record retention and
maintenance requirements in addition to those prescribed in this chapter. 


1. Coverage 


The retention requirement extends to books of original entry, source documents supporting accounting transactions,
the general ledger, subsidiary ledgers, personnel and payroll records, cancelled checks, and related documents
and records. Source documents include copies of all grant and subgrant awards, applications, and required grantee/subgrantee
financial and narrative reports. Personnel and payroll records shall include the time and attendance reports for
all individuals reimbursed under a grant, subgrant or contract, whether they are employed full-time or part-time.
Time and effort reports will be required for consultants. 


2. Retention Period 


The three-year retention period starts from the date of the submission of the final expenditure report or, for grants
which are renewed annually, from the date of submission of the annual expenditure report. 


3. Maintenance 


Grantees and subgrantees are expected to see that records of different fiscal years are separately identified and
maintained so that requested information can be readily located. Grantees and subgrantees are also obligated to
protect records adequately against fire or other damage. When records are stored away from the grantee's/subgrantee's
principal office, a written index of the location of stored records should be on hand, and ready access should be assured.



4. Access 


Grantees and subgrantees must give any authorized representative of the Institute access to and the right to examine
all records, books, papers, and documents related to an Institute grant. 


F. Project-Related Income 


Records of the receipt and disposition of project-related income must be maintained by the grantee in the same manner
as required for the project funds that gave rise to the income. The policies governing the disposition of the various
types of project-related income are listed below. 


1. Interest 


A State and any agency or instrumentality of a State including State institutions of higher education and State hospitals,
shall not be held accountable for interest earned on advances of project funds. When funds are awarded to subgrantees
through a State, the subgrantees are not held accountable for interest earned on advances of project funds. Local
units of government and nonprofit organizations that are direct grantees must refund any interest earned. Grantees
shall so order their affairs to ensure minimum balances in their respective grant cash accounts. 


2. Royalties 


The grantee/subgrantee may retain all royalties received from copyrights or other works developed under projects
or from patents and inventions, unless the terms and conditions of the project provide otherwise. 


3. Registration and Tuition Fees 


Registration and tuition fees shall be used to pay project-related costs not covered by the grant, or to reduce the
amount of grant funds needed to support the project. Registration and tuition fees may be used for other purposes only
with the prior written approval of the Institute. Estimates of registration and tuition fees, and any expenses to
be offset by the fees, should be included in the application budget forms and narrative. 


4. Income from the Sale of Grant Products

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00151 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

When grant funds fully cover the cost of producing and disseminating a limited number of copies of a product, the grantee
may, with the written prior approval of the Institute, sell additional copies reproduced at its expense only at a price
that recovers actual reproduction and distribution costs that were not covered by Institute grant funds or grantee
matching contributions to the project. When grant funds only partially cover the costs of developing, producing
and disseminating a product, the grantee may, with the written prior approval of the Institute, recover costs for
developing, reproducing, and disseminating the material to the extent that those costs were not covered by Institute
grant funds or grantee matching contributions. 
If the sale of products occurs during the project period, the costs and income generated by the sales must be reported
on the Quarterly Financial Status Reports and documented in an auditable manner. 
Whenever possible, the intent to sell a product should be disclosed in the concept paper and application or reported
to the Institute in writing once a decision to sell products has been made. The grantee must request approval to recover
its product development, reproduction, and dissemination costs as specified in section X.V. 


5. Other 


Other project income shall be treated in accordance with disposition instructions set forth in the project's terms
and conditions. 


G. Payments and Financial Reporting Requirements 


1. Payment of Grant Funds 


The procedures and regulations set forth below are applicable to all Institute grant funds and grantees. 
a. 

Request for Advance or Reimbursement of Funds. 

Grantees will receive funds on a ``Check-Issued'' basis. Upon receipt, review, and approval of a Request for Advance
or Reimbursement by the Institute, a check will be issued directly to the grantee or its designated fiscal agent. A
request must be limited to the grantee's immediate cash needs. The Request for Advance or Reimbursement, along with
the instructions for its preparation, will be included in the official Institute award package. 
For purposes of submitting Requests for Advance or Reimbursement, recipients of continuation and on-going support
grants should consider these grants as supplements to and extensions of the original award and number their requests
on a project rather than a grant basis. (See Recommendations to Grantees in the Introduction for further guidance.)

Payment requests for projects within a package grant may be submitted at the same time, but must be calculated separately
by component project. The alphabetic project identifier (A, B, C, etc.) should be appended to the grant number in Block
5 of the Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (See Recommendations to Grantees in the Introduction for further guidance.)

b. 

Termination of Advance and Reimbursement Funding. 

When a grantee organization receiving cash advances from the Institute: 
i. Demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to attain program or project goals, or to establish procedures that
will minimize the time elapsing between cash advances and disbursements, or cannot adhere to guideline requirements
or special conditions; 
ii. Engages in the improper award and administration of subgrants or contracts; or 
iii. Is unable to submit reliable and/or timely reports;

 

the Institute may terminate advance financing and require the grantee organization to finance its operations with
its own working capital. Payments to the grantee shall then be made by check to reimburse the grantee for actual cash
disbursements. In the event the grantee continues to be deficient, the Institute reserves the right to suspend reimbursement
payments until the deficiencies are corrected. 



c. 

Principle of Minimum Cash on Hand. 

Recipient organizations should request funds based upon immediate disbursement requirements. Grantees should
time their requests to ensure that cash on hand is the minimum needed for disbursements to be made immediately or within
a few days. Idle funds in the hands of subgrantees will impair the goals of good cash management.

2. Financial Reporting



In order to obtain financial information concerning the use of funds, the Institute requires that grantees/subgrantees
of these funds submit timely reports for review.

Two copies of the Financial Status Report are required from all grantees, other than recipients of scholarships under
section II.B.2.b.v., for each active quarter on a calendar-quarter basis. This report is due within 30 days after
the close of the calendar quarter. It is designed to provide financial information relating to Institute funds, State
and local matching shares, and any other fund sources included in the approved project budget. The report contains
information on obligations as well as outlays. A copy of the Financial Status Report, along with instructions for
its preparation, will be included in the official Institute Award package. In circumstances where an organization
requests substantial payments for a project prior to the completion of a given quarter, the Institute may request
a brief summary of the amount requested, by object class, in support of the Request for Advance or Reimbursement.

Grantees receiving a continuation or on-going support grant should provide financial information and number their
quarterly Financial Status Reports on a project rather than a grant basis.

Grantees receiving a package grant must submit a quarterly financial report summarizing the financial activity
for the entire package and separate reports for each project within the package. On the separate reports for the component
projects, the alphabetic project identifier (A, B, C, etc.) must be appended to the grant number in Block 5 of the Financial
Status Report.



3. Consequences of Non-Compliance With Submission Requirements



Failure of the grantee organization to submit required financial and program reports may result in a suspension of
grant payments or revocation of the grant award.



H. Allowability of Costs



1. General



Except as may be otherwise provided in the conditions of a particular grant, cost allowability shall be determined
in accordance with the principles set forth in 

OMB Circulars A-87,

 Cost Principles for State and Local Governments; 

A-21,

 Cost Principles Applicable to Grants and Contracts with Educational Institutions; and 

A-122,

 Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations. No costs may be recovered to liquidate obligations which are incurred
after the approved grant period.



2. Costs Requiring Prior Approval



a. 

Preagreement Costs.

 The written prior approval of the Institute is required for costs which are considered necessary to the project but
occur prior to the award date of the grant.

b. 

Equipment.

 Grant funds may be used to purchase or lease only that equipment which is essential to accomplishing the goals and objectives
of the project. The written prior approval of the Institute is required when the amount of automated data processing
(ADP) equipment to be purchased or leased exceeds $10,000 or the software to be purchased exceeds $3,000.

<TEXT>
 

c. 

Consultants.

 The written prior approval of the Institute is required when the rate of compensation to be paid a consultant exceeds
$300 a day.



3. Travel Costs



Transportation and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicant organization. If the applicant does
not have an established written travel policy, then travel rates shall be consistent with those established by the
Institute or the Federal Government. Institute funds shall not be used to cover the transportation or per diem costs
of a member of a national organization to attend an annual or other regular meeting of that organization.



4. Indirect Costs



These are costs of an organization that are not readily assignable to a particular project, but are necessary to the
operation of the organization and the performance of the project. The cost of operating and maintaining facilities,
depreciation, and administrative salaries are examples of the types of costs that are usually treated as indirect
costs. It is the policy of the Institute that all costs should be budgeted directly; however, if a recipient has an indirect
cost rate approved by a Federal agency as set forth below, the Institute will accept that rate.

a. 

Approved Plan Available.



i. The Institute will accept an indirect cost rate or allocation plan approved for a grantee during the preceding two
years by any Federal granting agency on the basis of allocation methods substantially in accord with those set forth
in the applicable cost circulars. A copy of the approved rate agreement must be submitted to the Institute.

ii. Where flat rates are accepted in lieu of actual indirect costs, grantees may not also charge expenses normally
included in overhead pools, e.g., accounting services, legal services, building occupancy and maintenance, etc.,
as direct costs.

iii. Organizations with an approved indirect cost rate, utilizing total direct costs as the base, usually exclude
contracts under grants from any overhead recovery. The negotiation agreement will stipulate that contracts are
excluded from the base for overhead recovery.

b. 

Establishment of Indirect Cost Rates.

 In order to be reimbursed for indirect costs, a grantee or organization must first establish an appropriate indirect
cost rate. To do this, the grantee must prepare an indirect cost rate proposal and submit it to the Institute. The proposal
must be submitted in a timely manner (within three months after the start of the grant period) to assure recovery of
the full amount of allowable indirect costs, and it must be developed in accordance with principles and procedures
appropriate to the type of grantee institution involved.

c. 

No Approved Plan.

 If an indirect cost proposal for recovery of actual indirect costs is not submitted to the Institute within three months
after the start of the grant period, indirect costs will be irrevocably disallowed for all months prior to the month
that the indirect cost proposal is received. This policy is effective for all grant awards.



I. Procurement and Property Management Standards



1. Procurement Standards



For State and local governments, the Institute is adopting the standards set forth in Attachment O of 

OMB Circular A-102.

 Institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations will be governed by the standards
set forth in Attachment O of 

OMB Circular A-110.





2. Property Management Standards



The property management standards as prescribed in Attachment N of 

OMB Circulars A-102

 and 

A-110

 shall be applicable to all grantees and subgrantees of Institute funds except as provided in section X.O.

All grantees/subgrantees are required to be prudent in the acquisition and management of property with grant funds.
If suitable property required for the successful execution of projects is already available within the grantee or
subgrantee organization, expenditures of grant funds for the acquisition of new property will be considered unnecessary.



J. Audit Requirements



1. Implementation




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00154 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Each non-scholarship grantee (including a State or local court receiving a subgrant from the State Supreme Court)
shall provide for an annual fiscal audit. The audit may be of the entire grantee organization (e.g., a university)
or of the specific project funded by the Institute. Audits conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984
and OMB Circular A-128, or OMB Circular A-133 will satisfy the requirement for an annual fiscal audit.
The audit shall be conducted by an independent Certified Public Accountant, or a State or local agency authorized
to audit government agencies. For grantees receiving more than $50,000 in payments during their fiscal year, the
audit shall be conducted in accordance with the Government Accounting Standards issued by the Comptroller General
of the United States and shall include: 

a. An opinion on whether the financial statements of the grantee present fairly its financial position and the results
of its financial operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 

b. A report on the grantee's internal control structure over financial reporting; and, 

c. A report on the tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations that have a direct and material effect on
the financial statement amounts. 

For grantees receiving payments totalling $50,000 or less during their fiscal year, the annual fiscal audit may be
conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA). A written report shall be prepared upon completion of the audit. Grantees are responsible
for submitting copies of the reports to the Institute within 30 days after the acceptance of the report by the grantee,
for each year that there is financial activity involving Institute funds. 

Grantees who receive funds from a Federal agency and who satisfy audit requirements of the cognizant Federal agency,
should submit a copy of the audit report prepared for that Federal agency to the Institute in order to satisfy the provisions
of this section. Cognizant Federal agencies do not send reports to the Institute. Therefore, each grantee must send
this report directly to the Institute. 



2. Resolution and Clearance of Audit Reports 



Timely action on recommendations by responsible management officials is an integral part of the effectiveness of
an audit. Each grant recipient shall have policies and procedures for acting on audit recommendations by designating
officials responsible for: follow-up, maintaining a record of the actions taken on recommendations and time schedules,
responding to and acting on audit recommendations, and submitting periodic reports to the Institute on recommendations
and actions taken. 



3. Consequences of Non-Resolution of Audit Issues 



It is the general policy of the State Justice Institute not to make new grant awards to an applicant having an unresolved
audit report involving Institute awards. Failure of the grantee organization to resolve audit questions may also
result in the suspension of payments for active Institute grants to that organization. 



K. Close-Out of Grants 



1. Definition 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00155 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Close-out is a process by which the Institute determines that all applicable administrative and financial actions
and all required work of the grant have been completed by both the grantee and the Institute. 



2. Grantee Close-Out Requirements 



Within 90 days after the end date of the grant or any approved extension thereof (revised end date), the following documents
must be submitted to the Institute by a grantee other than a recipient of a scholarship under section II.B.2.b.v. 

a. 

Financial Status Report

. The final report of expenditures must have no unliquidated obligations and must indicate the exact balance of unobligated
funds. Any unobligated/unexpended funds will be deobligated from the award by the Institute. Final payment requests
for obligations incurred during the award period must be submitted to the Institute prior to the end of the 90-day close-out
period. Grantees on a check-issued basis, who have drawn down funds in excess of their obligations/expenditures,
must return any unused funds as soon as it is determined that the funds are not required. In no case should any unused
funds remain with the grantee beyond the submission date of the final financial status report. 

b. 

Final Progress Report

. This report should describe the project activities during the final calendar quarter of the project and the closeout
period, including to whom project products have been disseminated; provide a summary of activities during the entire
project; specify whether all the objectives set forth in the approved application or an approved adjustment thereto
have been met and, if any of the objectives have not been met, explain the reasons therefor; and discuss what, if anything,
could have been done differently that might have enhanced the impact of the project or improved its operation. 



3. Extension of Close-Out Period 



Upon the written request of the grantee, the Institute may extend the close-out period to assure completion of the
Grantee's close-out requirements. Requests for an extension must be submitted at least 14 days before the end of the
close-out period and must explain why the extension is necessary and what steps will be taken to assure that all the
grantee's responsibilities will be met by the end of the extension period.

XII. Grant Adjustments 


All requests for program or budget adjustments requiring Institute approval must be submitted in a timely manner
by the project director. All requests for changes from the approved application will be carefully reviewed for both
consistency with this guideline and the enhancement of grant goals and objectives. 


A. Grant Adjustments Requiring Prior Written Approval 


There are several types of grant adjustments which require the prior written approval of the Institute. Examples
of these adjustments include: 
1. Budget revisions among direct cost categories which, individually or in the aggregate, exceed or are expected
to exceed five percent of the approved original budget or the most recently approved revised budget. For the purposes
of this section, the Institute will view budget revisions cumulatively. 
a. For package grants, reallocations among budget categories of an individual project within the package that total
less than five percent of the approved budget for that project do not require a grant adjustment. However, transfers
of funds between projects included in the package require prior, written approval by the Institute. 
b. For continuation and on-going support grants, funds from the original award may be used during the renewal grant
period and funds awarded by a continuation or on-going support grant may be used to cover project-related expenditures
incurred during the original award period, with the prior, written approval of the Institute. 
2. A change in the scope of work to be performed or the objectives of the project (see section XII.D.). 
3. A change in the project site. 
4. A change in the project period, such as an extension of the grant period and/or extension of the final financial or
progress report deadline (see section XII.E.). 
5. Satisfaction of special conditions, if required. 
6. A change in or temporary absence of the project director (see sections XII.F. and G.).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940822-2-00157 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940822-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

7. The assignment of an employee or consultant to a key staff position whose qualifications were not described in the
application, or a change of a person assigned to a key project staff position (see section X.X.). 
8. A change in the name of the grantee organization. 
9. A transfer or contracting out of grant-supported activities (see section XII.H.). 
10. A transfer of the grant to another recipient. 
11. Preagreement costs, the purchase of automated data processing equipment and software, and consultant rates,
as specified in section XI.H.2. 
12. A change in the nature or number of the products to be prepared or the manner in which a product would be distributed.



B. Request for Grant Adjustments 


All grantees and subgrantees must promptly notify the SJI program managers, in writing, of events or proposed changes
which may require an adjustment to the approved application. In requesting an adjustment, the grantee must set forth
the reasons and basis for the proposed adjustment and any other information the SJI program managers determine would
help the Institute's review. 


C. Notification of Approval/Disapproval 


If the request is approved, the grantee will be sent a Grant Adjustment signed by the Executive Director or his/her
designee. If the request is denied, the grantee will be sent a written explanation of the reasons for the denial. 


D. Changes in the Scope of the Grant 


A grantee/subgrantee may make minor changes in methodology, approach, or other aspects of the grant to expedite achievement
of the grant's objectives with subsequent notification of the SJI program manager. Major changes in scope, duration,
training methodology, or other significant areas must be approved in advance by the Institute. 


E. Date Changes 


A request to change or extend the grant period must be made at least 30 days in advance of the end date of the grant. A revised
task plan should accompany requests for a no-cost extension of the grant period, along with a revised budget if shifts
among budget categories will be needed. A request to change or extend the deadline for the final financial report or
final progress report must be made at least 14 days in advance of the report deadline (see section XI.K.3.). 


F. Temporary Absence of the Project Director 


Whenever absence of the project director is expected to exceed a continuous period of one month, the plans for the conduct
of the project director's duties during such absence must be approved in advance by the Institute. This information
must be provided in a letter signed by an authorized representative of the grantee/subgrantee at least 30 days before
the departure of the project director, or as soon as it is known that the project director will be absent. The grant may
be terminated if arrangements are not approved in advance by the Institute. 


G. Withdrawal of/Change in Project Director 


If the project director relinquishes or expects to relinquish active direction of the project, the Institute must
be notified immediately. In such cases, if the grantee/subgrantee wishes to terminate the project, the Institute
will forward procedural instructions upon notification of such intent. If the grantee wishes to continue the project
under the direction of another individual, a statement of the candidate's qualifications should be sent to the Institute
for review and approval. The grant may be terminated if the qualifications of the proposed individual are not approved
in advance by the Institute. 


H. Transferring or Contracting Out of Grant-Supported Activities 


A principal activity of the grant-supported project shall not be transferred or contracted out to another organization
without specific prior approval by the Institute. All such arrangements should be formalized in a contract or other
written agreement between the parties involved. Copies of the proposed contract or agreement must be submitted for
prior approval at the earliest possible time. The contract or agreement must state, at a minimum, the activities to
be performed, the time schedule, the policies and procedures to be followed, the dollar limitation of the agreement,
and the cost principles to be followed in determining what costs, both direct and indirect, are to be allowed. The contract
or other written agreement must not affect the grantee's overall responsibility for the direction of the project
and accountability to the Institute.
