DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 


Agricultural Marketing Service




Nominations for Members of the National Organic Standards Board 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, as amended (Act), requires the establishment of a National Organic Standards
Board (NOSB) to assist in the development of standards for substances to be used in organic production and to advise
the Secretary of Agriculture on any other aspects of the implementation of the Act. The NOSB was originally established
on January 24, 1992, with individual members appointed for staggered appointments of 3, 4, and 5 years. Appointments
for four members will be up in January 1995, and the Secretary seeks nominations of individuals to be considered for
selection as NOSB members. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law Number 92-463, notice is hereby given that the Organic
Foods Production Act of 1990, as amended, requires the Secretary to establish an organic certification program for
producers and handlers of agricultural products that have been produced using organic methods. In developing this
program, the Secretary is required to establish a NOSB. The purpose of the NOSB is to assist in the development of standards
for substances to be used in organic production and to advise the Secretary on any other aspects of the implementation
of the program. 



The current NOSB has worked to develop recommendations to the Secretary to establish the initial program. It is anticipated
that the NOSB will continue to work on recommendations for refinements in the program and the ongoing review of substances
considered for organic production and processing. 
A member of the NOSB shall serve for a term of 5 years, except that the Secretary appointed the original members of the
NOSB for staggered terms of 3, 4, and 5 years. The terms of four members of the current NOSB, who were appointed for 3-year
terms, will be completed on January 24, 1995. A member may serve consecutive terms if such member served an original
term that was less than 5 years. However a member of the NOSB, with 3 years of service, seeking reappointment may only
be reappointed for 3 years in accordance with 7 U.S.C. 2283 (c) which states ``No person other than an officer or employee
of the Department of Agriculture may serve more than six consecutive years on an advisory committee, unless authorized
by the Secretary.'' 

Nominations are sought for the positions of Farmer, Handler or Processor, Retailer, and Environmentalist. Individuals
desiring to be appointed to the NOSB at this time must be either an owner or operator of an organic farming operation,
an owner or operator of an organic handling or processing operation, an owner or operator of a retail establishment
with significant trade in organic products, or an expert in the area of environmental or resource conservation. 

One member of the NOSB must be a certifying agent as defined in Public Law Number 101-624. That member shall be
appointed at an appropriate date after the accreditation of a number of individuals as certifying agents has been
completed. 

Selection criteria will include such factors as: demonstrated experience and interest in organics; commodity and
geographic representation; endorsed support of industry organizations; demonstrated experience with environmental
concerns; and other factors as may be appropriate for specific positions. 

After applications have been reviewed, individuals receiving nominations will be contacted and supplied with biographical
forms. The biographical information must be completed and returned to USDA within 10 working days of its receipt,
to expedite the security clearance process that is required by the Secretary.

<DOCTITLE>Creaky Hart Project Area; Idaho Panhandle National Forests, Shoshone County, ID</DOCTITLE>



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for public comment on proposed activities
in the Creaky Hart Project Area.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the Forest Service is issuing a DEIS for public comment. The DEIS documents proposed timber
management practices that move the Creaky Hart Project Area toward the desired future conditions as directed by the
1987 Idaho Panhandle National Forest's (IPNF) Forest Plan. The area is located approximately 10 air miles north of
Wallace, Idaho and is approximately 13,960 acres in size.



Public participation has been on going throughout the project. Comments are requested on the DEIS for the next 45 days.
During this 45 day comment period, comments and concerns should be addressed to the NEPA Coordinator to assist in preparing
a final EIS.

The District Ranger is the responsible official for this DEIS. Alternative 7 is the preferred alternative at this
time.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposed action was developed for the area that included timber harvest, reforestation activities, and minimum
entry into the Trouble Creek Roadless Area through implementation of timber sales. The scope of the proposed action
is limited to timber harvesting, reforestation, and related road construction/reconstruction activities. During
development of the proposed action and alternatives to the proposed action, emphasis has been placed on forest health,
roadless, wildlife, and water resource concerns.



Seven alternatives were developed, including a No-Action Alternative. Alternative 7 is the alternative preferred
by the Forest Service. Under Alternative 7, the harvest of green, dead and dying timber is scheduled for implementation.
The project would produce an estimated 6.6 million board feet of timber and treat 56 timber harvest units. Openings
would be no larger than 5 acres. Harvest methods include, clearcut, shelterwood, and overstory removal using helicopter
and cable yarding. In this proposal 3.6 miles of road would be constructed. Roads would generally follow ridgetops
and not cross any live streams.

Management activities would be administered by the Wallace Ranger District of the Idaho Panhandle National Forests
in Shoshone County, Idaho. This DEIS will tier to the Forest Plan (September 1987) which provides the overall guidance
(Goals, Objectives, Standards and Guidelines, and Management Area direction) in achieving the desire future condition
for this area.

Notice of Court Decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



On August 26, 1991, the ITC determined that a U.S. industry was being materially injured by reason of imports of EL FPDs
from Japan (56 FR 43937, Sept. 5, 1991). On September 4, 1991, the Department published an antidumping duty order on
EL FPDs (56 FR 43741, September 4, 1991).

The ITC determination was appealed to the CIT by exporters of FPDs. Sharp Corporation obtained a preliminary injunction,
dated January 20, 1994 (Preliminary Injunction Order), enjoining liquidation of entries of EL FPDs entered after
February 21, 1991, the date of publication of the Department's preliminary determination of sales at less than fair
value (56 FR 7008, February 21, 1991). The CIT remanded the determination to the ITC to reconsider its injury determination,
and on March 8, 1993, the ITC determined on remand that no U.S. industry was being materially injured by reason of imports
of EL FPDs. This remand was affirmed by the CIT on April 14, 1994 in 

Hosiden I. 

The Department published a 

Timken 

notice on May 6, 1994, stating that the Department will continue to order the suspension of liquidation of the subject
merchandise and that ``[i]f the case is not appealed, or is affirmed on appeal, then the antidumping duty order on EL
FPDs will be revoked.'' 59 FR at 23690.

On May 10, 1994, Sharp Corporation filed with the CIT a Motion for Writ of Mandamus to Enforce Judgment objecting to
the steps taken by the Department in its May 6, 1994 

Federal Register

 notice to enforce the CIT's April 14, 1994 Order and requesting that the CIT order the Department to: (1) Terminate
the collection of cash deposits for estimated antidumping duties on EL FPDs; (2) suspend liquidation of entries of
EL FPDs; (3) refrain from imposing any further obligation on any party involved in any administrative review by the
Department relating to EL FPDs; and (4) execute all documents and take all necessary actions to effectuate a revocation
of the antidumping duty order. On August 12, 1994, the CIT issued a Memorandum and Order granting Sharp Corporation's
Motion for Writ of Mandamus to Enforce Judgment. 

Hosiden II

, Slip. Op. 94-128. Pursuant to the CIT's August 12, 1994 Order, we are hereby amending the Department's May 6,
1994, Notice of Court Decision and revoking the antidumping duty order on EL FPDs from Japan.



Actions Pursuant to Writ of Mandamus



Pursuant to 

Hosiden II,

 the Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service (Customs) to cease collection of cash deposits on entities
of EL FPDs as of the date of publication of this Order and instruct Customs to release any bonds and to refund cash deposits.
The Department will further instruct Customs to suspend the liquidation of entries of EL FPDs effective on entries
made on or after February 21, 1991. The Department will take no further action with respect to any administrative review
under section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1675, relating to EL FPDs. Finally, the Department
hereby revokes the antidumping duty order on EL FPDs from Japan (56 FR 43741, September 4, 1991), which revocation
shall be effective February 21, 1991, the date of the Department's publication in the 

Federal Register

 of the preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value in this case.

ACTION:

 Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews. 

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of two administrative
reviews of the antidumping duty order on stainless steel hollow products (SSHP) from Sweden. We have completed these
reviews and determined the margins for Sandvik AB, AB Sandvik Steel, and Sandvik Steel Company (collectively, Sandvik)
to be 3.65 percent for the period May 22, 1987 through November 30, 1988, and 1.33 percent for the period December 1,
1988 through November 30, 1989. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



Background 



On December 3, 1987, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 an antidumping duty order on SSHP from Sweden (52 FR 45985, as amended, 57 FR 52761). On December 5, 1988, pursuant to
the Department's notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (53 FR 48004) of the order for the period
May 22, 1987 through November 30, 1988, Sandvik requested that the Department conduct an administrative review.
On December 19, 1989, pursuant to the Department's notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (54
FR 52436) of the order for the period December 1, 1988 through November 30, 1989, Sandvik again requested that the Department
conduct an administrative review. 

On December 30, 1993, the Department published the preliminary results of these administrative reviews (58 FR 69332).
We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. On March 16, 1994, we received comments
from Sandvik. The Department has completed these administrative reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 



Scope of Reviews 



The merchandise covered by these reviews is stainless steel hollow products, including pipes, tubes, hollow bars
and blanks of circular cross section, containing over 11.5 percent chromium by weight. This merchandise is currently
classified under subheadings 7304.41.00 and 7304.49.00 of the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS). Prior to January
1, 1989, this merchandise was classified under subheadings 610.5130, 610.5202, 610.5229 and 610.5230 of the Tariff
Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA). Although the HTS and TSUSA subheadings are provided for convenience
and customs purposes, the written description of the scope of these reviews remains dispositive. 



Analysis of the Comments Received 



Based upon our analysis of the comments received, we have changed the results from those presented in the preliminary
results of these reviews as discussed below in the comments section of this notice. In addition, where we found clerical
errors, we made appropriate corrections. 



Comment 1:

 Sandvik contends that the Department should grant a level of trade adjustment in those situations in which sales to
distributors are compared with sales to end-users. In support of its argument, Sandvik states that 19 CFR 353.58 (1994)
provides that, when comparisons at the same level of trade are not possible, the Department will ``make appropriate
adjustments for differences affecting price comparability.'' Sandvik notes that the Department has correctly
made comparisons of merchandise at the same level of trade, where possible, and that it should make a level of trade
adjustment where sales to distributors are matched with sales to end-users.

<PARENT> FR940825-2-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Sandvik also asserts that, contrary to the Department's contention that the company failed to ``demonstrate that
it incurred different indirect selling expenses on sales to different levels of trade in the German market,'' the
company demonstrated, in significant detail, that discounts were granted exclusively to German distributors to
compensate these distributors for their cost of holding a stock of Sandvik products. Sandvik claims that the fact
that these distributor discounts were granted is undisputed in the case record. 

Finally, contrary to the Department's traditional reliance on cost differences as the basis for the adjustment,
Sandvik contends that other methods of valuing the adjustment may also be used since the Department's regulations
do not expressly limit the grant of the adjustment to those instances in which cost differences are present. Rather,
Sandvik argues that the regulation simply ``requires a level of trade adjustment whenever prices are not comparable.''
According to Sandvik, the distributor discount in this case is exactly the amount by which the sale price at the distributor
level of trade varies from the price of an identical sale at the end-user level of trade. Sandvik concludes that the
distributor discount is the best basis, if not the only basis, for valuing the level of trade adjustment. Accordingly,
since the company has shown that ``the discount is uniformly provided in all German distributor sales'', the Department
must make the level of trade adjustment whenever sales at different levels of trade are compared. 



Department's Position 



To determine whether a level of trade adjustment is warranted when sales to distributors are matched with sales to
end-users, we compared the reported unit sale prices to distributors with reported unit prices to end-users for the
same product, month of sale, and quantity bracket. Based upon our examination of these prices in both reviews, we found
wide price fluctuations without any discernible pattern. Moreover, in some instances, we found that prices to distributors
exceeded prices to end-users. Based upon these facts, Sandvik has not demonstrated that there are differences affecting
price comparability relating solely to the fact that sales are made at different levels of trade. Thus, the Department
maintains that there is insufficient justification to make a level of trade adjustment in those situations where
distributor and end-user sales are compared. 



Comment 2:

 Sandvik contends that two separate and distinct exporters are under review in the first administrative review, and
therefore, the Department should calculate separate rates for these companies. According to Sandvik, it sold to
an unrelated Canadian distributor a small volume of hollow bar, most, if not all, of which has never been sold into the
United States. Sandvik contends that the Department incorrectly assumes these sales have entered the United States
since the dumping calculation is based on Sandvik's sales to the Canadian company, not on the Canadian company's subsequent
sales into the United States. 

Second, Sandvik maintains that the Department has an established practice of calculating a separate margin for each
manufacturer/exporter investigated in an antidumping duty action provided the firms operate as separate and distinct
entities. In discussing its position, Sandvik addresses 

Certain Granite Products from Italy

 (53 FR 27187, July 19, 1988), where the Department collapsed firms with common ownership and boards of directors and
similar production facilities such that the firms would not have to retool in order to produce jointly; 

Certain Granite Products from Spain

 (53 FR 24337, June 28, 1988), where the firms shared sales opportunities, manufacturing decisions, and were billed
jointly; and 

Certain Granite Products from Italy

 (53 FR 27189, June 28, 1988) where the firms acted in concert in the marketplace. Sandvik claims, in contrast to these
cases, that it and the Canadian company are independently owned, possess no corporate or other close relationship,
and never operated closely or in concert for the production or sales of hollow bar. 

Finally, citing 

Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Plate and Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Sheet from Brazil

 (49 FR 3104, January 25, 1984), Sandvik contends that the only other situation in which the Department may consider
calculating a single margin for two companies involves entities with cooperative sales operations or firms that
do not separately negotiate prices with U.S. customers. Once again, Sandvik maintains that the facts in this case
do not warrant such treatment. Sandvik argues that it maintained separate sales operations at all times. Moreover,
Sandvik asserts that in those instances in which the Canadian company made sales to the United States, it directly
competed with Sandvik. Sandvik further maintains that each firm separately negotiated prices with potential U.S.
customers. 

As a final point, Sandvik contends that the Department has consistently published separate rates for sales made through
unrelated third-country trading companies or resellers. According to Sandvik, that practice should apply in this
case as the Canadian company is an unrelated third-country reseller. 



Department's Position 



We normally treat sales by a respondent to an unrelated purchaser as sales to the United States where the seller knows
that the merchandise is being sold for export to the United States. This is true of sales to trading companies in the
country of origin or those in third country locations. (

The antidumping duty rate calculated for Sandvik in the first administrative review pertains to Sandvik's sales
of the subject merchandise (1) made directly to the United States and (2) destined for consumption in the United States.
In its response, Sandvik stated that the Canadian company ``was authorized to sell the merchandise in the U.S.'' and
that the merchandise was intended for ultimate importation into the United States (Sandvik's April 5, 1989 response
at 10). Accordingly, we have continued to treat Sandvik's sales to the Canadian company as sales to the United States
because they were made with the knowledge that the merchandise was destined for consumption in the United States.
Therefore, we believe that such sales properly belong in the calculation of Sandvik's antidumping duty rate. 



Comment 3: 

Sandvik contends that it was inappropriate for the Department to apply, as best information available (BIA), the
antidumping duty rate from the less than fair value (LTFV) investigation for those instances in which constructed
value was not available for comparison to U.S. sales. Instead, according to Sandvik, in several recent administrative
reviews the Department has found that, where a gap existed in the record for certain U.S. sales, and the Department
had to use ``other information,'' not ``BIA,'' it could use a neutral and reasonable surrogate to bridge the gap. Sandvik
argues that the Department derives its authority to use reasonable, ``other information'' from its own inherent
authority to administer the U.S. antidumping law in a fair and equitable manner. 

Sandvik further points out that in this case the Department has already calculated margins on the overwhelming majority
of Sandvik's U.S. sales transactions. Therefore, Sandvik maintains that, rather than apply the rate from the LTFV
investigation as BIA, the Department should apply the weighted-average margin derived from the pool of sales with
calculated margins as the more appropriate rate for unmatched sales in this review. 



Department's Position 



Section 776(c) of the Act requires the Department to apply BIA ``whenever a party or any other person refuses or is unable
to produce information requested in a timely manner or in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an
investigation.'' 
When a company substantially cooperates with our requests for information, but fails to provide the information
requested in a timely manner or in the form required, we use as BIA the higher of (1) The highest rate (including the ``all
others'' rate) ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from either the LTFV investigation
or a prior administrative review; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the class or kind
of merchandise from the same country of origin (

Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of An Antidumping Duty Order

 (referring to Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) And Parts Thereof from France; et al.)
(58 FR 39729, 39739, July 26, 1993); and 

Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) And Parts Thereof from France; et al.; Final Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 

(57 FR 28360, 28379. June 24, 1992)). 

In cases where a firm failed to supply certain FMV information (

e.g., 

corresponding home market sales within the contemporaneous window or constructed value data for a few U.S. sales),
we apply the BIA rate as outlined above, and limit its application to the particular transactions involved. 

In this case, Sandvik substantially cooperated with the Department in furnishing the requested information. Therefore,
for those few sales in which we found it necessary to use partial BIA, we applied the rate of 20.47 percent from the LTFV
investigation, which is the highest rate ever applicable to Sandvik for the same class or kind of merchandise from
either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review. 



Comment 4: 

Sandvik contends that the Department's use of mean average shipment, entry, and payment dates to represent missing
shipment, entry, and payment dates imposes an unjustified penalty on the company. According to Sandvik, there were
a number of sales for which this particular information could not be furnished because, at the time the response was
prepared, payment, shipment and entry had not yet occurred. 

Sandvik claims that the use of mean shipment and entry dates greatly and arbitrarily increases the size of any adjustments
based on such dates. In particular, Sandvik notes that the time the merchandise is in inventory and the days for which
credit is extended are both greatly overstated through the application of these mean dates. Accordingly, Sandvik
urges the Department to adopt the company's earlier proposal of using the substituted date of June 1, 1989, the date
on which the first review tape was prepared, as the shipment date. According to Sandvik, this proposal is reasonable
even though it still overstates these adjustments. 



Department's Position 



We note that since the June 1, 1989, date of preparation of the computer tape, Sandvik received subsequent opportunities
to submit these missing data when replacement tapes were requested by the Department. Sandvik, however, provided
no additional data for these missing values. Accordingly, we have continued to apply mean values as BIA for these missing
data.

Comment 5: 

With respect to warranty expenses, Sandvik maintains that the Department based its calculation of U.S. warranty
expenses on the mistaken belief that Sandvik failed to report U.S. warranty expenses in its response. Contrary to
the Department's belief, Sandvik maintains that all warranty-related costs, consisting of the cost of reworking
defective merchandise and the transportation costs associated with returning the merchandise to the factory and
reshipping the reworked merchandise, were included in the cost and expense data submitted in its responses.
According to Sandvik, reworking costs are indistinguishable from normal production costs and are accumulated in
cost centers with other costs associated with further manufacturing. Thus, Sandvik maintains that reworking costs
are fully accounted for in the direct labor and factory burden components of Sandvik's conversion costs. Accordingly,
Sandvik argues there is no need to create a separate adjustment for costs incurred in reworking defective merchandise.
With respect to the freight expenses for returned merchandise and reshipment of reworked merchandise, Sandvik claims
that these expenses were included in its total freight calculation. Thus, to the extent the Department deducted total
freight expense from the U.S. price (USP), it must not deduct separate freight expenses pertaining to return of defective
and reshipment of reworked merchandise. 

In addition, Sandvik characterizes the Department's calculation of warranty expense as inappropriate since it
is based on the total value of returned defective merchandise and the cost of reworking defective merchandise. Sandvik
maintains that the value of returned merchandise does not constitute an expense incurred by the company because defective
merchandise is not discarded or scrapped at the company's expense, but rather is reworked and either returned to the
customer or placed in inventory for sale to another customer. Thus, Sandvik claims that the company only incurs the
cost of reworking the merchandise and the cost of return freight, which therefore constitute the entire amount of
U.S. warranty expenses. Sandvik claims that these warranty-related expenses were fully reported and have been deducted
elsewhere in the cost and expense data. Thus, any additional deduction would be unfair and impermissible double-counting
of warranty expenses for U.S. sales. 



Department's Position 



To the extent that freight expenses, pertaining to the return of defective merchandise and reshipment of reworked
merchandise, were part of Sandvik's total freight expense, we agree that such expenses should not be included in U.S.
warranty expenses since they have already been deducted from USP. Thus, we have adjusted the warranty expense accordingly.


We disagree with Sandvik, however, that USP need not be adjusted for the cost of reworking the defective merchandise
based upon Sandvik's contention that these costs are already part of the total cost of production. Inclusion of reworking
costs in the cost of production by itself has no impact on the calculation of dumping margins. Rather, dumping margins
are primarily price-based calculations, and therefore prices net of warranty expenses are essential for apples-to-apples
comparisons. Hence, the Department has adjusted USP for warranty expenses. In addition, since Sandvik did not separately
report the cost of reworking defective merchandise, we continued to use, as BIA, the value of the returned merchandise
to represent Sandvik's warranty expenses. 



Comment 6: 

Sandvik claims that the Department incorrectly treated expenses pertaining to transportation of merchandise from
the U.S. port to Sandvik's U.S. factory as an element of further manufacturing contributing to U.S. value added, rather
than as a cost of the imported input. Sandvik claims that, by attributing these movement expenses to U.S. further manufacturing
costs rather than to the cost of the imported redraw hollow, the Department artificially increased the amount of U.S.
value added, and thus allocated too large a share of profit to U.S. further manufacturing. 

Second, Sandvik maintains that this method of allocation is inconsistent with the antidumping statute and the Department's
regulations. Citing both section 772(e)(3) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.41(e), Sandvik contends that both authorities
direct the Department to reduce exporter's sales price (ESP) by any increased value ``resulting from a process of
manufacture or assembly performed on the imported merchandise,'' which does not specifically include the cost of
moving the component or product from the port to its factory.

<TEXT>
 

Third, Sandvik contends that according to the Court of International Trade (CIT) ruling in 

Sandvik AB 

v. 

United States

 (721 F. Supp. 1322, 1335 (CIT 1989)) the Department must calculate profit based on the ``increased value'' as defined
in the statute. Sandvik maintains that movement of a product or component does not constitute performance of a ``manufacture
or assembly'' process on the imported merchandise. Thus, Sandvik concludes that movement expenses may not be considered
part of the U.S. value added.



Department's Position



The Department's standard practice is to subtract from USP any increased value added to the merchandise by a process
performed after importation and before sale to the first unrelated customer (see 

e.g., Roller Chain, Other Than Bicycle, from Japan; Final Results of Administrative Review of Antidumping Finding

 (48 FR 51801, November 14, 1983), and 

Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review

 (54 FR 48011, November 20, 1989). Accordingly, the Department correctly included the costs of transporting the product
from the port to the U.S. factory as an element of further manufacturing. Contrary to respondent's claims, this practice
is consistent with the statute and the Department's regulations, which allow for adjustments to USP for any increased
value resulting from a process of manufacture or production, or assembly (

see

 19 USC  1677a(e)(3) and 19 CFR 353.41(e)). The Department treats the costs of moving the product to the factory
as part of the process of further manufacturing because, were it not for the further manufacturing, these costs would
not be incurred. Furthermore, the Department's regulations allow for inclusion of transportation costs in calculating
value added adjustments. Specifically, 19 CFR 353.41(e)(3) states that the Secretary ``generally will'' consider
many factors, including ``other expenses,'' in the determination of ``increased value.'' Thus, the Department's
practice is consistent with its authority to assess the costs of port to factory movement expenses in determining
value added adjustments. 

Sandvik's reliance on the CIT case, 

Sandvik AB 

v. 

United States

 (721 F. Supp. 1322, 1335 (CIT 1989) (

Sandvik

)), to support its contention that the movement of a product does not constitute performance of a ``manufacture or
assembly'' process is misplaced. In 

Sandvik

, the CIT held that the Department can deduct from the USP the profit associated with further manufacturing. In making
this decision, the CIT simply quoted the relevant portions of the statute and regulations at issue, but never addressed
the precise meaning of the statute or the issue of movement expenses. 

Moreover, the Department's approach to these movement expenses is in accordance with longstanding practice (

see Gray Portland Cement and Clinker from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review

 (56 FR 48826, September 20, 1983, as amended, 58 FR 53705, April 21, 1983) (the Department included freight from the
U.S. port to the U.S. plant in the U.S. further manufacturing costs); 

see also, Stainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review

 (57 FR 21389, 21392, May 20, 1992)). Finally, in 

Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks
from Japan

 (57 FR 3167, 3169, January 28, 1992), the Department included transportation of merchandise as part of U.S. value
added. Although these were delivery charges incurred in the transportation of the goods from the factory, this case
nonetheless illustrates the Department's practice of including movement expenses as part of the costs of further
manufacturing.

Therefore, the Department has included the costs of transporting the product from the port to the factory as an element
of further manufacturing. 



Comment 7: 

According to Sandvik, the company imposes a service charge for cutting each piece of hollow bar sold in Sweden to the
length desired by each Swedish customer. Sandvik points out that since none of the hollow bar sold in the United States
was cut to length, sales of hollow bar in the home market carry a selling expense that U.S. sales do not. Accordingly,
Sandvik requests that the Department reduce the home market price by the amount of the service charge.

In support of its position, Sandvik contends that both the Department's regulations and current practice establish
that Sandvik is entitled to a circumstance of sale adjustment for the service of cutting hollow bar to length. According
to Sandvik, 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2) sets forth the types of differences in circumstances of sale for which the Department
may normally make reasonable allowances, which includes ``those involving differences in * * * servicing.''
Thus, Sandvik contends that the company's service charge is properly characterized as a circumstance of sale adjustment.

In addition, Sandvik cites cases demonstrating that the requested adjustment is supported by Department practice.
In the antidumping duty investigation on 

Polyethylene Terephthalate Film, Sheet and Strip from the Republic of Korea

 (

Pet Film

) (56 FR 16305, April 22, 1991), Sandvik claims the Department granted a circumstance of sale adjustment to account
for slitting costs when respondent cut its merchandise to the width desired by each home market customer. According
to Sandvik, no such expenses were incurred for U.S. sales. Thus, Sandvik claims 

Pet Film

 is analogous to the situation in the present review on SSHP.

<TEXT>
 

Moreover, Sandvik states that the Department previously determined in the LTFV investigation of SSHP that the service
charge for cutting hollow bar to length should properly be treated as a circumstance of sale adjustment. Sandvik stresses
that the Department, during its verification in the LTFV investigation, found that hollow bar sold in Sweden was in
fact cut to length, while hollow bar sold in the United States was not. Sandvik claims that nothing has changed since
the LTFV investigation to warrant a change in the treatment of the expense. Based upon Department practice and in particular,
the Department's previous treatment of the service charge in the SSHP case, Sandvik concludes that the Department
should make a circumstance of sale adjustment under 19 CFR 353.56 to account for the additional selling expense that
Sandvik incurs when it sells hollow bar in the home market.

Finally, Sandvik contends that, contrary to the Department's claim in this administrative review that the company
``did not provide * * * the necessary information to make the adjustment,'' Sandvik asserts that the
record demonstrates otherwise. Specifically, Sandvik cites to its November 7, 1991, submission which sets forth
the cutting charge as a percentage of total Swedish hollow bar sales.



Department's Position



The Department grants a circumstance of sale adjustment where the claimed expense is directly related to sales of
the subject merchandise or sales used to represent foreign market value, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a). In this
case, Sandvik calculated a per unit servicing charge based upon the company's total servicing expense as a percentage
of total sales of hollow bar in Sweden. As indicated in its January 19, 1990, response, the amount charged for cutting
hollow bar to length for customers varies according to the grade and volume of hollow bar which is purchased. Thus,
the service charge varies by sale, and should have been reported on a transaction-specific basis as specifically
requested in the Department's deficiency questionnaire. We have, therefore, denied Sandvik a circumstance of sale
adjustment in this case.

With respect to treatment of the servicing charge as an indirect selling expense under 19 CFR 353.56(b), Sandvik calculated
the total servicing expense using the largest fixed percentage of the invoice price rather than an application of
either the grade or volume of the sales, which would have reduced the amount of the servicing charge. Therefore, we
have denied Sandvik's servicing charge as an indirect selling expense for these sales because the methodology used
to calculate the charge overstates the total expense by failing to account for the effect of different grades and volumes
on the total amount.



Final Results of Review



The final results of our reviews are as follows:






The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Furthermore,
the following cash deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results of administrative
reviews for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or
after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed
company listed above will continue to be the rate established in the final results of the third administrative review
(57 FR 21389, May 20, 1992); (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit
rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not
a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash
deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacture of the merchandise; (4) the
cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 20.47 percent, the ``all other'' rate established
in the original LTFV investigation by the Department (52 FR 37810, October 9, 1987; as amended 52 FR 45985, December
3, 1987), in accordance with the decisions of the CIT in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation 

v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-83.

This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibilities concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO.

These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with sections 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 353.22 of the Department's regulations.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of revocation of Countervailing Duty Order.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce (the Department) is revoking the countervailing duty order on certain apparel from Sri
Lanka (50 FR 9826) pursuant to a decision of the Court of International Trade (CIT) on June 24, 1994. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On October 22, 1993, the Department reinstated the countervailing duty orders on certain apparel and certain textile
mill products from Sri Lanka, effective May 18, 1992 (58 FR 54552). These reinstatements were made pursuant to orders
of the CIT and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. (

Belton Industries, Inc.

 v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 92-64 (CIT 1992), 

aff'd

, 6 F.3d 756 (Fed Cir. 1993) ``

Belton

''.) On November 19, 1993, the Government of Sri Lanka filed an action with the CIT challenging the reinstatement of
the countervailing duty order on certain apparel from Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka argued that the 

Belton

 decisions only applied to the countervailing duty order on certain textile mill products from Sri Lanka. The Department
concurred with the Government of Sri Lanka, and consented to judgment in this case. On June 24, 1994, the CIT ordered
the Department to revoke the countervailing duty order on certain apparel from Sri Lanka. Because an injunction was
issued in this case, and because no adversely affected interested party has standing as a party to the litigation to
appeal the CIT's decision, the Department is immediately revoking the countervailing duty order on certain apparel
from Sri Lanka, effective May 18, 1992. 


Scope of the Order 


Imports covered by this order are shipments of certain apparel from Sri Lanka. The scope of this order, published in
the Appendix of the 

Federal Register

 notice of Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Order on Certain Apparel from Sri Lanka (50 FR
9826), was originally defined solely in terms of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) item
numbers; no narrative product description was provided. On January 11, 1989, the Department published a conversion
from TSUSA to Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers, and the U.S. Customs Service has been suspending liquidation
according to that conversion since then. 


Instructions to Customs 


The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to terminate suspension of liquidation of certain apparel
from Sri Lanka as of the date of publication of this notice, and to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties,
all unliquidated entries of certain apparel exported from Sri Lanka on or after May 18, 1992.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On May 17, 1994, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the
countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel from Mexico (59 FR 25612). We have now completed the review and
determine the net subsidy to be zero for the 65 companies listed in the Appendix and 13.35 percent 

ad valorem 

for all other companies for the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background


On May 17, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25612) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on leather wearing
apparel from Mexico (46 FR 21357; April 10, 1981). The Department has now completed this administrative review in
accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The review period is January 1, 1992 through
December 31, 1992. The review involves 65 companies and eight programs.


Scope of Review


Imports covered by this review are shipments of Mexican leather wearing apparel. These products include leather
coats and jackets for men, boys, women, girls, and infants, and other leather apparel products including leather
vests, pants, and shorts. Also included are outer leather shells and parts and pieces of leather wearing apparel.
This merchandise is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 4203.10.4030,
4203.10.4060, 4203.10.4085 and 4203.10.4095. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes.
The written description remains dispositive.


Analysis of Comment Received


We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received a written comment from
the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU), whose members produce leather wearing apparel. The
ACTWU's comment supported the preliminary results of this review.


Final Results of Review


Since the comment received did not oppose any aspect of the preliminary results, we determine the net subsidy for these
final results to be the same as in the preliminary results: zero for the 65 companies listed in the Appendix and 13.35
percent 

ad valorem 

for all other companies for the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992.
Therefore, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailing duties as follows for subject
merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1992, and on or before December 31, 1992: zero on shipments from any of the
65 companies listed in the Appendix; and 13.35 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on shipments from all other companies.
Further, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation on all shipments of
this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this
notice. As provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act, the Customs Service will collect cash deposits of estimated countervailing
duties on such shipments as follows: zero on shipments of this merchandise from the companies listed in the Appendix,
and 13.35 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on shipments from all other companies. These instructions shall remain
in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 355.22.

<DOCTITLE>North American Free-Trade Agreement, Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews; Request for Panel Review</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 NAFTA Secretariat, United States Section, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of first request for panel review.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 12, 1994, U.S. Steel, a Division of USX Corp., Inland Steel Company, I/N Kote, and LTV Steel filed a First Request
for Panel Review with the Canadian Section of the NAFTA Secretariat pursuant to Article 1904 of the North American
Free Trade Agreement. Panel review was requested of the final determination of dumping made by the Canadian Deputy
Minister Of National Revenue (Customs, Taxation and Excise) respecting Certain Corrosion-Resistant Steel Sheet
Products from the United States of America. This determination was published in the Canada Gazette on July 16, 1994.
The NAFTA Secretariat has assigned Case Number CDA-94-1904-03 to this request.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Chapter 19 of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace domestic
judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from a NAFTA
country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel is established
to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether it conforms
with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.


Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1994, the Government of the United States,
the Government of Canada and the Government of Mexico established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational
Panel Reviews (``Rules''). These Rules were published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 23, 1994 (59 F.R. 8686). The panel review in this matter will be conducted in accordance with these rules.
A first Request for Panel Review was filed with the Canadian Section of the NAFTA Secretariat, pursuant to Article
1904 of the Agreement, on August 12, 1994, requesting panel review of the final determination of dumping described
above.
Rule 39(1) of the Rules provides, inter alia that:
(a) A Party or interested person may challenge the final determination in whole or in part by filing a Complaint in accordance
with Rule 39 within 30 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review (the deadline for filing a Complaint
is September 12, 1994);
(b) A Party, investigating authority or interested person that does not file a Complaint but that intends to appear
in support of any reviewable portion of the final determination may participate in the panel review by filing a Notice
of Appearance in accordance with Rule 40 within 45 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review (the deadline
for filing a Notice of Appearance is September 26, 1994); and
(c) The panel review shall be limited to the allegations of error of fact or law, including the jurisdiction of the investigating
authority, that are set out in the Complaints filed in the panel review and the procedural and substantive defenses
raised in the panel review.

Atlantic Swordfish Catches by Minor Harvesting Nations; Possible Restrictions on Imports


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS has been asked to conduct an investigation with respect to invoking restrictions on swordfish imports under
the provisions of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA or the Convention). This document provides background
information concerning this request and solicits comments to be considered in the NMFS investigation of the issue.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Blue Water Fishermen's Association asked NMFS to conduct an investigation with respect to invoking restrictions
on swordfish imports under the provisions of the ATCA. The request expressed concern about fisheries developing
in Canada, as well as in the Caribbean and Latin America. It included information showing a 37-percent decline
in U.S. catches from 1988 to 1992 and a 72-percent increase in Canadian landings during the same period. The request
also expressed a concern that Canadian vessels were apparently expanding operations into tropical regions and Bermuda.
It expressed the belief that NMFS should conclude that the apparent absence of effective Canadian regulations to
control harvest (fishing mortality) has undermined the effectiveness of the International Commission for the Conservation
of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT or the Commission) swordfish management program and has jeopardized what was predicted
as a reasonable probability of a stock increase based on the 1992 swordfish stock assessment by ICCAT.


In response to the request, NMFS has undertaken an investigation pursuant to the ATCA, which could lead to the prohibition
of swordfish imports from certain countries. As part of this investigation, NMFS has had a series of formal and informal
exchanges with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in Canada on swordfish catches and on Canadian vessels fishing
outside its exclusive economic zone. 
NMFS also has conducted a series of investigations about Canadian-harvested tuna shipped through Bermuda and has
collated import data from a number of countries fishing for swordfish in the Atlantic. This notice explains the legal
basis for the investigation, provides background information, and seeks additional information.


Regulations Implementing the ATCA


Regulations implementing the ATCA are published at 50 CFR 285, subpart D. They direct NOAA, with the approval of the
Secretary of Commerce and with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, to prohibit: (1) The entry into the United
States of fish in any form of those species which are subject to regulation pursuant to a recommendation of the ICCAT
and which were taken from the ICCAT regulatory area ``in such manner or in such circumstances as would tend to diminish
the effectiveness of the conservation recommendations of the Commission''; and (2) the entry into the United States,
from any country when vessels of such country are being used in the conduct of fishing operations in the regulatory
area in such manner or in such circumstances as would tend to diminish the effectiveness of the conservation recommendations
of ICCAT, of fish in any form of those species which are subject to regulation pursuant to a recommendation of the Commission
and which were taken from the ICCAT regulatory area.
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) is required to make inquiries and investigations, from time
to time, so as to keep informed of the nature and effectiveness of the measures for the implementation of the Commission's
recommendations concerning those activities which are being carried out by foreign countries whose vessels engage
in fishing within the ICCAT regulatory area. The AA also must undertake an investigation when a member of the public
submits a proper request. There are three related issues that the AA must consider:
1. Whether fish in any form are being taken in a manner or under such circumstances that would tend to diminish the effectiveness
of the conservation recommendations of ICCAT,
2. Whether a country is condoning the use of vessels in the conduct of fishing operations in the ICCAT regulatory area
in such a manner or under such circumstances that would tend to diminish the effectiveness of the conservation recommendations
of ICCAT, or
3. Whether a country is condoning the use of vessels in repeated and flagrant fishing operations which seriously threaten
the achievement of the objectives of the ICCAT recommendations.
In conducting the investigation, the AA is to take into account, among other considerations as may be pertinent:
1. Whether the country provides to ICCAT pertinent statistics on a timely basis;
2. Whether the country has in force conservation measures applicable to its own fishermen adequate for the implementation
of the Commission's recommendations;
3. Whether the country has in force measures for the control of landing in its ports of species subject to regulations
which are taken in the ICCAT regulatory area by fishermen of other countries contrary to the ICCAT conservation recommendations;
4. Whether the country, having put conservation measures into effect, takes reasonable action to enforce such measures;
5. The number of vessels of the country which conduct fishing operations in the ICCAT regulatory area; and
6. The quantity of species subject to regulation taken from the regulatory area by the country's vessels contrary
to the ICCAT conservation recommendations and its relationship to: (A) The total quantity permitted to be taken by
the vessels of all countries participating in the fishery; and (B) the quantity of such species sought to be restored
to the stocks of fish pursuant to the Commission's conservation recommendations.


ICCAT Recommendations


In 1990, ICCAT recognized that swordfish yields were not sustainable and that fishing mortality needed to be reduced.
As a result, six management recommendations were approved. First, mortality on fish weighing more than 25 kg was to
be reduced 15-percent from recent levels, using 1988 as a base year. Mortality reductions could be made by reducing
catch or by reducing equivalent effort. Second, taking and landing of fish smaller than 25 kg was prohibited. Tolerances
were allowed for incidental small fish catches, provided that small fish do not exceed 15-percent of the total
number of fish per boat landing. Third, all countries directly fishing for swordfish were to limit fishing mortality
to 1988 catch levels or to an equivalent level of effort. Fourth, notwithstanding the first and third recommendations,
countries with small catches were to keep annual catches at ``reasonable levels'' and abide by all conservation measures
on small fish. (This provision applies to Canada, but not to the United States.) Fifth, countries not targeting swordfish
were to limit incidental catch to not more than 10-percent by weight of the total catch. Sixth, ICCAT was to encourage
cooperation by non-ICCAT members in achieving the conservation goals of the ICCAT recommendations.
The Report of the 1990 ICCAT meeting shows that there was considerable discussion of what would constitute ``reasonable
levels,'' as that term was used in the fourth recommendation, but that term was never specifically defined in the recommendation
itself. Based upon that discussion, the United States understood the term to refer to an allowed increase in total
country catch of up to 45-percent from its 1988 catch levels. When the United States introduced the fourth recommendation
dealing with countries with small catches, Portugal supported the proposed wording, since the total impact of allowing
the countries with smaller catches to increase by 45-percent would be far less than the bycatch taken at that
time and which would be permissible to countries that take swordfish as a bycatch. Canada supported the position of
Portugal.
In 1992, ICCAT's swordfish panel recommended that all nations fishing for Atlantic swordfish restrict 1993-94
catch levels or fishing capacity to recent levels (i.e., 1990-91). The panel also recommended that the Standing
Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) assess the impact of conservation measures on the stock at the 1994 meeting.


Fishing Records


No country filed an objection to either the 1990 or 1992 recommendations; thus, the recommendations have come into
force. As a result of the U.S. regulations implementing the ICCAT recommendations, U.S. landings have dropped rapidly
from an all-time high of 6,385 metric tons (mt) in 1989 to the following levels for 1990-93, respectively: 5,494
mt, 4,255 mt, 3,833 mt, and 2,584 mt. (The 1993 figure is preliminary.) This is a 60-percent reduction in catch
in 4 years. In terms of the 1990 ICCAT recommendation setting the small fish tolerance level at 15-percent by
number, the percentage and number of small fish landed also have decreased annually and, for the period 1989-92,
were 37.7-percent (65,712 small fish from a total catch of 174,271), 32.5-percent (46,381 small fish
from a total catch of 142,847), 21.8-percent (21,391 small fish from a total catch of 98,306), and 7-percent
(5,417 small fish from a total catch of 77,487), respectively. Effort has decreased as well. The number of vessels
that actually have fished has dropped 25-percent from 457 to 334.
Canadian landings have shown an opposite trend. From 1985-89, annual Canadian catches were 585 mt, 1,059 mt,
954 mt, 898 mt, and 1,247 mt, respectively_well below Canada's self-determined quota of 3,500 mt for those years.
In response to the 1990 ICCAT recommendations for swordfish, Canada reduced its self-determined quota to 2,000 mt.
Since then, Canadian harvests of swordfish have rapidly increased from 991 mt in 1990, 1,026 mt in 1991, 1,547 mt in
1992, to approximately 2,322 mt in 1993. This is a 134-percent increase in landings. Prior to 1992, the last year
that Canadian catches exceeded 1,500 mt was in 1980. The percentage and number of small fish landed have fluctuated
annually, and, for the period 1989-92, were 16.4-percent (3,445 small fish from a total catch of 20,980),
10.7-percent (1,445 small fish from a total catch of 13,525), 11.4-percent (1,824 small fish from a total
catch of 15,988), and 15.5-percent (4,092 small fish from a total catch of 26,465), respectively. (Canada's
1993 small catch data was not available at the time of printing.)
Since Canada harvested 898 mt in 1988, a 45-percent increase would have been to 1,302 mt. However, Canada's current
quota of 2,000 mt is an increase of over 120-percent from 1988 levels. Additionally, Canada's swordfish harvest
in 1993 exceeded this quota by approximately 322 mt. Canada's quota for 1994 again is set at 2,000 mt.
In a meeting with the United States on this issue, Canada contended that its 2,000 mt quota was within ``reasonable
levels'' and disagreed with the U.S. view that Canada, a ``minor'' harvesting nation at the time the ICCAT recommendations
came into force, should limit its harvest to a 45-percent increase over its 1988 catch level. Canada pointed
out that, prior to the health alert of the 1970s that nearly closed the fishery, Canadian fisherman were harvesting
well over 2,000 mt. Further, Canada maintained that, until recently, no country had objected to its self-determined
2,000 mt quota. Canada argued that its quota reduction from 3,500 mt to 2,000 mt was tantamount to compliance with the
fourth ICCAT recommendation.
In addition to Canadian swordfish harvests, recent U.S. import statistics have raised a concern that certain other
countries also may be harvesting swordfish in amounts inconsistent with the fourth ICCAT recommendation. For example,
Grenada increased its exports to the United States more than 500-percent since 1990, to 3.29 mt; St. Vincent
and the Grenadines increased its exports 25-percent since 1992, to 13.39 mt; and Venezuela, an ICCAT member,
has increased its exports 150-percent since 1990, to 141.5 mt.
As part of its investigation into alleged noncompliance, NMFS is seeking additional information pertaining to the
compliance by minor swordfish harvesting nations with relevant ICCAT recommendations. The texts of the relevant
recommendations and U.S. domestic regulations can be obtained by contacting NMFS (see

<DOCTITLE>Taking of Marine Mammals Incidental to Commercial Fishing Operations; Interim Exemption for Commercial Fisheries
</DOCTITLE>

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final List of Fisheries for 1994.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final List of Fisheries for 1994 pursuant to the interim exemption for the taking of marine mammals
incidental to commercial fishing operations under section 114 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA).
The 1994 final list revises the categories of certain U.S. commercial fisheries based on new information obtained
since publication of the 1993 final List of Fisheries. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 114 of the MMPA establishes an interim exemption for the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial
fishing operations and requires NMFS to publish and annually update the List of Fisheries, along with the marine mammals
and the number of vessels or persons involved in each fishery, arranging them according to categories, as follows:





1. A fishery that has a frequent incidental taking of marine mammals; 

2. A fishery that has an occasional incidental taking of marine mammals; or 

3. A fishery that has a remote likelihood, or no known incidental taking, of marine mammals. 

The following criteria are used in classifying fisheries in the List of Fisheries, pursuant to section 114 of the MMPA:




Category I. 

There is documented information indicating a ``frequent'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery. ``Frequent''
means that it is highly likely that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel
in the fishery during a 20-day period. 



Category II. 

(1) There is documented information indicating an ``occasional'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery,
or (2) in the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals, other factors
such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished,
and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is a likelihood of at least an ``occasional''
incidental taking in the fishery. ``Occasional'' means that there is some likelihood that one marine mammal will
be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period, but that there is little
likelihood that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken. 



Category III. 

(1) There is information indicating no more than a ``remote likelihood'' of an incidental taking of a marine mammal
in the fishery, or (2) in the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals,
other factors such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons
and areas fished, and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is no more than a remote likelihood
of an incidental take in the fishery. ``Remote likelihood'' means that it is highly unlikely that any marine mammal
will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period. 

On March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10372), NMFS published the proposed List of Fisheries for 1994 and requested comments and information
on the changes contained therein. After reviewing the comments received, NMFS has determined that all changes identified
in the proposed list are warranted and will be incorporated into the final list. In addition, portions of the mid-Atlantic
coastal gill net fishery (upper river and estuarine areas of the Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay and New York Bight, as
well as Pamlico and Albemarle Sound in North Carolina) will be reclassified under Category III based on recently obtained
information which suggests the rare occurrence of marine mammal takes in these areas. Gillnetters operating outside
of these areas in the mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery must still register under Category II, regardless of whether
or not they sometimes participate in the reclassified inshore fishery mentioned earlier (Category III). 

This final list will remain in effect until the interim exemption established under section 114 of the MMPA becomes
obselete. The MMPA was amended on April 30, 1994, and section 118 was created to govern the taking of marine mammals
incidental to commercial fishing operations. The provisions of section 118 will replace the current interim exemption
system (section 114), when regulations are put into effect, no later than September 1, 1995. Included in the implementation
will be a revised List of Fisheries, a revised set of classification criteria, and new implementing regulations,
based on the provisions of section 118, to replace those provisions currently in effect.

Comments Received on the 1994 Proposed List of Fisheries 



Ten comments were received in response to the request for comments on the proposed List of Fisheries for 1994. The comments
were mixed in their support for and opposition to the changes proposed and are summarized below. 



Washington, Oregon Lower Columbia River Salmon Drift Gill Net Fishery 



Several comments were received in support of the proposed recategorization of the Columbia River commercial gill
net fishery from a Category I to a Category III fishery, based on the relatively low level of incidental marine mammal
mortality. NMFS has reclassified this fishery as proposed. 



Alaska Copper River and Bering River Salmon Drift Gill Net Fishery 



A number of the comments favored the proposed recategorization of the Alaska Copper River and Bering River (adjacent
to Prince William Sound) salmon drift gill net fishery from a Category I to a Category II fishery. Until recently, take
rates for this fishery were based on the total number of interactions, which included momentary interactions with
the nets as well as serious injuries and mortalities. For this fishery, NMFS recognizes that many entanglements recorded
by observers resulted in the animals freeing themselves from the net without assistance from fishermen. NMFS has
reclassified the Alaska Copper River and Bering River (adjacent to Prince William Sound) drift gill net fishery to
Category II as proposed. 



Alaska Prince William Sound and Alaska Southern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Western Gulf of Alaska Sablefish
Longline Fisheries 



One comment was received recommending reclassification of the Alaska Prince William Sound and Alaska Southern Bering
Sea, Aleutian Islands and Western Gulf of Alaska sablefish longline fisheries from a Category II to a Category III
fishery. The commenter stated that although fishermen chase away killer whales from sablefish caught on longline
gear, this action does not meet the definition of incidental take under the MMPA interim exemption. 

Under section 114 of the MMPA and based on congressional guidance, takes include the harassment, entanglement, injury
or mortality of a marine mammal. NMFS believes that the deterring killer whales from catch and gear in sablefish longline
fisheries constitutes harassment. Therefore, under section 114, these takes qualify the fishery for Category II
classification. 

Section 118 of the MMPA's recent amendments has directed NMFS to consider only incidental mortality and serious injury
takes when categorizing fisheries under the new regime that is to replace the interim exemption by September 1995.
The amendment also prohibits intentional lethal takes of marine mammals, except when necessary to save human life.
Therefore, NMFS will reevaluate Alaska sablefish longline fisheries for possible reclassification to Category
III when it prepares a List of Fisheries under the provisions of Section 118. 



Gulf of Maine Atlantic Salmon Aquaculture Fishery 



One comment was received in support of the proposal to reclassify the Gulf of Maine Atlantic salmon aquaculture fishery
from a Category III to a Category II fishery. The commenter cited admissions by industry representatives of high kill
rates and potential under-reporting of marine mammal mortalities in this fishery, and recommended recategorization
as a Category I fishery, in lieu of the original proposal for change to Category II. 

List of Fisheries criteria for a Category I classification require: (1) Documented information indicating a ``frequent''
incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery or (2) the expressed intention of Congress to place the fishery
in Category I (50 CFR 229.3). 

Due to the limited documented evidence of incidental takings and the absence of definitive guidance from Congress
regarding this fishery, only a Category II classification is warranted at this time. NMFS will enhance efforts to
obtain better information on current take levels and the degree to which marine mammals are deterred from aquaculture
operations in this fishery.

All California Gill Net Fisheries (except the CA Klamath River gill net fishery) 



A number of comments were received on the proposal to recategorize all California gill net fisheries based on the mesh
size of the gear deployed. One commenter indicated that the State of California passed legislation banning the use
of gill nets, thus, making the Federal recategorization of California gill net fisheries unnecessary. Actually,
the State of California has not banned the use of gill nets completely, but has only restricted their use in State waters.


In 1990, State of California passed the Marine Resources Protection Act (MRPA), which prohibits the use of gill and
trammel nets in an area identified as the Marine Resources Protection Zone (MRPZ). The MRPZ includes ocean waters
from 0-3 nautical miles from the California mainland coast, and any manmade breakwater, between a line extending
due west from Point Arguello, Santa Barbara County, and a line extending due west from the U.S.-Mexico border. The
MRPZ also includes waters less than 35 fathoms (64 m) deep, between Point Fermin, Los Angeles County, and the south
jetty at Newport Beach, Orange County. Further, the MRPZ encompasses waters less than 70 fathoms deep, or within 1
mile, whichever is less, of the Channel Islands consisting of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Anacapa, San Nicholas, Santa
Barbara, Santa Catalina, and San Clemente Islands. The MRPA also established in perpetuity State legislation restricting
the use of gill nets in the waters north of Point Arguello. Despite these prohibitions, there is still an active, but
significantly reduced, set gill net fishery in California waters. For example, a set gill net fishery for Pacific
herring sac-roe in San Francisco Bay is active during the months of December through March. In addition, there are
approximately 20 set gill net vessels that are continuing to fish in the Southern California Bight, and in Central
California, there are no water depth restrictions for set gill net fishing between Point Sal and Arguello. The MRPA
does not affect the offshore drift gill net fishery for shark and swordfish. 

Other comments were received that were in favor of the change in classification of California gill net fisheries based
on mesh size. Although a correlation between mortality rates and mesh size has been observed in California gill net
fisheries, this relationship may not be applicable to other gill net fisheries outside California. Therefore, as
the commenters noted, this change should not be applied to non-California gill net fisheries until there is information
to support such a change. 

Based on evidence presented in the notice of the proposed List of Fisheries for 1994 (59 FR 10372, March 4, 1994), reclassification
of fisheries that use mesh sizes greater than 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) to Category I and reclassification of fisheries that
use mesh sizes less than or equal to 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) to Category III is warranted. 



Mid-Atlantic Coastal Gill Net Fishery 



Although changes to this fishery were not proposed, many comments were received concerning the mid-Atlantic coastal
gill net fishery. Commenters indicated that a lack of justification exists for the Category II designation within
the inner bays, rivers, and tributaries along the mid-Atlantic coast, and these areas should be reclassified as Category
III fisheries. 

NMFS has evaluated existing information and agrees that the reclassification of certain areas is warranted. The
category II classification of the mid-Atlantic coastal gill net fishery will continue to apply to all gill nets set
in coastal waters from North Carolina to Nantucket, MA, excluding the segments described below. 



Inshore Mid-Atlantic Gillnet Fisheries: Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts and New York Bight 



All gill net fisheries operating landward of the first bridge of any embayment in Rhode Island, southern Massachusetts
(to Monomoy Island), Raritan, and lower New York Bays in New York Bight are reclassified as Category III fisheries.




Long Island Sound 



All gill net fisheries setting nets west of a line from the north fork of the eastern end of Long Island, NY (Orient Point
to Plum Island to Fishers Island) to Watch Hill, RI are reclassified as Category III fisheries.

Delaware Bay 



Harbor porpoise and bottlenose dolphin have stranded inside Delaware Bay as far as Fortescue, NJ. Therefore, only
those gill net fisheries operating north of a line drawn from the southern point of Nantuxent Cove (mouth of Cedar Creek,
NJ) to southern boundary of Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge at Kelly Island, DE (Port Mahon) are reclassified
as Category III fisheries. 


Chesapeake Bay 



Seaward of the Chesapeake Bay/Bridge Tunnel, 42 bottlenose dolphin and 65 harbor porpoise stranded in Virginian
waters during 1993-94. Landward of the Chesapeake Bay/Bridge Tunnel, approximately 14 bottlenose dolphin and 1
harbor porpoise were reported stranded in 1993-94, with little evidence of gill net interactions. Therefore, all
gill net fisheries operating between the Chesapeake Bay/Bridge Tunnel and the mainland are reclassified as Category
III fisheries. 



North Carolina 



After extensive monitoring of gill net effort monitoring in Pamlico and Albermarle Sound, the North Carolina Department
of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources has reported no marine mammals incidentally taken in these areas.
Therefore, all gill net fisheries operating between the Outer Banks and the mainland from Morehead City, NC to the
North Carolina-Virginia border are reclassified as Category III fisheries.

Notice of Availability of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) 
for the Transfer of Wake to Other Federal Agencies 



The U.S. Air Force is proposing the transfer of Wake Island Airfield (WIA) to other federal agencies in accordance
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementing
NEPA, the Department of Defense Directive (DOD) 6050.1 and Air Force Regulation (AFR) 19-2. These directives
require the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to consider environmental consequences when authorizing or approving federal
actions. 

The USAF has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) analyzing the potential environmental consequences of the
proposed transfer of civil administration authority for WIA from the USAF to other federal agencies, and the planned
future uses of WIA by the recipient agencies. 

On the basis of the EA, we conclude the implementation of the proposed action or any of the alternatives will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the environment at WIA and, as a result, an Environmental Impact Statement is
not warranted. 

Comments on this FONSI must be received on or before September 15, 1994 and may be addressed to Capt William Cronin,
15 CES/CEVP, 75 H Street, Hickam AFB HI 96853-5328, Telephone (808) 449-7514. 

Documents are available for public review at Hawaii State University, 478 South King, Honolulu, HI, 96813, Telephone

<DOCTITLE>Nominations to the Inland Waterways Users Board</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office, Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 302 of Public Law 99-662 established the Inland Waterways Users Board. The Board is an independent Federal
advisory committee. Its eleven members are appointed by the Secretary of the Army. This notice replaces the notice
with the same subject published in the 

Federal Register

 on 4 August 1994. That notice solicited nominations for five appointments or reappointments to two year terms that
will begin January 1, 1995. Subsequent to the submission of the August 4, 1994 notice, a member of the Inland Waterways
Users Board eligible for reappointment indicated he will decline reappointment. This notice modifies the solicitation
of nominations to reflect this change and extends the date for submitting nominations until September 19, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The selection, service and appointment of board members are covered by provisions of Section 302 of Public Law 99-662.
The substance of these provisions is as follows:



Selection


Members are to be selected from the spectrum of commercial carriers and shippers using the inland and intracoastal
waterways, to represent geographical regions and to be representative of waterway commerce as determined by commodity
ton-mile statistics.



Service



The Board is required to meet at least semi-annually to develop and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army
on waterways construction and rehabilitation priorities and spending levels for commercial navigation improvements,
and report its recommendations annually to the Secretary and the Congress.



Appointment



The operation of the Board and the appointment of its members are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub.
L. 92-463 as amended) and Departmental implementing regulations. Members serve without compensation but
their expenses due to board activities are reimbursable.

The considerations specified in Section 302 for the selection of the Board members, and certain terms used therein,
have been interpreted, supplemented, or otherwise clarified as follows:



Carriers and Shippers



The law uses the terms ``primary users and shippers.'' Primary users has been interpreted to mean the providers of
transportation services on inland waterways such as barge or towboat operators. Shippers has been interpreted to
mean the purchasers of such services for the movement of commodities they own or control. Individuals are appointed
to the Board, but they must be either a carrier or a shipper, or represent a firm that is a carrier or shipper. For that
purpose a trade or regional association is neither a shipper or primary user.



Geographical Representation



The law specifies ``various'' regions. For the purpose of selecting Board members, the waterways subjected to fuel
taxes and described in Public Law 94-502, as amended, have been aggregated into six regions. These are: (1) The
Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries above the mouth of the Ohio; (2) the Lower Mississippi River and its tributaries
below the mouth of the Ohio and above Baton Rouge; (3) the Ohio River and its tributaries; (4) the Gulf Intracoastal
Waterway in Louisiana and Texas; (5) the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed
waterways east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed waterways including Tennessee-Tombigbee, plus the Atlantic
Intracoastal Waterway below Norfolk; and (6) the Columbia-Snake River System and Upper Willamette. The intent is
that each region shall be represented by at least one Board member, with that representation determined by the regional
concentration of the individual's traffic on the waterways.



Commodity Representation



Waterway commerce has been aggregated into six commodity categories based on ``inland'' ton-miles shown in Waterborne
Commerce of the United States. In rank order they are: (1) Farm and Food Products; (2) Coal and Coke; (3) Petroleum,
Crude and Products; (4) Minerals, Ores, and Products; (5) Chemicals and Allied Products; and (6) All other.


A consideration in the selection of Board members will be, that the commodities carried or shipped by those individuals
or their firms will be reasonably representative of the above commodity categories.


Reflecting preceding selection criteria, the present representation by Board members is as follows:


The five members whose terms expire December 31, 1994, include one shipper representative representing the Upper
Mississippi River Region (Region 1) and farm and food products, ethanol and coal; one shipper representative representing
the Lower Mississippi River Region (Region 2), and farm and food products; one carrier representative representing
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Louisiana and Texas (Region 4), and petroleum and petroleum products; one carrier
representative representing the Ohio River Region (Region 3), and coal and coke, minerals, and metals, petroleum
and petroleum products, farm and food products and chemicals; and one carrier representative representing the Columbia-Snake
River System and Upper Willamette (Region 6), and farm and food products, petroleum products, chemicals, containers,
and forest products. The members representing Regions 2, 3 and 6 area eligible for reappointment. However, the member
representing Region 6 has indicated that he will decline reappointment to the Board.


The six members whose terms expire December 31, 1995, include three shipper representatives representing (1) the
Lower Mississippi River (Region 2), and farm and food products, (2) the Ohio River (Region 3), and coal, and (3) the
East Gulf region (Region 5), and coal; two carrier representatives representing the Ohio River Region (Region 3),
and farm and food products, coal, petroleum, chemicals, minerals and metals; and one shipper/carrier representative
representing the Ohio River Region (Region 3), and coal.


Nominations to replace members whose terms expire December 31, 1994, may be made by individuals, firms, or associations.
Nominations should state the region to be represented and whether the nominee is to represent carriers or shippers.
Information should be provided on the nominee's personal qualifications and the commercial operations of the carrier
and/or shipper with whom the nominee associated. The latter information should show the actual or estimated ton-miles
of commodities carried or shipped on inland waterways in a recent year (or years) using the waterway regions and commodity
categories previously listed.


Nominations received in response to last year's 

Federal Register

 notice published on August 9, 1993, have been retained for consideration for reappointment along with nominations
received in response to this 

Federal Register

 notice. Renomination is not required but may be desirable.


Deadline for Nominations



All nominations must be received at the address provided in this notice not later than September 19, 1994.

Notice of Intention to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement



The Commission staff has determined that licensing the existing projects could constitute a major Federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS) for Thunder Bay and Hillman Hydro Project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy
Act.

The staff's EIS will consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed project and
reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis.

A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will
be analyzed by the Commission staff and considered in a final EIS.



Project Site Visit



The applicant and Commission staff will conduct a project site visit of the Thunder Bay and Hillman Hydro Project.
The site meeting will be held starting at 1:00 P.M. on September 6, 1994 at the entrance of the Best Western Motel, 1286
M32 West, Alpena, Michigan and continue the next day (on September 7, 1994), and if needed on September 8, 1994, as well.
All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend. All participants are responsible
for their own transportation to and from the project site. For more details, interested parties should contact Patrick
Murphy, FERC, at (202) 219-2659, prior to the site visit date.



Scoping Meetings



The Commission staff will conduct one evening scoping meeting and one morning scoping meeting. All interested individuals,
organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental
issues that should be analyzed in the EIS.

To help focus discussions, a preliminary EIS scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed at the scoping
meetings will be distributed by mail to persons and entities on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the preliminary scoping
document will also be made available at the meetings.

The evening meeting will be held on Wednesday, September 7, 1994, from 7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. (or later) at the Natural
Resources Center, Room 150 (NRC 150), Alpena Community College, 666 Johnson Street, Alpena, Michigan.

The morning meeting will be held on Wednesday, September 7, 1994, from 9:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. at the Conference Room,

Objectives



At the scoping meetings, the Commission staff will: (1) summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified
for analysis in the planned EIS; (2) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially
quantified data, on the resources at issue, and (3) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that
should be analyzed in the EIS.

Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EIS.



Meeting Procedures



The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and, thereby, will become a part of the formal record of the Commission
proceeding on this project. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to identify themselves
for the record.

Concerned parties are encouraged to offer us verbal guidance during public meetings. Speaking time allowed for individuals
will be determined before each meeting, based on the number of persons wishing to speak and the approximate amount
of time available for the session, but all speakers will be provided at least five minutes to present their views.

Persons choosing not to speak but wishing to express an opinion, as well as speakers unable to summarize their positions
within their allotted time, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record.

Written scoping comments may also be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, until October 7, 1994. All filings should contain an original and 8 copies. Failure
to file an original and 8 copies may result in appropriate staff not receiving the benefit of your comments in a timely
manner. See 18 CFR 4.34(h).

All correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Scoping Comments, Thunder Bay and
Hillman Hydro Project, FERC Nos. 2404-017 and 2419-007, Michigan.

All those attending the meeting are urged to refrain from making any communications concerning the merits of the application
to any member of the Commission staff outside of the established process for developing the record as stated into the
record of the proceeding.

Further, interested persons are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures, requiring parties
or interceders (as defined in 18 CFR 385.2010) to file documents on each person whose name is on the official service
list for this proceeding. See 18 CFR 4.34(b).

all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

El Paso states that it can presently deliver 1,080 Mcf of natural gas per day at the existing Bell Ranch Tap. El Paso indicates
that pursuant to an agreement with Southwest dated February 18, 1994, El Paso agreed to upgrade the Bell Ranch Tap to
accommodate Southwest's request for the delivery of up to 650 Mcf per day of additional volumes to a maximum of 1,730
Mcf per day. According to El Paso, Southwest will use the additional volumes of natural gas to be delivered at the upgraded
tap to serve existing and new residential, commercial, and industrial requirements in the area. El Paso further states
that the total estimated cost of the proposed facilities is $73,000, and that Southwest has agreed to reimburse El
Paso for the costs related to upgrading the Bell Ranch Tap to a meter station.

3. Koch Gateway Pipeline Company 



[Docket No. CP94-718-000]
 


Take notice that on August 16, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch), P.O. Box 1478, Houston, Texas 77251-1478,
filed in Docket No. CP94-718-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's

ability to serve its other existing customers. 



Comment date:

 October 3, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



4. Shell Offshore, Inc. 



[Docket No. CP94-722-000]
 


Take notice that on August 17, 1994, Shell Offshore, Inc. (SOI), One Shell Square, New Orleans, Louisiana 70139, filed
a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94-722-000, requesting that the Commission declare
that facilities to be constructed on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) would have the primary function of gathering
natural gas and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural
Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.


SOI states that it proposes to construct a seven-mile, 12-inch pipeline extending from the production platform in
Mississippi Canyon Block 194 (MC-194), offshore Louisiana to a sub-sea interconnect with the 20-inch jurisdictional
transmission line jointly owned by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company in Mississippi
Canyon Block 148. SOI further states that the line would be owned by the working interest owners in MC-194 and
would be used to gather their production. SOI indicates that the line would be operated at a pressure of 1250 psig and
that compression, dehydration and separation facilities are located on the production platform in MC-194,
but that any processing for the extraction and removal of liquids and liquefiable hydrocarbons would occur at onshore
processing plants. 

SOI seeks a declaratory order holding that the proposed facilities would have the primary function of gathering natural
gas and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act.
In support of its claim that the primary function of the proposed facility is gathering, SOI points out the following:
(1) the length (seven miles) and diameter (12 inches) are comparable to other OCS facilities previously determined
to be gathering, (2) the geographic configuration of the facility (a small diameter gathering line feeding production
into a larger diameter interstate pipeline) is consistent with other OCS gathering facilities, (3) the facility
will be located entirely behind onshore processing plants, and (4) the facility will be owned by the working owners
in MC-194 to gather their production to a point where it can be received for transportation onshore. SOI indicates
that 20,000 Mcf per day of production from MC-194 is currently curtailed due to inadequate pipeline capacity,
and SOI requests that an expedited decision be issued permitting the facilities to be placed into service during the
1994 offshore Louisiana window.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the

Requirements (EPA ICR No. 1135.05; OMB No. 2060-0171). This is a request for renewal of a currently approved
information collection.



Abstract: 

Owners or operators of magnetic tape coating facilities must provide EPA, or the delegated State regulatory authority,
with one-time notifications and reports, and must keep records, as required of all facilities subject to the general
NSPS requirements. In addition, facilities subject to this subpart must install a continuous monitoring system

Information Collection Submitted to 
the Office of Management and Budget For Review 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Housing Finance Board.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of submission to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of existing information collection for purposes
of renewal of OMB approval.


</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The information collection described below has been submitted to OMB for review in order to obtain a renewal of OMB
approval prior to expiration of the currently assigned OMB control number (3069-0002) on October 31, 1994.





Title of Information Collection: 

Personal Certification and Disclosure Forms. 



Need For and Use of Information Collection: 

The Federal Home Loan Bank Act (Bank Act) establishes certain eligibility requirements for Federal Home Loan Bank
(Bank) appointive and elective directors and authorizes the Federal Housing Finance Board (Board) to promulgate
rules implementing these requirements. 

See 

12 U.S.C. 1422b(a)(1), 1427(a), (b), (d). 

Selected provisions of parts 931 and 932 of the Board's regulations (director eligibility provisions) implement
the statutory eligibility requirements for Bank directors. 

See 

12 CFR parts 931 and 932. The information collection is used by Board staff to determine whether prospective and seated
Bank directors satisfy the statutory eligibility requirements and are carrying out their official responsibilities
without conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest. 

The director eligibility provisions require appointive directors; candidates for appointive director; elective
directors; and nominees for elective director to file forms with the Board certifying their compliance with the applicable
statutory and regulatory requirements and disclosing certain financial relationships. 

Where the information collected indicates that an appointive director candidate or elective director nominee is
not eligible to serve, the person is so notified, and his or her name is withdrawn from consideration for the directorship,
unless the person intends to remedy the ineligibility. If the information collected reveals that a seated appointive
director is ineligible to serve, the director is so notified and is either required to resign or given the opportunity,
in the Board's discretion, to cure the ineligibility. If the information collected indicates that a seated elective
director is ineligible, the person is so notified, and the directorship becomes vacant immediately, by operation
of the statute. 

See 

12 U.S.C. 1427(f)(3). The Board would promptly notify the affected Bank of any vacancies that have arisen on its board.




Description of Likely Respondents: 

The respondents to this information collection will include all Bank appointive directors; candidates for appointive
director; elective directors; and nominees for elective director. 



Estimate of Burden: 

The total annual average number of respondents is estimated at 350, with one response required per respondent. The
average hours per response is estimated at 0.9 hours.

Grants for Injury Control Research Centers; Notice Availability Of Funds for Fiscal Year 1995 



Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces that grant applications are being accepted for Injury
Control Research Centers (ICRC's). The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion
and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and
mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority areas of Violent and Abusive
Behavior and Unintentional Injuries. For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the Section ``Where to Obtain
Additional Information.'' 


Authority 


This program is authorized under Sections 301 and 391-394 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 and
280b-280b-3). Program regulations are set forth in 42 CFR, Part 52. 


Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants include all nonprofit and for-profit organizations. Thus, universities, colleges, research
institutions, hospitals, other public and private organizations, State and local health departments, and small,
minority and/or women-owned businesses are eligible for these grants. Applicants from non-academic institutions
should provide evidence of a collaborative relationship with an academic institution. Current recipients of CDC
injury control research center grants and injury control research program project grants are eligible to apply.



Availability of Funds 



Approximately $1,500,000 is expected to be available in fiscal year (FY) 1995 to fund approximately one new or re-competing
center award. (A portion of this amount may be allocated to support currently approved but unfunded phases of newly
funded ICRCs.) New awards can be made for a project period not to exceed three years, and re-competing awards can be
made for a project period not to exceed five years. The amount of funding available may vary and is subject to change.
Beginning award dates for each submission are shown in the ``Receipt and Review Schedule'' section of this announcement.
Continuation awards 
within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 

New center grant awards will not exceed $500,000 per year (total of direct and indirect costs) with a project period
not to exceed three years. Depending on availability of funds, re-competing existing center awards may range from
$750,000 to $1,500,000 per year (total of direct and indirect costs) with a project period not to exceed five years.
The range of support provided is dependent upon the degree of comprehensiveness of the center in addressing the phases
of injury control (i.e., Prevention, Acute Care, and Rehabilitation) as determined by the Injury Research Grants
Review Committee (IRGRC). 

Incremental levels within this range for successfully recompeting ICRC's will be determined as follows:



Base funding (included in figures below): Up to $750,000 

One phase ICRC (addresses one of the three phases of injury control): Up to $1,000,000 
 
Two phase ICRC (addresses two of the three phases of injury control): Up to $1,250,000 
 
Comprehensive ICRC (addresses all three phases of injury control): Up to $1,500,000 


 

Subject to program needs and the availability of funds, supplemental awards to expand/enhance existing projects,
to add a new phase(s) to an existing ICRC grant, or to add biomechanics project(s) that support phases may be made for
up to $250,000 per year. 



Purpose 


The purposes of this program are:

F. To facilitate injury control efforts supported by various governmental agencies within a geographic region.




Program Requirements 



A. Applicants must demonstrate and apply expertise in at least one of the three phases of injury control (prevention,
acute care, or rehabilitation) as a core component of the center. The second and/or third phases do not have to be supported
by core funding but may be achieved through collaborative arrangements. Comprehensive ICRC's must have all three
phases supported by core funding. 

B. Applicants must document ongoing injury-related research projects or control activities currently supported
by other sources of funding. 

C. Applicants must provide a director (Principal Investigator) who has specific authority and responsibility to
carry out the project. The director must report to an appropriate institutional official, e.g., dean of a school,
vice president of a university, or commissioner of health. The director must have no less than 30 percent effort devoted

solely to this project with an anticipated range of 30 to 50 percent. 

 D. Applicants must demonstrate experience in successfully conducting, evaluating, and publishing injury research
and/or designing, implementing, and evaluating injury control programs. 

E. Applicants must provide evidence of working relationships with outside agencies and other entities which will
allow for implementation of any proposed intervention activities. 

F. Applicants must provide evidence of involvement of specialists or experts in medicine, engineering, epidemiology,
law and criminal justice, behavioral and social sciences, biostatistics, and/or public health as needed to complete
the plans of the center. These are considered the disciplines and fields for ICRC's. An ICRC is encouraged to involve
biomechanicists in its research. This, again, may be achieved through collaborative relationships as it is no longer
a requirement that all ICRC's have biomechanical engineering expertise. 

G. Applicants must have an established curricula and graduate training programs in disciplines relevant to injury
control (e.g., epidemiology, biomechanics, safety engineering, traffic safety, behavioral sciences, or economics).


H. Applicants must demonstrate the ability to disseminate injury control research findings, translate them into
interventions, and evaluate their effectiveness. 

I. Applicants must have an established relationship, demonstrated by letters of agreement, with injury prevention
and control programs or injury surveillance programs being carried out in the State or region in which the ICRC is located.
Cooperation with private-sector programs is encouraged. 

Applicants should have an established or documented planned relationship with organizations or individual leaders
in communities where injuries occur at high rates, e.g., minority health communities. 

Grant funds will not be made available to support the provision of direct care. Studies may be supported which evaluate
methods of care and rehabilitation for potential reductions in injury effects and costs. Studies can be supported
which identify the effect on injury outcomes and cost of systems for pre-hospital, hospital, and rehabilitative
care and independent living. 

Eligible applicants may enter into contracts, including consortia agreements (as set forth in the PHS Grants Policy
Statement, dated April 1, 1994), as necessary to meet the requirements of the program and strengthen the overall application.



Evaluation Criteria 



Upon receipt, applications will be reviewed by CDC staff for completeness and responsiveness as outlined under the
previous heading ``Program Requirements.'' (A listing of where these requirements are described and/or documented
in the application will facilitate the review process.) Incomplete applications 
and applications that are not responsive will be returned to the applicant without further consideration.

Applications which are complete and responsive may be subjected to a preliminary evaluation by reviewers from the
Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC) to determine if the application is of sufficient technical and scientific
merit to warrant further review; the CDC will withdraw from further consideration applications judged to be noncompetitive
and promptly notify the principal investigator/program director and the official signing for the applicant organization.


Those applications judged to be competitive will be further evaluated by a dual review process. The primary review
will be a peer evaluation (IRGRC) of the scientific and technical merit of the application. The final review will be
conducted by the CDC Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control (ACIPC), which will consider the results
of the peer review together with program need and relevance. Funding decisions will be made by the Director, National
Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), based on merit and priority score ranking by the IRGRC, program
review by the ACIPC, and the availability of funds. 



A. Review by the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC) 



Peer review of ICRC grant applications will be conducted by the IRGRC, which may recommend the application for further
consideration or not for further consideration. Site visits will be a part of this process for recompeting ICRC's.
Reverse site visits may be a part of this process for new applicants. 

Factors to be considered by IRGRC include: 

1. The specific aims of the application, e.g., the long-term objectives and intended accomplishments. 

2. The scientific and technical merit of the overall application, including the significance and originality (e.g.,
new topic, new method, new approach in a new population, or advancing understanding of the problem) of the proposed
research. 

3. The extent to which the evaluation plan will allow for the measurement of progress toward the achievement of stated
objectives. 

4. Qualifications, adequacy, and appropriateness of personnel to accomplish the proposed activities. 

5. The soundness of the proposed budget in terms of adequacy of resources and their allocation. 

6. The appropriateness (e.g., responsiveness, quality, and quantity) of consultation, technical assistance,
and training in identifying, implementing, and/or evaluating intervention/control measures that will be provided
to public and private agencies and institutions, with emphasis on State and local health departments, as evidenced
by letters detailing the nature and extent of this commitment and collaboration. Specific letters of support or understanding
from appropriate governmental bodies must be provided. 

7. Evidence of other public and private financial support. 

8. Progress thus far made as detailed in the application if the applicant is submitting a competitive renewal application.
Documented success examples include: development of pilot projects; completion of high quality research projects;
publication of findings in peer reviewed scientific and technical journals; number of professionals trained; provision
of consultation and technical assistance; integration of disciplines; translation of research into implementation;
impact on injury control outcomes including legislation/regulation, treatment, and behavior modification interventions.




B. Review by CDC Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control (ACIPC) 



Factors to be considered by ACIPC include: 

1. The results of the peer review. 

2. The significance of the proposed activities as they relate to national program priorities and the achievement
of national objectives. 

3. National and programmatic needs and geographic balance. 

4. Overall distribution of the thematic focus of competing applications; the nationally comprehensive balance
of the program in addressing; the three phases of injury control (prevention, acute care, and rehabilitation); the
control of injury among populations who are at increased risk, including minority groups, the elderly and children;
the major causes of intentional and unintentional injury; and the major disciplines of injury control (such as biomechanics
and epidemiology). 

5. Within budgetary considerations the ACIPC will establish annual funding levels as detailed under the heading
``Availability of Funds.'' 



C. Applications for Supplemental Funding 



Supplemental grant awards may be made when funds are available to support research work or activities. Applications
should be clearly labeled to denote their status as requesting supplemental funding support. These applications
will be reviewed by the IRGRC and the ACIPC. 



D. Continued Funding 



Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of the availability of funds and the following
criteria: 

1. The accomplishments of the current budget period show that the applicant's objectives as prescribed in the yearly
workplans are being met; 

2. The objectives for the new budget period are realistic, specific, and measurable; 

3. The methods described will clearly lead to achievement of these objectives; 

4. The evaluation plan allows management to monitor whether the methods are effective by having clearly defined process,
impact, and outcome objectives, and the applicant demonstrates progress in implementing the evaluation plan; 

5. The budget request is clearly explained, adequately justified, reasonable, and consistent with the intended
use of grant funds; and 

6. Progress has been made in developing cooperative and collaborative relationships with injury surveillance and

<DOCTITLE>Cooperative Agreement for the National Coalition for </DOCTITLE>
Adult Immunization 



Introduction 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Immunization Program (NIP), announces the availability
of cooperative agreement funds to assist the National Coalition for Adult Immunization (NCAI) in giving guidance
to and coordinating activities of the NCAI Action Groups. The NCAI consists of private, professional, and volunteer
organizations and public health agencies. The goal of the NCAI is to reduce vaccine-preventable diseases and deaths
among adults in the United States by increasing the awareness of physicians, other health care providers, and the
general public about the need for and the benefits of immunization. The NCAI supports the use of influenza, pneumococcal,
hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella vaccines and tetanus and diphtheria toxoids in adults. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.
This announcement is related to the priority area of Immunization and Infectious Diseases. (For ordering a copy of
Healthy People 2000, see the section 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

.) 



Authority 



This program is authorized under the Public Service Act, Section 317k [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)], as amended. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 



Assistance will only be provided to one of the member groups or professional organizations of the National Coalition
for Adult Immunization. No other applications will be solicited. 

The NCAI is a membership of 72 private, public, and voluntary organizations, whose goal is to improve the immunization
levels in the adult population by the year 2000. Member organizations develop highly visible programs to educate
the public about adult vaccine preventable diseases. 


The NCAI is unique, in that there is collaboration among the Public Health Service, private, professional, and voluntary
organizations with a history of combining resources and sharing information to improve immunization rates in adults.


NCAI member organizations have established and continue to maintain a network of contacts, who contribute to the
development and distribution of information and educational materials and support of activities to improve adult
immunization. Coalition members are more likely to receive support and cooperation from private, public and professional
organizations to achieve its mission than non-coalition members. 

The applicant organization should have an emphasis on research or education on adult health issues, including immunization.
In addition, applicants must have demonstrated relevant leadership experience in building relationships with
national organizations, private and public sector non-profit health care organizations, professional health
associations, volunteer groups, advocacy groups, minority organizations, and government entities. 



The applicant organization must have an established national network of State or local chapters and/or affiliates
which devote a substantial proportion of their activities to adult health issues.

<DOCTITLE>Motor Vehicle Use Restrictions, Garnet Resource Area, Butte District, MT</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Designation of restrictions on motor vehicle travel on certain lands in the Garnet Resource Area.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The use of motor vehicles on public lands in the Garnet Resource Area is hereby restricted in accordance with the authority
and requirements of Executive Orders 11644 and 11989, and regulations contained in 43 CFR Part 8340. The following
described lands under the administration of the Bureau of Land Management are designated as open, limited, or closed
to motorized vehicle use pursuant to the provisions of 43 CFR 8342.1.



Affected by the designation are 146,232 acres, which includes all public lands in the Garnet Resource Area. The lands
are managed under the Garnet Resource Management Plan dated January 10, 1986. They are located in Missoula, Granite,
and Powell counties. 

These designations are revisions to Federal Register notice dated Tuesday, September 23, 1986, Vol. 51, No. 189,
Wednesday, October 29, 1986, Vol. 51, No. 209, and Monday, September 16, 1991, Vol. 56, No. 179. 

These revisions are necessary to more efficiently manage vehicle use on public lands, to implement decisions in the
Garnet Resource Management Plan and to coordinate vehicle travel management with adjoining intermingled private
and public lands. Comments received during public open houses and written responses as part of the Garnet Resource
Management Plan process influenced these designations. This designation order supersedes all other off-road vehicle
travel designations. These designations are published as final, effective immediately, and will remain in effect
until rescinded or modified by the authorized officer. Under 43 CFR 4.21, an appeal may be filed with the Interior Board
of Land Appeals within 30 days of publication in the 

Federal Register.

 



A. Open Designation



No areas have been designated as open.



B. Limited Designation



Areas which are designated limited comprise approximately 85,775 acres. Limited designation was determined appropriate
to protect the resources of the public lands, promote the safety of all users of the public lands, and to minimize conflicts
among various users. The following tables identify the type of restriction on motorized vehicle travel, the specific
area(s) where the restriction occurs, the affected acreage area, and a brief rationale for each affected area. The
specific areas and roads on which motorized vehicles activities are limited are shown on the Garnet Resource Area
Travel Plan Map. Copies of the updated Travel Plan Map will be available at the BLM offices in butte and Missoula about
mid-August 1994.

Motor vehicle travel by wheeled vehicles on all other public land in the Garnet Resource Area not included in the following
tables or designated as closed is limited to existing roads and trails. The acreage on which travel is permissible
year-round but is limited to existing roads and trails totals about 60,457 acres.

 on May 5, 1983 (Vol. 48 No. 88). The authority for this supplementary rule was contained in 43 CFR 8363.1-3(b)
and 8363.3. These regulations were subsequently amended and the authority for the subject supplementary rule was
recodified (see 48 FR 36384, August 10, 1983) and is currently cited as 43 CFR 8365.1-2(a) and 8365.1-6.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 There is no change in either the Eugene District's camping stay limit rule or the authority under which it was promulgated.
The only purpose of this notice is to eliminate confusion resulting from the 1983 re-numbering of the applicable part
of Title 43 CFR cited as authority for the camping stay limit rule.

<DOCTITLE>Santa Cruz In Situ Copper Mining Research Project; Draft Environmental Assessment; Public Meeting </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Mines, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of draft environmental assessment (EA) prepared for the Santa Cruz In Situ Copper Mining Research
Project and notice of public meeting. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with section 102 (2) (C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a draft EA has been prepared
for the Santa Cruz In Situ Copper Mining Research Project and is currently available for public review and comment.
The proposed action is the in situ mining of copper from a copper oxide zone using a pattern of injection and recovery
test wells, and fabrication and operation of a pilot-scale solvent extraction-electrowinning (SX-EW) facility
to remove dissolved copper from solution. The project site is located approximately 7 miles west of the city of Casa
Grande, Arizona. A public meeting to receive comments on the draft EA is scheduled. Individual copies of the draft
EA may be requested directly from the Bureau or viewed at the Casa Grande city library.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In situ copper mining involves the injection of a dilute sulfuric acid solution through a well or wells completed into
an otherwise undisturbed ore zone; selective dissolution of copper as the solution moves through and contacts copper
oxide mineralization located along natural fractures; collection of copper-bearing solution by recovery wells;
removal of the dissolved copper from collected solution using a conventional SX-EW plant located on the surface;
rejuvenation of solution to its original strength; and solution reinjection back into the ore zone to repeat the cycle.
The project well field will consist of one injection test well in the center of a square measuring 127 ft to a side, and
a recovery test well located at each of the four corners of the square. This arrangement is referred to as a ``five-spot''
well pattern. Injection of solution will occur at a rate of about 10 to 50 gal/min. The total area to be occupied by the
various components of the project (including injection and recovery test wells, ground water monitor wells, and
SX-EW facility) is 8 1/2-acres. 



The research project is a cooperative effort of the Bureau of Mines and the Santa Cruz Joint Venture (a joint venture
formed between ASARCO Santa Cruz, Inc., and Freeport Copper Company). The goal of the research project is to determine
the technical, economic, and environmental feasibility of in situ mining of copper oxide minerals. The research
plan calls for in situ mining to continue until sufficient data are collected to evaluate the mining technique. This
time period is presently estimated to require 18 months to complete, but it may extend for up to 4 years. In addition
to an environmental review performed under NEPA, this project is subject to Federal, State, and local environmental
permitting requirements.

Notice of Meetings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Park Service announces a televised ``Town Meeting'' with Roger Kennedy, the Director of the National
Park Service on September 9, 1994 and a public meeting, to be held at the Arch Street Meeting House on September 13 and
14, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The focus of these meetings will be to inform the public as to the progress made to date on the development of alternatives
for the General Management Plan/ Environmental Impact Statement. At the televised ``town meeting'' the topic to
be considered will be the future of Independence Mall, as part of Independence National Historic Park. An 800 number
will be available for viewers to call in questions and comments to be addressed on the air. The program will be rebroadcast
on tape on September 11 from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.



The two public workshops will cover the National Park Service's proposed alternative concepts for the future of the
park. The workshops will present alternative concepts that have been generated to date. These alternatives are based
on information that has been gathered as part of the initial data gathering, and scoping phases of the General Management
Plan effort that began in the fall of 1993.

<DOCTITLE>General Management Plan; Joshua Tree National Monument; Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>


Summary: 

Pursuant to Section 102 (2) (C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190 as amended),
the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS)
assessing the potential impacts of the proposed General Management Plan for Joshua Tree National Monument, which
is in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, California. Once approved, the plan will guide the management of the
monument over the next 15 years. 


The proposed action, 

Alternative A, 

would improve visitor contact facilities and services at each of the three main entrances, with a new visitor center
developed at the west entrance. Interpretive programs and wayside exhibits would be updated and expanded. Facilities
in existing developed areas would be replaced or redesigned to improve aesthetics, efficiency, and resource protection.
Campground capacities would remain basically unchanged, but campsites would be improved through redesign. Picnic
facilities and day use parking would be expanded somewhat, primarily in already-disturbed areas. Resource management
programs would be increased to ensure better resource protection. 
Two alternatives are evaluated in the DEIS. 

Alternative B_No Action 

would continue current management strategies with no changes in visitor and park support facilities and no change
in programs. 

Alternative C_Minimum Requirements 

would provide for the rehabilitation of deteriorated facilities in their current locations. Capacities of camp
areas and day use parking areas would be unchanged, while the number of picnic sites would be slightly increased. The
primary visitor center would remain at the Oasis of Mara. 
The environmental consequences of the proposed action and the alternatives are fully documented, and mitigation
provided as appropriate to minimize impacts. No significant impacts are anticipated as a result of implementing
the proposed action.



Supplementary Information: 

Written comments on the draft General Management Plan (GMP) and DEIS should be directed to the Regional Director,
Western Regional Office, National Park Service, 600 Harrison St., Ste. 600, San Francisco, CA 94107-1372.



Comments on the draft plan must be received by November 7, 1994. 
Two public open house sessions will be held to facilitate public review of the draft plan and DEIS. Park Service officials
will be available at these sessions to explain the alternatives, answer questions, and receive public comments.
The first session will be held September 14, from noon until 8 p.m., at Copper Mountain College, Hi-Desert Campus,
6162 Rotary Way, Joshua Tree, California. The second open house will be held September 15, from noon until 8 p.m., at
the College of the Desert, Regional Business Center, 43500 Monterey Ave., Palm Desert, California. The public is
invited to stop by any time during the open house hours. 
Inquiries on the draft GMP and DEIS and requests for copies of the draft plan should be directed to Joshua Tree National
Monument, 74485 National Monument Drive, Twentynine Palms, CA 92277, or by telephone at (619) 367-7511. Copies
of the draft GMP will be available for public inspection at the monument and at area libraries.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Suspension of investigations and cancellation of hearing. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 19, 1994, the Department of Commerce suspended its antidumping investigations on color negative photographic
paper (CNPP) and certain chemical components from Japan and the Netherlands. The basis for the suspension is an agreement
by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Konica Corp., and Fuji Photo Film B.V., exporters which account for substantially all
of the imports of these products from Japan and the Netherlands, to revise their prices to eliminate completely any
amount by which the foreign market value of their merchandise exceeds the United States price of the subject merchandise.
Accordingly, the United States International Trade Commission gives notice of the suspension of its antidumping
investigations involving imports from Japan and the Netherlands of CNPP and certain chemical components. CNPP is
provided for in subheadings 3703.10.30 and 3703.20.30 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS);
emulsions are provided for in subheadings 3707.10.00 and 3707.90.30 of the HTS; couplers and coupler dispersions
are provided for in HTS subheadings 3707.90.30, 3707.90.60, 2933.19.30, 2933.90.25, and 2934.90.20. The Commission
also gives notice of the cancellation of the hearing scheduled in connection with these investigations for August
23, 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Dismissal of a request to institute a section 751(b) review investigation concerning the Commission's affirmative
determination in investigation No. 731-TA-263 (Final), 

Iron Construction Castings from Canada.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 8, 1994, the Commission determined, pursuant to section 751(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the ``Act'')(19
U.S.C. 1675(b)) and Commission rule 207.45 (19 CFR 207.45), that the subject request does not show changed circumstances
sufficient to warrant institution of an investigation to review the Commission's affirmative determination in
investigation No. 731-TA-263 (Final), regarding iron construction castings from Canada. Iron construction
castings are provided for in subheading 7325.10.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.

Pursuant to section 207.45(b)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 207.45(b)(2)), the
Commission published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 requesting comments as to whether the alleged changed circumstances warranted the institution of a review investigation.
59 FR 29619 (June 8, 1994). Because the alleged changed circumstances related to the U.S. market and were not unique
to Canadian imports, the Commission also sought comment on whether it should self-initiate a review regarding imports
of iron construction castings from Brazil, India, and China. Comments were received both in opposition to and in favor
of the petition. Summarizing the impact of the alleged changed circumstances in a supplemental comment to their petition,
the petitioners estimated that only 18-38 percent of the total U.S. castings market is open to Canadian (and
presumably other) import competition. Petitioners' Comments at 8. The petitioners maintain that with such a substantial
portion of the United States market ``closed'' to Canadian producers, domestic producers are effectively protected
from injury and would continue to be protected if the order for Canada were to be revoked. Id. at 9-10. Counsel
on behalf of the Castings Panel of the Engineering Export Promotion Council of India and the exporters of castings
from India urge the Commission to review not only its determination with respect to Canada but also its determination
with respect to India; however, they offer no arguments for changed circumstances other than those of the petitioners.
Indian Parties' Comments at 2-3. 
In opposition to the petition, comments were filed by counsel on behalf of the U.S. producers of the subject merchandise.
The U.S. producers take issue with the petitioners regarding (1) the size of the market affected by these two Buy America
provisions, claiming that there is no evidence of widespread implementation of these provisions at either the State
or local level and that the share of the market so affected is on the order of 17 percent, rather than 62-82 percent;
and (2) the enforcement of country-of-origin marking requirements, claiming that these were being fully enforced
at least one year prior to 1986, the year Commerce's antidumping-duty order went into effect. U.S. Parties' Comments
at 9-18. The domestic producers argue that section 751(b) and applicable Commission precedent preclude a review
because the changed circumstances alleged by the Canadian producers are premised on inaccurate or incomplete factual
assertions, exaggerated estimates of the effect of Buy America restrictions, and speculation regarding future
action by states and municipalities. Id. at 18-21. 
After consideration of the request and the comments submitted in response to the Commission's 

Federal Register

 notice, the Commission determines that the information of record does not show changed circumstances sufficient
to warrant institution of an investigation to review the Commission's affirmative determination in 

Iron Construction Castings from Canada, 

Inv. No. 731-TA-263 (Final), USITC Pub. 1811 (Feb. 1986) or its determination in 

Iron Construction Castings from Brazil, India, and the People's Republic of China, 

Inv. Nos. 701-TA-249; 731-TA-262, 264-265 (Final), USITC Pub. 1838 (April 1986). 




DECISION OF THE COMMISSION: 

Section 751(b)(1) of the Act grants to the Commission the authority to conduct an investigation to determine whether
to revoke or modify an outstanding antidumping order. The Commission is required to conduct a review of a prior affirmative
injury determination whenever it receives a request for such a review that shows ``changed circumstances sufficient
to warrant a review.'' Congress, however, set forth ``very strict controls'' on the exercise of that authority, demonstrating
that it did not want prior Commission injury determinations ``to remain in a state of flux.'' 

Royal Business Machines, Inc. v. United States, 

507 F. Supp. 1007, 1014 n. 18 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1980), 

aff'd, 

669 F.2d 692 (CCPA 1982). The statutory requirements for instituting Section 751 reviews clearly demonstrate the
intent of Congress that the ``underlying finding of injury . . . is entitled to deference and should
not be disturbed lightly.'' 

Avesta AB v. United States, 

689 F. Supp. 1173, 1180 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1988) (

Avesta I

); 

see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. United States

, 750 F.2d 927, 932 (Fed. Cir. 1984). 
In order for a review investigation to be instituted, the information available to the Commission, after notice and
comment from all interested parties, must be sufficient to persuade the Commission: (1) That there have been significant
changed circumstances from those in existence at the time of the original investigation, (2) that those changed circumstances
are not the natural and direct result of the imposition of the antidumping or countervailing duty order, and (3) that
the changed circumstances indicate that the domestic industry would not be materially injured should the order be
revoked thereby warranting a full investigation. 

See A. Hirsh, Inc. v. United States

, 737 F. Supp. 1186 (CIT 1990)(

aff'd

 914 F.2d 232 (Fed. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 1308 (1991)(

Avesta II

). Once instituted, the petitioner must persuade the Commission, after a full investigation and hearing, that the
domestic industry would not be injured or threatened with injury if the order were revoked. 

See Citizen Watch Co. v. United States

, 733 F. Supp. 383 (CIT 1990).

The CIT has observed that ``Congress carefully limited the availability of  1675(b) investigations'' and
that ``the party seeking review bears the initial burden of showing the existence of changed circumstances sufficient
to warrant a review.'' 

Avesta I, 

689 F. Supp. at 1180, 1181; 

Avesta II, 

724 F. Supp. at 978; 

A. Hirsh, Inc. v. United States, 

729 F. Supp. 1360 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1990) 

(Hirsh I), aff'd following remand, 

737 F. Supp. 1186 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1990) 

(Hirsh II). 

This burden is placed upon the party seeking review because the review investigation does not begin with a clean slate
as though it were an original investigation. 

Matsushita, 

750 F.2d at 932. Although a petition for institution of a review need not ``prove'' that changed circumstances exist
such that injury would not recur upon revocation, it must nevertheless contain 

credible 

evidence which, if uncontroverted by other evidence, would persuade the Commission that a full review is warranted.


Avesta I, 

689 F. Supp. at 1181. 


In determining whether a full review is warranted, the Commission is permitted to weigh the evidence presented to
it. The Commission analyzes the specific facts alleged in the petition and fully evaluates all the evidence submitted
in support of, and in opposition to, the petition. Full reviews will not be instituted based upon mere allegations
in a petition, allegations that are clearly contradicted by evidence submitted by others in response to the Commission's
notice, or allegations that are contradicted or undermined by a petitioner's own data. Thus, the Commission decides
whether to initiate a review, not based solely on the allegations contained in a petition, but also upon a critical
evaluation of the entire record. 

Avesta I, 

689 F. Supp. at 1181. 

In this case, the request alleged three changed circumstances warranting review: (1) Changes in enforcement of country
of origin marking requirements for manhole covers; (2) the extension of Buy America restrictions to procurement
of iron construction castings in airport construction; and (3) the extension of Buy America restrictions to procurement
of iron construction castings in all highway construction that receives federal financing. The information available
on the record does not persuade us that a full investigation is warranted for any of the three allegations. 


The changes in country of origin marking requirements for manhole covers significantly predate the Commission's
original determination. The statutory change occurred in 1984, and there is documented evidence of its enforcement
by Customs prior to 1986. Because those requirements were in effect prior to the Commission's injury determination,
they are not ``changed'' circumstances. The two separate extensions of Buy America restrictions, however, occurred
after the Commission's determination and do constitute ``changed circumstances'' that are not the natural and direct
consequence of the imposition of the order. With respect to the extension of Buy America restrictions to airport construction,
the Canadian industry admits that the change only affects 2 percent of total U.S. consumption. In the context of this
market and the relative shares of the market reflected in the original record, such a marginal impact alone is not a
changed circumstance sufficient to warrant review. 

The third ``changed circumstance'' concerns a 1991 amendment to the Buy America provisions (Section 165(a)) of the
Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. Section 1048 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act of 1991 extended those Buy America restrictions to iron. Amended section 165(a) reads as follows: 




Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Transportation shall not obligate any funds authorized
to be appropriated by the Act * * * unless steel, 

iron, 

cement, and manufactured products used in such project are produced in the United States.

 


23 U.S.C. 101 note (emphasis added). The Canadian producers insist that this amendment has effectively precluded
them from competing with the domestic industry in 60-75 percent of the U.S. market. 



In this case, because ``the vast bulk of construction castings are ultimately purchased and used by utilities, municipalities,
and other such entities for civil construction purposes,'' government contracts comprise a substantial portion
of total sales. 

Iron Construction Castings from Canada, 

USITC Pub. 1811 at A-9. It is not at all clear, however, what percentage of the total market is covered by Buy America
restrictions and how the extension of Buy America restrictions has affected the U.S. market generally, or any segment
of the market in particular. 

The only available objective evidence of the impact of the Buy America restrictions on U.S. sales of Canadian castings_import
trends_suggests that the restrictions have not had a significant impact on such sales. If the extension of Buy America
restrictions had a significant impact on the ability of Canadian producers to compete in the U.S. market, then one
would expect to see a decline in imports from Canada, and from all other sources as well, shortly after the extensions
took effect. Data supplied by the Canadian producers regarding import trends, however, indicate that, after the
extension of the Buy America restrictions, imports did not decline significantly. In 1986, when the order was first
imposed, imports of iron construction castings from Canada reached 21,377 short tons. While imports declined subsequently,
the significant decline in imports predates the extension of Buy America restrictions in 1991. Imports declined
from 18,312 short tons in 1989 to 11,996 short tons in 1990. In 1991, such imports declined slightly to 10,233 short
tons. Although imports dropped further to 8,312 short tons in 1992, data available for the first three quarters of
1993 indicate that imports from Canada already exceeded 1992 full-year levels and were likely to exceed 12,000 short
tons by the end of the year. 

See

 Petition at Appendix 22. Declines in imports followed by larger increases in recent periods do not support the claim
that the 1991 amendments have significantly affected the ability of Canadian producers to compete in the U.S. market.


To support their assertion of the size of the Buy America market, the Canadian producers submitted only a conclusory
and unsubstantiated declaration by a member of the Canadian Foundry Association. No methodology was identified
and no source was cited for the estimates. Further, the Canadian producers acknowledge that their estimates are based
on favorable assumptions regarding future actions by state and local authorities in extending their own Buy America
restrictions to cover iron construction castings. They argue that such actions, while not mandatory, ``are reasonable
to expect.'' We find persuasive the domestic producers' objection that such expectations of future state and local
administrative actions do not constitute changed circumstances. 

See Avesta I, 

689 F. Supp. at 1185 (``A future intention does not show changed circumstances in the present.''). 

Moreover, the Canadian producers did not provide any evidence regarding their shipments to particular U.S. market
segments and the effect of the extension of Buy America restrictions, if any, on shipments to each of those market segments.
In sum, we believe that the Canadian estimates of the Buy America market are overstated. 

Although Buy America restrictions have been expanded as the result of federal legislation, it is not clear how broad
they are and how much of the iron construction casting market is now affected by them. Although the Canadian producers
have arguably raised an issue of fact that may have merit, if true, they have not provided sufficient evidence to persuade
us that the petition shows changed circumstances warranting review. While the petitioner need not prove its case
at the institution stage, the petition, as filed, must contain more than the conclusory allegations submitted in
this case. Because neither probative supporting evidence, an explanation of methodology, nor any concrete indication
of the significance of the extension of Buy America restrictions has been provided, there is insufficient evidence
to warrant a full investigation. Absent such evidence, we determine that it is inappropriate to institute a review.
Accordingly, the request for a review is denied. Finally, in the absence of a review of the Canadian order, a self-initiated
review of the order covering iron construction castings from Brazil, India, and China is inappropriate. 




By order of the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>United States v. S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G.; Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>


Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), that a proposed
Final Judgment, Stipulation, and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois at Rockford in United States v. S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G., Civil
No. 94 C 50249, as to both defendants.
The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by entering into an agreement by which
Bayer licensed S.C. Johnson to use Cyfluthrin in household insecticides in the United States, refrained from licensing
other firms to use Cyfluthrin, and ended its own plans to compete with S.C. Johnson in the sale of household insecticides
in the United States. S.C. Johnson is the country's largest maker of household insecticides with total sales between
45-60% of the market.
The proposed Final Judgment enjoins defendants from entering into any agreement to allocate markets for the sale
of household insecticides, and it requires them to license others, on reasonable terms, to use or sell Cyfluthrin.
The judgment also enjoins defendants from entering into any exclusive license for any active ingredient, if the license
agreement has been disapproved by the United States, and it requires S.C. Johnson to provide the government prior
notice of any such exclusive license with any person other than Bayer.
Household insecticides are chemical products sold in a wide variety of forms (

e.g. 

aerosols, bait traps) for use by consumers to kill ants, roaches, and other insects that infest dwellings. 
Public comment on the proposed Final Judgment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments
and responses thereto will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Gail Kursh, Chief Professions and Intellectual Property
Section, Room 9903, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001
[(telephone: 202) 307-5799)].

United States of America, Plaintiff, v. S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G., Defendants. Civil No. 94C50249.



Complaint



The United States of America, acting under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, brings this
civil action to obtain equitable and other relief against the defendants named herein, and complains and alleges
as follows:



I



Jurisdiction, Venue, And Defendants


1. This complaint is filed under Section 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 4, in order to prevent and restrain violations,
as hereinafter alleged, by defendants of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1.
2. Bayer A.G. (``Bayer''), a German corporation with its principal place of business at 5090 Leverkusen-Bayerwerk,
Germany, is made a defendant. Bayer wholly owns and closely controls Miles, Inc., an Indiana corporation that maintains
an established place of business at 9801 West Higgins Road, Rosemont, Illinois, in the Northern District of Illinois.
Bayer, through its subsidiary, Miles, Inc., is found and transacts business in the Northern District of Illinois.
Venue as to Bayer is proper under 15 U.S.C. 22 and 28 U.S.C. 1391 (c).
3. S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. (``Johnson''), a Wisconsin corporation with its principal place of business at 1525
Howe Street, Racine, Wisconsin, is made a defendant. Johnson is found and transacts business in the Northern District
of Illinois. Venue as to Johnson is proper under 15 U.S.C. 22 and 28 U.S.C. 1391 (c).



II


Trade And Commerce


4. Defendant Bayer and its subsidiaries receive large amounts of money in the form of payments from manufacturers
for the sale of active ingredients for use in household insecticides in the United States, and defendant Johnson and
its subsidiaries receive large amounts of money from the sale of household insecticides to retailers and consumers
throughout the United States. Defendants' business activities and operations, as hereinafter described, involve
or affect the interstate and international flow of funds and are within the flow of, and have a substantial effect upon,
interstate and foreign commerce.



III



Background


5. Household insecticides are chemical products that are sold in a wide variety of forms (

e.g.

, aerosols, baits, powders, and traps) for use by consumers to trap or kill ants, roaches, crickets, and other undesirable
insects that invade and infest houses, apartments and other dwellings. Because of their low cost, superior efficacy,
and ease of use, there are no good substitutes for household insecticides, and thus they constitute a relevant product
market.
6. The relevant geographic market for the sale of household insecticides is the United States. Annual retail sales
of household insecticides in the United States exceeded $450 million in 1993.
7. The United States market for household insecticides is highly concentrated. Johnson is the largest manufacturer
of household insecticides in the United States, with total sales between 45-60% of the market. Johnson's two
next-largest competitors in the sale of household insecticides each have sales of no more than 12% of the market, and
the shares of Johnson's three other major competitors range from 6 to 10% of the market.
8. Successful new entry into or expansion within the United States market for household insecticides is difficult.
To be successful, a new entrant must demonstrate that its household insecticide has superior safety and efficacy,
attributes that are solely dependent upon the active ingredient chosen for use in the product. Active ingredients
must comply with state and federal government regulations for safety and efficacy prior to sale in the United States.
Compliance with such laws and regulations is an expensive and time-consuming process that often takes more than three
years and costs over $10 million to complete.

<PARENT> FR940825-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

9. Bayer is one of a small number of firms in the world that engage in research and development of active ingredients
for household insecticides. Bayer has numerous patents in countries around the world, including United States patents,
on such active ingredients. Bayer makes and sells, or licenses others to make and sell, such active ingredients in
various countries, including the United States.
10. Bayer, which makes and sells household insecticides in many countries outside the United States, is one of the
few significant potential entrants into the United States household insecticides market. Bayer earlier had planned
and made preparations to enter the United States household insecticides market with a new product, called Laser.
Laser's chief active ingredient was Cyfluthrin, developed and patented by Bayer and widely considered to be superior
to other active ingredients because of its long-lasting killing power. Through Laser, Bayer could have become one
of Johnson's major competitors in the household insecticides market in the United States.


IV


Violation Alleged


11. Beginning at least as early as March 1988 and continuing to the present, Johnson and Bayer entered into an agreement
to unreasonably restrain trade and commerce and lessen competition in the manufacture and sale of household insecticides
in the United States in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1.
12. For the purpose of forming and effectuating this agreement, defendants did the following things, among others:
(a) Bayer licensed Johnson to use Clyfluthrin in household insecticides in the United States, and granted Johnson
a right of first refusal for exclusive rights for the United States on future active ingredients developed by Bayer
for household insecticides;
(b) Bayer refrained from licensing Johnson's competitors to use or sell Cyfluthrin; and
(c) Bayer ended its plans to market Laser and compete with Johnson in the United States household insecticides market.


V


Competitve Effects


13. Defendants agreement and activities have had the following direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable
effects, among others:
(a) Incentives for Bayer to compete with Johnson in the manufacture and sale of household insecticides in the United
States have been substantially reduced; and
(b) Competition generally in the market for the sale of household insecticides in the United States has been unnecessarily
and unreasonably restrained.


VI


Prayer For Relief


Wherefore, plaintiff prays:
1. That Johnson and Bayer be enjoined and restrained from entering into any agreement or understanding the purpose
or effect of which is to allocate or divide territories or markets for the sale of household insecticides;
2. That Johnson and Bayer be enjoined from entering into any exclusive license for an active ingredient patented by
Bayer without plaintiff's prior approval;
3. That Johnson and Bayer be enjoined from entering into or carrying out an exclusive license to make, use or sell Cyfluthrin
in the United States without plaintiff's prior approval;
4. That Johnson be enjoined and restrained from obtaining from anyone an exclusive license for any active ingredient
for use in any household insecticide without prior notice (and if necessary, provision of additional information
regarding the arrangement) to plaintiff;
5. That plaintiff have such other relief as may be just and proper; and
6. That plaintiff be awarded its costs in this action.

United States of America, Plaintiff, v. S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G., Defendants. Civil No. 94C50249.


Final Judgment


Plaintiff, the United States of America, having filed its Complaint on August 4, 1994, and plaintiff and defendants,
S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G., by their respective attorneys, having consented to the entry of this Final
Judgment without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and without this Final Judgment constituting evidence
against or admission by any party with respect to any issue of fact or law; 
Now, therefore, before the taking of any testimony and without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or law, it
is hereby Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed:


I


Jurisdiction


This Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and each of the parties to this action. The Complaint states a claim
upon which relief may be granted against S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G. under Section 1 of the Sherman Act,
as amended, 15 U.S.C.  1.


II


Definitions


As used in this Final Judgment:
(A) ``Active ingredient'' means any chemical compound or substance used or contemplated for use in the United States
as a knock-down, debilitating, or killing agent in a household insecticide, regardless of whether that compound
or substance has been approved by federal or state regulatory authorities.
(B) ``Exclusive license'' means any agreement for the license or supply of an active ingredient that directly or indirectly,
implicitly or explicitly, limits access to S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. or to S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and the licensor.


III


Applicability


This Final Judgment applies to S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc.'s and to Bayer A.G.'s officers, directors, subsidiaries,
agents, employees, successors, and assigns, and to all other persons in active concert of participation with any
of them who receive actual notice of this Final Judgment pursuant to F.R.C.P. 65(d).


IV


Injunctive Relief


(A) S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G. are each enjoined and restrained from entering into or carrying out
any agreement or understanding, the purpose or effect of which would be to allocate or divide territories or markets
for the distribution or sale of household insecticides, unless any such agreement or understanding relates exclusively
to markets other than the United States and has no effect on United States commerce.
(B) S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G. are each enjoined and restrained from entering into any exclusive license
between them for any active ingredient, the patent rights to which are beneficially owned by Bayer A.G., if such license
has been disapproved by the U.S. Department of Justice as provided herein.
S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G. each must provide the U.S. Department of Justice at least 90 days' written
notice of their intent to enter into any exclusive license between them. If requested by the Department of Justice
within 30 days after its receipt of such notice, S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G. must supply, within 30 days
of such request, all information in their possession reasonably necessary to enable the Department to determine
the competitive effect of their exclusive license. The Department must exercise its unconditional right to disapprove
an exclusive license between S.C. Johnson & Co., Inc. and Bayer A.G. by so notifying them in writing within 90 days
after receiving defendants' notice of intent.
(C) S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G. are each enjoined and restrained from entering into, carrying out,
or operating under any exclusive license to make, use or sell Cyfluthring in the United States. Bayer A.G. must offer,
to any person who requests it, a license to use or sell Cyfluthrin in the United States, upon reasonable and mutually
agreeable terms and conditions, but no minimum royalty payment shall be required under such license. Nothing herein,
however, shall prohibit Bayer A.G. from reserving exclusively for itself Cyfluthrin or any other active ingredient,
or from discontinuing the manufacture, sale or use in the United States of Cyfluthrin or any other active ingredient.
(D) No more than 180 days and not less than 90 days before entering into any exclusive license with any person other than
Bayer A.G., for any active ingredient other than Cyfluthrin, S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. must provide the U.S. Department
of Justice written notice of such license agreement. If requested by the Department of Justice within 30 days after
its receipt of such notice, S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. must supply within 30 days after such request, all information
in its possession reasonably necessary to determine the competitive effect of such license agreement.

on August 4, 1994, alleging that defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, by entering into
an agreement and understanding that unreasonably restrained interstate trade in the manufacture and sale of household
insecticides. The agreement featured an exclusive license arrangement and the transfer by Bayer to Johnson of the
assets assembled by a Bayer subsidiary, Miles,Inc., to compete in the sale of household insecticides in the United
States with a new product, called Laser. Laser's chief active ingredient was Cyfluthrin, which Bayer developed and
patented. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that defendants engaged in the following activities:

(a) Bayer licensed Johnson to use Clyfluthrin in household insecticides in the United States, and granted Johnson
a right of first refusal for exclusive rights for the United States on future active ingredients developed by Bayer
for household insecticides;

(b) Bayer refrained from licensing Johnson's competitors to use or sell Cyflutrhin; and

(c) Bayer ended its plans to market Laser and compete with Johnson in the United States household insecticides market.




The Complaint alleges that the appropriate product market in which to access the competitive effect of the Cyfluthrin
license and transfer of assets is the market for the manufacture and sale of household insecticides. This is the appropriate
market because other types of insect killers, such as agricultural pesticides, are not good substitutes for household
insecticides used to kill ants, roaches, and other insects that typically infest dwellings. The Complaint alleges
that the entire United States is the relevant geographic market. In this market, the Complaint alleges, Johnson is
the largest firm, and the licensing arrangement helped it to maintain its commanding position.

The Judgment enjoins Johnson and Bayer from entering into any agreement to allocate territories or markets for the
distribution or sale of household insecticides, unless such an agreement relates exclusively to markets other than
the United States and has no effect on United States commerce, and requires that Bayer license Cyfluthrin to any person
on reasonable terms and conditions.
 Further, the Final Judgment provides the Department with the opportunity to review any future exclusive licenses
for new active ingredients that Johnson might seek to obtain from Bayer or any other person.






The Judgment requires the defendants to file annual reports with the Government that certify that each has distributed
the Final Judgment to responsible executives and explained the terms of the Judgment to them. Entry of the Final Judgment
will terminate the Government's action against the defendants,
 except that the Court will retain jurisdiction over the matter for further proceedings that may be required to interpret,
enforce or modify the Judgment, or to punish violations of any of its provisions.




II



Description of the Activities Involved in the Alleged Violations



During a three-year period between 1985 and March 1988, Miles, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Bayer, developed a new line
of household insecticides to be marketed under the brand name ``Laser.'' The Laser products were to have contained
a potent new active ingredient, Cyfluthrin, a chemical compound developed and patented by Bayer. Cyfluthrin promised
to provide Laser a significant competitive advantage over existing U.S. household insecticides because it extended
the insecticide's killing power up to three months after initial application.
By early 1988, Miles had substantially completed its preparations to enter the U.S. household insecticides market.
Evidence indicates that its entry would have been successful. According to Miles' projections, first-year sales
of Laser products would have made Miles one of the nation's leading makers of household insecticides.
In March 1988, however, Bayer canceled the Laser project. It instead agreed to sell Miles' Laser-related product
research and packaging design to Johnson, and to license Johnson to use Cyfluthrin in its household insecticide products.






Under the terms of that ten-year license agreement, Johnson agreed to pay Bayer a minimum of $5.2 million annually
in addition to a specified per pound fee for the use of Cyfluthrin. In addition, Johnson acquired a right of first refusal
to any other active ingredient Bayer later developed.

Through this agreement, the United States alleges, Bayer effectively chose not to compete in the U.S. household insecticides
market, instead, licensing to Johnson the right to use those assets Bayer had assembled and would require to compete
in the United States.


The agreement helped ensure Johnson's continued dominance of the highly concentrated U.S. household insecticides
market. Johnson is the leading maker of household insecticides with somewhere between 45-60 percent of total
market sales. It is significantly larger than any of its six major competitors, whose market shares range from 6 to
12 percent of overall sales. By purchasing some of the assets Bayer would have used in entering the market, and entering
into what was in effect an exclusive license for Cyfluthrin, Johnson effectively eliminated competition that could
have helped drive down prices or improve the quality of household insecticides. Because new entry or expansion in
this market is difficult in light of the high cost and significant time it takes to comply with federal and state governmental
regulations, new entry into or expansion within this market is unlikely to militate against the anti-competitive
effects of the defendants' agreement.


III


Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment



The United States, Johnson and Bayer have stipulated that the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgment at any time
after compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(b)-(h). The Judgment provides
that its entry does not constitute any evidence or admission by any party with respect to any issue of fact or law.

Under the provisions of Section 2(e) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(e), the Judgment
may not be entered unless the Court finds entry is in the public interest. Section XI of the proposed Final Judgment
set forth such a finding.


A. Terms


The Judgment provides that:
(1) Johnson and Bayer are each enjoined and restrained from entering into any agreement or understanding, the purpose
or effect of which would be to allocate or divide, territories or markets for the distribution or sale of household
insecticides, unless any such agreement or understanding relates exclusively to markets other than the United States
and has no effect on United States commerce.

<DOCNO> FR940825-2-00113 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940825-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Johnson and Bayer are each enjoined and restrained from entering into any exclusive license between them for any
active ingredient, the patent rights to which are beneficially owned by Bayer, that the U.S. Department of Justice
disapproves in writing. To ensure the Department of Justice has adequate notice of such agreements, Johnson and Bayer
each must provide the Department at least 90 days' written notice of their intent to enter into such an exclusive license
agreements, and if requested by the Department of Justice within 30 days after its receipt of such notice, Johnson
and Bayer must supply within 30 days of such request, all information in their possession reasonably necessary to
enable the Department of Justice to determine the competitive effect of such license agreement.
(3) Johnson and Bayer are each enjoined and restrained from entering into, carrying out, or operating under any exclusive
license to make, use or sell Cyfluthrin in the United States. Bayer must offer to any person who requests, a license
to use or sell Cyfluthrin in the United States, upon reasonable and mutually agreeable terms and conditions, but no
minimum royalty payment shall be required under such license; and
(4) No more than 180 days nor less than 90 days before entering into any exclusive license with any person other than
Bayer, for any active ingredient other than Cyfluthrin, Johnson must provide the Department of Justice written notice
of such license and, if requested by the Department of Justice within 30 days after its receipt of such notice, Johnson
must supply within 30 days after such request, all information in its possession reasonably necessary to determine
the competitive effect of such license agreement.


B. Effect on Competition


The proposed Final Judgment will ensure that Johnson's competitors will have access to Cyfluthrin and thus likely
promote competition in the household insecticide market. Nonexclusive licenses will be made available to Johnson's
competitors on reasonable terms and conditions that are at least as favorable as the terms and conditions Bayer accorded
Johnson, except that there will be no minimum royalty payments under such licenses. In addition, by prohibiting any
market allocation agreements between the defendants, the Final Judgment ensures that the defendants will not be
able to restrict potential competition in the U.S. household insecticides market.
In addition, the proposed Final Judgment ensures that any exclusive or co-exclusive license agreement between Johnson,
which is dominant in the household insecticides market, and Bayer for new active ingredients will not restrict competition
in the household insecticides market. The proposed relief also ensures that the United States receives prior notice
of any exclusive or co-exclusive license agreement between Johnson and any active ingredient manufacturer other
than Bayer, and thus an opportunity to challenge any such agreement that the United States believes may substantially
lessen competition in the household insecticides market. At the same time, Department of Justice review of any exclusive
or co-exclusive license agreement for active ingredients contemplated by Johnson should not unreasonably restrict
Johnson's ability to obtain the necessary active ingredients to formulate its household insecticide products and
remain competitive in the household insecticides market.


IV


Remedies Available To Private Litigants


Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct
prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well
as costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing
of such actions. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(a), the Judgment has no
prima facie 

effect in any subsequent lawsuits that may be brought against Johnson and Bayer in this matter.


V


Procedures Available For Modification Of The Proposed Final Judgment


As provided by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, any person believing that the proposed Final Judgment
should be modified may submit written comments to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section,
U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW., Room 9903, Washington, DC 20001, within the
60-day period set forth in the Act. These comments, and the Department's responses, will be filed with the Court and
published in the 

Federal Register

. All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free, pursuant to a stipulation
signed by the United States and Bayer and Johnson, to withdraw its consent to the Judgment at any time prior to entry.
Section IX of the Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over this action, and the parties may apply
to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for modification, interpretation, or enforcement of the Judgment.


VI


Determinative Materials/Documents


Materials or documents of the type described in Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.
 16(b), were considered in formulating the proposed Final Judgment.


VII


Alternative To The Proposed Final Judgment


The alternative to the proposed Judgment is a full trial on the merits. While the Department is confident of its ability
to succeed in such a trial, the litigation involves difficult issues of law and fact. A favorable outcome is not a certainty.
The Final Judgment agreed to by the parties provides all the relief that the United States sought in its complaint.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Determinations Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional
Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA-W) issued
during the period of August, 1994.

In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of Section 222 of the Act must be met.

(1) that a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
have become totally or partially separated, 

(2) that sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and

(3) that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm or appropriate
subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales
or production.



Negative Determinations for Worker Adjustment Assistance



In each of the following cases the investigation revealed that criterion (3) has not been met. A survey of customers
indicated that increased imports did not contribute importantly to worker separations at the firm.




TA-W-30,037; Elf Atochem North American, Inc., Industrial Chemical Div., Tacoma, WA

TA-W-29,730; Hughes Aircraft Radar Systems Group, Los Angeles, CA

TA-W-29,921; Douglas & Lomason Co., Phenix City, AL

TA-W-29,830; Isoloc Manufacturing Co., Vancouver, WA

TA-W-29,942; Fuelco, Denver, CO

TA-W-29,867; Struthers-Dunn, Inc., Pitman, NJ

TA-W-29,632; Weldotron Corp., Piscataway, NJ




In the following cases, the investigation revealed that the criteria for eligibility have not been met for the reasons
specified.




TA-W-30,118; H & W Service Co., Crane, TX




The workers' firm does not produce an article as required for certification under Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.




TA-W-29,685; Frigidaire Co., Athens Range Products, Athens, TN




Increased imports did not contribute importantly to worker separations at the firm.




TA-W-30,051; Ford New Holland, Dallas, TX




The workers' firm does not produce an article as required for certification under Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.




TA-W-29,985; Farah Manufacturing Co., El Paso, TX




The investigation revealed that criterion (2) has not been met. Sales or production did not decline during the relevant
period as required for certification.




TA-W-30,005; Ford New Holland, Troy, MI




The workers' firm does not produce an article as required for certification under Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.




TA-W-30,061; Philips Lighting Co., Washington, PA




The workers' firm does not produce an article as required for certification under Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.




TA-W-29,872; Baxter Healthcare Corp., Bently Div., Irvine, CA




The investigation revealed that criterion (2) has not been met. Sales or production did not decline during the relevant
period as required for certification.




TA-W-29,970; New York Life Insurance Co., New York, NY




The workers' firm does not produce an article as required for certification under Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.




TA-W-29,768; Normandy Manufacturing Co., Inc., Paducah, KY




Predominate reason for the subject firm's closure in March 1994 was a decline in its sales staff in the first quarter
of 1994. Fewer salesmen in 1994 led to a decline in sales at the subject firm in the first quarter of 1994 compared to the
same period in 1993.




TA-W-29,743 & TA-W-29,832; IBM Corp., Poughkeepsie, NY & Kingston, NY




The workers' firm does not produce an article as required for certification under Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.




TA-W-30,111; Southland Corp., Willow Grove, PA




The workers' firm does not produce an article as required for certification under Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.




TA-W-29,774; Airfoil Forging Textron, Euclid, OH




The investigation revealed that criterion (2) and criterion (3) have not been met. Sales or production did not decline
during the relevant period as required for certification. Increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive
with articles produced by the firm or appropriate subdivision have not contributed importantly to the separations
or threat thereof, and the absolute decline in sales or production.

of IBM Corp, East Fishkill Facility, Hopewell, NY engaged in the production of thermal conduction modules and component
parts other than chips are denied.

Also, pursuant to Title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (P.L. 103-182) concerning
transitional adjustment assistance hereinafter called (NAFTA-TAA) and in accordance with Section 250(a)
Subchapter D, Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act as amended, the Department of Labor presents summaries of determinations
regarding eligibility to apply for NAFTA-TAA issued during the month of August 1994.

In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for NAFTA-TAA
the following group eligibility requirements of Section 250 of the Trade Act must be met:

(1) that a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
(including workers in any agricultural firm or appropriate subdivision thereof) have become totally or partially
separated from employment and either_


(A) that sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely,
(B) that imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm
or subdivision have increased.


(c) that the increase in imports contributed importantly to such workers' separations or threat of separation and
to the decline in sales or production of such firm or subdivision; or

(2) that there has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like
or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision.



Negative Determinations NAFTA-TAA



NAFTA-TAA-000164; Lipe-Rollway Corp., Rollway Bearing Div., Liverpool, NY






The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met. U.S. imports of cylindrical roller bearings
from Canada and Mexico declined in the twelve month period of May 1993 through April 1994 compared to the same period
one year earlier. A survey of major customers revealed that customers did not import roller bearings from Canada or
Mexico in 1992, 1993 or during January-June 1994.





NAFTA-TAA-00166; Lockheed Fort Worth Co., Fort Worth, TX





The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met. There was no shift in production workers'
firm to Mexico or Canada. Production of electrical harnesses was shifted to Mexico prior to December 8, 1993, the earliest
date for coverage of worker separations under NAFTA-TAA.






NAFTA-TAA-00173; Chock Full O'Nuts, Greenwich Mills Div., Mebane, NC




The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met. A survey of major customers of the subject
plant revealed that customers did not import fruit drinks or iced tea mix from Mexico or Canada.






NAFTA-TAA-00116; Fisher-Price, Inc., Brownsville, TX (Matamoros, MX)





The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met. Worker separations at the subject plant
are a result of a company decision to move production from Matamoros to other locations in Mexico and to the Orient.
A shift in production from one location in Mexico to another location in that country cannot be used as a basis for certification
under the terms of Title V of the North American Free Trade Implementation Act.






NAFTA-TAA-00171; Coltec Industries, Inc., Burbank, CA





The investigation revealed that the workers of the subject firm did not produce an article within the meaning of the
Act. The Department of Labor has consistently determined that the performance of services did not constitute production
of an article as required by the Trade Act of 1974.






NAFTA-TAA-00172; American Cyanamid Co., Pearl River, NC





The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met. 
Although American Cyanamid is currently seeking the approval necessary to shift production of dyclomycin to Mexico,
no shift has yet occurred. In addition, no worker separations attributable to the possible transfer have yet taken
place.



Affirmative Determinations NAFTA-TAA



NAFTA-TAA-00163; Sola Optical USA, Inc., Colonial Heights, VA





A certification was issued covering all workers of the Colonial Heights, VA plant of Sola Optical USA, Inc., separated
on or after December 8, 1993.





NAFTA-TAA-00165; Dana Corp., Pueblo, CO





A certification was issued covering all workers of Dana Corp., Pueblo, CO separated on or after December 8, 1993.







NAFTA-TAA-00167; Sara Lee Knit Products, Midway, GA





A certification was issued covering all workers of the Midway, GA plant of Sara Lee Knit Products separated on or after
December 8, 1993.







NAFTA-TAA-00170; GenCorp. Reinforced Plastics Div., Ionia, MI





A certification was issued covering all workers engaged in employment related to the production of reinforced fiberglass
grill openly panels for the Buick Century and the Oldsmobile Ciera lines at the Ionia, MI plant of the Reinforced Plastics
Div., GenCorp separated on or after December 8, 1993.






NAFTA-TAA-00169; Parker Hannifin Corp., Berea, KY





A certification was issued covering all workers of Parker Hannifin Corp., Berea, KY separated on or after December
8, 1993. 





I hereby certify that the aforementioned determinations were issued during the month of August, 1994. Copies of these
determinations are available for inspection in Room C-4318, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210 during normal business hours or will be mailed to persons who write to the above address.

<USBUREAU>Mine Safety and Health Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Petitions for Modification </DOCTITLE>



The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section
101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 



1. Genwal Coal Company (Amendment) 



[Docket No. M-94-116-C] 



Genwal Coal Company, P.O. Box 1420, Huntington, Utah 84528 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR
75.350 (air courses and belt haulage entries) to its Crandall Canyon Mine (I.D. No. 42-01715) located in Emery
County, Utah. The petitioner proposes to use belt air to ventilate the face area; to install a low-level carbon monoxide
detection system that would provide both visual and audible alarm signals as an early warning device in belt entries
used as intake air courses; and to provide two separate and distinct intake air escapeways to the miners working in
the development sections. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the
same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



2. Three Way Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-94-117-C] 



Three Way Coal Company, P.O. Box 17, Brachdale, Pennsylvania 17923 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1400 (hoisting equipment; general) to its Little Vein Slope (I.D. No. 36-08332) located in Schuylkill
County, Pennsylvania. Because of the steep, frequently changing pitch and numerous curves and knuckles in the main
haulage slope, the petitioner proposes to use the gunboat without safety catches in transporting persons. As an alternative,
when using the gunboat to transport persons, the petitioner proposes to use an increased rope strength safety factor
and secondary safety connections which are securely fastened around the gunboat and to the hoisting rope above the
main connecting device. 
 


3. Red Oak Mining Company 



[Docket No. M-94-118-C] 



Red Oak Mining Company, P.O. Box 210, Westover, Pennsylvania 16692 has filed to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1103-4(a)(3)
(automatic fire sensor and warning device systems) to its South Mine (I.D. No. 36-07810) located in Cambria
County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system as an early
warning fire detection system in all belt entries where a monitoring system identifies a sensor location instead
of having a detection system in each belt flight. The petitioner states that the carbon monoxide monitoring system
would be capable of providing both a visual and audible alarm signal that would be activated when the carbon monoxide
level at any sensor reaches 10 ppm above the ambient level of the mine, and that all miners would be withdrawn to a safe
location unless the cause for the alarm is determined not be hazardous to the miners. The petitioner asserts that the
proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.




4. Red Oak Mining Company 



[Docket No. M-94-119-C] 



Red Oak Mining Company, P.O. Box 210, Westover, Pennsylvania 16692 has filed to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.350
(air courses and belt haulage entries) to its South Mine (I.D. No. 36-07810) located in Cambria County, Pennsylvania.
The petitioner proposes to install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system as an early warning fire detection
system in conveyor belt entries used as intake air courses that would provide both visual and audible alarm signals
when the carbon monoxide level at any sensor is 10 ppm above the ambient level for the mine, when an audible alarm signal
is different from the alert signal, and when the carbon monoxide level reaches 15 ppm above the ambient level for the
mine. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection
as would the mandatory standard.

5. Somerset Mining Company 



[Docket No. M-94-120-C] 



Somerset Mining Company, P.O. Box 535, Somerset, Colorado 81434 has filed a petition to modify the application of
30 CFR 75.350 (air courses and belt haulage entries) to its Sanborn Creek Mine (I.D. No. 05-04452) located in
Gunnison County, Colorado. The petitioner proposes to use belt air to ventilate active working places in order to
enhance the operator's ability to ventilate remote sections of the mine. The petitioner states that application
of the standard would result in a diminution of safety to the miners. In addition, the petitioner asserts that the proposed
alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



6. Arclar Company 



[Docket No. M-94-121-C] 



Arclar Company, 29 West Raymond, P.O. Box 444, Harrisburg, Illinois 62946 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.360(b)(6) (preshift examination) to its Big Ridge Mine (I.D. No. 11-02879) located in Saline County,
Illinois. The petitioner proposes to conduct preshift examinations of the intake air at specified locations to determine
the quality and quantity of the air reporting to the operating unit and to examine the neck areas for any changes in roof
conditions on a weekly basis. The petitioner states that a six month history of preshift examinations have shown no
quantity of methane or oxygen deficiency. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide
at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



7. Freeman United Coal Mining Company 



[Docket No. M-94-122-C] 



Freeman United Coal Mining Company, P.O. Box 100, West Frankfort, Illinois 62896-0100 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1002 (location of trolley wires, trolley feeder wires, high-voltage cables
and transformers) to its Orient No. 6 Mine (I.D. No. 11-00599) located in Jefferson County, Illinois. The petitioner
proposes to use 2400 volt cables to power longwall equipment inby the last open crosscut and within 150 feet of pillar
workings (gob) areas. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure
of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



8. B&M Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-94-123-C] 



B&M Coal Company, Box 37, Dilliner, Pennsylvania 15327 has filed an amended petition for its B&M No. 2 Mine
(I.D. No. 36-06126) located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner requests that previous petition,
docket number M-91-102-C, for 30 CFR 75.362 be amended. The petitioner requests that Item No. 15
of the previous petition be amended to include language requiring intake escapeways to be maintained in accordance
with new mandatory standard 30 CFR 75.380 (f)(1) (Ventilation Final Rule of November 15, 1992). The petitioner asserts
that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.




9. Kennecott Utah Copper 



[Docket No. M-94-36-M] 



Kennecott Utah Copper, 8362 West 10200 South, P.O. Box 525, Bingham Canyon, Utah 84006-0525 has filed an amended
petition to its previous petition 30 CFR 56.9022, docket number M-86-20-M for its Concentrator
North (I.D. No. 42-00717) located in Salt Lake County, Utah. The petitioner requests that the previous petition
be amended to reflect the new mandatory standard 30 CFR 56.9300 (d)(1) and (d)(3). The petitioner proposes to post
warning signs that impoundment roadway is not bermed and caution must be used at each access point from the outer roadway
because of the structure of the tailings impoundment; to post signs that limit speed at 15 MPH; to limit access to the
impoundment roadway to only authorized personnel required to be in the area for inspecting and/or maintaining the
pipeline in the area, in the tailings, and/or the roadway. In addition, the petitioner proposes to install a 24-inch
diameter pipeline on the inside edge of the impoundment roadway that serves as a continuous delineator to vehicle
drivers; to limit traffic on the roadway to one-way traffic; to limit access to personnel required to have access to
conduct inspections or perform maintenance; to provide training to all authorized personnel concerning special
hazard recognition; and to issue a special license, that would be updated every four years, to authorized drivers
in the area. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least same measure of protection
as would the mandatory standard. 



10. Rock of Ages Corporation, and Swenson Granite Company, Inc. (Subsidiary of Rock of Ages) 



[Docket No. M-94-37-M] 



Rock of Ages Corporation, P.O. Box 482, Barre, Vermont 05641 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR
56.19003 to its Rock of Ages Lite Side (I.D. No. 43-00024); its Rock of Ages Dark Side (I.D. No. 43-00023);
and its Wells Lamson (I.D. No. 43-00063) all located in Washington County, Vermont, and its Gray Quarry (I.D.
No. 27-00083) located in Merrimack County, New Hampshire. The petitioner requests relief from the mandatory
standard as it applies to chain drives between the driving mechanism and the gear train of the hoists, allowing the
use of chain drives for such application. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide
at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

<DOCTITLE>Duke Power Company; Withdrawal of Application for Amendment to Facility Operating License </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Duke Power Company (the licensee)
to withdraw its May 13, 1993, application for proposed amendments to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-9
and NPF-17 for the McGuire Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. 

The proposed amendments would have reduced the maximum allowable power range neutron flux high setpoints with inoperable
steam line safety valves during four-loop operation.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Approval and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval
of Amendment No. 6 to a Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Equity Linked Term Notes


August 18, 1994.


On December 29, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change relating to Equity Linked Term Notes (``ELNs''). Notice of the proposal and Amendment No. 1
 appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on January 26, 1994.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule
change on January 31, 1994, Amendment No. 3 on March 9, 1944, Amendment No. 4 on April 28, 1994, Amendment No. 5 on June
27, 1994, and Amendment No. 6 on July 18, 1994.
 This order approved the Exchange's proposal, as amended.
 








The Amex proposes to amend Section 107B of the Guide with respect to the listing criteria for ELNs.
 ELNs are intermediate term (two to seven years), non-convertible, hybrid securities, the value of which is linked
to the performance of a highly capitalized, actively traded common stock. ELNs may provide for periodic interest
payments to holders based on fixed or floating rates, or they may be structured as ``zero coupon'' instruments with
no payments to holders prior to maturity.
 ELNs may be subject to a ``cap'' on the maximum principal amount to be repaid to holders upon maturity, and they may feature
a ``floor'' on the minimum principal amount paid to holders upon maturity.





In addition to the general listing criteria contained in Section 107A of the Guide,
 ELNs must also conform to the special listing criteria of Section 107B of the Guide which provide that: (1) Each issuer
must have a tangible net worth of at least $150 million; (2) the total original issue price of the particular issue of
ELNs combined with all of the issuer's other ELNs listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ'') may not be greater than 25% of the
issuer's tangible net worth at the time of issuance; (3) each underlying linked stock must have either (i) a market
capitalization of at least $3 billion and a trading volume in the 12-month period preceding listing (in all markets
in which the underlying security is traded) of at least 2.5 million shares, or (ii) a market capitalization of at least
$1.5 billion and a trading volume in the 12-month period preceding listing (in all markets in which the underlying
security is traded) of at least 20 million shares; (4) the issuer of the underlying linked stock must be a U.S. reporting
company under the Act; (5) the issuance of ELNs relating to an underlying linked stock may not exceed 5% of the total
outstanding shares of such stock; (6) the linked security must either be listed on a national securities exchange
or traded through NASDAQ; and (7) the linked security must be subject to last sale reporting.

The Exchange is now proposing to amend Section 107B in order to provide for the listing and trading of ELNs linked to
a security, including a sponsored ADR,
 that is traded in the U.S. markets and is issued by a non-U.S. company
 that is subject to reporting requirements under the Act. Except for the requirement that the issuer of the underlying
linked security must be a U.S. company, the listing requirements for ELNs linked to a security issued by a non-U.S.
company will be the same as those set forth above with the following enhancements:
 (1) Section 107B of the Guide is being amended to clarify that the trading volume requirement refers to U.S. trading
volume;
 (2) the term of such ELNs shall be limited to between two and three years; (3) either (i) the Exchange must have in place
a comprehensive market information sharing agreement
 with the primary exchange on which the underlying security is primarily traded (in the case of ADRs, with the primary
exchange where the security underlying the ADR is traded), or (ii) at least 50% of the market for the underlying security
and all related securities
 for the six months prior to issuance must occur in the U.S. market;
 (4) if linked to an ADR, the ADR must be sponsored; (5) there must be a minimum of 2,000 holders of the linked security;
(6) the ELNs issuance may not exceed (i) 2% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least
30% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market,
(ii) 3% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume
for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred In the U.S. market, or (iii) 5% of the total shares of the
underlying security outstanding provided at least 70% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months
prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market; and (7) no ELN may be listed if the U.S. market for the underlying security
accounted for less than 30% of the worldwide trading volume for the security and related securities during the prior
six months.

The proposal defines the U.S. market
 as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'')
 and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').
 






The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will benefit investors by expanding the number of securities
that may be linked to ELNs, thereby providing investors with enhanced investment flexibility. The Exchange further
believes that it is appropriate to now include within the existing regulatory framework for ELNs, securities that
are traded in the U.S. and that are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to reporting requirements under the Act because
of the significant level of U.S. investor interest in both U.S. and non-U.S. highly capitalized and actively traded
reporting companies. Because an ELN and the underlying security traded in the U.S. to which it will be linked will continue
to be subject to the criteria presently contained in Sections 107A and 107B of the Guide, as enhanced herein, and the
Exchange will have in place either a comprehensive market information sharing agreement with the primary exchange
where the underlying security trades (in the case of an ADR, with the primary exchange in the country where the security
underlying the ADR primarily trades) or the linked security will meet the proposed trading volume criteria where
no such agreement exists, the Exchange believes that it will have the ability to inquire into potential trading problems
or irregularities with respect to any particular ELN and the underlying security to which it is linked. 
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5)
 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, in the Commission's order originally approving
the listing and trading of ELNs, the Commission stated it would be willing to reexamine the issue of allowing ELNs linked
to ADRs if such a decision were justified by the subsequent trading experience of ELNs and if sufficient safeguards
were put into place to ensure the pricing integrity of both the ELN and the underlying ADR.
 The Commission is satisfied that these preconditions have been satisfied. As of July 1, 1994, the Amex had 11 series
of ELNs listed for trading. The Exchange represents that no problems have arisen and no complaints have been received
by the Exchange with respect to the trading of these series of ELNs.
 Accordingly, the trading history of ELNs overlying common stock issued by U.S. companies has not raised any regulatory
concerns that would cause the Commission to be concerned about expanding the listing of ELNs to include ELNs linked
to securities (including sponsored ADRs) that are traded in the U.S. on a national securities exchange or through
NASDAQ and that are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to reporting requirements under the Act.

The Commission also believes that sufficient safeguards will be in place to ensure the pricing integrity of both the
ELN and the underlying security. First, each of the requirements currently in place for the listing of ELNs (

i.e., 

market capitalization, trading volume, maximum size of issuance, and U.S. last sale reporting), as enhanced herein,
will apply where the linked security is a security that is traded in the U.S. and is issued by a non-U.S. company. In addition,
the only such securities that can be linked to ELNs are those for which either a comprehensive market information sharing
agreement is in place with the primary market for the security underlying the ELN (in the case of an ADR, with the primary
exchange in the country where the security underlying the ADR primarily trades) or where at least 50% of the worldwide
trading volume in the underlying security and other related securities for the six months prior to issuance occurs
in the U.S. market.
 These standards are more stringent than those the Commission recently found to be adequate with respect to the listing
and trading of options on ADRs where no comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement exists between the Exchange
and the primary market in the country where the security underlying the ADR is primarily traded.
 As the Commission stated in the ADR Approval Order, the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement
serves as a deterrent to manipulation and thus protects the integrity of the marketplace.
 Additionally, the Commission stated that where the U.S. market is the primary market for the trading of an ADR, the
U.S. market is the relevant pricing market for that ADR.
 In those cases, the Commission stated that a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement exists because the self-regulatory
organizations which make up the U.S. market are members of ISG, through which the Exchange can investigate any potential
manipulations.
 As a result, by applying these same standards to ELNs linked to securities that are traded in the U.S. market and are
issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements, the Commission believes the Exchange will
be able to detect and deter potential manipulations involving ELNs and the linked securities.








Moreover, the Commission believes that the proposed method described above for determining whether the six-month
trading volume
 of the underlying security and all related securities in the U.S. market is at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume
of such securities is adequate to ensure that the U.S. market is and continues to be the price discovery market for the
security underlying an ELN. The Commission notes that these procedures are substantively the same as those the Commission
approved in the ADR Approval Order.
 Furthermore, limiting the term of ELNs linked to securities issued by non-U.S. companies to no more than three years
will increase the likelihood that the U.S. market will remain the primary price discovery market for the underlying
linked security during the term of the ELNs.





Finally, the Exchange will require for ELNs linked to securities issued by non-U.S. companies that there be at least
2,000 holders of the underlying security and that the size of such ELN issuances will be limited to (i) 2% of the total
shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 30% of the worldwide trading volume for the security
for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, (ii) 3% of the total shares of the underlying security
outstanding provided at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing
occurred in the U.S. market, or (iii) 5% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least
70% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market.
The Commission believes that these restrictions will minimize the possibility that trading in an ELNs issuance will
adversely impact the market for the security to which it is linked.





In summary, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act because: (1) There is nothing in the
trading history of ELNs which raises any regulatory concerns with respect to expanding the ELNs listing standards
to include ELNs linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs) that are traded in the U.S. on a national securities
exchange or through NASDAQ and that are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements; (2)
the proposed rule change adequately safeguards the pricing integrity of both the ELN and the underlying security
and ensures that there is sufficient surveillance to detect as well as deter manipulation; and (3) the existing regulatory
structure and issuer requirements for ELNs, as enhanced herein, will be applied and will ensure that ELNs will continue
to be linked to highly capitalized companies.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 6 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register 

in order to allow the Exchange to list without delay ELNs linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs) that are
traded in the U.S. securities markets and that are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements
and that satisfy the proposed listing guidelines. Amendment No. 6 provides that ELNs may be linked to equity
 securities issued by non-U.S. companies and traded in the U.S. as ADRs, ordinary shares, or otherwise, and significantly
enhances the existing listing criteria in Sections 107A and 107B of the Guide for ELNs linked to securities issued
by U.S. companies.





The Commission believes that broadening the universe of securities that can be linked to ELNs beyond ADRs, as originally
proposed, to also include securities traded in the U.S. as ordinary shares or otherwise that are issued by non-U.S.
companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements, does not raise any regulatory issues that the Exchange has not
adequately addressed with respect to ELNs linked to ADRs. Furthermore, the Commission believes that the enhanced
listing criteria proposed in Amendment No. 6 which will apply to ELNs linked to any security issued by a non-U.S. company,
combined with the numerical listing standards currently contained in Sections 107A and 107B of the Guide, ensure
that the Amex has the ability to detect and deter manipulation with respect to both the ELN and the underlying security.
Finally, the Commission believes that Amendment No. 6 conforms the proposed rule change to the procedures approved
by the Commission for the listing of options on ADRs.
 As stated in the ADR Approval Order, the Commission continues to believe that these standards will ensure that the
U.S. market is the relevant pricing market for the ELN and the underlying security where there is no comprehensive
market information sharing agreement with the primary market for such security (for ADRs, the primary exchange in
the country where the security underlying the ADR primarily trades).
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 6 to the proposed rule change
on an accelerated basis.






Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 6. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to the File Number SR-Amex-93-46
and should be submitted by September 15, 1994.

It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Ammex-93-46), as amended, is hereby approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change
Modifying the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service</DOCTITLE>


August 18, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
, notice is hereby given that on July 20, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and
III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by NSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The text of the proposed rule change consists of modifications to NSCC's rules and procedures relating to the Automated
Customer Account Transfer Service (``ACATS'').


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The proposed rule change will modify NSCC's ACATS to accelerate the time in which accounts are transferred. The proposed
rule change is made in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange's (``NYSE'') recently filed proposed rule change
to amend NYSE Rule 412 relating to transfers of customer accounts.





Under NSCC's proposed rule change, NSCC Rule 50, Section 9, will be amended to allow a receiving member one business
day after receipt from NSCC of the customer account asset data report to determine whether to accept, to reject, or
to request adjustments to the account. Currently, receiving members have two business days to respond after receiving
the customer account asset data report. Where Mutual Fund Services eligible book share mutual fund assets are to be
transferred, a receiving member again will have one business day instead of two business days after receipt of the
customer account asset data report to submit detailed transfer instructions to NSCC. Each business day that the delivering
member causes an adjustment to be made to an account will give the receiving member one additional business day to accept,
reject, or request adjustments or in the case of mutual funds to submit transfer instructions. Currently, receiving
members have two business days after an adjustment. Additionally, the proposed rule change will delete language
that treats transfers of accounts containing option positions differently from transfers of accounts without option
positions.
NSCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act because the changes
will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will have an impact on or impose a burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others


No written comments relating to the proposed rule change have been solicited or received. NSCC will notify the Commission
of any written comments received by NSCC.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:
(A) By order approve such proposed rule change or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public
Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of NSCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NSCC-94-13
and should be submitted by September 15, 1994.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of
Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Equity Linked Debt Securities</DOCTITLE>



August 18, 1994.



On March 1, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change relating to Equity Linked Debt Securities (``ELDS''). Notice and partial accelerated approval
of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on April 7, 1994.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On July 15, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to
the proposed rule change.
 This order approves the remainder of the Exchange's proposal, as amended.









ELDS are intermediate-term (two to seven years), non-convertible, hybrid securities, the value of which is based,
at least in part, on the value of another issuer's common stock or other equity security.
 ELDS may pay periodic interest or may be issued as zero-coupon instruments with no payments to holders prior to maturity.
 Furthermore, ELDS may be subject to a ``cap'' on the maximum principal amount to be repaid to holders upon maturity
and, additionally, may feature a ``floor'' on the minimum principal amount to be repaid to holders upon maturity.






In addition to the Exchange's requirements with respect to a particular issuance of ELDS,
 ELDS must also conform to the special listing criteria set forth in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual which provide that:
(1) An issuer of ELDS must satisfy the Exchange's listing criteria;
 (2) each issuer must have a minimum tangible net worth of $150 million; (3) the original issue price of the ELDS, combined
with all of the issuer's other ELDS listed on a national securities exchange or otherwise publicly traded in the United
States, may not be greater than 25% of the issuer's net worth at the time of issuance; (4) each underlying linked security
must have either (i) a market capitalization of at least $3.0 billion and a trading volume of at least 2.5 million shares
in the one-year period preceding the listing of the ELDS, or (ii) a market capitalization of at least $1.5 billion and
a trading volume of at least 20 million shares in the one-year period preceding the listing of the ELDS; 
 (5) the issuer of the underlying security must be a U.S. reporting company under the Act; (6) the underlying security
must be traded on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association;
(7) the underlying security must be subject to last sale reporting; and (8) except under limited circumstances, the
issuance of ELDS relating to any underlying security may not exceed five percent of the total shares outstanding of
such underlying security.

The Exchange proposed two sets of changes to the ELDS listing standards. The first proposed change, which the Commission
has already approved,
 provides alternative market capitalization and trading volume criteria for the underlying security. Specifically,
an underlying security may now have either; (1) A minimum market capitalization of at least $3.0 billion and a trading
volume of at least 2.5 million shares in the one-year period prior to the listing of the ELDS; or (2) a minimum market
capitalization of $1.5 billion and a trading volume of at least 20 million shares in the one-year period prior to the
listing.




The second set of proposed changes would amend Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual to allow the issuer of the underlying
security to be a non-U.S. company,
 if certain criteria are met. Under the proposal, the issuer of the underlying security could be a non-U.S. company
subject to reporting requirements under the Act, and whose securities are traded in the United States either as ordinary
shares or as sponsored
 ADRs if ne of the following conditions are met:






1. The Exchange has in place an effective surveillance sharing agreement
 with the primary market for the underlying security (in the case of an ADR, with the primary market in the country where
the security underlying the ADR primarily trades) and at least 30% of the world-wide trading volume for the security
and all related securities (as defined herein) occurs in the U.S. market;






2. The United States is the primary market for the underlying security (determined in the manner discussed below).
In determining whether the U.S. is the primary market for the underlying security, the combined trading volume of
the security (and in the case of ADRs, other classes of stock and ADRs related to the underlying security (``related
securities'')) in the United States for the six-month period preceding the date of listing
 must account for at least 50% of the combined worldwide trading in such securities. The U.S. trading in the security
underlying the ELDS would include only those U.S. self-regulatory organizations included in the Intermarket Surveillance
Group
 and linked through the Intermarket Trading System.
 Trading in the United States in other market would be included in the world-wide trading volume for the security, but
not the U.S. trading volume.

In addition to the listing requirements in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual which are applicable to all ELDS, an ELDS
issue linked to a security (including sponsored ADRs) that is traded in the U.S. and is issued by a non-U.S. company
subject to U.S. reporting requirements must also satisfy the following criteria: (1) The term of the ELDS may not exceed
three years; (2) the trading volume requirements in Paragraph 703.21(C) of the Manual shall be based on U.S. trading
volume;
 (3) with respect to ADRs, an ELDS may only be linked to sponsored ADRs; (4) the Exchange shall use trading volume data
for the six months prior to listing for purposes of determining U.S. Share Volume and Relative ADR volume (both as defined
in the proposal); (5) there must be a minimum of 2,000 holders of the underlying security; (6) the ELDS issuance may
not exceed (i) 2% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 30% of the worldwide
trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, (ii) 3% of the total
shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume for the security
for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, or (iii) 5% of the total shares of the underlying security
outstanding provided at least 70% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing
occurred in the U.S. market; and (7) an ELDS may not be listed if less than 30% of the worldwide trading volume in the underlying
security (for ADRs, trading volume in the ADR and related securities) for the prior six months occurred in the U.S.
market.







The Exchange believes that allowing ELDS to be issued based on the value of eligible securities (including sponsored
ADRs) traded in the U.S. and issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements, will provide significant
benefits to investors and the capital markets by providing increased investment and corporate financing flexibility.
The Exchange further believes that this flexibility will be achieved without compromising investor protection
by ensuring that either the primary market for the linked security is in the United States or the Exchange has access
to surveillance information from the primary exchange in the country where the security underlying the ELDS is primarily
traded (in the case of an ADR, from the primary exchange in the country where the security underlying the ADR primarily
trades). 

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5)
 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, in the Commission's order originally approving
the listing and trading of ELDS, the Commission stated it would reexamine the issue of allowing ELDS linked to ADRs
if such a decision were justified by the subsequent trading experience of ELDS and if sufficient safeguards were put
into place to ensure the pricing integrity of both the ELDS and the underlying ADR.
 The Commission is satisfied that these preconditions have been satisfied. As of July 1, 1994, the NYSE had two series
of ELDS listed for trading. The Exchange represents that no problems have arisen and no complaints have been received
by the Exchange with respect to the trading of these series of ELDS.
 Accordingly, the trading history of ELDS to date has not raised any regulatory concerns that would cause the Commission
to be concerned about expanding the listing of ELDS to include ELDS linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs)
that are traded in the U.S. on a national securities exchange or through the facilities of a national securities association
and are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements.

The Commission also believes that sufficient safeguards will be in place to ensure pricing integrity in both the ELDS
and the underlying security. First, each of the numerical requirements currently in place for the listing of ELDS
(

i.e.

, market capitalization, trading volume, and maximum size of issuance), as enhanced herein, will apply where the
linked security is a security (including sponsored ADRs) that is traded in the U.S. and is issued by a non-U.S. company
subject to U.S. reporting requirements. In addition, the only such securities that can be linked to ELDS are those
for which either an effective surveillance sharing agreement
 is in place with the primary market for the security underlying the ELDS (in the case of an ADR, with the primary exchange
in the country where the security underlying the ADR primarily trades) or where at least 50% of the world-wide trading
volume in the security and other related securities for the six months prior to issuance occurs in the U.S. market.
 These standards for the underlying security are more stringent than those the Commission recently found to be adequate
with respect to the listing and trading of options on ADRs where no effective surveillance sharing agreement exists
between the Exchange and the primary market in the country where the security underlying the ADR is primarily traded.
 As the Commission stated in the ADR Approval Order, the existence of an effective surveillance sharing agreement
serves as a deterrent to manipulation and thus protects the integrity of the marketplace.
 Additionally, the Commission stated that where the U.S. ADR market is the primary market for the trading of an ADR,
the U.S. market is the relevant pricing market for that ADR.
 In those cases, the Commission stated that an effective surveillance sharing agreement exists because the self-regulatory
organizations which make up the U.S. market are members of ISG, through which the Exchange can investigate any potential
manipulations.
 As a result, by applying these same standards to ELDS linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs) issued by non-U.S.
companies, the Commission believes the Exchange will be able to detect and deter potential manipulations involving
ELDS and such linked securities. 










Moreover, the Commission believes that the proposed method described above for determining whether the six-month
trading volume
 of the security underlying the ELDS and all related securities in the U.S. market is at least 50% of the world-wide trading
volume for such securities is adequate to ensure that the U.S. market is and continues to be the price discovery market
for a security underlying an ELDS. The Commission notes that these procedures are substantively the same as those
the Commission approved in the ADR Approval Order.
 Furthermore, limiting the term of ELDS linked to securities issued by non-U.S. companies to no more than three years
will increase the likelihood that the U.S. market will remain the primary price discovery market for the security
during the term of the ELDS. 






Finally, the Exchange will require that there be at least 2,000 holders of the underlying security and will limit ELDS
linked to these securities to (i) 2% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 30%
of the worldwide trading value for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, (ii)
3% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume
for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, or (iii) 5% of the total shares of the
underlying security outstanding provided at least 70% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months
prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market. The Commission believes that will minimize the possibility that trading
in an ELDS issuance will adversely impact the market for the underlying security to which it is linked.

<TEXT>
 

In summary, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act because (1) there is nothing in the
trading history of ELDS which raises any regulatory concerns with respect to expanding the ELDS listing standards
to include ELDS linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs) that are traded in the U.S. either on an exchange or
though the facilities of a national securities exchange and are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting
requirements; (2) the proposed rule change adequately safeguards the pricing integrity of both the ELDS and the underlying
security and ensures that there is sufficient surveillance to detect as well as deter manipulation; and (3) the existing
regulatory structure and issuer requirements for ELDS, as enhanced herein, will be applied and will ensure that ELDS
will continue to be linked to highly capitalized companies.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to allow the Exchange to list without delay ELDS linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs) that are
traded in the U.S. securities markets and are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to reporting requirements under
the Act and that satisfy the proposed listing guidelines. Specifically, Amendment No. 1 significantly enhances
the existing listing criteria contained in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual for the listing of ELDS overlying securities
issued by U.S. companies. The Commission believes that the enhanced listing criteria proposed in Amendment No. 1
which will apply to ELDS linked to any security (including sponsored ADRs) issued by a non-U.S. company, combined
with the numerical listing standards currently contained in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual, ensure that the NYSE
has the ability to detect and deter manipulation with respect to both the ELDS and the underlying security. Furthermore,
the Commission believes that Amendment No. 1 conforms the proposed rule change to the procedures approved by the Commission
for the listing of options on ADRs.
 As stated in the ADR Approval Order, the Commission continues to believe that these standards will ensure that the
U.S. market is the relevant pricing market for the ELDS and the underlying security where no comprehensive market
information sharing agreement exists with the primary market for such underlying security (for ADRs, the primary
exchange in the country where the security underlying the ADR is primarily traded).
 Finally, allowing the Commission to approve, on a case-by-case basis, an issue of ELDS related to more than the specified
percentages of the outstanding shares of the underlying security merely expands the flexibility currently provided
in the rules with respect to ELDS linked to securities issued by U.S. companies.
 Because the Exchange must obtain Commission approval prior listing an ELDS linked to a security (including a sponsored
ADR) issued by a non-U.S. company which exceeds those percentages, the Commission believes that this amendment does
not raise any new regulatory concerns. Accordingly, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving
Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.







IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's
proposal. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such
filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should
refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-04 and should be submitted by September 15, 1994. 

It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the portion of the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-94-04), as amended, relating to the listing
and trading of ELDS linked to either sponsored ADRs or securities issued by non-U.S. companies is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to the Listing and Trading of Options and Long-Terms Options on the Phlx Semiconductor Index</DOCTITLE>



August 18, 1994.



I. Introduction



On January 5, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of index options on the Phlx Semiconductor Index (``Semiconductor
Index'' or ``Index''). The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on January 14, 1994,
 Amendment No. 2 on April 26, 1994,
 and Amendment No.; 3 on May 20, 1994.
 Notice of the proposal, as amended, appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on July 12, 1994.
 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended.











II. Description of Proposal


A. General



The Phlx proposes to list for trading options on the Phlx Semiconductor Index, a new securities index developed by
the Phlx and based on U.S. stocks representing the semiconductor industry that are traded on the NYSE or the AMEX, or
are NM securities traded through the facilities of NASDAQ. The Phlx also proposes to list LEAPS on the full-value Index
(``Index LEAPS''). Semiconductor Index LEAPS will trade independent of and in addition to regular Semiconductor
Index options traded on the Exchange; however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and
regular Index options will be aggregated. The Phlx will use a price-weighted methodology to calculate the value of
the Index.






B. Composition of the Index



The Index was designed by the Exchange and is presently composed of 16 highly capitalized and widely held common stocks
of U.S. companies that are primarily involved in the design, manufacture, sale, and distribution of semiconductors
used in computer and other electronic device manufacturing. Six of these securities currently trade through NASDAQ
as NM securities, and ten trade on the NYSE. All component stocks are ``reported securities,'' as that term is defined
in Rule 11a3-1 of the Act.
 The Index is price-weighted and will be calculated on a real-time basis using last sale prices.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940825-2-00149 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940825-2-00096 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As of the close of trading on July 21, 1994, the Index was valued at 237.19. As of July 8, 1994, the market capitalizations
of the individual securities in the Index ranged from a high of $25.0 billion to a low of $317.8 million, with the mean
being $4.8 billion. The market capitalization of all the securities in the Index was $76.8 billion. The total number
of shares outstanding on that date for the stocks in the Index ranged from a high of 557.2 million shares to a low of 15.7
million shares. Also on that date, the price per share in the U.S. of the securities in the Index ranged from a high of
$83.88 to a low of $14.50. In addition, the average daily trading volume in the U.S. of the stocks in the Index, for the
six-month period from January 1, 1994, through June 30, 1994, ranged from a high of 2.7 million shares per day to a low
of 107,000 shares per day. Lastly, no one component accounted for more than 15.79% of the Index's total value and the
percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted for 51.01% of the Index's value. The percentage
weighting of the lowest weighted component was 2.73% of the Index and the percentage weighting of the five smallest
issues in the Index accounted for 17.41% of the Index's value. 


C. Maintenance


The Index will be maintained by the Phlx. The Phlx may change the composition of the Index at any time, subject to compliance
with the maintenance criteria discussed herein, to reflect the conditions in the semiconductor industry. In accordance
with Phlx rule 1009A, if it becomes necessary to replace a security in the Index, the Exchange represents that it will
be replaced with a stock which the Exchange, in its discretion, believes would be compatible with the intended market
character of the Index.
 In making replacement determinations, the Exchange will also take into account a security's capitalization, liquidity,
volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement. Further, securities may be replaced in the event of
certain corporate events, such as takeovers or mergers, that change the nature of the security. If, however, the Exchange
determines to increase the number of Index component securities to greater than 21 or reduce the number of index component
securities to fewer than 11, the proposal provides that the Phlx will submit a rule filing with the Commission pursuant
to Section 19(b) of the Act. In addition, in choosing replacement securities for the Index, the Phlx will be required
to ensure that at least 90% of the weight of the Index continues to be made up of stocks that are eligible for standardized
options trading.

D. Applicability of Phlx Rules Regarding Index Options



Except as modified by this order, Phlx Rules 1000A through 1103A, in particular, and Phlx Rules 1000 through 1070,
in general, will be applicable to Semiconductor Index options and Index LEAPS. Those rules address, among other things,
the applicable position and exercise limits, policies regarding trading halts and suspensions, and margin treatment
for narrow-based index options.



E. Calculation of the Index



The Phlx Semiconductor Index is a price-weighted index and reflects changes in the prices of the Index component securities
relative to the Index's base date of December 1, 1993. Specifically, the Index value is calculated by adding the prices
of the component stocks, dividing this summation by a divisor that is equal to the number of the components of the Index
to get the average price, and multiplying the resulting number by 100. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the
divisor will be adjusted to reflect non-market changes in the prices of the component securities as well as changes
in the composition of the Index. Changes that may result in divisor adjustments include, but are not limited to, stock
splits and dividends, spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions.

The Index value will be updated dynamically at least once every 15 seconds during the trading day. The Phlx has retained
Bridge Data, Inc. to compute the value of the Index. Pursuant to Phlx Rule 1100A, updated Index values will be disseminated
and displayed by means of primary market prints reported by the Consolidated Tape Association and over the facilities
of the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''). The Index value will also be available on broker/dealer interrogation
devices to subscribers of the option information.

The Index value for purposes of settling outstanding regular Index options and Index LEAPS contracts upon expiration
will be calculated based upon the regular way opening sale prices for each of the Index's component securities in their
primary market on the last trading day prior to expiration. In the case of securities traded on and through NASDAQ,
the first reported sale price will be used. Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value of the Index will
be determined and that value will be used as the final settlement value for expiring Index options and Index LEAPS contracts.
If any of the component stocks do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior trading
day's (

i.e.,

 normally Thursday's) last sale price will be used in the Index calculation. In this regard, before deciding to use
Thursday's closing value of a component security for purposes of determining the settlement value of the Index, the
Phlx will wait until the end of the day on the last trading day before expiration.



F. Contract Specifications



The proposed options on the Index will be cash-settled, European-style options.
 Standard options trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. Eastern Standard time) will apply to the contracts. The Index
multiplier will be 100. The strike price interval will be $5.00 for Index options with a duration of one year or less
to expiration. In addition, pursuant to Phlx Rule 1012(a), there may be up to six expiration months outstanding at
any given time. Specifically, there may be up to three expiration months from the March, June, September, and December
cycle plus up to three additional near-term months so that the two nearest term months will always be available. The
Exchange also intends to list several Index LEAPS series that expire from 12 to 36 months from the date of issuance pursuant
to Phlx Rule 1101A(b)(iii).

G. Position and Exercise Limits, Margin Requirements, and Trading Halts



Because the Index is classified as an ``industry index'' under Phlx rules,
 Exchange rules that are applicable to the trading of options on narrow-based indexes will apply to the trading of Semiconductor
Index options and Index LEAPS. Specifically, Exchange rules governing margin requirements,
 position and exercise limits,
 and trading halt procedures
 that are applicable to the trading of narrow-based index options will apply to options traded on the Index. Positions
in Index LEAPS will be aggregated with positions in regular Index options on a one-for-one basis for purposes of position
and exercise limits.








H. Surveillance



Surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also
be used to monitor trading in Index options and Index LEAPS. These procedures include complete access to trading activity
in the underlying securities. Further, the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, dated July 14, 1983, as amended
on January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of options on the Index.







III. Findings and Conclusions




The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of Semiconductor Index options, including Index LEAPS, will
serve to promote the public interest and help to remove impediments to a free and open securities market by providing
investors with a means of hedging exposure to market risk associated with securities representing the semiconductor
industry.









The trading of options of LEAPS on the Semiconductor Index, however, raises several concerns, namely issues related
to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market impact. The Commission believes, however, for the
reasons discussed below, that the Phlx adequately has addressed these concerns.



A. Index Design and Structure




The Commission finds that the Semiconductor Index is a narrow-based index. The Index is composed of only sixteen securities,
all of which represent the semiconductor industry. Accordingly, in light of the limited number of stocks in the Index
and that the Index represents one industry sector, the Commission believes it is proper to classify the Semiconductor
Index as narrow-based and apply Phlx's rules governing narrow-based index options to trading in the Index options
and Index LEAPS.

<PARENT> FR940825-2-00096 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the overwhelming
majority of the components that comprise the Index are actively traded, with an average daily trading volume for the
period from January 1, 1994 through June 30, 1994, ranging from a high of 2.7 million shares per day to a low of 107,000
shares per day. Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging from a high
of $25.0 billion to a low of $317.8 million as of July 8, 1994, with the mean being $4.86 billion. Third, although the
Index is only comprised of sixteen component securities, no one particular security or group of securities dominates
the Index. Specifically, as of July 8, 1994, no one stock accounted for more than 15.79% of the Index's total value and
the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted for 51.01% of the Index's value. Fourth,
at least 90% of the securities in the Index, by weight, must be eligible for standardized options trading. This proposed
maintenance requirement will ensure that the Index is substantially comprised of options eligible securities.
Fifth, if the Phlx increases the number of component securities to more than 21 or decreases that number to less than
11, the Phlx will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before listing new
strike price or expiration month series of Semiconductor Index options or Index LEAPS. This will help protect against
material changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect the Phlx's obligations to
protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly markets in Semiconductor Index options and Index LEAPS. This will
further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission believes that the
expense of attempting to manipulate the value of the Semiconductor Index in any significant way through trading in
component stocks (or options on those stocks) coupled with, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading
activity in those securities, will help deter such illegal activity.


B. Customer Protection


The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Semiconductor Index options and Index LEAPS, can commence
on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded options
occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) The special risks of options are
disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading
are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly,
because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options
currently traded on the Phlx, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection
of investors in Semiconductor Index options and LEAPS.


C. Surveillance


The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a security index
derivative product and the exchange(s) trading to securities underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
 In this regard, the Phlx, NYSE, Amex, and NASD are all members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary
surveillance information.

D. Market Impact


The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Semiconductor Index options and Index LEAPS on the Phlx will
not adversely impact the underlying securities markets.
 First, as described above, for the most part, no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because
(i) at least 90% of the numerical value of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's options
listing standards, (ii) each of the component securities must be traded on either the NYSE or the Amex, or as NM securities
traded through NASDAQ, and (iii) the component securities must be subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule
11Aa3-1 of the Act,
 the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities. Third, the 7,500
contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to minimize potential
manipulation and market impact concerns.






Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring Semiconductor Index options and Index LEAPS based on the
opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts, valuing options for
exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects
on markets for securities underlying options on the Index.







It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Phlx-94-02), as amended, is approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice clarifies SBA's position on the permissible sources of funds for the repurchase of 3% preferred tock from
the Agency by specialized small business investment companies. Under the narrow circumstances described in this
Notice, the stock may be repurchased with ``idle funds'' of the company.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On April 1, 1994, SBA published a Notice in the 

Federal Register 

 setting forth the guidelines SBA would follow in its implementation of the 3% Preferred Stock Repurchase Program
for Small Business Investment Companies licensed under section 301(d) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958,
as amended (SSBICs). See 59 FR 15491. SBA has determined that those guidelines require further clarification as they
relate to the use of ``idle funds'' to finance a repurchase transaction.





SBA reiterates its position that the financing of a repurchase with cash already in an SSBIC is inconsistent with the
policy of avoiding the transfer of cash flows from SSBICs into the Agency. Under certain unique circumstances, however,
an SSBIC's idle funds may be a permissible temporary source of funds.

If an SSBIC (i) has retained earnings available for distribution which, when capitalized, would be insufficient
to pay the full repurchase price, (ii) has no outstanding indebtedness to SBA or any other party, and (iii) holds unencumbered
publicly traded and marketable securities with an unrealized gain (after deducting any allowances for prospective
income taxes and other contingent liabilities such as incentive compensation) equal to at least 20 percent of the
difference between the repurchase price and the capitalizable retained earnings, SBA will permit the SSBIC to use
its idle funds in the financing of its repurchase transaction 

provided

 that, based on its most recent financials submitted with its application for repurchase, cash and idle funds remaining
in the SSBIC after the repurchase would be more than the total loans and investments made by the SSBIC during the prior
two fiscal years. SBA's permission would be conditioned upon the following:

(1) The SSBIC would be required to capitalize its retained earnings available for distribution. Idle funds would
be used only to fund the difference between the repurchase price and the capitalizable retained earnings.

(2) The use of idle funds in the financing of a repurchase transaction would be a temporary measure only. Within two
years of using idle funds in its repurchase transaction, the SSBIC must ``replace'' those funds by increasing its
private capital through the sale of stock for cash to non-SBA sources or through a capitalization of retained earnings
available for distribution.

(3) Until private capital is increased in the manner described in the preceding paragraph, the SSBIC must continue
to hold unencumbered publicly traded and marketable securities with a value, after allowances, of not less than two
times the amount of capital yet to be raised by the SSBIC. Failure to comply with this paragraph or the preceding paragraph
could result in the transfer of the SSBIC to the Office of Liquidation.

<DOCTITLE>Approval of Noise Compatibility Program, Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport, Kalamazoo, MI</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by the County of Kalamazoo, Michigan, under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act
of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR Part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal
and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1980). On March 1, 1993, the FAA determined that
the noise exposure maps submitted by the County of Kalamazoo under Part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements.
On May 17, 1994, the Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport
noise compatibility program.


A total of sixteen (16) measures were included in the Kalamazoo County recommended program. Of the sixteen (16) measures,
four (4) are listed as ``Nose Abatement Plan Measures,'' nine (9) are listed as ``Land Use Management Program Measures,''
and three (3) are listed as ``Continuing Program Measures.'' The FAA has approved fifteen (15) of the sixteen (16)
measures.''



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Kalamazoo/Battle
Creek International Airport, effective May 17, 1994.




Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program
which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.
Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act, and is limited to
the following determinations:
a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150;
b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;
c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and
d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.

Specific limitations with respect to the FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated
in FAR Part 150,  150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Detroit Airports District Office in Belleville, Michigan.


The County of Kalamazoo submitted to the FAA noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced
during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from June 20, 1989, through November 18, 1993. The Kalamazoo/Battle
Creek International Airport noise exposure maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements
on March 1, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 15, 1993.

The Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised
of actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of
the study completion to the year 1995. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility
program as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on November 18, 1993, and was
required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight
procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period would have
been deemed to be approval of such program.


The submitted program contained sixteen (16) proposed actions for noise mitigation. The FAA completed its review
and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. The
overall program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective May 17, 1994.

Outright approval was granted for 15 of the 16 specific program elements. One proposed element to extend Runway 35
1,000 feet was disapproved pending submission of additional information regarding air traffic safety and efficiency.
These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports
on May 17, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and documents which comprised the submittal
to the FAA, are available for review at the following locations:




Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., room 617, Washington, DC 20591; 

Federal Aviation Administration, Detroit Airports District Office, Willow Run Airport, East, 8820 Beck Road, Belleville,
Michigan 48111;
Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport, 5235 Portage Road, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49002.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice_request for prospectuses.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Academic Programs of the United States Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs
announces an open competition to award grants to post-secondary educational institutions for academic exchange
programs.



This is a two-step competition. For Step I, interested institutions whose proposed projects are eligible in terms
of partner country(ies) and academic discipline(s) (see below) should submit a five-page, double-spaced prospectus.
Agency panels will review prospectuses according to the established review criteria listed below.

In Step II, approximately forty-five to fifty institutions will be invited to submit comprehensive proposals which
will be reviewed by independent academic review panels and by an Agency panel. Subject to the availability of funds,
16-20 grants will then be awarded in Fiscal Year 1995 with a minimum of two grants for each geographic region (described
below).

Overall grant making and funding authority for this program is contained in Fulbright-Hays Act, also known as the
Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended, Public Law 87-256. The purpose of the Act is
``to enable the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United
States and the people of other countries * * *; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations
by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United
States and other nations * * * and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic and peaceful
relations between the United States and the other countries of the world.''

Projects must conform with Agency requirements and guidelines outlined in this announcement. USIA projects and
programs are subject to the availability of funds.






ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER: 

All communications with USIA concerning this announcement should refer to the above title and reference number E/ASU-94-01.






DATES:





Step I deadline: 

All copies must be received at the U.S. Information Agency by 5 p.m. Washington, D.C. time on Friday, October 7, 1994.
Faxed documents will not be accepted, nor will documents postmarked on October 7, 1994, but received at a later date.
It is the responsibility of each applicant to ensure that prospectuses are received by the above deadline.



Step II schedule: 

Those applicants with successful prospectuses will be invited on or about November 30, 1994 to submit comprehensive
proposals due at the Agency on or about February 22, 1995. Final awards will be made on or about August 1, 1995.



Program dates: 

Grants should begin on September 1, 1995.



Program duration: 

September 1, 1995-August 31, 1998.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a nonpolitical character and should be
balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. Diversity should
be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, religion,
geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere
to the advancement of this principle.



Overview



The objectives of the College and University Affiliations program are to:

 Promote institutional linkages between U.S. and foreign institutions of higher education in academic disciplines
and in countries and regions without significant, privately funded exchanges.

 Provide significant mutual benefit to both the U.S. and foreign institutions involved in the exchanges.

 Support current Agency disciplinary and geographic programming priorities.

 Develop skills and knowledge and advance scholarship and teaching in the disciplines supported through the
program.

 Advance mutual understanding between the U.S. and the countries or regions represented in the linkages.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940825-2-00172 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940825-2-00108 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Complement the individual lectureship, research and graduate study fellowships available under Fulbright
and other Agency auspices. 

 Increase international academic exchange by two-year and small, four-year colleges and schools, especially
community colleges and those with significant minority student enrollments. 

 Ensure a wide-ranging distribution of grants geographically throughout the U.S. and abroad. 

 Support linkages which have institutional backing and cost sharing from both the U.S. and foreign institution.


 Foster long-term, active relationships between the affiliated institutions after Agency funding has terminated.




Program Guidelines 



Exchange visits will involve some combination of the following activities: teaching, lecturing, research, faculty
and curriculum development, and community outreach directly related to the purpose of the affiliation. The ideal
and most competitive projects will constitute a well-reasoned combination of all of these activities. The exchange
visits to all partner institutions must be for one month or more with the exception of planning visits which may be for
shorter periods. Three-month or one-semester visits are strongly preferred and projects with longer lengths of
stay will be more competitive. 

Acceptable projects will be to either establish new affiliations or to innovate and strengthen existing partnerships,
not merely to extend projects previously funded by the College and University Affiliations Program (formerly the
``University Affiliations Program''), other USIA linkage programs or similar linkage programs funded by other
U.S. government agencies. Projects for technical or development assistance and feasibility studies to plan affiliations
will not be considered. Research projects must include collaboration by researchers from participating institutions
and be linked to substantial participation in graduate-level seminars. 

The competition, as described in the separate section below on geographic area programs, is limited to selected countries
and academic disciplines which represent USIA's geographic and academic priorities for the College and University
Affiliations Program.

to other USIA programs.




Review Process: 

The College and University Affiliations Program review process for invited institutions will be conducted in three
stages: Technical, Academic, and Agency.



USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines stated herein and in the letter of invitation. Eligible
proposals will be forwarded to outside academic panel(s) and Agency panel(s) for advisory review. All eligible proposals
will also be reviewed by the Agency's contracts offices, as well as the Office of Academic Programs, the USIA geographic
area office, and the USIA post overseas. Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel or by other
Agency elements. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the USIA Associate Director for Educational and Cultural
Affairs. Final technical authority for grants resides with the USIA grants officer.

ACTION: 

Notice_request for proposals.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Russia/Eurasia Division of the Office of Citizen Exchanges of the United States Information Agency's Bureau
of Education and Cultural Affairs announces an open competition for an assistance award program. Public or private
non-profit organizations meeting the provisions described in IRS regulation 501(c)(3) may apply to conduct at least
three five-week, U.S.-based internship programs for Russian business people and local government officials. A
minimum of ten Russian participants must be included in each internship cycle. Programs may not begin any earlier
than March 1995. Pending the availability of funds, the program may be extended through December 1997.


This program is a continuation of a pilot project conducted in 1994 and seeks to provide Russian business people with
knowledge of a market economy and promote a supportive business environment for the participants upon their return
to Russia. The participants will be recruited, through an open and competitive process, from selected regions of
Russia and will begin arriving in the United States in March 1995.
Overall grant making authority for this program is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act
of 1961, as amended, Public Law 87-256, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act. The purpose of the Act is ``to enable
the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the
people of other countries * * *; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating
the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other
nations * * * and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic and peaceful relations
between the United States and the other countries of the world.''
Programs and projects must conform with Agency requirements and guidelines outlined in the Application Package.
USIA projects and programs are subject to the availability of funds.



ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER: 

All communications with USIA concerning this announcement should refer to the above title and reference number E/P-95-15.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity''
should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender,
religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged
to adhere to the advancement of this principle.

Overview


The ``Business for Russia'' program has been developed in full partnership with the Russian Government and various
Russian organizations. It has been designed as a working partnership between U.S. federal, state, and local governments,
NGOs, and private enterprises and their counterpart institutions in Russia. Pending the availability of fund, approximately
1,000 Russian business people and local government officials will be recruited from selected regions of Russia through
an open competition coordinated in Russia by an experienced, Moscow-based U.S. grantee organization in conjunction
with the Russian government and Russian partner organizations. Participants will be screened for proficiency in
English prior to final selection. Operating in accordance with guidelines established by USIA, the recruitment/selection
organization will also cooperate with the U.S. Embassy, Peace Corps, American private organizations and businesses,
and the Russian government and business organizations to select Russian participants.
This announcement seeks American grantee organizations to organize and implement business internships in the United
States that will enhance the Russians' ability to develop their own businesses upon returning to Russia. USIA is interested
in proposals that provide a professional business experience and, secondarily, expose the participants to American
life and culture. USIA is not interested in programs that are academic in nature; this program is designed to provide
practical, hands-on training in the American business environment that can be transferred to the individual's employment
situation in Russia.


Participant Profile


Russian participants will be predominantly business managers in existing small or medium-sized firms and entrepreneurs
who manage their own businesses, mostly in the 25-40 age group. A small number of local government officials
may also be recruited for participation in the program. All participants will be required to have a working knowledge
of English. Depending on the results of this selection process, the Agency may request that the U.S.-based grantee
organizations modify the number of individual interns assigned to their local region to meet the demands of the program.
The Office of Citizen Exchanges will be responsible for matching interns with the appropriate US host organizations.
Interns will be placed in geographic ``clusters'' in the U.S. (i.e., areas within two hours' driving time of a central
meeting point) in order to maximize local resources and strengthen the effectiveness of all aspects of the training
program. Every effort will be made to group the interns by Russian region of origin in order to permit them to share common
experiences and to develop networks and professional associations upon their return home. Proposals should explain
how the grantee organizations will utilize the cluster to improve Russians' exchange experience.
Programs must comply with J-1 visa regulations. Participants will be covered by the Agency's self-insurance
policy.


Proposed Budget


Organizations must submit a comprehensive line item budget based on the specific guidance provided in the Budget
Guidelines section of the Application Package. Grants awarded to eligible organizations with less than four years
of experience in conducting international exchange programs will be limited to $60,000. Allowable costs for the
program include the following:
(1) International and domestic air fares; transit costs; ground transportation costs.
(2) Housing. Participants are to be housed with volunteer US homestay families. There are no provisions for reimbursing
homestay families for their hosting costs. Participants may be housed in hotels for a maximum of five nights, at a rate
not to exceed $100/night.
(3) Per diems. Participants may be compensated for meals and incidental expenses a rate not to exceed $25/day for the
duration of the program.
(4) Book and Cultural Allowances. Participants are entitled to a one-time book allowance payment of $150 and a cultural
allowance of $100 per person. Accompanying staff are not eligible for these benefits.
(5) Consultants. Consultants may be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Daily honoraria
may not exceed $250/day.
(6) Room rental. Generally not to exceed $250/day.
(7) One working meal per project. Per capita costs may not exceed $15-20 for a lunch and $20-30 for a dinner.
The number of invited guests may not exceed the number of participants by more than a factor of two. This includes room
rental if applicable.

Cost-sharing and enhancement of the basic package provided by USIA is encouraged. The Agency reserves the right to
reduce, revise, or increase the proposal budget in accordance with the needs of the program. Please refer to the Application
Package for complete budget guidelines.




Review Process






USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines stated herein and in the Application Package. Eligible
proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will also be reviewed
by the budget and contracts offices, as well as the USIA Office of Eastern Europe and the NIS and the USIA post in Russia.
Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel or by other Agency elements. Funding decisions
are at the discretion of the USIA Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority
for grant awards resides with the USIA grants officer.




Review Criteria




Technically eligible applications will be competitively reviewed according to the following criteria:


1. 

Quality of the program idea: 

Proposals should exhibit originality, substance, precision, and relevance to Agency mission.


2. 

Program planning and ability to achieve program objectives: 

The proposal should clearly show how the grantee institution will meet the program's objectives. The proposal should
include a detailed agenda and work plan that illustrate logistical capacity. The project content should be substantive
and the planned execution realistic.


3. 

Institutional ability/record: 

Interested institutions should demonstrate their potential for program excellence and/or provide documentation
of successful programs. If an organization is a previous USIA grant recipient, responsible fiscal management and
full compliance with all reporting requirements from past Agency grants, as determined by USIA's Office of Contracts
(M/KG), will be considered. Pertinent evaluation results of previous projects are a part of this assessment.


4. 

Thematic and area expertise: 

Proposals should reflect the institution's expertise in the subject area and should address the specific issues
of concern facing the Russian Federation.


5. 

Project personnel: 

Personnel's thematic and logistical expertise should be relevant to the proposed program. R&eacute;sum&eacute;s
should be suited to the specific proposal and no longer than two pages.


6. 

Cross-cultural sensitivity: 

Proposals should show evidence of sensitivity to historical, linguistic, and other cross-cultural factors, as
well as appropriate knowledge of Russia's geography, and should show how this sensitivity will be used in practical
aspects of the program, such as pre-departure orientations or briefing of American hosts.


7. 

Multiplier effect/follow-on activities: 

Proposed programs should strengthen long-term mutual understanding, to include maximum sharing of information
and establishment of long-term institutional and individual ties. Proposals should also reflect an institutional
commitment for continued exchange activity beyond the term of the USIA grant.


8. 

Cost-effectiveness/cost-sharing: 

The overhead and administrative components should be kept as low as possible. Costs to USIA per exchange participant
should be reasonable, and all items proposed for USIA funding must be necessary and appropriate to achieve the program's
objectives. Proposals should maximize cost-sharing through other private sector support as well as direct funding
contributions and/or in-kind support from the prospective grantee institution.


9. 

Project evaluation: 

Proposals should include a plan to evaluate the project's success.


10. 

Support of diversity: 

Proposals should demonstrate the recipient's commitment to promoting the awareness and understanding of diversity
throughout the program. This can be accomplished through documentation (such as a written statement or account)
summarizing past and/or on-going activities and efforts that further the principle of diversity within both their
organization and their activities.

<TEXT>
 

Authority for the RERC program of NIDRR is contained in section 204(b)(3) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended
(29 U.S.C. 760-762). Under this program the Secretary makes awards to public and private agencies and organizations,
including institutions of higher education, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations, to conduct research, demonstration,
and training activities regarding rehabilitation technology in order to enhance opportunities for meeting the
needs of, and addressing the barriers confronted by, individuals with disabilities in all aspects of their lives.
An RERC must be operated by or in collaboration with an institution of higher education or a nonprofit organization.

These proposed priorities support the National Education Goals that call for all children in America to start school
ready to learn and for every adult American to possess the skills necessary to compete in a global economy. 
Under the regulations for this program (see 34 CFR 353.32) the Secretary may establish research priorities by reserving
funds to support particular research activities. 
The Secretary will announce the final priorities in a notice in the 

Federal Register

. The final priorities will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations
of the Department. Funding of a particular project depends on the final priorities, the availability of funds, and
the quality of the applications received. The publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the Secretary
from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject
to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.





Note:

 This notice of proposed priorities does not solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition
will be published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrent with or following the notice of final priorities. 


Description of the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center Program 


RERCs carry out research or demonstration activities by: (1) Developing and disseminating innovative methods of
applying advanced technology, scientific achievement, and psychological and social knowledge to (a) solve rehabilitation
problems and remove environmental barriers, and (b) study new or emerging technologies, products, or environments;
(2) demonstrating and disseminating (a) innovative models for the delivery of cost-effective rehabilitation technology
services to rural and urban areas, and (b) other scientific research to assist in meeting the employment and independent
living needs of individuals with severe disabilities; or (3) facilitating service delivery systems change through
(a) the development, evaluation, and dissemination of consumer-responsive and individual and family centered
innovative models for the delivery to both rural and urban areas of innovative cost-effective rehabilitation technology
services, and (b) other scientific research to assist in meeting the employment and independent needs of individuals
with severe disabilities. 
The statute requires that each applicant for a grant, including an RERC, demonstrate how its proposed activities
address the needs of individuals from minority backgrounds who have disabilities. Each RERC must provide training
opportunities to individuals, including individuals with disabilities, to become researchers of rehabilitation
technology and practitioners of rehabilitation technology in conjunction with institutions of higher education
and nonprofit organizations. 


General


The Secretary proposes that the following requirements apply to the RERCs pursuant to these absolute priorities
unless noted otherwise: 
The RERC (except the RERC on universal telecommunications access) must have the capability to design, build, and
test prototype devices and assist in the transfer of successful solutions to the marketplace. The RERC must evaluate
the efficacy and safety of its new products, instrumentation, or assistive devices. 
The RERC must provide graduate-level research training to build capacity for engineering research in the rehabilitation
field and to provide training in the applications of new technology to service providers and to individuals with disabilities
and their families. 
The RERC must develop all training materials in formats that will be accessible to individuals with various types
of disabilities and communication modes, and widely disseminate findings and products to individuals with disabilities
and their families and representatives, service providers, manufacturers and distributors, and other appropriate
target populations. 
The RERC must involve individuals with disabilities, persons from minority backgrounds with disabilities and,
if appropriate, their family members in planning and implementing the research, development, and training programs,
in interpreting and disseminating the research findings, and in evaluating the Center. 
The RERC must share information and data, and, as appropriate, collaborate on research and training with other NIDRR-supported
grantees including, but not limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Disability and Business Technical
Assistance Centers and other related RERCs and RRTCs. The RERC must work closely with the RERC on Technology Evaluation
and Transfer at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 


Priority


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet the following
priorities. The Secretary proposes to fund under this competition only applications that meet these absolute priorities.

Proposed Priority 1: Technology for Children With Orthopedic Disabilities 


Background 


Children who sustain traumatic injury, congenital anomalies or disease-induced anomalies may require prosthetic
devices for missing limbs and orthotic devices for support and correction. 
Because children are growing rapidly, their prosthetic and orthotic devices must be designed to satisfy their special
developmental needs. Too often, children's devices are scaled-down versions of adult devices. 
New composite materials such as graphite, carbon fiber/carbon matrix, and fiber-reinforced ceramics have 
much to offer in prosthetic and orthotic design and practice because they are lightweight and durable. These factors
are especially important for young children. However, composite materials require different manufacturing techniques
than those used to form metals. The special configurations of these devices require special construction methods
to produce devices that are safe and effective and competitively priced. In addition, most composite materials are
hard to re-shape once they are made. This interferes with the fitting of devices that need to be adjusted for each child.
Techniques for adjusting the shape of composite material devices need to be developed. 
The neuromuscular and musculoskeletal development of growing children presents a significant challenge to those
practitioners who provide children with prosthetic and orthotic devices. The devices must meet the prevailing needs
of the child as well as adjust to the child's physical growth for a reasonably long period of time. 
Most orthotic/prosthetic facilities have difficulty meeting these challenges. This is compounded by the fact that
children who need these services are not evenly distributed throughout the country, and there are few service providers
in some geographic areas. In addition, some practitioners and parents have limited access to a variety of devices.
As a result, they are not in a position to sample a number of devices and select the one that is most appropriate. For example,
the electric hand often appeals to a parent because it looks and acts like a real hand. An experimental fitting and practical
comparison may persuade parents and child that benefits of hook design outweigh the cosmetic appeal of the electric
hand. Inexpensive opportunities to try out various prostheses need to be increased. 



Proposed Priority 



An RERC on technology and children with orthopedic disabilities shall_

 Develop and evaluate prosthetic and orthotic devices and related orthopedic procedures to meet the changing
needs of growing children with neuromuscular and musculoskeletal impairments; 

 Identify and assess the suitability of materials for use in these devices, including composite materials,
considering the weight, strength, durability, adaptability, techniques of fabrication, cost and cosmetic acceptability;


 Develop improved methods for fabricating assistive devices for children, including those using composite
materials; 

 Evaluate the effectiveness of the systems of delivery of prosthetic and orthotic devices and closely related
assistive technology to children with orthopedic impairments and develop recommendations to improve the current
systems; 

 Identify, develop, and evaluate models to enable children and families, as well as clinicians, to test prosthetic
and orthotic devices for suitability prior to purchase; 

 Identify the unique barriers to effective service delivery for prosthetic and orthotic devices facing families
of children with orthopedic disabilities from minority backgrounds and develop strategies for overcoming those
barriers; and 

 Develop and implement strategies to increase the participation of children with orthopedic impairments
and their parents in identifying user needs for prosthetic and orthotic devices and future areas of research. 



Proposed Priority 2: Technology for Low Vision and Blindness Background 



The National Center for Health Statistics and other authorities variously estimate the number of legally blind persons
in the United States at 400,000 to 600,000, with another 1.4 million persons severely visually impaired. More than
10 million others have some visual impairment that cannot be further improved with corrective lenses. There are also
large and rapidly increasing numbers of older individuals with impairments in contrast, binocularity, and adaptation,
which significantly limit their performance in a wide variety of everyday tasks. 

Technological innovations arising from the development of new scientific and medical knowledge can have a positive
impact on the lives of persons with low vision or blindness. While progress has been made regarding educational and
vocational aids, optical amplifiers for low vision, orientation and mobility aids, and improved functional vision
assessment, the need remains for improvements in these areas. For example, there is a need for new and innovative adaptive
devices and development of systems engineering solutions to assist in our efforts to prepare all children with low
vision and blindness to enter school ready to learn through early identification, monitoring, and treatment of visual
impairments in neonates and infants.
