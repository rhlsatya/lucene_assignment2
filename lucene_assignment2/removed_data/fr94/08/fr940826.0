Oranges, Grapefruit, Tangerines, and Tangelos Grown in Florida; Finalize Revised Special Purpose Shipment Exemption
Provisions for Organic Citrus Fruit 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule to redefine the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' to mean those persons who handle citrus fruit which is
certified as organically grown under Florida law, and requires such persons to certify that they will limit shipments
of such fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruit. This final rule more precisely defines organically grown
Florida citrus fruit, and is designed to increase the market for organic shipments. The rule was unanimously recommended
by the Citrus Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing
order.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 87 and Marketing Order No. 905 [7 CFR Part 905] regulating the
handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order.
This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601-674],
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit,
tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and about 11,000 growers of these citrus fruits in Florida. Small agricultural
service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts
of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural growers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000.
A minority of these handlers and a majority of the growers may be classified as small entities.

An interim final rule was issued on May 18, 1994, and published in the 

Federal Register

 [59 FR 26927, May 25, 1994], with an effective date of May 25, 1994. That rule amended   905.146, 905.147,
and 905.148 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which
ended June 24, 1994. One comment was received. 
Mr. Joseph B. Procacci, Assistant Chairman, National Association of Perishable Agricultural Receivers, filed
a comment in support of the revisions. He supports the revision in the regulation's definition of Special Purpose
Shippers to include Florida's new certification process of organic producers. He stated it is crucial in preserving
the integrity of the organic citrus industry. He also expressed support for the regulation's requirement that such
shippers also certify that they will limit organic shipments to organic outlets. 
The order for Florida citrus provides for the establishment of minimum grade and size requirements. The minimum grade
and size requirements are designed to provide fresh markets with fruit of acceptable quality, thereby maintaining
consumer confidence for fresh Florida citrus. This helps create buyer confidence and contributes to stable marketing
conditions. This is in the interest of producers, packers, and consumers, and is designed to increase returns to Florida
citrus growers. 
The cultural practices of producers of organically grown citrus differ from normal industry practices. Because
of these differences, organically grown fruit is usually required to meet a different grade standard under the marketing
order. This grade standard pertains only to the external characteristics of the fruit, not the internal quality.

The different grade standard is needed to facilitate the marketing of organic citrus. There are indications that
organically grown citrus, from a marketing standpoint, are a different commodity than conventionally grown citrus.
Organic citrus generally has higher external damage. Organic fruit for the most part is marketed differently, is
not mixed with non-organic fruit, appeals only to certain consumers, and is in many respects, a specialized commodity.
The interim final rule also more precisely defined organic fruit, and the type of market outlets which organically
grown fruit could be sold in, free from certain requirements imposed under the order. These changes were unanimously
recommended by the committee at its November 16, 1993, meeting. 
Sections 905.146, 905.147, and 905.148 of the regulations provide terms and conditions under which shippers may
ship organically grown Florida citrus fruit, as Special Purpose Shippers, with a conditional release from certain
grade requirements issued under  905.52 of the order. 
When the provisions concerning special purpose shipments were made effective in 1978, there were no laws governing
organic fruit and vegetable growers in Florida. A ``Special Purpose Shipper'' was defined under the marketing order
as one who had certified that they would handle only citrus fruit which they knew from their own personal knowledge
was produced on trees on which only compost, non-acidulated fertilizer such as rock phosphate, dolomite, or ground
limestone is used, and to which no chemical insecticide or fungicide had been applied. However, the State of Florida
now requires all organically grown fruits and vegetables to be certified. Accordingly, the committee has recommended
redefining the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' in  905.146 to mean a person who handles Florida citrus fruit
that is certified by a Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services licensed certifying agent as organically
grown under Florida law. This definition reflects that organic fruit has been certified under Florida law, and also
provides additional assurance that shippers claiming organic status and utilizing the grade standards for organic
fruit qualify to do so. 
Under Florida law, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services licenses independent third parties
to act as certifying agents. Growers who intend to sell organic fruit make an application to a certifying agent. The
certifying agent inspects and certifies a grower's acreage as being in accordance with Florida law and issues the
grower a certificate. The certificate number is transferred to a trip ticket which accompanies any shipments of fruit
grown on the certified acreage. When the handler receives the shipment, a copy of the trip ticket is provided to the
state inspector indicating that the fruit is certified organic and can be packed using the applicable organic grade
standards. 
The committee also recommended that  905.146 be revised to require Special Purpose Shippers to certify that
they will limit their shipments of organically grown citrus fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruits.
The interim final rule replaced the requirement that only outlets registered and approved by the committee could
receive such fruit and ended the requirement that receivers of special purpose shipments complete the applicable
sections of the Report of Special Purpose Shipments form.

The language in   905.146, 905.147, 905.148 concerning Certificates of Privilege is being revised for
clarity, and procedural safeguards are being added to  905.147(c) dealing with suspensions or denials of Certificates
of Privilege. 
This rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revised exemption provisions
for special purpose shipments, as specified. The Department's view is that this rule may have a beneficial impact
on growers and shippers of organic citrus fruit. 
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements
that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have
been assigned OMB number 0581-0094. This action will reduce the reporting burden on approximately 95 receivers
of special purpose shipments of Florida citrus completing a section of the Report of Special Purpose Shipments form,
taking about .04 hour to complete each report. 
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available
information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the 

Federal Register

 [59 FR 26927, May 25, 1994] will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Termination of Provisions of Marketing Orders 907, 908, and 910; Navel and Valencia Oranges Grown in Arizona and Designated
Parts of California; Lemons Grown in California and Arizona 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Termination order. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document terminates the Federal marketing orders regulating the handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown
in Arizona and designated parts of California and lemons grown in California and Arizona. The Secretary of Agriculture
has found that these marketing orders no longer tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937. In a press release issued on May 16, 1994, the Department of Agriculture announced the intention
to terminate the orders for California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia oranges, and lemons, noting the division
and turmoil in the industry and that the programs are not functioning as they should.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This action is governed by the provisions of section 608c(16)(A) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937,
as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 


Marketing Order Nos. 907 and 908 [7 CFR Parts 907 and 908], as amended, regulate the handling of navel and Valencia oranges
grown in Arizona and designated parts of California. Marketing Order No. 910 [7 CFR Part 910], as amended, regulates
the handling of lemons grown in California and Arizona. 
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This termination order has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
of the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges, 125 handlers of Valencia oranges, and 70 handlers of lemons
who were subject to regulation under the respective marketing orders and there are approximately 3,750 producers
of navel oranges, 3,700 producers of Valencia oranges, and 2,000 producers of lemons in the regulated areas. Small
agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having
annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia oranges,
and lemons may be classified as small entities. 
Marketing Order No. 907 has been in effect since 1953, Marketing Order No. 908 since 1954, and Marketing Order 
No. 910 since 1958. When order authorities were utilized, the orders provided for the establishment of weekly volume
regulation and size requirements. In addition, the marketing orders authorized marketing research and development
and provided for reporting and recordkeeping requirements for affected handlers.

This action terminates the provisions of the marketing orders regulating the handling of navel and Valencia oranges
grown in Arizona and designated parts of California and lemons grown in California and Arizona. 
On May 16, 1994, the Deputy Secretary announced in a press release that it was the Department's intention to terminate
the marketing orders for California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia oranges, and lemons. The decision noted the
division and turmoil in the industry surrounding the California-Arizona citrus orders. The press release stated
that there is a clear indication that the programs are not working as they should. 
The California-Arizona citrus orders have been marked by industry divisiveness and widespread order violations.
In an effort to reach a satisfactory resolution of industry differences, the Secretary suspended the weekly volume
regulation provisions of the orange orders on June 18, 1993, and invited the industry to submit proposed amendments
to the orders that could achieve the program objectives. After a year, serious differences remain, with no apparent
consensus among the industry. Instead, the orders themselves are contributing to the divisiveness in the industry
and are working to the detriment of growers, packers, and consumers. 
Therefore, based on the above considerations, pursuant to section 8c(16)(A) of the Act and  907.83,  908.83,
and  910.84 of the respective marketing orders, it is found that 7 CFR Parts 907, 908, and 910 no longer tend to
effectuate the declared policy of the Act, and they are hereby terminated. 
Section 8c(16)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary to notify Congress 60 days in advance of the termination of a Federal
marketing order. Congress was so notified on May 16, 1994, and the termination of Marketing Orders Nos. 907, 908, and
910 shall become effective on August 26, 1994. 
Based on the unanimous recommendations of the Navel Orange Administrative Committee (NOAC), the Valencia Orange
Administrative Committee (VOAC), and the Lemon Administrative Committee (LAC), the Secretary has determined that
Alvin Freisen (VOAC chairperson), and all five members of the joint executive committee for the NOAC and the VOAC,
will serve as trustees for the NOAC and the VOAC and that all six members of the executive committee of the LAC (including
alternates) will serve as trustees for the LAC in order to oversee the administrative affairs of the respective orders.

The trustees will be responsible for completing the orders' unfinished business, including ensuring termination
of all outstanding agreements and contracts, and the payment of all obligations. The trustees will be responsible
for safeguarding program assets, holding committee records, and arranging for a financial audit to be conducted.
All such actions by the trustees are subject to the approval of the Secretary. Those designated as trustees for the
NOAC and VOAC are Ms. Darlene V. Ohnemus (VOAC and NOAC member), Mr. Robert O. Bream (NOAC member), Mr. Christopher
R. Frame (NOAC chairperson), Mr. William E. Slattery (VOAC member), Mr. David R. Giller (VOAC member), and Mr. Alvin
Friesen (VOAC chairperson). Those designated as trustees for the LAC are Mr. Solon J. Boydston (LAC member), Ms. Darlene
V. Ohnemus (LAC member), Mr. David R. Giller (LAC member), Mr. Alvin Friesen (LAC member), Mr. Charles R. Bell (LAC
member), and Mr. Christopher R. Frame (LAC member). The trustees shall continue in their capacity until discharged
by the Secretary. 
The remainder of the reserves, after immediate expenses are paid, will be held by the trustees to be used to cover unforeseen,
outstanding expenses obligated by the committees. 
It is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest
to give preliminary notice or to engage in further public procedure prior to putting this action into effect and that
good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication because: (1)
Growers and handlers are aware of this action since notice was given to Congress and the termination was announced
in a press release issued by the Secretary on May 16, 1994; (2) this action relieves restrictions on handlers by terminating
the requirements of the marketing orders regulating the handling of California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia
oranges, and lemons; and (3) no useful purpose would be served by delaying this action. 
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Tokay Grapes Grown in San Joaquin County, CA; Expenses and Assessment Rate for 1994-95 Fiscal Year 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without changes, the provisions of the interim
final rule which authorized expenses and established an assessment rate for the Tokay Grape Industry Committee (Committee)
under Marketing Order No. 926 for the 1994-95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables the Committee
to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer this program. Funds to administer this program
are derived from assessments on handlers.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 926 [7 CFR Part 926] regulating the handling of Tokay
grapes grown in San Joaquin County, California. The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, Tokay grapes grown in California are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate
specified herein will be applicable to all assessable Tokay grapes handled during the 1994-95 fiscal year,
beginning April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 3 handlers of Tokay grapes regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately
15 Tokay grape producers in San Joaquin County, California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the
Small Business Administration [13 CFR  121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and
small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
The Tokay grape marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular
fiscal year apply to all assessable grapes handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are
prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted
to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are grape handlers and producers. They are familiar with
the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus,
all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. 
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of grapes. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. 
The Committee met on April 29, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenditures of $5,150 with an assessment
rate of $0.07 per carton for the 1994-95 fiscal year. In comparison, the expenditure amount and the assessment
rate are remaining unchanged from the 1993-94 fiscal year. 
Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year, estimated at $4,500, will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. 
An interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 [59 FR 30872, June 16, 1994] and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act. 
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994-95 fiscal year for the program began April 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate
of assessment apply to all assessable grapes handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this
action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action
as a final rule without change.

Expenses and Assessment Rate for the 1994-95 Fiscal Year; Winter Pears Grown in Oregon, Washington, and California



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenses and establishes an assessment rate for the Winter Pear Control Committee
(Committee) under Marketing Order No. 927 for the 1994-95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables
the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer
the program are derived from assessments on handlers.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 927 [7 CFR Part 927] regulating the handling
of winter pears grown in Oregon, Washington, and California. The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, winter pears grown in Oregon, Washington, and California are subject to assessments.
It is intended that the assessment rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable pears handled during
the 1994-95 fiscal year, which began July 1, 1994, and ends June 30, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt
any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 90 handlers of winter pears regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately
1,850 winter pear producers in Oregon, Washington, and California. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration 
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified
as small entities. 
The Oregon, Washington, and California winter pear marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that
the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable winter pears handled from the beginning of
such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration
of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and
producers of Oregon, Washington, and California winter pears. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with
the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate
budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons
have an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of pears. Because this rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. 
The Committee met on June 3, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $6,835,926 for the 1994-95
fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993-94 fiscal year expense amount was $6,933,615, which is $97,689 more than
the amount recommended for the current fiscal year. 
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.43 per standard box, or equivalent for winter
pears. The Committee did not recommend a supplemental assessment rate for Anjou variety pears this fiscal year. In
comparison, the 1993-94 winter pear assessment rate was $0.45 per standard box, or equivalent and $0.04 for
the supplemental assessment rate on Anjou variety pears. This represents a $0.02 decrease in the assessment rate
recommended for this fiscal year. 
This rate, when applied to anticipated winter pear shipments of 13,817,000 boxes or equivalent, will yield a total
of $5,941,310 in assessment income. Assessment income, along with $401,324 from other income sources, and $493,292
from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. The $493,292 withdrawal of
funds from the Committee's authorized reserve will result in no reserve remaining at the end of the 
1994-95 fiscal period. 
Major expense categories for the 1994-95 fiscal year include $5,572,500 for advertising, $276,340 for SOPP
data research, $276,340 for winter pear improvement, $142,310 for salaries and benefits, and $612,442 for unshared
contingency. 
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal year for the Committee began July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable winter pears handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers are aware of this
action which was recommended by the Committee at public meetings and which is similar to budgets issued in past years;
and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this action.

Expenses and Assessment Rate for the 1994-95 Fiscal Year for the Marketing Order Covering Cranberries Grown
in States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington,
and Long Island in the State of New York 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final authorizes expenses and establishes an assessment rate for the Cranberry Marketing Committee
(Committee) under Marketing Order No. 929 for the 1994-95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables
the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer
this program are derived from assessments on handlers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 929 
[7 CFR Part 929], as amended, regulating the handling of cranberries grown in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order''. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act''. 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, cranberries grown in 10 states are subject to assessments. It is intended that the
assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable cranberries during the 1994-95 fiscal
year beginning September 1, 1994, through August 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local
laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 30 handlers of cranberries grown in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey,
Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York who are subject to regulation
under the cranberry marketing order and approximately 1,050 producers of cranberries in the regulated area. Small
agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual
receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are
less than $5,000,000. The majority of cranberry producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. 

The cranberry marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular
fiscal year apply to all assessable cranberries handled from the beginning of such year. The budget of expenses for
the 1994-95 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this
marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers of cranberries.
They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area
and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of cranberries. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce
sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The recommended budget and rate of assessment are usually
acted upon by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore,
the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its expenses.


The Committee conducted a mail vote and unanimously recommended 1994-95 marketing order expenses of $164,690
and an assessment rate of $0.03 per 100-pound barrel of cranberries. In comparison, 1993-94 budgeted expenses
were $155,000, with an approved assessment rate of $0.03 per 
100-pound barrel of cranberries. This represents an increase of $9,690 in expenses recommended for this fiscal year,
with the assessment rate remaining unchanged. 

Assessment income for 1994-95 is estimated to total $122,580 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments
of 
4,086,000 barrels of cranberries. The assessment income, plus $3,750 in interest income and a withdrawal of $38,360
from the Committee's authorized reserve fund will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at
the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year are estimated to be 
$150,000. The reserve fund will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. 

Major expense categories for the 1994-95 fiscal year include $70,110 for operating expenses, $40,500 for travel
expenses, and $33,241 for administrative expenses. 

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available
information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the 1994-95 fiscal year begins September 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable cranberries handled during the fiscal year; and 
(3) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this action.

Filberts/Hazelnuts Grown In Oregon and Washington; Establishment of Interim Final and Final Free and Restricted
Percentages for the 1993-94 Marketing Year 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule establishing interim final and final free and restricted percentages for domestic inshell filberts/hazelnuts
for the 1993-94 marketing year under the Federal marketing order for filberts/hazelnuts grown in Oregon and
Washington. The percentages allocate the amounts of domestically produced filberts/hazelnuts which may be marketed
in domestic, export and other outlets. The percentages are intended to stabilize the supply of domestic inshell filberts/hazelnuts
in order to meet the limited domestic demand for such filberts/hazelnuts and provide reasonable returns to producers.
This rule was recommended by the Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Board (Board), which is the agency responsible for local
administration of the order.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 982 [7 CFR Part 982], both as amended, regulating
the handling of filberts/hazelnuts grown in Oregon and Washington. This order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 


The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is intended that this action apply
to all merchantable filberts/hazelnuts handled during the 1993-94 marketing year. This rule will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 1,000 producers of filberts/hazelnuts in the production area and approximately 25 handlers
subject to regulation under the marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business
Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service
firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of handlers and producers
of filberts/hazelnuts may be classified as small entities. 

The Board's recommendation and this rule are based on requirements specified in the order. This rule finalizes an
interim final rule which established the amount of inshell filberts/hazelnuts that can be marketed in domestic markets.
The domestic outlets for this commodity are characterized by limited demand, and interim final and final free and
restricted percentages benefit the industry by promoting stronger marketing conditions and stabilizing prices
and supplies, thus improving grower returns. 

The interim final rule was issued on February 18, 1994, and published in the 

Federal Register

 [59 FR 9068, February 25, 1994], with an effective date of February 25, 1994. That rule added  982.242 to the rules
and regulations in effect under the order. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended March 28, 1994. 

One comment was received, from the United States Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy (SBA).
The SBA's comment alleged that the Department should have undertaken an analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act and should have sought public comment prior to placing the interim rule in effect. The comment by SBA fails to consider
the distinct characteristics of the filbert program. 

Under this marketing order, there are permanent regulations that authorize a market allocation program for filberts
and that specify exactly how the free and restricted percentages should be established and revised. Those provisions
were adopted after a formal rulemaking hearing, a process that allows for a full presentation of all economic and operational
evidence not only in written form, but also through oral testimony under oath and subject to cross-examination. The
process additionally permits further briefing and exceptions based on this record of exhibits and testimony. Hence,
there has been extensive economic analysis and public participation in the rulemaking adopting the market allocation
program and specifying the market allocation calculation procedures. 

Each year the marketing order Board meets and considers a marketing policy for the coming year, including the activation
of the market allocation program and the projected trade demand (as calculated under the specifications in the permanent
regulations). The Board represents the entire filbert industry and brings to its deliberations the highest level
of experience and expertise. The Board conducts open meetings and receives input of an economic nature from all interested
persons. The Secretary's representatives are in attendance at such meetings and freely interact to gather any necessary
economic or operational information. In addition, the Board is continually gathering economic data from a number
of sources for its deliberations and for submission to the Secretary. At several points during the season, the Board
holds further open meetings to update or revise the market allocation program for the year. 

In view of this unique and comprehensive system, the Department believes it is sufficiently knowledgeable to make
a Regulatory Flexibility Act certification without any further studies or reports. In addition, there has been ample
opportunity for public participation both in the formal rulemaking process that created the detailed market allocation
program formula being applied herein, as well as thereafter to assure the Secretary that there has been no misapplication.
Finally, it should be noted that the specific action commented-on is an interim rule which relieved restrictions
by releasing the full free percentage immediately on February 25 rather than waiting until late May as may be provided
under the order. This relaxation was effectuated only 10 days after the last date for marketing policy revisions and
seeking further prior public participation would have significantly temporally diluted the value of this relief
to the industry. Hence, the alternative championed by SBA would have maintained for a longer time more restrictive
trade controls on small handlers.

Therefore, for the reasons stated, the above comment in opposition to the interim final rule is denied. 


The Board is required to meet prior to September 20 of each marketing year to compute an inshell trade demand and preliminary
free and restricted percentages, if the use of volume regulation is recommended during the season. The order prescribes
formulas for computing the inshell trade demand, as well as preliminary, interim final, and final percentages. The
inshell trade demand establishes the amount of inshell filberts/hazelnuts the market can utilize throughout the
season, and the percentages release the volume of filberts/hazelnuts necessary to meet the inshell trade demand.
The preliminary percentages provide for the release of 80 percent of the inshell trade demand. The interim final percentages
release 100 percent of the inshell trade demand. The inshell trade demand equals the average of the preceding three
``normal'' years' trade acquisitions of inshell filberts/hazelnuts, rounded to the nearest whole number. The Board
may increase such estimate by no more than 25 percent, if market conditions warrant an increase. The final free and
restricted percentages release an additional 15 percent of the average of the preceding three years' trade acquisitions
of inshell filberts/hazelnuts for desirable carryout. 
 


The preliminary free and restricted percentages make available portions of the filbert/hazelnut crop which may
be marketed in domestic inshell markets (free) and exported, shelled, or otherwise disposed of (restricted) early
in the 1993-94 season. The preliminary free percentage is expressed as a percentage of the total supply subject
to regulation and is based on preliminary crop estimates. The majority of domestic inshell filberts/hazelnuts are
marketed in October, November, and December. By November, the marketing season is well under way. 
 


At its August 26, 1993, meeting, the Board announced preliminary free and restricted percentages of 7 percent and
93 percent, respectively, to release 80 percent of the inshell trade demand. The purpose of releasing only 
80 percent of the inshell trade demand under the preliminary percentage is to guard against underestimates of crop
size. The preliminary restricted percentage is 100 percent minus the free percentage. 
 


On or before November 15, the Board must meet again to recommend interim final percentages and final percentages.
The Board uses current crop estimates to calculate the interim final and final percentages. The interim final percentages
are calculated in the same way as the preliminary percentages and release 100 percent of the inshell trade demand previously
computed by the Board for the marketing year. Final free and restricted percentages release an additional 15 percent
of the average of the preceding three years' trade acquisitions to ensure an adequate carryover into the following
season. The final free and restricted percentages must be effective at least 30 days prior to the end of the marketing
year (July 1 through June 30), or earlier, if recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary. In addition, revisions
in the marketing policy can be made until February 15 of each marketing year. 
 


In accordance with order provisions, the Board met on November 10, 1993, reviewed and approved an amended marketing
policy and recommended the establishment of interim final and final free and restricted percentages. Interim final
percentages were recommended at 12 percent free and 88 percent restricted, and final free and restricted percentages
were recommended at 13 percent and 87 percent. The interim final percentages made an additional 807 tons of product
available for the domestic inshell market. The interim final marketing percentages were based on the industry's
final production estimates and released 3,903 tons to the domestic inshell market from the 1993 crop. The final marketing
percentages released an additional 605 tons from the 1993 crop for domestic use. Thus, a total of 4,508 tons of product
was available from the 1993 crop for domestic use when the final percentages were established. The Oregon Agricultural
Statistics Service provided an early estimate of 39,000 tons total production for the Oregon and Washington area.
However, a handler survey conducted by the Board provided a more current estimate of 37,700 tons total production
for the area. Therefore, the Board voted to unanimously accept the more current estimate of 37,700 tons. 

Although the crop is large, the Board determined that the inshell domestic market conditions would allow more product
without depressing the market and recommended immediate release of the additional 15 percent (the final percentages).
The Board believed that the immediate release of the final percentages would benefit the industry with increased
returns to growers and more product available for consumers.

The marketing policy of the marketing order states that the final percentages must be effective at least 30 days prior
to the end of the marketing year, or earlier. The Board recommended immediate release of the final percentages, in
accordance with the authority of the marketing policy. The marketing policy also requires that procedurally, the
Board recommend interim final and final percentages. Therefore, the interim final percentages were established
even though they would not be utilized this marketing season. 
The marketing percentages were based on the Board's production estimates and the following supply and demand information
for the 1993-94 marketing year: 






 

In addition to complying with the provisions of the marketing order, the Board also considers the Department's 1982
``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' (Guidelines) when making its computations
in the marketing policy. This volume control regulation provides a method to collectively limit the supply of inshell
filberts/hazelnuts available for sale in domestic markets. The Guidelines provide that this primary market have
available a quantity equal to 110 percent of recent years' sales in those outlets before secondary market allocations
are approved. This provides for plentiful supplies for consumers and for market expansion while retaining the mechanism
for dealing with oversupply situations. An additional increase of 20 percent (807 tons) was included in the calculations
used in determining the inshell trade demand. The established final percentages make available 4,508 tons from the
1993 crop plus 937 tons of declared carryin which is 135 percent of prior years' sales, thus exceeding the goal of the
Guidelines. 
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the Board,
and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the 

Federal Register

 [59 FR 9068, February 25, 1994] will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Spearmint Oil Produced in the Far West; Revision of the Salable Quantity and Allotment Percentage for ``Class 3''
Native Spearmint Oil for the 1994-95 Marketing Year 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule increases the quantity of ``Class 3'' (Native) spearmint oil produced in the Far West that
handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers during the 1994-95 marketing year. This rule was recommended
by the Spearmint Oil Administrative Committee (Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of
the marketing order for spearmint oil produced in the Far West. The Committee recommended this rule to avoid extreme
fluctuations in supplies and prices and thus help to maintain stability in the Far West spearmint oil market. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 985 [7 CFR Part 985], regulating the handling of spearmint oil produced
in the Far West (Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and designated parts of California, Nevada, Montana, and Utah), hereinafter
referred to as the ``order.'' This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing
order now in effect, salable quantities and allotment percentages may be established for classes of spearmint oil
produced in the Far West. This rule increases the quantity of Class 3 spearmint oil produced in the Far West that may
be purchased from or handled for producers by handlers during the 1994-95 marketing year, which ends on May 31,
1995. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are eight spearmint oil handlers subject to regulation under the order and approximately 260 producers of spearmint
oil in the regulated production area. Of the 260 producers, approximately 145 producers hold ``Class 3'' (Native)
spearmint oil allotment base, and approximately 160 producers hold ``Class 1'' (Scotch) spearmint oil allotment
base. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as
those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and producers of Far West spearmint oil may be classified
as small entities. 
The Far West spearmint oil industry is characterized by producers whose farming operations generally involve more
than one commodity and whose income from farming operations are not exclusively dependent on the production of spearmint
oil. The U.S. production of spearmint oil is concentrated in the Far West, primarily Washington, Idaho, and Oregon
(part of the area covered by the order). Spearmint oil is also produced in the Midwest. The production area covered
by the order normally accounts for 75 percent of the annual U.S. production of spearmint oil. 
This rule increases the quantity of Native spearmint oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers
during the 1994-95 marketing year, which ends on May 31, 1995. This rule increases the salable quantity from
897,388 pounds to 1,092,577 pounds and the allotment percentage from 46 percent to 56 percent for Native spearmint
oil for the 1994-95 marketing year. 
The salable quantity is the total quantity of each class of oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers
during a marketing year. The salable quantity calculated by the Committee is based on the estimated trade. The total
salable quantity is divided by the total industry allotment base to determine an allotment percentage. Each producer
is allotted a share of the salable quantity by applying the allotment percentage to the producer's allotment base
for the applicable class of spearmint oil. 
The initial salable quantity and allotment percentages for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils for the 1994-95
marketing year were recommended by the Committee at its October 6, 1993, meeting. For both Native and Scotch spearmint
oils, the Committee recommended salable quantities of 897,388 pounds and 723,326 pounds, and allotment percentages
of 46 percent and 41 percent, respectively. 
A proposed rule incorporating the Committee's October 6, 1993, recommendation was published in the December 21,
1993, issue of the 

Federal Register

 [58 FR 67378]. Comments on the proposed rule were solicited from interested persons until January 20, 1994. No comments
were received. Accordingly, based upon analysis of available information, a final rule establishing the Committee's
recommendation as the salable quantities and allotment percentages for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils for
the 1994-95 marketing year was published in the March 16, 1994, issue of the 

Federal Register

 [59 FR 12151]. 
Pursuant to authority contained in sections 985.50, 985.51, and 985.52 of the order, the Committee unanimously recommended
at its June 14, 1994, teleconference meeting that the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint
oil for the 1994-95 marketing year be increased. The Committee recommended that the Native spearmint oil salable
quantity be increased from 897,388 pounds to 1,092,577 pounds. Based on a revised total allotment base of 1,951,032
pounds, the allotment percentage is increased from 46 to 56 percent which results in a 195,189 pound increase in the
salable quantity.

In making this recommendation the Committee considered all available information on supply and demand. As of June
14, 1994, the Committee reports that of the 1994-95 Native spearmint oil salable quantity of 897,388 pounds,
78,787 pounds remained available for handling. Handlers have indicated, however, that demand may approximate 200,000
pounds of Native spearmint oil for the remainder of this marketing year. This level of demand was not anticipated by
the Committee when it made its initial recommendation for the establishment of a salable quantity and allotment percentage
for Native spearmint oil for the 1994-95 marketing year. 

The recommended salable quantity of 1,092,577 pounds of Native spearmint oil (an increase of 195,189 pounds), combined
with the actual June 1, 1994, carry-in of 21,125 pounds, results in a revised 1994-95 available supply of 1,113,702
pounds. This available supply is approximately 30,000 pounds higher than the annual average of sales for the past
five years. The Committee anticipates that foreseeable demand will be adequately met with the recommended increase.

The Committee did not recommend an increase in the available supply of Scotch spearmint oil since it is anticipated
that there will be a surplus supply of this type of oil by the end of the 1994-95 marketing year. 

The Department, based on its analysis of available information, has determined that an allotment percentage of 56
percent should be established for Native spearmint oil for the 1994-95 marketing year. This percentage will
provide an increased salable quantity of 1,092,577 pounds of Native spearmint oil.
 
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including that contained in the prior proposed and final rules
in connection with the establishment of the salable quantities and allotment percentages for Native and Scotch spearmint
oils for the 1994-95 marketing year, the Committee's recommendation and other available information, it is
found that to revise section 985.213 [59 FR 12151] to change the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native
spearmint oil, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists
for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) This interim final rule increases the quantity of Native spearmint oil that may be marketed immediately;
(2) Handlers and producers should be apprised as soon as possible of the salable quantity and allotment percentage
of Native spearmint oil contained in this interim final rule; and (3) This rule provides a 30-day comment period and
any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Removal of an Exemption for Raisins Produced in Southern California
and Exported to Mexico 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises the administrative rules and regulations established under the Federal marketing order
for raisins produced from grapes grown in California. It removes a provision that currently exempts raisins produced
from grapes dried on the vine in southern California and exported to Mexico from all marketing order requirements.
This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), which is responsible
for local administration of the order. Elimination of the exemption will facilitate administration and improve
enforcement efforts. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989], both as amended, regulating
the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This action will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing
order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of producers
and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. 

This final rule removes a provision that exempts raisins produced from grapes dried on the vine in southern California
and exported to Mexico in natural condition from all marketing order requirements. It is based on a unanimous recommendation
of the Committee and other available information. 

Section 989.60 of the order provides that the Committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, rules and
procedures to exempt from regulations raisins produced in southern California (i.e., the counties of Riverside,
Imperial, San Bernardino, Ventura, Orange, Los Angeles, and San Diego) and disposed of for distillation, livestock
feed, or by export in natural condition to Mexico. 

Paragraph (b) of section 989.160 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations (7 CFR 989.102-989.176)
currently exempts raisins produced from grapes dried on the vine in those southern California counties, which are
disposed of for use in distillation, livestock feed, or by export in natural condition to Mexico, from all marketing
order requirements. This final rule eliminates the exemption that applies to those raisins exported in natural condition
to Mexico.

When that exemption provision was established in the early 1970's, the quantities of raisins exported to Mexico were
relatively small and were of off-grade quality. It was determined at that time that the export exemption would not
interfere with order regulations or with accomplishing program objectives. 

Diminished demand in recent years for off-grade raisins and raisin residual material for distillation in California
has made export in natural condition to Mexico a relatively lucrative market. The Committee has confirmed reports
that large volumes of poor quality raisins, including lots as large as forty to fifty thousand pounds, have been exported
into Mexico from southern California and other areas of California. This is a significant departure from the situation
which existed when the exemption was first implemented. Raisins from areas which are not exempt from the provisions
of the order appear to be passing into Mexico in violation of the regulations. 

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has effected the removal of import duties and license requirements,
opening the Mexican market to raisins which meet the quality requirements of the order. Hence, there is now an opportunity
to build an export market in Mexico for high quality raisins. The Committee believes that all raisins eligible for
export to Mexico need to be subject to the quality requirements of the order. The Committee also believes that the regulation
of such raisins is essential to meeting program objectives and improving compliance efforts. 

On the basis of this information, the Committee, on April 16, 1994, unanimously recommended the removal of the exemption
that applies to raisins produced from grapes dried on the vine in southern California and exported in natural condition
to Mexico. 

Notice of this action was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 15, 1994 [59 FR 36093]. The proposed rule provided a 15-day comment period which ended August 1, 1994. No comments
were received. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation
and other information, it is found that the issuance of this final rule, will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date
of this final rule until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The 1994-95 crop year began August 1, 1994, and the final rule should cover as much of the crop year
as possible to accomplish program objectives and improve compliance efforts; (2) handlers are aware of this action
which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting; and (3) the proposed rule provided a 15-day
comment period, and no comments were received.

Milk in the Chicago Regional Marketing Area; Revision of Rule



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
action: 

Revision of rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This document temporarily revises the supply plant shipping standards under the Chicago Regional order for the month
of September 1994. Shipping percentages for individual supply plants and units of supply plants are reduced to 1 percent
and 4 percent, respectively, for the month of September. The action is necessary to prevent uneconomic and inefficient
movements of milk to qualify plants for pooling. A proposed reduction for the month of August was found to be not necessary.

supplementary information: 

Prior document in this proceeding: 



Notice of Proposed Temporary Revision: Issued July 11, 1994; published July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36094).

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to
have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 

The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling.

This revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions
of  1030.7(b)(5) of the Chicago Regional milk order.

Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 36094) concerning a proposed temporary relaxation of the supply plant shipping percentages under the Chicago
Regional milk order. The revisions were proposed to be effective for the months of August and September 1994. The public
was afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting written data, views and arguments by
July 22, 1994.

Two comments supporting the proposed revision for the month of September were received. The comments agreed that
the degree of adjustment that the order allows the market administrator to make in supply plant shipping requirements
would be sufficient for the month of August. No opposing comments were received.

Statement of Consideration



For the month of September 1994 this rule revises from 5 percent to 1 percent the requirements of the Chicago Regional
order that pool supply plants ship to distributing plants a minimum percentage of receipts. For a unit of supply plants,
the action reduces the required shipping percentage from 10 percent of the supply plants' receipts to 4 percent. A
proposed revision for the month of August is found to be unnecessary because the order authorizes the market administrator
to reduce the supply plant shipping percentages to a great enough degree to meet current market needs. The degree to
which the market administrator is authorized to revise shipping requirements is, however, not great enough to meet
the needs of the market for September.

The temporary revision was requested by Central Milk Producers Cooperative (CMPC), a federation of cooperative
associations that represent a substantial number of the producers who supply the market. CMPC contends that a reduction
of the shipping percentages is necessary to prevent uneconomic shipments of milk from distant supply plants solely
for pooling purposes.

CMPC originally requested that the required supply plant shipping percentages be eliminated for September for both
individual supply plants and supply plant units. After having the opportunity to see data for further months, however,
the cooperative federation stated that the revision originally requested would be excessive in view of recent increases
in production over the volume CMPC had projected and recent increased demand for milk for manufacturing uses. CMPC
therefore recommended that the proposed reduction be modified to establish shipping standards of 1 percent for individual
supply plants and 4 percent for units. Dean Foods, a large fluid milk handler regulated under the Chicago Regional
order, supported CMPC's request for September.

In view of the supply/demand relationship for the market the supply plant shipping percentages should be reduced
for September 1994. A reduction of the shipping percentages will contribute to orderly marketing in that costly and
inefficient shipments of milk from distant supply plants will not be necessary. Thus, dairy farmers who have supplied
the market will continue to have their milk pooled under the order.

The revision needed for September is greater than the market administrator is authorized to accomplish under the
order. Therefore, it must be effectuated by the Director of the Dairy Division.

After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal set forth in the aforesaid notice, and other
available information, it is hereby found and determined that the pool supply plant shipping percentage set forth
in  1030.7(b) should be reduced for the month of September to 1 percent of individual supply plant receipts and
4 percent of supply plant unit receipts.

It is hereby found and determined that 30 days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest in that:

(a) This revision is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to maintain orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area for the month of September;

(b) This revision does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and

(c) Notice of the proposed revision was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written
data, views, or arguments concerning this revision.

Two comments supporting the proposed revision were received, with no comments opposing.

Therefore, good cause exists for making this revision effective less than 30 days from the date of publication in the


Federal Register.

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is adopting without modification an interim final rule amending the Cotton
Board Rules and Regulations to allow for the continuation of collections on renumbered imported cotton-containing
products as long as no change in the product's Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) description occurs. Since renumbering
of products by the U.S. Customs Service occurs rather frequently, providing for a continuation of assessment collection
will prevent unnecessary and costly interruptions of the program.

Regulatory Impact 


This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file
suit in court. Under Section 12 of the Act, any person subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating
that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance
with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity
for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the
District Court of the United States in any district in which the person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place
of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling, provided a complaint is filed within 20 days from
the date of the entry or the ruling.

There are an estimated 10,000 importers who are presently subject to rules and regulations issued pursuant to the
Cotton Research and Promotion Order 7 U.S.C. 2101-2118. This rule will affect importers of cotton and products
containing cotton. The majority of these importers are small businesses under the criteria established by the Small
Business Administration. This rule will help ensure the uninterrupted collection of assessments on products already
subject to assessment. 



Economic Impact 



The AMS Administrator has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR part 1320) which implement the Paperwork
Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) the information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained
in this subpart have been previously approved by OMB and assigned control number 0581-0093. 



Background 



In July of 1992, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) finalized rules and regulations for the authority to collect
assessments on cotton and cotton-containing products as authorized in the 1990 Farm Bill. In order to designate specific
imported products subject to assessment, AMS published, within the implementing regulations, a table of approximately
700 HTS numbers and individual assessment rates for each. Collections began on August 1, 1992. Soon after, the Department
of Commerce changed certain HTS numbers that USDA had identified as subject to the assessment. During the first 17
months of import assessments, AMS has found that the Department of Commerce may revise HTS numbers as a result of presidential
proclamation, congressional actions, statistical tracking requirements, etc. Often, these changed numbers are
merely replacements of previous numbers and have no impact on the physical properties, description or cotton content
of the product it represents. 

The U.S. Customs Service informed USDA prior to the publishing of this rule that several HTS numbers listed in the Import
Assessment Table contained in 7 CFR 1205.510 would no longer be valid as of January 1, 1994, because of recent statistical
changes made by the Department of Commerce. These statistical changes to the HTS numbers were made for reasons associated
with the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 

In order to collect cotton research and promotion assessments on imported products containing cotton, HTS numbers
listed in the Assessment Table in 7 CFR 1205.510 must correspond to numbers listed in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.
USDA has found that frequent rulemaking is necessary in order to maintain an up-to-date list of HTS numbers in the regulations
which provide the U.S. Customs Service the authority to collect cotton research and promotion assessments on imported
cotton and products containing cotton. 

Changes made to HTS numbers during calendar year 1993 have resulted in reduced collections by U.S. Customs under the
import assessment program averaging over $30,000 per month. 

USDA has reason to believe that changes in HTS numbering and the resulting impact on the Cotton Research and Promotion
Program will continue. U.S. international trade agreements such as NAFTA, GATT, and changes in most favored nation
trading status for certain textile producing countries will, according to the U.S. Customs Service, generate changes
in HTS headings on a continuing basis. The Cotton Research and Promotion Program would in this environment experience
an unpredictable loss of revenue. 

With the number and frequency of HTS number changes USDA expects, updating the list of HTS numbers through rulemaking
is an impractical solution to minimizing interruptions in assessment collections. Therefore, this rule provides
for the continued collection of assessments when HTS numbers are changed so long as such changes have no impact on the
physical properties, description, or cotton content of the products involved. 

It is important to note that Commerce does renumber HTS headings where an actual change in the product occurs. This
rule would not address this type of renumbering. USDA will continue to suspend assessments in these situations until
the cotton content and a revised assessment rate could be determined and the assessment table revised. 

Based on discussions with importers and U.S. Customs Service officials, USDA has determined that the import community
supports continuing to pay assessments on products when numbers have changed but the product remains the same. In
fact, suspending collections on HTS headings that undergo mere renumbering is causing confusion for importers and
Customs. Customs officials have informed USDA that they can program their automated computer collection system
to continue collecting assessments when HTS headings undergo renumbering. 

On July 1, 1994, at 59 FR 33901, AMS published an interim final rule amending 7 CFR Part 1205 to allow for the continuation
of collections on renumbered imported cotton-containing products as long as no change in the product's Harmonized
Tariff Schedule (HTS) description occurs. The rule was published with a request for comments to be submitted by August
1, 1994. AMS received no comments pertaining to the interim final during the specified comment period. Therefore,
this rule adopts the interim final rule without change.

Potato Research and Promotion Plan; Amendments of the Rules and Regulations to Permit Changes in the Size of the Administrative
Committee




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule provides the National Potato Promotion Board (Board) the flexibility to change the number
of producer members on the Administrative Committee to reflect changes in potato production in the United States
through amendment of the Board's bylaws, with the Secretary's approval, updates the address of the Board's office,
and revises the Harmonized Tariff Schedule code number for imported potato starch for human consumption. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under the Potato Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) [7 CFR Part 1207]. The Plan is
authorized by the Potato Research and Promotion Act, as amended [7 U.S.C. 2611-2627], hereinafter referred
to as the Act. 


This rule is exempt from Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
311 of the Act, a person subject to a plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such plan, any provision
of such plan or any obligation imposed in connection with such plan is not in accordance with law; and requesting a modification
of the plan or an exemption from the plan. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States
in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided that a complaint is filed within 20 days after the date of entry of
the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
There are an estimated 2,000 handlers, 6,000 producers, 80 importers of potatoes and potato products for human consumption,
and 25 importers of seed potatoes who are subject to the provisions of the Plan. The majority of these persons may be
classified as small agricultural producers and small agricultural service firms. Small agricultural producers
are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5 million. The majority
of potato handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.

The National Potato Promotion Board (Board) administers a national program of research, development, advertising,
and promotion designed to strengthen potatoes' competitive position and to maintain and expand domestic and foreign
markets for potatoes and potato products. The program is financed by assessments on producers of 5 or more acres of
potatoes (collected by the first handler) and on all imported fresh or processed potatoes for human consumption and
seed potatoes (collected by the U.S. Customs Service). There are currently 103 members on the Board: 100 producers,
2 importers, and a public member. 
Due to the large size of the Board, the Plan authorizes the Board to appoint an Administrative Committee which has the
authority to conduct Board business on the Board's behalf. As currently set forth in paragraph (a) of section 1207.507
of the rules and regulations issued under the Plan, the Board is authorized to appoint up to 27 members to the Administrative
Committee which includes 25 producer members, 1 importer member, and the public member. Producer membership on the
Administrative Committee is allocated among six regions established in the Board's bylaws on the percentage of U.S.
potato production in each region. 
Since the six regions were established in 1972, potato production in the U.S. has increased and shifted to the extent
that the number of producer members in each region is no longer representative of the percentage of production in each
region. 
At its March 20, 1993, annual meeting, the Board directed its Long-Range Planning Subcommittee to study the increase
and shifts in potato production to determine whether or not producer member allocation by region was equitable and
to recommend corrective action the following year. 
Using data from the Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistical Service, the subcommittee determined
that, based on the percentage of U.S. potato production, some regions were under-represented and other regions were
over-represented on the Administrative Committee. The subcommittee also determined that if the 25 producer members
on the Administrative Committee were apportioned based on current production, some regions would lose representation
disproportionately to the decrease in production in that region. Therefore, at the Administrative Committee's
January 12, 1994, meeting, the subcommittee presented to the Administrative Committee four proposals for the Administrative
Committee's consideration. The Administrative Committee approved a proposal to add 5 producer members to the Administrative
Committee and to reallocate the 30 producer members to reflect, as closely as possible, the percentage of U.S. potato
production in each region. The proposal approved by the Administrative Committee for presentation to the full Board
would increase the total number of Administrative Committee members from 27 to 32 (30 producer members, 1 importer
member, and the public member) and would reallocate the 30 producer members among the regions as follows: Northwest,
from 8 members to 13; North Central, from 5 members to 6; Northeast, from 5 members to 4; Southwest, from 3 members to
2; South Central, from 2 members to 3; and Southeast, 2 members (no change). 
This recommendation was presented to and approved by the full Board at the Board's annual meeting on March 18, 1994.
The Board approved an amendment to Article VI, Section 1 of the Board's bylaws, which sets forth the allocation of Administrative
Committee members, and recommended amending paragraph (a) of section 1207.507 of the Plan's rules and regulations,
which sets forth the number of members and composition of the Administrative Committee. 
While the Board, with the Secretary's concurrence, may amend its bylaws to reflect changes to the regional boundaries
and allocation of the producer members, paragraph (a) of section 1207.507 of the rules and regulations issued under
the Plan must be amended to change the number of Board members who may serve on the Administrative Committee. However,
U.S. potato production and the distribution of that production among the states is subject to future change which
would affect producer representation on the Administrative Committee. Therefore, in order to provide more flexibility
to the Board in adjusting the size of its Administrative Committee based on current production trends and, at the same
time, eliminate unnecessary rulemaking, this rule amends paragraph (a) of section 1207.507 to provide that the number
of producer members on the Administrative Committee be as set forth in the Board's bylaws. 
This action also revises section 1207.501 of the rules and regulations to reflect the Board's current place of business.

In addition, the Committee for Statistical Annotation of Tariff Schedules of the International Trade Commission,
at the request of the Department, has revised the statistical reporting requirements for imported potato starch.
As a result, Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) code numbers which differentiate between imported potato starch for
human consumption and imported potato starch for other uses have been established. Paragraph (b)(3) of section 1207.510
provides the HTS categories and assessment rates on imported tablestock potatoes and frozen or processed potatoes
for ultimate consumption by humans and on imported seed potatoes. The Act provides the authority for the Board to assess
only those potatoes and potato products intended for human consumption and for use as seed. Because the tariff schedule
did not provide a statistical breakout to identify product intended for different uses, the present HTS code number
in this section identifying potato starch does not differentiate between the above uses. As a result, it is possible
that assessments on potato starch not intended for human consumption are being collected by the U.S. Customs Service
on the Board's behalf. Amending this section to list the correct HTS code for potato starch for human consumption will
eliminate the need for importers to request a refund from the Board of assessments that might be erroneously collected
by Customs on the Board's behalf. Therefore, this rule also amends paragraph (b)(3) of section 1207.510 to reflect
the new HTS code number identifying potato starch for human consumption. 
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this rule would not have a significant
economic effect on a substantial number of small entities.

Pursuant to the provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary,
and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good
cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) This action formalizes the Department's approval of amendments to the Board's bylaws which were approved
by the full Board and makes other amendments to the rules and regulations that ensure effective administration of
the Act; (2) a 30-day period is provided to allow interested parties to comment prior to finalization; and (3) no useful

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action approves a revision to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) to include revisions to the Texas Air
Control Board, part III, chapter 101, 

General Rules

, 
section 101.10, 

Emission Inventory Requirements

. These revisions are for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within
the ozone nonattainment areas. The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal requirements
for an emission statement program as part of the SIP for Texas. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



Background


The air quality planning and State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport
areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act''). EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA
intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone
transport areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation
of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''),
and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO

x

 Supplement to the General Preamble'')). 
EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed
in this document, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The
Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify part 40 of the CFR to reflect the requirements of the emission
statement program. 
Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out
requirements applicable in Marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c),
(d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph
(3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements showing
actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO

x

). This paragraph provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992, establishing
this emission statement program. Whatever minimum reporting level is established in a State emission statement
program, if either VOC or NO

x

 is emitted at or above the designated level, the other pollutant should be included in the emission statement, even
if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs.
The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the State within three years after November
15, 1990, and annually thereafter. EPA requests that the States submit the emission data to EPA through the Aerometric
Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emission statement data should include: Certification of data
accuracy; source identification information; operating schedule; emissions information (to include annual and
typical ozone season day emissions); control equipment information; and process data. EPA developed emission statements
data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements. This consistency is essential
to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all EPA reporting
requirements.
In addition to the submission of the emission statement data to AIRS, States should provide EPA with a status report
that outlines the degree of compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should
report quarterly to EPA the total number of sources affected by the emission statement provisions, the number that
have complied with the provisions, and the number that have not. This status report should also include the total annual
and typical ozone season day emissions from all reporting sources, both corrected and non-corrected for rule-effectiveness
(RE). States should include in their status report a list of sources that are delinquent in submitting their emission
statement and that emit 500 tons per year (tpy) or more of VOC or 2500 tpy or more of NO

x

. This report should be a quarterly submittal until all the regulated sources have complied for the reporting year.
Suggested submittal dates for the quarterly status reports are July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. 



Analysis of State Submission


1. Procedural Background


The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement
program will become a part. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State
must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.

1

 Section 110(l) similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the CAAA
must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.





EPA must at the outset determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action
(see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within
60 days of receiving a submission. However, under section 110(k)(1)(B), a submittal is deemed complete by operation
of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA 6 months after receipt of the submission.
The State passed the revisions to the TACB General Rules, 101, by repealing the existing section 101.10 and replacing
it with a new section 101.10 on August 20, 1992. The State submitted the revision to public hearing on April 19, 1992.
The rule was submitted to EPA on October 15, 1992, by the Governor, as a proposed revision to the SIP. 
The October 15, 1992, SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance
with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991).
The submittal was found to be complete and a letter dated 
January 15, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to
be taken in the review process. The provisions of the regulations are outlined under the analysis of the State's submission
below.
On September 1, 1993, the TACB merged with the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC) and is now called the Office of Air Quality within the TNRCC. The merger did not abrogate, void,
or rescind any rules, regulations, Orders, permits, or any other action previously taken by the former TACB.


2. Components of Emission Statement Program


There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the State must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for
reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability,
definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below.



A. SIP Revision Submission. Required within 2 years of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) (November
15, 1990). 
B. Program Elements. The State emission statement program must, at a minimum, include provisions covering applicability
of the regulations, definitions for key terms used in the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered
by the regulations, and the specific reporting requirements for sources. The emission statement submitted by the
source should contain, at a minimum, a certification that the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the
individual certifying the statement, source identification information, operating information, process rate
data, control equipment information, and emissions information. These elements are described in greater detail
in section D of this document. EPA recommends that the State program require the submission of the data from the sources
no later than April 15 of each year to insure that the State can meet the July 1 deadline for the submission of data into
AIRS each year. The guidance document prepared by EPA provides a draft model State rule which can be used as the basis
for the States to develop their program. The guidance document also provides suggested language for the specific
program elements. 
C. Sources Covered. Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone
require emission statement data from sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) or oxides of nitrogen (NO

x

) in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of the classification
(Marginal, Moderate, etc.). 

 

The States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for classes or categories of sources
with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO

x

 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories
and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP-42)
or other methods acceptable to EPA. States should get clearance from the appropriate EPA Regional Office to waive
the emission statement requirement for these smaller sources. 
D. Reporting Requirements for Sources. The State of Texas requires facilities to report on an emissions inventory
questionnaire supplied by the State. Sources covered by the State emission statement program should submit, at a
minimum, the following data elements:

 

1. Source identification information.
2. Operating information.
3. Process rate data.
4. Control equipment information.
5. Emissions information.



3. Review of the State's Emission Statement Regulations.


A. Applicability


The applicability of the regulation to ozone nonattainment areas is documented in subsection (a) and (a)(1). The
rule states that the owner or operator of the following stationary sources in the State of Texas or on waters that extend
25 miles from the shoreline shall submit emissions inventories to the Texas Air Control Board (TACB) on forms or other
media approved by the TACB: a major facility/stationary source, as defined in Section 101.1 of this title (relating
to definitions), and any stationary source in an ozone nonattainment area emitting a minimum of 10 tons per year (tpy)
volatile organic compounds (VOC), 25 tpy nitrogen oxides (NOx), or 100 tpy carbon monoxide (CO). 


B. Types of Inventories


There are two types of inventories identified in the regulation which are pertinent to emission statements. They
are an initial emissions inventory and an ozone nonattainment area inventory.
The requirement for initial emissions inventories is documented in subsection (b)(1). Stationary sources, as identified
in subsection (a) of Section 101.10 shall submit an initial emissions inventory (IEI) for any criteria pollutant
or hazardous air pollutant that has not been identified in a previous inventory. The IEI shall consist of actual emissions
of VOC, NO

x

, CO, sulfur dioxide (SO

2

), lead (Pb), and particulate matter of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM

10

) from stationary sources and emissions of all hazardous air pollutants identified in the FCAA, Section 112(b). For
purposes of this section, the term ``actual emission'' is the actual rate of emissions of a pollutant from an emissions
unit for the calendar year or seasonal period. Actual emission estimates must also include excess emissions occurring
during maintenance, start-ups, shut-downs, upsets, and downtime to parallel the documentation of these events
in the emissions inventory and must follow emissions calculations identified in subsection (c) of section 101.10.
The requirement for ozone nonattainment areas inventories is documented in subsection (b)(3). This subsection
requires stationary sources in ozone nonattainment areas emitting a minimum of 10 TPY of VOC, 25 TPY of NO

x

, or 100 TPY of CO to submit an annual inventory. The inventory shall consist of actual annual emissions and typical
weekday emissions that occur during the summer months. 


C. Minimum Data Requirements


The data requirements include a certifying statement, facility identification information, operating information,
process rate data, control equipment information, and emissions information. 
The certifying statement is documented in subsection (d). 
A statement is required from the owner or operator to accompany the emission inventory certifying that the information
is true and accurate to the best knowledge of the certifying official. The certification will include the name, title,
signature, date of signature, and telephone number of the certifying official. 
The data requirements are contained in the questionnaire used by the State to gather emission statement data. The
questionnaire is required from all facilities which must report emission statement data. A copy of the questionnaire
and instructions for completion is contained in the Technical Support Document (TSD). Source data elements required
by Texas through the questionnaire sent by the State to the facilities are:



1. Facility identification information. 


a. Full name, physical location, and mailing address of facility. 
b. Latitude and Longitude. 
c. SIC code(s).

 
2. Operating information. 


a. Percentage annual throughput by season. 
b. Days per week during the normal operating schedule. 
c. Hours per day during the normal operating schedule. 
d. Hours per year during the normal operating schedule. 



3. Process rate data. 
 

a. Annual process rate (annual throughput). 
 b. Peak ozone season daily process rate (in nonattainment areas. 



4. Control equipment information. 
 

a. Current primary and secondary AIRS Facility System (AIRS) control equipment identification codes. 
 b. Current control equipment efficiency (percent). 



5. Emissions information. 
 

a. Estimated actual VOC and/or NO

x

 emissions at the segment level, in tpy for an annual emission rate and pounds per day for a typical ozone season day (defined
as the average or typical operating day during the peak ozone season). The instructions for completion of the questionnaire
require that if either VOC or NO

x

 is emitted at or above the designated level, the other pollutant must be included in the emission statement, even if
it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs. Actual emission estimates must include upsets, downtime, and
fugitive emissions, and must follow an emission estimation method. Emissions will be reported as one number. 
 b. AFS estimated emissions method code. 
 c. Emission factor (if emissions were calculated using an emissions factor). 


D. Calculations


Calculations of emissions are documented in subsection (c). The subsection specifies that actual measurement with
continuous monitoring systems (CEMS) is the preferred method of calculating emissions from a point source. Other
means of determining actual emissions may be utilized if CEMS data is not available in accordance with detailed instructions
from the Emissions Inventory Division of the TACB.


E. Reporting Requirements 


The reporting requirements are documented in subsection (e). The reporting deadline for the 1992 ozone nonattainment
area is 
March 31, 1993. Subsequent emission statements are due on 
March 31 of each year and will contain data for the previous year. 


F. Enforcement


The enforcement requirements are documented in 
subsection (f). The State of Texas has included language in its regulation that permits the State to enforce the provisions
of the regulation under all pertinent State enforcement authorities.
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the
enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from

J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541 (April 16, 1992) (``Review
of State Implementation Plans and Revisions for Enforceability and Legal Sufficiency'')). SIP provisions must
also contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section
110(a)(2)(C)). 
The analysis of the Texas regulation shows that it adequately addresses all components of an emission statement program.
In addition, the State has agreed to provide the EPA with emission statement data for the EPA AIRS through the State
grants process and to provide quarterly status reports.



Final Action 


In today's action, the EPA is granting final approval of the Texas emission statement program as submitted. The EPA
is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and
anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this FR publication, the EPA is proposing to approve
the SIP revision should adverse comments be received. Thus, this action will be effective October 25, 1994 unless,
by September 26, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.
If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document
which will withdraw the final action. All public comments will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on
this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties
interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no comments are received, the public is advised
that this action will be effective October 25, 1994. 
The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments of November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those
requirements. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 


Regulatory process


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, 
part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.
Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have
a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship
under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic
reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Union Electric Co.

 v. 

U.S. E.P.A.

, 
427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S. Ct. 1976; 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)).
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 25, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time
within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action.
This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. 



Executive Order 12866


This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from 
Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general
public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table Two and Table Three
SIP revisions 
(54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section three of 
Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table Two and Table Three
SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request.
This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On July 8, 1994, (59 FR 35044) the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approved a revision to the
Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. The action approved a request by Indiana to redesignate the following
ozone nonattainment areas: St. Joseph and Elkhart, Vanderburgh, and Marion Counties to attainment of the National
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. The USEPA also approved the State's maintenance plan for these counties.
The USEPA is withdrawing this final rule due to the adverse comments received on these actions. In a subsequent final
rule USEPA will summarize and respond to the comments received and announce final rulemaking action on this requested
Indiana SIP 
revision and redesignation.

Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals,
and Other Non-Profit Organizations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim final rule will adopt for the Department of the Interior, standards which will be imposed on grantees
covered by the revised Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements
for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations.''



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

OMB Circular A-110 covers both grants made by Federal agencies and subgrants made by States to nongovernmental
organizations.



Agencies were required to adopt those standards which would be imposed on grantees in codified regulations within
six months after publication in the 

Federal Register

.

Over 200 comments were received by OMB from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, professional organizations,
and others in response to the notice published on August 27, 1992 (57 FR 39018) requesting comments on proposed revisions.
The comments were considered in developing the final version. Consequently, this rule is published as an interim
final rule because of the previous request for comment process used in the development of the Circular, the large number
of comments already received and considered by OMB and the Federal agencies, and due to the limited flexibility to
revise the rule provided by OMB.

This interim final rule essentially adopts all the language in the Circular with two exceptions. At Section 12.904,
language has been added to describe the procedure for handling requests for class deviations and case-by-case exceptions.
At Section 12.915, the Department is including a term and condition concerning use of the metric system of measurement.

The Department is revising 43 CFR part 12, by adding subpart F to implement these requirements.



Public Participation



The policy of the Department of the Interior, is whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments, suggestions or objections
regarding the interim final rule to the location identified in this preamble.



Executive Order 12866, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Regulatory Flexibility Act



This interim final rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866.

The Department has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities because it does not affect the amount of funds provided in the covered programs, but rather modifies
and updates administrative and procedural requirements. This interim final rule does not contain a collection of
information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).



Environmental Effects



The Department has determined that this rule does not constitute a major Federal action having a significant impact
on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.



Executive Order No. 12778



The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that this proposed rule meets the applicable standards
provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

(2) services performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients, and other payees; and,

(3) other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance is required.



Accrued income

 means the sum of:

(1) earnings during a given period from:

(i) services performed by the recipient, and

(ii) goods and other tangible property delivered to purchasers, and

and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts, and Cooperative Agreements.''



Suspension

 means an action by a Federal awarding agency that temporarily withdraws Federal sponsorship under an award, pending
corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to terminate the award by the Federal awarding agency. Suspension
of an award is a separate action from suspension under the Department of the Interior regulations implementing E.O.'s
12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' See Subpart D of 43 CFR part 12.



Termination

 means the cancellation of Federal sponsorship, in whole or in part, under an agreement at any time prior to the date

Unrecovered indirect cost

 means the difference between the amount awarded and the amount that could have been awarded under the recipient's
approved negotiated indirect cost rate.



Working capital advance

 means a procedure whereby funds are advanced to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for a given
initial period.



 12.903


Effect on other issuances.



For awards subject to this subpart, all administrative requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals,
handbooks and other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart shall
be superseded, except to the extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with the deviations
provision in section 12.904.



 12.904


Deviations.



The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), may grant exceptions for classes of grants or recipients subject to the
requirements of this subpart when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in the interest of maximum uniformity,
exceptions from the requirements of this subpart shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. Federal awarding
agencies may apply more restrictive requirements to a class of recipients when approved by OMB. All requests for class
deviations shall be processed through the Assistant Secretary_Policy, Management, and Budget. Federal awarding
agencies may apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for statutory requirements.
Exceptions on a case-by-case basis may also be made by Federal awarding agencies. Bureau/office application of less
restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for statutory requirements as well as exceptions on
a case-by-case basis, will be approved by designated officials identified in bureau/office procedures.



 12.905


Subawards.



Unless sections of this subpart specifically exclude subrecipients from coverage, the provisions of this subpart
shall be applied to subrecipients performing work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher
education, hospitals, or other non-profit organizations. State and local government subrecipients are subject
to the provisions of regulations implementing the grants management common rule, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements
for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,'' 43 CFR part 12.



Pre-Award Requirements



 12.910


Purpose.



Sections 12.911 through 12.917 prescribe forms and instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying
for Federal awards.



 12.911


Pre-award policies.



(a) 

Use of Grants and Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts.

 In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative
agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs the use
of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal
purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.
The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial
involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying
out the activity contemplated in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition
of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.

(b) 

Public Notice and Priority Setting.

 Federal awarding agencies shall notify the public of their funding priorities for discretionary grant programs,
unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute.

 12.912

Forms for applying for Federal assistance.


(a) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320,
``Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public,'' with regard to all forms used by the Federal awarding agency in place
of or as a supplement to the Standard Form 424 (SF-424) series.
(b) Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and instructions prescribed by the Federal awarding
agency.
(c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' the applicant
shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF-424 (Application for Federal Assistance) indicating whether
the application was subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for
a particular State can be obtained from the Federal awarding agency or the 

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance

. The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State
for review.
(d) Federal awarding agencies that do not use the SF-424 form will indicate whether the application is subject
to review by the State under E.O. 12372.


 12.913

Debarment and suspension.


Federal awarding agencies and recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common
rule implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension,'' Subpart D of 43 CFR part 12. This common rule
restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from
or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance program or activities.


 12.914

Special award conditions.


(a) Federal awarding agencies may impose additional requirements as needed, if an applicant or recipient:
(1) Has a history of poor performance,
(2) Is not financially stable,
(3) Has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this part,
(4) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or
(5) Is not otherwise responsible.
(b) Additional requirements may only be imposed provided that the applicant or recipient is notified in writing as
to:
(1) The nature of the additional requirements;
(2) The reason why the additional requirements are being imposed;
(3) The nature of the corrective action needed;
(4) The time allowed for completing the corrective actions; and
(5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed.
(c) Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been corrected.


 12.915

Metric system of measurement.


The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the
metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency
to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies will follow the provisions of
E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.'' When applicable, the awarding agency shall request
that measurement-sensitive information to be included as part of the application be expressed in metric units. When
required by the awarding agency for grants to recipients, the following term and condition will be incorporated into
the grant:


Provision


All progress and final reports, other reports, or publications produced under this award shall employ the metric
system of measurement. However, the recipient may use non-metric measurements to the extent that the recipient has
supporting documentation that the use of metric measurements is impracticable or is likely to cause significant
inefficiencies or loss of markets to the recipient, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products
in non-metric units.


End of Provision


 12.916

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.


Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a political subdivision
of a State that is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with Section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference
be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified
in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247-254). Accordingly,
State and local institutions of higher education and hospitals that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal
funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products
pursuant to the EPA guidelines.


 12.917

Certifications and representations.


Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal awarding agency is authorized and encouraged
to allow recipients to submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive order, or regulation
on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications
and representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance
with the pertinent requirements.


Post-Award Requirements


Financial and Program Management


 12.920

Purpose of financial and program management.


Sections 12.921 through 12.928 prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making payments,
and rules for: satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for program income, budget revision
approvals, making audits, determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.

 12.921

Standards for financial management systems.


(a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate financial data to performance data and develop
unit cost information whenever practical.
(b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following.
(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program
in accordance with the reporting requirement set forth in Section 12.952. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting
on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall
not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop accrual data for their reports
on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.
(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income and interest.
(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property, and other assets. Recipients shall adequately
safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.
(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should
be related to performance and unit cost data.
(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs.''
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.
(7) Accounting records, including cost accounting records, that are supported by source documentation.
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal
awarding agency at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements
of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.
(d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient
coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.
(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above in Section 12.921 (c) & (d), the bonds shall be obtained
from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety
Companies Doing Business with the United States.''


 12.922

Payment.


(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury
and the issuance of redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of
State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR part 205.
(b) (1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain or
demonstrate:
(i) written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient,
and
(ii) financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in
Section 12.921.
(2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the
actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share
of any allowable indirect costs.
(c) Whenever possible, advances will be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal
awarding agency to the recipient.

(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.

(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR Part 205.

(3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic
fund transfers are not used.

(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,''
or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to
the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal
awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.

(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. Federal
awarding agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction
project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes
a minor portion of the project.

(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt
of the billing, unless the billing is improper.

(2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit a request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers
are not used.

(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that
reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency
may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance
cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's
disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements.
The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely
advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned
on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges
made by recipients at any time during the project period unless paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply:

(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements; or

(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129,
``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable
notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until
the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.

(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are
as follows.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, Federal awarding agencies shall not require
separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories
for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure
of funds.
(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.
(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients are encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least
50 percent by women or minority group members).
(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (h) (1),
(2) or (3) apply:
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.
(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances.
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources.
(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient
for administrative expense. In keeping with Electric Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR part 206), interest should be
remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electric medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients
who do not have this capability should use a check. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA as it pertains
to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay preaward costs for discretionary awards without
prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this subpart, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.
(1) SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement.'' Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270
as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs where electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods
are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in
lieu of the SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.''
(2) SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.'' Each Federal awarding
agency shall adopt the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction
programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines
that it provided adequate information to meet Federal needs.


 12.923 

Cost sharing or matching.


(a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing
or matching when the contributions meet all of the following criteria.
(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00042 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00014 </PARENT>

(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.

(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.

(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.

(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used
for cost sharing or matching.

(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency.

(7) Conform to other provisions of this subpart, as applicable.

(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the
Federal awarding agency.

(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities
acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the
lesser of paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section:

(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the
time of donation.

(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency
may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value
at the time of donation to the project.

(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid.

(f) Donated supplies may include such items as office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies.
Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not
exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.

(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings, and land for which
title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph (1) or (2) of this section
apply:

(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient to acquire equipment, buildings, or land, the total value
of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00014 </PARENT>

(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings, or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved
the charges.

(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications.

(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed their fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient.

(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition
at the time of donation.

(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.

(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value.

(i) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third
parties.

(1) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient
for its own employees.

(2) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall
be documented.



 12.924 

Program income.



(a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards in this section in requiring recipient organization to account
for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained
by the recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award,
shall be used in one or more of the following ways:

(1) added to funds committed to the project or program by the Federal awarding agency and recipient and used to further
eligible project or program objectives;

(2) used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program; or

(3) deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs upon which the
Federal share of costs is based.

(c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be use in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this
section.

(d) If the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program
income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except
research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically unless the
awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award or the recipient is subject
to special award conditions, as indicated in Section 12.924.

(e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients
shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.

(f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident
to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these
costs have not been charged to the award.

(g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards
(See Sections 12.930 through 12.937).

(h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients
shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties
for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However,
Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or
research award.



 12.925 

Revision of budget and program plans.



(a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It may
include either the Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon Federal awarding agency
requirements. It shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.

(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget
and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.

(c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for one
or more of the following program or budget related reasons.

(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring
prior written approval).

(2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award document.

(3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved
project director or principal investigator.

(4) The need for additional Federal funding.

(5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval
is required by the Federal awarding agency.

(6) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance
with OMB Circular A-21, ``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular A-122,
``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 74 Appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs
Applicable to Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 48 CFR part 31, ``Contract
Cost Principles and Procedures,'' as applicable.

(7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.

(8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved award, the subaward, transfer or contracting out
of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment, or general
support services.

(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by
OMB.

(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, Federal Awarding agencies are
authorized, at their option to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this subpart
and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more
of the following:

(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the
Federal awarding agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Federal awarding agency
is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award
is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).

(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the conditions
listed below apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing, with
the supporting reasons and revised expiration date, at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award.
This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. The conditions
that prevent issuance of a one-time extension are:

(i) the terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension;

(ii) the extension requires additional Federal funds; or

(iii) the extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.

(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods.

(4) For awards the support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's
regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e)(1) through (3) of this section are automatically
waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph
(e)(2) applies.

(f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or
programs, functions, and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the
cumulative amount of the transfer exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by
the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation
or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.

(g) No other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section
require prior approval.

(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies
for budget revisions whenever paragraph (h)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply:

(1) the revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00045 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) additional Federal funds are needed to complete the project; or
(3) the recipient requests a revision that involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements
may be imposed under Section 12.927.
(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items will be imposed unless OMB approves a deviation.
(j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction
work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval before making any fund or budget
transfers between the two types of work supported.
(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify
the Federal awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed
the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5,000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever
is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation
award.
(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application
unless the Federal awarding agency indicates that a letter of request suffices.
(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the Federal awarding agency
shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision
is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient
in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.


 12.926 

Non-Federal audits.


Certain recipients and subrecipients shall be subject to non-Federal audits in accordance with the applicable directive
from the table below.

Federal awarding agencies shall determine allowable costs in accordance with the type of entity incurring the costs,
using the appropriate directive from the table below.






 12.928 

Period of availability of funds.



Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations
incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal awarding agency.



Property Standards



 12.930 

Purpose of property standards.



Sections 12.931 through 12.937 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished
by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. The recipient may use its
own property management standards and procedures provided it observes the provisions of   12.931 through
12.937.



 12.931 

Insurance coverage.



Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired
with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless
required by the terms and conditions of the award.



 12.932 

Real property.



(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the awarding agency.

(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal awarding agency for the use of real property in other
federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose
of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e.,
awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the Department of the Interior.

(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor. The Federal awarding agency
shall give one or more of the following disposition instructions.

(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project.

(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and
pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the
Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any,
from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures
shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage
of the current fair market value of the property.



 12.933 

Federally-owned and exempt property.



(a) 

Federally-owned property.

 (1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually
to the Federal awarding an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody. Upon completion of the
award, or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Federal awarding agency
for further Federal utilization.

(2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to
the General Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the
property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C.
3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821,
``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions
shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency.

(b) 

Exempt property.

 When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with
Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Federal
awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should a Federal awarding agency
not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further
obligation to the Federal Government.



 12.934 

Equipment.



(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section.

(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside
organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.

(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient
shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:

(1) activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency, then

(2) activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.

(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall
be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government,
use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal
awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income.

(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Federal
awarding agency.

(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following.

(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.

(i) A description of the equipment.

(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification
number.

(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.

(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.

(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.

(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment
(not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).

(vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.

(viii) Unit acquisition cost.

(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current
fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.

(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.

(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.

(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.

(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.

(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established
which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient
may retain the equipment for other uses if compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor.
The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the
original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment,
the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency
shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within
that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the Federal
awarding agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. The Federal
awarding agency shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request
and the following procedures shall govern:

(1) If so instructed, or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's
request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an amount computed by applying
to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However,
the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever
is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.

(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal
Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost
of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping
or interim storage costs incurred.

(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient will be reimbursed by the Federal
awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.

(h) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party
named by the Federal Government when the third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. The transfer
shall be subject to the following standards.

(1) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise described to the recipient in writing.

(2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a
final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally owned equipment.
If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120-calendar-day period, the
recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate.

(3) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions
for federally owned equipment.



 12.935


Supplies and other expendable property.



(a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual
inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project
or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally sponsored project or program, the recipient shall
retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate
the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.

(b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations
for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal
statute, as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.



 12.936


Intangible property.



(a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was
purchased, under an award. The Federal awarding agency(ies) reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable
right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.

(b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide
regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations
and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''

(c) Unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, the Federal Government has the right to:

(1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award; and

(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data for Federal purposes.

(d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition
in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally authorized purpose, and the recipient
shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally
authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of Section
12.934(g).



 12.937


Property trust relationship.



Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds
shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property
was acquired or improved. Agencies may require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of record
to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition
conditions apply to the property.

Procurement Standards



 12.940

Purpose of procurement standards.



Sections 12.941 through 12.948 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are furnished to ensure that materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or
requirements shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, unless specifically required by
Federal statute or executive order or approved by OMB.



 12.941

Recipient responsibilities.



The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal awarding agency,
regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements
entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source
evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to
such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.



 12.942

Codes of conduct.



The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.



 12.943

Competition.



All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for the related procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose
bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other
factors considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill
in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the
recipient's interest to do so.



 12.944

Procurement procedures.



(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide, at a minimum,
that:

(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items. 

(2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most
economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government; and

(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following.

(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, the description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00051 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance
required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.

(iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items
are included in the solicitation.

(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in
the metric system of measurement.

(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.

(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal.

(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable.

(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.

(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration
and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.

(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used.

(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who posses the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources, and accessibility to other necessary
resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' implementation
of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' See Subpart D of 43 CFR part 12.

<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00052 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review of procurement
documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the
following conditions apply.
(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part.
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000)
and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.
(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.
(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement.
(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold.


 12.945

Cost and price analysis.


Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement
action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted,
market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element
of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability, and allowability.


 12.946

Procurement records.


Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following
at a minimum:
(a) Basis for contractor selection,
(b) justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained, and 
(c) basis for award cost or price.


 12.947

Contract administration.


A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions,
and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow-up of all purchases. Recipients shall
evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions,
and specifications of the contract.


 12.948

Contract provisions.


The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the provisions below
in all contracts and subcontracts.
(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements
of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest
is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified.
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.
(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.







(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.''






(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, the Comptroller General of the
United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers
and records of the contractor that are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations,
excerpts and transcriptions.


(e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement
provisions of Appendix A to this subpart, as applicable.






Reports and Records







 12.950

Purpose of reports and records.

Sections 12.951 through 12.953 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial
and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements.


 12.951 

Monitoring and reporting program performance.


(a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function, or activity
supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure that subrecipients have met the audit requirements
in Section 12.926.
(b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency of submission for performance reports. Except as provided
in  12.951(f), performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently
than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the end of the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual
reports shall be due 30 days after the end of the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual reports
before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. Final performance reports are
due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award.
(c) A final technical or performance report shall be required after completion of the project only if the awarding
agency determines this to be appropriate.
(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the
following:
(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs.
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.
(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high
unit costs.
(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency of developments that have a significant impact
on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse
conditions that materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include
a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.
(g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed.
(h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance
data from recipients.


 12.952 

Financial reporting.


(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information
from recipients.
(1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report.
(i) Each Federal awarding agency will require recipients to use either the SF-269 or SF-269A to report
the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the
option of not requiring the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement,
or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs,
except that a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF-270
is used only for advances.
(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal
awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on an
accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop accrual information
through best estimates based upon an analysis of the documentation on hand.
(iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or
program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not
be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the
completion of the agreement.

<TEXT>
 

(iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original
and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and
semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved
by the Federal awarding agency upon request by the recipient.

(2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions.

(i) When funds are advanced to recipients, the Federal awarding agency shall require each recipient to submit the
SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF-272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this
report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the
recipients.

(ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of
the report.

(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks''
section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations
of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.

(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF-272 15 calendar
days following the end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients
receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.

(v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following
reasons: 

(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that the advances are monitored through other
forms contained in this section;

(B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive
Federal advances; or

(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.

(b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall
be observed.

(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall
issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports.

(2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in
Section 12.921, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be upon written notice to the recipient
until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in obtaining this information,
shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.

(3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line item or any report if not necessary.

(4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format
or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.

(5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes
to the accuracy of reporting.



 12.953 

Retention and access requirements for records.




(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. Federal
awarding agencies shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients.

(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that
are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report. The
only exceptions are the following:

(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.

(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement
is not applicable to the recipient.
(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. as specified in paragraph 12.953(g).
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records.
(d) The Federal awarding agency will request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines
that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal
awarding agency may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint
use.
(e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers,
or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts,
transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's
personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph
are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.
(f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall place restrictions on recipients that limit public
access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate
that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency.
(g) 

Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc.

 Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records:
indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of
the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe
benefit rates).
(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits
to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year
retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of the submission.
(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the
subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation
purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records
starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.


Termination and Enforcement


 12.960 

Purpose of termination and enforcement.


Sections 12.961 and 12.962 set forth uniform suspension, termination and enforcement procedures.


 12.961 

Termination.


(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3) apply.
(1) By the Federal awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.
(2) By the Federal awarding agency with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon
the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to
be terminated.
(3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency written notification setting forth the reasons for
such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However,
if the Federal awarding determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the grant
will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety.
(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in  12.971(a), including
those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall
be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.

 12.962 

Enforcement.



(a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award,
whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the Federal awarding
agency may in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in Section 12.914, take one or more of the
following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.

(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement
action by the Federal awarding agency.

(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity
or action not in compliance.

(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.

(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.

(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.

(b) 

Hearings and appeals.

 In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal,
or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable
to the action involved.

(c) 

 Effects of suspension and termination.

 Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless the Federal awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension
or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary
and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section apply:

(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.

(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period
in which the termination takes effect.

(d) 

Relationship to debarment and suspension.

 The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient
from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding agency implementing
regulations (see 43 CFR Part 12).



After-the-Award Requirements



 12.970 

Purpose.



Sections 12.971 through 12.973 contain closeout procedures and other procedures for subsequent disallowances
and adjustments.



 12.971 

Closeout procedures.



(a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all financial, performance,
and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. The Federal awarding agency may approve extensions

under the award not later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion as specified in the
terms and conditions of the award or in agency implementing instructions.

(c) The Federal awarding agency shall make prompt payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under
the award being closed out.

Federal Government in accordance with Sections 12.931 through 12.937.

(g) If a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, the Federal awarding agency shall retain
the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting
from the final audit.



 23.972 

Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.



(a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following.

(a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled
under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If the recipient does not pay
within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, the Federal awarding agency may reduce the debt by:

(1) making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements;

(2) withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient; or

(3) taking other action permitted by statute.

<USDEPT>NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</USDEPT>





Testimony and Production of Official Records and Information 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Science Foundation.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule establishes procedures to be followed when a National Science Foundation (NSF) employee is issued
a court demand or is requested to provide testimony or produce records in a legal proceeding. These procedures are
designed to promote economy and efficiency in NSF's programs and operations, to minimize the possibility of involving
NSF in controversial issues not related to its functions, to maintain the impartiality of NSF among private litigants,
and to protect sensitive, confidential information and the deliberative process. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 8, 1994, NSF published proposed procedures to be followed when a National Science Foundation (NSF) employee
is issued a court demand or is requested to provide testimony or produce records in a legal proceeding. 59 FR 35079 (July
8, 1994). NSF received two comment letters, one from an individual who supported adoption of the procedures as proposed,
and the other from a university concerned that the definition of the term ``employee'' could be interpreted to include
university faculty who receive NSF awards and/or serve as peer reviewers on NSF panels. 


The term ``employee'' was not intended to cover investigators under NSF awards, and the definition has been revised
to make this explicit. However, the rule was intended to reach peer reviewers, but only as to matters directly relating
to their service for the Foundation. To the extent this was not clear in the proposed rule, Section 615.2 has been revised
to specifically provide that the rule's procedures do not apply to requests or demands for testimony by peer reviewers
that is directly related to their service as reviewers. 

In addition to these clarifications, the final rule includes the following four minor revisions: 


Section 615.2 Applicability 


The phrase ``while in leave status'' was deleted from this provision because only Government employees can be ``in
leave status'' but the provision is intended to apply to certain other individuals as well. 



Section 615.4 Legal Proceedings Before NSF or in Which the United States Is a Party 



This provision was revised to provide that the General Counsel will arrange for testimony of current employees for
the United States, rather than for the testimony of both past and current employees. 


Section 615.5 Legal Proceedings Between Private Litigants 


Subsection (a) was intended to prevent employees from producing official records and information or providing testimony
unless authorized to do so by the General Counsel. The proposed rule's inclusion of the phrase ``or by other applicable
law'' at the end of the subsection created uncertainty as to the intent of the subsection, and, as a result, was deleted.

Subsection (c) was revised to specifically provide that employees may testify as to any matter, if authorized to do
so by the General Counsel. 
I have determined that this proposed rule is not an economically significant rule as that term is defined in Executive
Order 12866. I have also determined that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities as that term is defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612,
because it would affect only the conduct of NSF activities and actions of NSF personnel. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b),
the rule is therefore exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses requirements of sections
603 and 604.

Paperwork Reduction Act


In the 

Third Memorandum Opinion and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 

in PP Docket No. 93-253, the Commission has amended 47 CFR Part 24 which contain rules and requirements governing
the award of narrowband PCS licenses through a system of competitive bidding. Applicants are required to file certain
information so that the Commission can determine whether the applicants are legally, technically, and financially
qualified to be licensed. Affected members of the public are any members of the public who want to become a narrowband
PCS licensee. Implementation of the rules contained in the 

Third Memorandum Opinion and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 

will impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements on certain members of the public. The Federal Communications
Commission will submit an information collection request to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3507. Persons wishing to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain,
Office of Management and Budget, Room 3225, New Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20503, (202) 395-3561.
For further information, contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 418-0210.

I. Introduction



1. By this action, we respond to petitions for reconsideration of the 

Third Report and Order 

in this proceeding.
 The 

Third Report and Order 

established service-specific rules for competitive bidding for the award of licenses for Personal Communications
Services in the 900 MHz band (narrowband PCS). Seven such petitions were received, as well as three oppositions and
comments and one reply.







2. On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Budget Act) added a new section 309(j) to the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151-173 (the Communications Act). This amendment to the Communications
Act gave the Commission express authority to employ competitive bidding procedures to choose from among mutually
exclusive applications for initial licenses. The Commission's 

Second Report and Order 

established general rules and procedures and a broad menu of competitive bidding methods to be used for all auctionable
services.






3. The 

Third Report and Order 

established competitive bidding rules for narrowband PCS. The Commission decided that because of the interdependence
within certain classes of narrowband PCS licenses and the relatively high expected value of such licenses, where
the agency received mutually exclusive applications most narrowband PCS licenses would be awarded through a sequence
of simultaneous multiple round auctions. However, we stated that we might alternatively use oral sequential or single
round sealed bidding to award certain narrowband PCS licenses if the operational complexity or administrative costs
associated with simultaneous auctions proved excessive relative to the expected value of the licenses to be awarded.
We stated that in conducting narrowband PCS auctions we would generally follow the payment and procedural rules adopted
in the 

Second Report and Order, 

and we adopted general procedural and processing rules for the narrowband PCS service based on Parts 22 and 90 of the
Commission's rules. We also structured our rules to provide opportunities for small businesses and businesses owned
by women and minorities to participate in the auction and in the provision of spectrum based services.

4. On July 29, 1994 we completed the first spectrum auction for the ten available nationwide narrowband PCS licenses.
This auction was the first test of the simultaneous multiple round auction design and of our provisions for designated
entities. This auction was enormously successful. One indication of the efficiency of the simultaneous multiple
round bidding process is the fact that the winning bids were either identical or virtually identical for virtually
identical licenses. As we expected, this auction also attracted broad participation by designated entities. Of
the 29 registered bidders 9, or 30 percent, indicated status as either minority or woman-owned firms. The strong bidding
competition among relatively large firms and incumbent paging companies, however, may have been a factor in the lack
of designated entities among the winning bidders. These results have caused us to reexamine some of the auction rules
and designated entity provisions previously adopted in the 

Third Report and Order. 

In addition, we request comment on a number of possible further changes in the designated entity provisions that might
apply to the upcoming MTA and BTA auctions.

II. Auction Design


A. Bidding Procedures


5. In the 

Third Report and Order, 

the Commission noted its earlier findings: (1) That licenses with strong value interdependencies should be auctioned
simultaneously, (2) that multiple round auctions will generally yield more efficient allocations of licenses and
higher revenues than other auction methodologies because they provide bidders with information regarding other
bidders' valuations of licenses, and (3) that simultaneous multiple round auctions become less cost effective as
the value of licenses decreases, because they are relatively time-consuming and expensive to implement.
 The Commission stated that where the licenses to be auctioned are interdependent and their value is expected to be
high, simultaneous multiple round auctions would best achieve the Commission's goals.
 We stated, however, that we might use methods other than simultaneous multiple round bidding in cases where license
values are expected to be relatively low, where bidder participation is expected to be limited, or where the interdependence
of licenses is less significant.
 We stated that in selecting the auction method for each narrowband PCS auction, we would balance the advantages of
more sophisticated auction methods, such as simultaneous multiple round bidding, with the greater complexity and
cost they might entail.








6. In the Third Report and Order 

the Commission decided to auction the 12.5 kHz unpaired MTA and BTA response channel licenses in a single round sealed
bid auction because the value of those licenses is low relative to the cost of conducting more complex auctions. We
also stated that because only incumbent paging licensees already serving the license area are eligible to bid on these
licenses, sealed bid auctions might help to reduce the likelihood of collusion. We further stated that information
about license values from earlier narrowband auctions would also be available to assist bidders in valuing these
licenses. Moreover, because under the sealed bid approach bidders cannot be certain that they will be the high bidder
on the licenses they seek to obtain, we allowed bidders to bid without risking a default penalty on more than the two
licenses in each service area, provided they specify in advance the order in which they wish to be awarded such licenses
if they are the high bidder on more than they are permitted to hold.





7. 

Petitions. 

Paging Network, Inc. (PageNet) and Tri-State Radio Co. (Tri-State) seek reconsideration of the decision to use single
round sealed bid auction procedures for assignment of the 12.5 kHz unpaired licenses.
 PageNet and Tri-State assert that the Commission has underestimated the likely value of the response channel licenses.
 PageNet and Tri-State also assert that great value interdependence exists among the response channel licenses.
 They state that there are likely to be numerous bidders for most licenses.
 In this regard, PageNet claims that collusive behavior is no more likely for these licenses than for other narrowband
PCS licenses. PageNet and Tri-State question whether bidders for response channel licenses will obtain useful information
about license values from previous narrowband PCS auctions. PageNet asserts that license values will vary from one
provider and area to another, and that bidders may have no realistic idea as to the value of the licenses.
 PageNet claims that the single sealed bid mechanism will require exorbitantly expensive market research on the part
of bidders, and the result will still depend on chance.
 Further, PageNet states that it is important to choose an auction method which provides useful information on license
values to bidders during the auction. Therefore, PageNet supports adopting an alternative auction method that is
streamlined to minimize cost and complexity, and recommends an ascending bid multiple round methodology.











8. Tri-State claims that the rules mandating single round sealed bidding are deficient from an auction design perspective.
Tri-State asserts that these rules are poorly structured to allow bidders to obtain a common frequency across regions,
and that under the rules bidders cannot know how to prioritize their bids. Tri-State further claims that the sealed
bidding procedures require exceedingly complicated bidding strategies, which necessitate the adoption of a clear
reallocation mechanism for defaulted licenses. Alternatively, Tri-State recommends a procedure in which bidders
submit sealed bids for a given MTA or BTA without specifying which of the available frequencies the bidder is bidding
on. Under Tri-State's recommended approach, winning bidders would be ranked for purposes of frequency selection
according to the total amount they bid for all the channels on which they hold winning bids. Tri-State claims that this
procedure maximizes the number of multiple MTA/BTA bidders who can obtain a common paging response channel in all
markets in which they bid.
 Tri-State argues that its proposed auction procedures will level the playing field between bidders for paging response
channels and those for regional and nationwide narrowband PCS authorizations, who do not need to aggregate a common
frequency across geographic areas.
 Tri-State includes a 25 percent bidding credit for minority- and female-owned businesses and small businesses,
and states that its plan could be refined by providing that winning bidders pay the highest losing bid for a license.
 Tri-State asserts that its proposed auction procedures will ensure that the Commission maximizes revenues from
paging response license auctions and allow bidders to set priorities more accurately and to adopt relatively simple
bidding strategies.
 AirTouch recommends multiple round simultaneous auctions, and suggests that bids for the response channels be in
pool form, such that the highest four bidders would receive a license and could agree among themselves as to the licenses
to be held by each.
 American Paging, Inc. (API) supports multiple-round ascending simultaneous bidding methodologies, at least for
the MTA response channel licensing.










9. 

Discussion. 

Petitioners have convinced us that paging response channel licenses may have more value interdependency, and higher
value, than was apparent at the time of the 

Third Report and Order. 

We also recognize that alternative auction methodologies proposed by petitioners may offer a low-cost auction method
with desirable characteristics for auctioning interdependent licenses, and thus may prove superior to the sealed
bid approach set forth in the 

Third Report and Order. 

In addition, the recent nationwide narrowband auction demonstrated that simultaneous multiple round auctions
are easier and less expensive to implement than we earlier anticipated, and thus they may prove to be an appropriate
procedure for auctioning the response channel licenses. However, we will defer our decision regarding the auction
design for the 12.5 kHz MTA and BTA paging response channels until we have gained further experience with simultaneous
multiple round auctions. We will announce our final choice of auction design and procedures for the response channels
by Public Notice prior to the auction.

B. Minimum Opening Bid


10. In the 

Third Report and Order, 

we stated that we believe it is necessary to impose a minimum bid increment to ensure that the auctions conclude within
a reasonable period of time in narrowband PCS auctions where simultaneous multiple round bidding is used. The bid
increment is the amount or percentage by which the bid must be raised above the previous round's high bid in order to
be accepted as a valid bid in the current round. We stated that we might impose a minimum bid increment of 5 percent or
$0.01 per MHz per pop, whichever is greater, in narrowband PCS auctions where multiple round bidding is used. We also
retained the discretion to vary the minimum bid increments for individual licenses or groups of licenses over the
course of an auction.







11. In order to expedite the auction process further, we also reserve the discretion to establish a suggested opening
bid or a minimum opening bid on each license in addition to the minimum bid increment.
 If we were to adopt minimum opening bids, we anticipate that we would seek expedited comments on any figures proposed.
Once a minimum bid is established for a license, initial bids will have to be above that level to be considered valid.
The amount of the suggested opening bid or the minimum opening bid, if one is used, will be set forth in the Public Notice
announcing the auction. Generally, we will establish suggested opening bids or minimum opening bids in the range
of $.03-$.20 per MHz-pop for each license.
 A suggested opening bid or minimum opening bid will provide bidders with an incentive to start bidding at a substantial
portion of the license value, thus ensuring a rapid conclusion to the auction.






C. Activity and Stopping Rules



12. In the 

Third Report and Order, 

we stated that when we use the three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rule, the auction will move from stage I to stage
II when, after three rounds of bidding, the high bid has changed on 5 percent or fewer of the licenses (measured in MHz-pops)
being auctioned. Stage III will begin when the high bid has changed on 2 percent or fewer licenses over three rounds.
 We conclude after our experience in conducting the nationwide narrowban auction that we may find it important to move
the auctions from one stage to the next at a different pace than would occur under this rule. Accordingly, we retain
the discretion to determine and announce during the course of an auction when, and if, to move from one auction stage
to the next, based on a variety of measures of bidder activity, (

e.g., 

the percentage of licenses on which there are new bids, the number of new bids, and the percentage increase in revenue).
Bidders will be notified at least one round prior to the commencement of the next stage of an auction.






13. We also stated that in stage III, a bidder would have to be active on 100 percent of the MHz-pops for which it wishes
to retain eligibility.
 In order to allow bidders greater flexibility, we think that it may be beneficial in some auctions to reduce this figure
slightly, but in no case below 90 percent. We will announce the required activity levels for stage III in a Public Notice
in advance of each auction.





14. In the 

Third Report and Order, 

we stated that where we use the Milgrom-Wilson activity rule we intend to use a simplified waiver procedure whereby
bidders will be permitted five automatic waivers from the activity rule during the course of an auction.
 A waiver permits a bidder to maintain its eligibility at the same level as in the round for which the waiver is submitted,
regardless of the bidder's level of bidding activity in that round. Subsequently, we have concluded based on our experience
in conducting the nationwide narrowband auction that fewer waivers may be necessary to maintain the pace of the auction
and prevent strategic use of waivers. Consequently, we will allow one automatic waiver from the activity rule during
each stage of an auction, or one automatic waiver during a number of bidding rounds specified in a Public Notice. We
retain the flexibility, however, to change by Public Notice the number of waivers that will be permitted and the frequency
with which they may be exercised by public notice prior to a specific narrowband auction. While we may allow bidders
to request proactive waivers that will keep the bidding open, under no circumstances will an automatic waiver prevent
an auction from closing.

15. In the 

Second Report and Order, 

we retained the discretion to declare by announcement at any point during a multiple round auction that the auction
will end after a specified number of additional rounds.
 We want to clarify however, that if this procedure is used, we will accept bids in the final rounds only for licenses
on which the highest bid increased in at least one of the preceding three rounds. No new bids will be accepted for other
licenses.
 There are two reasons not to take bids on licenses on which there has been no recent bidding. First, the fact that bidding
on an individual license may close will provide an additional incentive to bid actively and thus speed the conclusion
of the auction. If bids are accepted on all licenses in the final rounds there is less cost to a bidder in holding back.
Second, closing bidding on licenses for which activity has ceased ensures high bidders for those licenses that they
will not lose a license without having an opportunity to make a counter-offer.
 This reduces the uncertainty associated with aggregating licenses that are worth more to a particular bidder as a
package than individually. If final bids are accepted on all licenses, a high bidder on an aggregation of licenses
may unexpectedly lose a critical part of the aggregation and have no chance to regain it except in the post-auction
market, where bargaining or other transaction costs may be high.







D. Release of Bidder Information



16. We note that in the reconsideration of the 

Second Report and Order 

we reserved additional flexibility with respect to the requirement to release information concerning the identity
of bidders, which may affect auctions for narrowband PCS licenses. In the 

Second Memorandum Opinion and Order


 we reserved the option to release bidder identities on an auction-by-auction basis, and stated that we would announce
by Order and Public Notice prior to each auction whether the identities of bidders would be made public in that auction.
 In this regard, we retain the flexibility in the context of narrowband PCS auctions to determine on an auction-by-auction
basis whether or not to release bidder identities during the course of the auction.






E. Filing Procedures



17. 

Petition. 

Phase One asserts that the Communications Act permits the FCC to employ competitive bidding procedures only where
mutual exclusivity exists, and that consequently the FCC is prohibited from establishing specific auction dates
until it has determined that a particular application is mutually exclusive with another.
 Phase One states that the FCC must first notify each qualified applicant of its application processing status in advance
of scheduling auctions to allow applicants sufficient time to analyze auction strategies and evaluate the competition.
 Phase One also states that the FCC is obligated to suspend its auctions until each petition in PP Docket No. 93-253
has been addressed.
 Phase One states that our contractor, Tradewinds International, Inc. (Tradewinds) must be prevented from promoting
FCC auctions. Because there can be no auctions without mutual exclusivity, according to Phase One the advertising
by Tradewinds amounts to false and misleading advertising and raises conflict of interest questions because Tradewinds
may benefit if auctions are actually held.









18. AirTouch Paging (AirTouch) asserts in opposition that the Communications Act only prohibits auctioning of a
license for which no mutually exclusive applications have been accepted for filing, and not the establishment of
auction dates. In fact, AirTouch notes that mutually exclusive applications were received for each of the nationwide
narrowband PCS licenses.
 PacBell states that there is no legal basis for Phase One's argument that the Commission must delay announcing auction
dates until mutual exclusivity has been established.








19. 

Discussion. 

The Budget Act provides that if applications are not mutually exclusive no auction will be held.
 We have found, however, that it is important to begin planning for auctions as early as possible to assure that they
will run smoothly. To maintain an expeditious auctioning and licensing schedule it is necessary, for instance, to
reserve sites for auctions before all applications have been received. Further, we believe that it is important that
we schedule auctions far enough in advance to provide applicants with ample time to attract financing and plan their
bidding strategies. In any event, we have previously indicated that we will cancel a scheduled auction if we do not
receive mutually exclusive applications.
 Consequently we believe that our auction schedule and procedures are fully consistent with the provisions of the
Budget Act.

<TEXT>
 

20. We find advertising of auctions desirable and in the public interest, even if, because of lack of mutual exclusivity,
no auction takes place for some licenses. Among its other beneficial effects, advertising of auctions may be essential
for making potential licensees, and in particular designated entities, aware of the opportunities available to
them. In order to make service available as rapidly and efficiently as possible, we must ensure that those who value
the license most highly, and will offer the services most valued by the public, have an opportunity to bid on them. Mutual
exclusivity cannot be established until applications have been received, and at that point advertising will no longer
be useful because the purpose of advertising is to inform potential licensees of the opportunity to file applications.
Consequently, we retain our existing filing procedures and continue to permit our contractor to advertise auctions
even before mutual exclusivity has been established.





F. Application-Processing Rules


21. In the 

NPRM 

in this proceeding, the Commission stated: In order to avoid needless duplication, we propose that the following
general filing and processing rules apply to all PCS: Sections 22.3-22.45 and 22.917(f), and 22.918-22.945,
47 CFR   22.3-22.45, 22.917(f), and 22.918-22.945. For those PCS applicants who file on Form
574, we believe that   90.113-90.159 of our rules, 47 CFR   90.113-90.159, could
be used to process those applications with appropriate modifications.





22. 

Petition. 

AIDE asserts in its petition for reconsideration of the 

Second Report and Order 

that the Commission acted improperly in proposing substantive PCS application-processing rules in the 

NPRM 

because, it argues, such rules are outside the scope of this rulemaking, which is limited to implementation of the
competitive bidding requirements of  309(j) of the Communications Act.
 AIDE argues that the Commission's proposal of application-processing rules is legally insufficient to constitute
a valid notice of proposed rules, and that some of the rules cited have no immediate applicability to PCS service. AIDE
asserts that in the 

Second Report and Order 

the Commission failed to respond to the merits of the arguments concerning filing and processing rules in AIDE's comments
on the 

NPRM. 

AIDE concludes that the Commission needs to issue a supplemental 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 

to adopt license-processing rules for PCS. PacBell states, however, that the Administrative Procedure Act does
not prohibit the Commission from issuing more than one order based on a notice and comment period.
 PacBell also states that there is an exception to the Administrative Procedure Act's notice and comment requirements
``when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding * * * in the rules issued) that
notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.''







23. 

Discussion. 

The Commission adopted few filing or processing rules in the 

Second Report and Order. 

Those rules that the Commission did adopt pertaining to the filing and processing of applications and certifications
were clearly proposed in the NPRM.
 In the 

Second Memorandum Opinion and Order 

we stated that we would address AIDE's concerns in the reconsiderations of the service-specific Orders in which the
application processing rules were adopted. In the Third Report and Order, we adopted the service-specific narrowband
PCS application processing rules to which AIDE's petition refers and thus, we address the substance of AIDE's arguments
below.




24. The competitive bidding process is a means of assigning licenses, and rules and procedures for processing of license
applications are an integral and necessary part of that process. By citing in the NPRM the specific Part 22 and Part
90 application processing rules that we would use as the basis for adopting PCS rules, we provided commenters with
exceptionally clear notice and an opportunity to comment on the rules we contemplated adopting for narrowband PCS.
The few changes that we made from the proposed rules were necessary to adapt them to auctioning narrowband PCS licenses.
For example, we adopted certain technical requirements such as restrictions on station antenna structures.
 We also deleted any procedures that were related to grants by random selection.
 The resulting rules are clearly a logical outgrowth of the rules proposed in the NPRM, applied in the context of the
use of competitive bidding to assign narrowband PCS licenses. Rules adopted as a logical outgrowth comply with all
Administrative Procedure Act requirements.

III. Rules Prohibiting Settlements and Collusion 




25. 

Petitions and Oppositions

. The collusion rules adopted in the 

Third Report and Order 

prevent bidders for narrowband PCS licenses from entering into settlement agreements after applications are filed.
AIDE asserts that narrowband bidders should be allowed to enter into settlement agreements, as encouraged by  24.429(b),
and asserts that the Commission's decision to avoid post-filing settlements was impermissibly based on consideration
of potential revenues. Quentin L. Breen (Breen) urges us to act on AIDE's petition to liberalize treatment of full
market settlements. Breen states that the Budget Act does not relieve the Commission of its obligation in the public
interest to continue to use means such as negotiation to avoid mutual exclusivity, nor does the Act oblige us to adopt
anti-collusion regulations. Instead of permitting applicants to avoid the uncertainties and inefficiencies of
the auction process, Breen states that the rules effectively mandate that parties will go to end of the auction without
being able to consider settlement.
 PageNet, conversely, urges the Commission to prohibit any settlement negotiations during the competitive bidding
process.
 According to PageNet, there is no way for mutually exclusive applicants to come to an agreement on settlement without
exchanging the same kinds of information that would be exchanged for the formation of collusive strategies in auction
bidding. Accordingly, PageNet asserts that settlement discussions should be prohibited prior to selection of a
winner from among the Form 175 applicants.
 Furthermore, PageNet contends, that there is little likelihood of an all-market settlement in any given market,
because if any one applicant declines to settle, the settlement is defeated.
 








26. 

Discussion

. As stated in our reconsideration of the 

Second Report and Order

, we have decided to retain the existing collusion rules, to the extent that they prevent settlements after applications
are filed.
 These rules were designed to avoid formation of anticompetitive agreements among bidders, although we intend to
continue reliance on the antitrust laws as our primary method of avoiding bidder collusion.
 As we indicated in the 

Second Report and Order

, we believe that our rules prohibiting collusion will serve the objectives of the Budget Act by preventing applicants,
especially the largest companies, from entering into agreements to use bidding strategies that divide the market
to the disadvantage of other bidders.
 We also seek to ensure that entities will not file applications solely for the purpose of demanding payment from other
bidders in exchange for settlement or withdrawal of their applications. 







27. Accordingly, to ensure that the bidding process is competitive and to encourage formation of a competitive post-auction
market structure, we are retaining the collusion rules in the narrowband PCS context.
 Furthermore, to make clear that we recognize that these rules effectively prohibit post-filing settlements, we
are amending our rules to eliminate Section 24.429(b). We believe that this is the most straightforward approach,
given our strong concerns that collusion could have an extremely harmful impact upon competition. 





28. However, in order to provide bidders sufficient time and greater flexibility to attract capital, we make several
modifications to our collusion rules adopted in the 

Third Report and Order

. First, in the 

Second Memorandum Opinion and Order

, we clarified the applicability of the collusion rules to cases where an applicant has a common ownership interest
with another applicant.
 In that item we stated that, unless the second applicant is expressly identified as an entity with whom the first applicant
has an agreement concerning bidding, we will prohibit these parties from communicating concerning their bidding
strategies. This prohibition will hold even if the other bidder is identified on the applicant's short-form application
as having a common ownership interest with the applicant. 





29. Furthermore, where common non-controlling ownership exists between two or more bidders, those bidders may win
more licenses cumulatively than a single entity is entitled to hold. In such cases we will permit divestiture of non-controlling
interests to bring the entities into compliance with the license aggregation limits provided such divestiture is
completed within 90 days of grant of the license. Such post-auction divestiture will enable investors to finance
more than one bidder without risking default penalties if both bidders win licenses which in combination exceed our
aggregation limits. 

30. In addition, we wish to modify our rules regarding amendments to short-form applications. Section 24.413 of the
Commission's rules requires all applicants to list certain ownership information including all partners, subsidiaries,
affiliates and all persons holding five percent or more of the stock, warrants, options or debt securities of the applicant.
Section 24.422(b) currently prohibits amendments to the short-form application to make ownership changes or changes
in the parties to bidding consortia after the application filing deadline has passed. As a result of our experience
in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction we believe that it is necessary to allow applicants to amend their FCC Form
175 applications to make ownership changes after the filing deadline has passed, provided such changes do not result
in a change in control of the applicant and provided that discussions leading up to such changes do not violate our anti-collusion
rules. Such amendments must be made within two business days of any such change. Permitting such amendments will provide
bidders with flexibility to seek additional capital after applications have been filed, while ensuring that the
real party in interest does not change. Accordingly, we will modify rule 24.422(b) to permit applicants to amend their
FCC Form 175 applications to reflect ownership changes that do not result in a change in control of the applicant. Such
changes shall not be regarded as major amendments to an application, provided they do not result in a transfer of control
of the applicant.

31. In addition, we are modifying our collusion rules, which currently prohibit bidders from communicating with
one another after short form applications have been filed regarding the substance of their bids or bidding strategies
and which also prohibit bidders from entering into consortia arrangements or joint bidding agreements of any kind
after the deadline for short form applications has passed. In order to permit bidders to respond to higher than expected
license prices by combining their resources during an auction, we will now permit bidders who have not filed Form 175
applications for any of the same licenses to engage in discussions and enter into bidding consortia or joint bidding
arrangements during the course of an auction. We conclude that where bidders have not applied for any of the same licenses
there is little risk of anticompetitive conduct with respect to a single license and therefore we believe that it is
appropriate to relax our collusion rules to permit bidders in this context to have greater flexibility to increase
their competitiveness in the auction by combining their resources, provided that no change of control of any applicant
takes place.

IV. Paging Response Channel Eligibility


32. Mercury submitted a request for clarification that non-incumbent paging licensees will be permitted to apply
for only those narrowband paging response channel licenses that remain available after the initial response channel
auctions. Eligibility requirements for these channels were adopted in GEN Docket No. 90-314, and therefore
we will address this issue as part of the further reconsideration of the narrowband PCS service rules in that docket
and in ET Docket No. 92-100.







V. Designated Entity Provisions


33. 

Background.

 In the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, Congress amended the Communications Act to require the Commission
to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minority group members
(designated entities) would have an opportunity to obtain licenses and participate in offering spectrum-based
services.
 We considered numerous alternatives that might ensure opportunities for these designated entities, including
installment payment plans, bidding credits, spectrum set-asides, tax certificates, royalty payments, innovator's
preferences, and distress sales to designated entities.
 After considering the characteristics of the narrowband PCS service, we ultimately adopted installment payments
for small businesses acquiring certain regional, MTA or BTA licenses.
 We also provided that a 25 percent bidding credit would be available to businesses owned by minorities and/or women
on certain nationwide, regional, MTA and BTA licenses.
 Both installment payments and bidding credits were made available to small businesses owned by minorities and/or
women. In addition, we provided that tax certificates would be made available to encourage investment in women- and
minority-owned businesses.
 Our rules, however, did not permit rural telephone companies to obtain bidding credits or installment payments unless
they also qualified as small businesses or businesses owned by minorities and/or women.














34. 

Petitions. 

Three petitions assert that provisions made available for various designated entities, such as bidding credits,
installment payments and tax certificates, should also be made available to all designated entity groups, and for
all narrowband PCS licenses. The Association of Independent Designated Entities (AIDE) suggests that bidding credits,
currently available for all businesses owned by minorities 
and/or women, should be granted to all small businesses and rural telephone companies, for all narrowband PCS licenses.
 AIDE reasons that even if bidding credits are not appropriate for small businesses applying for nationwide licenses
(because small businesses can not afford to construct nationwide narrowband PCS systems), the Commission should
nevertheless permit small businesses to obtain bidding credits for the smaller, geographically limited narrowband
licenses.
 AIDE also states that the decision to limit installment payments to certain licenses was impermissibly based on maximizing
auction revenues.










35. U.S. Intelco Networks, Inc. (USIN) and the Rural Cellular Association (RCA) assert that the failure to provide
any narrowband provisions for rural telephone companies violates the Budget Act
 and ensures that narrowband PCS will be unavailable in rural areas.
 RCA states that rural telephone companies should receive bidding credits and tax certificates.
 RCA bases this assertion on the rationale that providing special bidding provisions for rural telephone companies
would increase the likelihood that narrowband PCS licenses will be awarded to entities that will provide service
to rural areas.
 RCA also notes that the Budget Act directs that the auction procedures must ensure that licenses for new technologies
are awarded in a manner that promotes their rapid deployment ``for the benefit of the public, including those residing
in rural areas.''










36. 

Oppositions

. PageNet states that no additional measures should be taken with respect to participation of rural telephone companies
or small businesses in narrowband PCS auctions.
 As to the availability of provisions for women and minority-owned businesses for only one license per channel grouping,
PageNet notes that licenses with bidding credits comprise 37 percent of regional licenses and almost 45 percent of
the available narrowband spectrum, thus earmarking a good deal of spectrum for designated entities.
 PageNet states that small businesses have always had ample opportunities in paging, and thus there is no reason to
grant them special consideration.
 We also request comment on a proposal to redesignate the BTA licenses as regional licenses.







37. 

Decision.

 We have decided, in response to petitions and to our experience with the nationwide narrowband auction, to expand
the provisions for designated entities in future narrowband auctions. First, we will modify the definition of small
business to expand eligibility. Second, for the upcoming regional narrowband auctions we will increase the bidding
credit for women- and minority-owned businesses.

38. Congress mandated that the Commission ``ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services.''
 To achieve this goal, the statute requires the Commission to ``consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences,
and other procedures.'' Thus, while providing that we may charge for licenses, Congress has ordered that the Commission
design its auction procedures to ensure that designated entities have opportunities to obtain licenses and provide
service. For that purpose, the law does not mandate the use of any particular procedure but it specifically approves
the use of ``tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures.'' The use of any such procedure is, in our
view, mandated where necessary to achieve Congress's objective of ensuring that designated entities have the opportunity
to participate in narrowband PCS.




39. In addition to this mandate, the statute sets forth various congressional objectives. For example, it provides
that in establishing eligibility criteria and bidding methodologies the Commission shall ``promot[e] economic
opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American
people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants,
including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.''
 Further, Section 309(j)(4)(A) provides that to promote the statute's objectives the Commission shall ``consider
alternative payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments,
with or without royalty payments, or other schedules or methods * * * and combinations
of such schedules and methods.''





40. To satisfy these statutory mandates and objectives, we established in the 

Second Report and Order

 eligibility criteria and general rules to govern the special measures for small businesses, and businesses owned
by members of minority groups and women. In the 

Third Report and Order

, we employed several measures, including installment payments, bidding credits and tax certificates, to enhance
opportunities for designated entities bidding on certain narrowband PCS licenses. We stated that we believed that
narrowband PCS would provide significant opportunities for all designated entities to provide a wide variety of
new services including advanced paging and messaging services. In adopting the particular measures for designated
entities, however, we assumed that narrowband PCS would involve relatively low capital entry requirements, and
would therefore be well-suited to small entities, which lack access to large amounts of capital.
 Accordingly, we found that the measures we selected for narrowband PCS auctions were appropriately tailored to the
unique characteristics of narrowband PCS and would therefore ``create meaningful incentives for small businesses
and businesses owned by minorities and/or women to both bid successfully for available licenses and provide innovative
and expeditious service to the public.
 In this regard we indicated that installment payments would provide a significant means for small businesses to overcome
their main barrier to entry: lack of access of financing. And, a 25 percent bidding credit for minority and women-owned
businesses together with a tax certificate program would address the additional obstacles faced by those designated
entities. We noted, however, that we would continue to assess the effectiveness of the measures adopted for narrowband
PCS, and would apply any knowledge gained to subsequent auctions.






41. Our goal in the narrowband personal communications service is to meet fully the statutory mandate of Section 309(j)(4)(D),
as well as the objectives of promoting economic opportunity and competition, of avoiding excessive concentration
of licenses, and of ensuring access to new and innovative technologies by disseminating licenses among a wide variety
of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority
groups and women. As explained more fully below, we believe that it is necessary in some respects to do more to ensure
that small businesses and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have a meaningful opportunity
to participate in the provision of narrowband PCS. As a result of our experience in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction,
we are concerned that a 25 percent bidding credit and installment payments may not be sufficient to ensure the opportunity
of these businesses to compete against the larger, deep pocketed incumbent firms. Therefore, we have decided to expand
the provisions for designated entities as described below.

A. Definition of Small Business


42. In the 

Third Report and Order 

we adopted a definition for small businesses based on the standard definition used by the Small Business Administration
(SBA). This definition permits an applicant to qualify for installment payments based on a net worth not in excess
of $6 million with average net income after Federal income taxes for the two preceding years not in excess of $2 million.
13 CFR 121.802(a)(2).
 In the 

Second Memorandum Opinion and Order,

 we removed our generic ``small business'' definition, which was based on the original SBA size standard and indicated
that we would establish a definition for ``small businesses'' on a service-specific basis.




43. Many commenters, including the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA, argue that the SBA net worth/net revenue
definition is too restrictive and will exclude businesses of sufficient size to survive, much less succeed, in the
competitive PCS marketplace. The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy and the Suite 12 Group advocate adoption of a gross
revenue test, arguing that a net worth test could be misleading as some very large companies have low net worth. The
SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy recommends that the revenue standard be raised to include firms that (together with
affiliates) have less than $40 million in gross revenues. Similarly, Suite 12 suggests a $75 million in annual sales
threshold. As another option, the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy suggests that the Commission consider a higher
revenue ceiling or adopt different size standards for different telecommunications markets.





44. We now realize that the cost of acquiring a narrowband PCS license will be significant and bidders may be required
to expend millions of dollars to acquire a license and construct a system in PCS markets. Thus, we believe that our current
narrowband PCS small business definition is overly restrictive because it would exclude most businesses possessing
the financial resources to compete successfully in the provision of narrowband PCS services. Accordingly, we modify
our small business definition for narrowband PCS auctions to ensure the participation of small businesses with the
financial resources to compete effectively in an auction and in the provision of narrowband PCS services.
45. There is substantial support in the record for a $40 million gross revenue standard. For example, the SBA recommends
that for PCS, a small business be defined as one whose average annual gross revenues for its past three years do not exceed
$40 million.
 It states that this definition isolates those companies that have significantly greater difficulty in obtaining
capital than larger enterprises. At the same time, the SBA contends that a company with $40 million in revenue is sufficiently
large that it could survive in a competitive wireless communications market.
 Similarly, the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy asserts that a $40 million threshold will allow participation by firms
``of sufficient size to meet demands in almost all small markets and some medium-size markets without significant
outside financial assistance.''







46. For purposes of narrowband PCS, we shall therefore define a small business as any firm, together with affiliates
and certain large investors, with average gross revenues for the three preceding years of less than $40 million.
 In addition, an applicant will not qualify as a small business if any one attributable investor in, or affiliate of,
the entity has $40 million or more in personal net worth.
 To ensure that only 

bona fide

 small businesses in need of government financing are eligible, we will consider the gross revenues of the applicant,
its affiliates, as well as those of ``attributable'' investors on a cumulative basis. The text that follows discusses
what interests are attributable for these purposes. In addition, it sets forth exceptions to these attribution rules
for minority and women-owned applicants.

47. 

Qualified ``Small Businesses''.

 As a general rule, the gross revenues of all investors in, and affiliates of, an applicant are counted on a cumulative,
fully-diluted basis for purposes of determining whether the $40 million gross revenue threshold has been exceeded,
and on an individual basis regarding the $40 million personal net worth standard.
 There are two exceptions to this rule, however. First, applicants that meet the definition of a small business may,
as discussed below, form consortia of small businesses that, on a aggregate basis, exceed the gross revenue cap. Second,
the gross revenues, personal net worth, and affiliations of any investor in the applicant are not considered so long
as the investor holds 25 percent or less of the applicant's passive equity. For corporations, we shall use the term
passive equity investors to mean investors who hold only non-voting stock or voting stock that includes no more than
15 percent of the voting interests. Where different classes of stock are held, however, the total amount of equity
must still be no more than 25 percent to meet this requirement. For partnerships, the term means limited partnership
interests that do not have the power to exercise control of the entity.
 The passive investor exception will be available, however, only so long as the applicant remains under the control
of one or more entities or individuals (defined as the ``control group'') and the control group holds at least 25 percent
of the applicant's equity and, in the case of corporate applicants, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
 In the case of partnership applicants, the control group must hold all the general partnership interests. Winning
bidders are required to identify on their long-form applications the identity of the members of this control group
and the means of ensuring control (such as a voting trust agreement). The gross revenues of each member of the control
group and each member's affiliates will be counted toward the $40 million gross revenues threshold and applicants
shall certify that each control group member meets the individual $40 million personal net worth standard, regardless
of the size of the member's total interest in the applicant.







48. The attribution levels we have selected here are intended to balance the competing considerations that apply
in this particular context and may differ from those we have used in other circumstances. As a general matter, the 25
percent limitation on equity investment interests will serve as a safeguard that the very large entities who are excluded
from bidding in these blocks do not, through their investments in qualified firms, circumvent the gross revenue cap.
At the same time, it will afford qualified bidders a reasonable measure of flexibility in obtaining needed financing
from other entities, while ensuring that such entities do not acquire controlling interests in the eligible bidders.
Similarly, the 15 percent threshold for attributing revenues of investors with voting stock in corporate applicants
is designed to keep ineligible parties from exerting undue influence over eligible firms. For all of these reasons,
we also will attribute the gross revenues of entities, or the personal net worth of individuals, that otherwise constitute
``affiliates'' of the applicant.






49. 

Qualified Woman and Minority-Owned Small Businesses.

 The record demonstrates that women and minorities have especially acute problems in obtaining financing, due in
part to discriminatory lending practices by private financial institutions. To address these special problems
and to afford women and minority-owned small businesses more flexibility in attracting financing, it is necessary
to provide these entities with an alternative, somewhat more relaxed option regarding the attribution of revenues
of passive investors. Under the alternative standard, we will not attribute to the applicant the gross revenues or
net worth of any single investor in a minority or woman-owned small business applicant unless it holds more than 49.9
percent of the passive equity (which is defined to include as much as 15 percent of a corporation's voting stock). To
guard against abuses, however, the control group of applicants choosing this option would have to own at least 50.1
percent of the applicant's equity, as well as retain control and hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
 Winning bidders must identify on their long-form applications a control group (this time consisting entirely of
minorities and/or women or entities 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women) and the gross revenues
and net worth of each member of the control group and each member's affiliates will be counted toward the $40 million
gross revenue threshold or the individual $40 million personal net worth limitation, regardless of the size of the
member's total interest in the applicant.





50. Relaxing the attribution standard somewhat in determining the eligibility of woman and minority-owned companies
to bid as small businesses directly addresses what most commenters have stated to be the biggest obstacle to entry
for these designated entities: obtaining adequate financing. By this measure, women and minorities who are eligible
to bid as small businesses (

i.e.,

 who otherwise meet the $40 million gross revenue standard) will be required to maintain control of their companies
and, at the same time, will have flexibility to attract significant infusions of capital from a single investor. The
requirement that the minority and women principals hold 50.1 percent of the company's equity mitigates substantially
the danger that a well-capitalized investor with a substantial ownership stake will be able to assume 

de facto

 control of the applicant.

<PARENT> FR940826-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

51. Of course, women and minority-owned firms, like any other small business applicant, may sell a larger portion
of their companies' equity, provided that they also abide by the general eligibility requirements for small businesses.
Specifically, the gross revenues and net worth of all investors holding more than 25 percent of the company's passive
equity (as defined to include 15 percent or more of the voting stock) will be attributed toward the $40 million cap and
the $40 million personal net worth standard. In this event, the control group will be required to hold at least 25 percent
of the company's equity and 50.1 percent of its voting stock.

52. 

De Facto Control Issues. 

We shall codify in our rules a provision explaining more explicitly the term ``control,'' so that applicants will
have clear guidance concerning the requirement that a control group maintains 

de facto

 as well as 

de jure

 control of the firms that are eligible for special treatment under the rules for narrowband PCS. For this purpose,
we shall borrow from certain SBA rules that are used to determine when a firm should be deemed an affiliate of a small
business. These SBA rules, which are codified in 13 CFR 121.401, provide several specific examples of instances in
which an entity might have control of a firm even though the entity has less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern,
and thus provide a useful model for our rules. Through reference to circumstances such as those described in the SBA
rules, our rules will expressly alert designated entities that control of the applicant through ownership of 50.1
percent of the firm's voting interests may be insufficient to ensure 

de facto

 control of the applicant if, for example, the voting stock of the eligible control group is widely dispersed. In those
and other circumstances, ownership of 50.1 percent of the voting stock may be insufficient to assure control of the
applicant. Of course, apart from these structural issues relative to control, eligible entities must not, during
the license term, abandon control of their licenses through any other mechanism. As we stated in the 

Second Report and Order, 

designated entities must be prepared to demonstrate that they are in control of the enterprise.






53. In the 

Second Memorandum Opinion and Order, 

we concluded that designated entities might be permitted to receive benefits based on their participation in consortium
on a service specific basis, but believed generally that such a consortium should not be entitled to qualify for measures
designed specifically for designated entities. As a general matter, we shall continue to adhere to that principle.
We think, however, that in the narrowband PCS service, allowing small businesses to pool their resources in this manner
is necessary to help them overcome capital formation problems and thereby ensure their opportunity to participate
in auctions and to become strong narrowband PCS competitors. Because of the exceptionally large capital requirements
associated with acquiring a license in this service, we agree with the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy that, so long
as individual members of the consortium satisfy the definition of a small business, the congressional objective
of ensuring opportunities for small businesses will be fully met. Individual small entities that join to form consortia,
as distinguished from a single entity with gross revenues in excess of $40 million, still are likely to encounter capital
access problems and, thus, should qualify for measures aimed at small businesses. We do not believe however, that
this congressional goal will be satisfied if special measures are allowed for consortia that are ``predominantly''
or ``significantly'' owned and/or controlled by small businesses. This would have the effect of eviscerating our
small business definition criteria and would not further the ability of 

bona fide

 small businesses to participate in PCS services.

54. 

Financial Benefits. 

To ensure that the control group has a substantial financial stake in the venture, we shall adopt certain additional
requirements. As noted previously, we shall require that at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock and at least 25 percent
(or 50.1 percent for the alternative option for minority- and women-owned businesses) of the aggregate of all outstanding
shares of stock to be unconditionally owned by the control group members. In addition, 50.1 percent of the annual distribution
of dividends paid on the voting stock of a corporate applicant concern must be paid to these members. Also, in the event
stock is sold, the control group members must be entitled to receive 100 percent of the value of each share of stock in
his or her possession. Similarly, in the event of dissolution or liquidation of the corporation, the control group
members must be entitled to receive at least 25 percent (or 50.1 percent, as the case may be) of the retained earnings
of the concern and 100 percent of the value of each share of the stock in his or her possession, subject, of course, to
any applicable laws requiring that debt be paid before distribution of equity.

55. Partnerships and other non-corporate entities will be subject to similar requirements. Indicia of ownership
that we will consider in non-corporate cases include (but are not limited to) (a) the right to share in the profits and
losses, and receive assets or liabilities upon liquidation, of the enterprise 

pro rata 

in relationship to the designated entity's ownership percentage and (b) the absence of opportunities to dilute the
interest of the designated entity (through capital calls or otherwise) in the venture. As with corporations, our
concern is ensuring that the economic opportunities and benefits provided through these rules flow to designated
entities, as Congress directed.

56. 

Abuses.

 As stated above, we intend by these attribution rules to ensure that bidders and recipients of these licenses are 

bona fide

 in their eligibility, and we intend to conduct random audits both before the auctions and during the 10-year initial
license period to ensure that our rules are complied with in letter and spirit. If we find that large firms or individuals
exceeding our personal net worth caps are able to assume control of licensees that have received small business provisions
or otherwise circumvent our rules, we will not hesitate to force divestiture of such improper interests or, in appropriate
cases, issue forfeitures or revoke licenses. In this regard, we reiterate that it is our intent, and the intent of Congress,
that women, minorities and small businesses be given an opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS services, not
merely as fronts for other entities, but as active entrepreneurs.
57. In addition, in view of our new small business definition and the associated maximum investor limits, we are modifying
our unjust enrichment rules to prevent any post-auction circumvention of our financial threshold, and to ensure
that the ultimate licensees are 

bona fide

 designated entities. Accordingly, firms that received installment payments based on their small business status
will be subject to repayment if, for example, another entity subsequently purchases an ``attributable'' interest
or becomes a member of the control group and, as a result, the gross revenues of the firm would exceed the $40 million
gross revenues cap, or the personal net worth of an individual investor exceeds the $40 million personal net worth
threshold.


B. Bidding Credits in Regional Narrowband Auctions


58. In the 

Third Report and Order

 we established bidding credits of 25 percent for women- and minority-owned businesses on two of the six regional narrowband
licenses.
 In order to increase the opportunities for women and minorities to participate in the provision of narrowband service,
we have decided to increase the bidding credit on the same two licenses for women- and minority-owned businesses in
the upcoming regional narrowband auction from 25 percent to 40 percent. Our experience with the nationwide narrowband
PCS auctions, where very high license values coupled with only a 25 percent bidding credit may have contributed to
the failure of women- and minority-owned businesses to win licenses, suggests that a credit of this magnitude may
be necessary to overcome the disadvantages of these groups in bidding for licenses representing large populations
and large geographic areas.
 In an 

ex parte

 filing, Essence Television Productions, Inc. one of the initial participants in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction,
argues that designated entities should receive bidding credits of up to 40 percent when competing in auctions against
non-designated entities.
 The increased bidding credit combined with installment payments for firms that meet our revised small business definition
should enable minority- and women-owned businesses to attract the capital necessary to compete. In addition, we
seek comment on whether additional measures such as an entrepreneur's block should be employed in future auctions
(see 

infra.

).






C. Rural Telephone Companies


59. In this docket, we established general rules and identified several measures, including installment payments,
spectrum set-asides, bidding credits and tax certificates, that we would choose among in establishing rules for
auctionable spectrum-based services, on a service-specific basis. In adopting service-specific rules, we have
carefully selected provisions to meet the particular needs of each designated entity group, so as to ``ensure,''
pursuant to the statute, that each group has the opportunity to participate in providing spectrum-based services.
60. As we indicated above, it is occasionally necessary to do more to ensure that businesses owned by members of minority
groups and women have a meaningful opportunity to participate in provision of personal communications services
than is necessary to ensure that other designated entity groups have similar opportunities.
 The major problem facing minorities and women who seek to offer PCS is lack of access to capital.
 Small businesses also encounter serious funding problems.
 In contrast, rural telephone companies that are not small businesses (and are not owned by minorities or women) do
not face the same difficulties in obtaining capital. Accordingly, we do not believe that any additional provisions
for rural telephone companies are necessary or appropriate in the context of narrowband PCS. Moreover, as we stated
in the 

Second Report and Order,

 limiting installment payments to smaller businesses, including those owned by minorities and women, best comports
with the intent of Congress by avoiding auction procedures that tend to favor incumbents with established revenue
streams over new companies and entrepreneurs.
 Therefore, rural telephone companies that are not eligible as small businesses will not receive installment payment
assistance.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

61. Finally, we believe that special provisions for rural telephone companies that are not smaller entities are not
necessary in this context to encourage service to rural areas.
 Especially in regions where the lack of wireline service makes wireless alternatives desirable, paging service
is provided to rural areas by paging companies as well as telephone companies. We therefore believe that many telecommunications
companies, and not only rural telephone companies, will pursue ordinary profit incentives to provide narrowband
PCS service to outlying areas. Accordingly, we believe that installment payment plans are not necessary to encourage
larger rural telephone companies to provide this relatively low-cost service in rural areas.





D. Other Designated Entity Decisions



62. We make two additional decisions concerning designated entities on our own motion. First, we clarify that, for
a partnership to qualify for designated entity status, all general partners in the applicant and its ``control group''
must be eligible entities, consistent with our revised generic eligibility criteria in the 

Second Memorandum Opinion and Order 

in this proceeding. For the purposes of our rules, we presume that all general partners in a partnership have the power
to bind the partnership, and therefore have 

de facto 

control.
 Therefore, to ensure that designated entity provisions are made available only to legitimate eligible entities
if the partnership is to receive designated entity benefits, all general partners will be required to be designated
entities if the partnership is to obtain designated entity status.





63. In addition, we are adopting for narrowband PCS the requirement that all entities claiming a designated entity
benefit must substantiate their eligibility for such benefits. In a related action reconsidering the 

Second Report and Order 

in this proceeding, we are requiring applicants that seek designated entity benefits to document their eligibility
for such benefits.
 For narrowband PCS we therefore require designated entity applicants to describe on their long-form applications
how they meet the eligibility criteria for designated entity benefits. Applicants must list and summarize on their
long-form application all agreements that affect designated entity status, such as all partnership agreements,
shareholder agreements, management agreements and other agreements, including oral agreements, which establish
that the designated entity will have both 

de facto 

and 

de jure 

control of the entity. In addition, we will require that such information be maintained at the licensee's facilities,
or by its designated agent, for the term of the license, and that the information be made available to Commission staff
upon request. We believe that this provision will prove useful when the Commission conducts its random audits of designated
entities providing narrowband PCS to ensure their continuing designated entity status.





VI. Procedural Matters And Ordering Clause



A. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



64. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C.  604, the Commission's final analysis for the


Memorandum Opinion and Order 

is as follows:



Memorandum Opinion and Order_Final Analysis



65. 

Need for, and Purpose of, this Action. 

As a result of new statutory authority, the Commission may utilize competitive bidding mechanisms in the granting
of certain initial licenses. The Commission published an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, 

see generally 

5 U.S.C.  603, within the 

Notice of Proposed Rule Making 

in this proceeding, and published Final Regulatory Flexibility Analyses within the 

Second Report and Order 

(at   299-302) and the 

Third Report and Order 

(at   91-94). As noted in these previous final analyses, this proceeding will establish a system
of competitive bidding for choosing among certain applications for initial licenses, and will carry out statutory
mandates that certain designated entities, including small entities, be afforded an opportunity to participate
in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services.

66. 

Summary of the Issues Raised by the Public Comments. 

In regard to the specific narrowband PCS issues addressed by this 

Third Memorandum Opinion and Order, 

no comments were submitted in response to our Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.

67. 

Significant Alternatives Considered. 

Although, as described in (B) above, no comments were received pertaining to narrowband PCS, the 

Second Report and Order 

and 

Third Report and Order 

addressed at length the general policy considerations raised as a result of the Commission's new auction authority.

Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Acceptability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice expands the list of acceptable substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODSs) under the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. SNAP implements section 612 of the
amended Clean Air Act of 1990 whereby EPA is required to evaluate substitutes for the ODSs, and regulate the use of substitutes
where other alternatives exist that reduce overall risk to human health and the environment. Through these evaluations,
SNAP generates lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes for each of the major industrial use sectors.



On March 18, 1994, EPA promulgated its plan for administering the SNAP program, and issued decisions on the acceptability
and unacceptability of a number of substitutes (59 FR 13044). In today's Notice, EPA is issuing decisions on the acceptability
of certain substitutes not previously reviewed by the Agency. The intended effect of this action is to expedite movement
away from ozone depleting compounds. To arrive at determinations on the acceptability of substitutes, the Agency
completed a cross-media sector end-use screening assessment of risks to human health and the environment.

II. Section 612 Program



A. Statutory Requirements



Section 612 of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to develop a program for evaluating alternatives to ozone-depleting
substances. EPA is referring to this program as the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. The major
provisions of section 612 are:

 

Rulemaking

_Section 612(c) requires EPA to promulgate rules making it unlawful to replace any class I (chlorofluorocarbon,
halon, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, methyl bromide, and hydrobromofluorocarbon) or class II (hydrochlorofluorocarbon)
substance with any substitute that the Administrator determines may present adverse effects to human health or the
environment where the Administrator has identified an alternative that: (1) Reduces the overall risk to human health
and the environment, and (2) is currently or potentially available.

 

Listing of Unacceptable/Acceptable Substitutes

_Section 612(c) also requires EPA to publish a list of the substitutes unacceptable for specific uses. EPA must publish
a corresponding list of acceptable alternatives for specific uses.

 

Petition Process

_Section 612(d) grants the right to any person to petition EPA to add a substance to or delete a substance from the lists
published in accordance with section 612(c). The Agency has 90 days to grant or deny a petition. Where the Agency grants
the petition, EPA must publish the revised lists within an additional 6 months.

 

90-day Notification

_Section 612(e) requires EPA to require any person who produces a chemical substitute for a class I substance to notify
the Agency not less than 90 days before new or 

existing

 chemicals are introduced into interstate commerce for significant new uses as substitutes for a class I substance.
The producer must also provide the Agency with the producer's unpublished health and safety studies on such substitutes.

 

Outreach

_Section 612(b)(1) states that the Administrator shall seek to maximize the use of federal research facilities and
resources to assist users of class I and II substances in identifying and developing alternatives to the use of such
substances in key commercial applications.

 

Clearinghouse

_Section 612(b)(4) requires the Agency to set up a public clearinghouse of alternative chemicals, product substitutes,
and alternative manufacturing processes that are available for products and manufacturing processes which use
class I and II substances.



B. Regulatory History



On March 18, 1994, EPA published the Final Rulemaking (FRM) (59 FR 13044) which described the process for administering
the SNAP program and issued EPA's first acceptability lists for substitutes in the major industrial use sectors.
These sectors include: Refrigeration and air conditioning; foam blowing; solvent cleaning; fire suppression and
explosion protection; sterilants; aerosols; adhesives, coatings and inks; and tobacco expansion. These sectors
compose the principal industrial sectors that historically consume the largest volumes of ozone-depleting compounds.

As described in the final rule for the SNAP program (59 FR 13044), EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are
required to list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. Such listings do not impose any sanction, nor do
they remove any prior license to use a substance. Consequently, EPA is adding substances to the list of acceptable
alternatives without first requesting comment on new listings.

EPA does, however, believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required to place any substance on the list of prohibited
substitutes, to list a substance as acceptable only under certain conditions, to list substances as acceptable only
for certain uses, or to remove a substance from either the list of prohibited or acceptable substitutes. Updates to
these lists are published as separate notices of rulemaking in the 

Federal Register.

The Agency defines a ``substitute'' as any chemical, product substitute, or alternative manufacturing process,
whether existing or new, that could replace a class I or class II substance. Anyone who produces a substitute must provide
the Agency with health and safety studies on the substitute at least 90 days before introducing it into interstate
commerce for significant new use as an alternative. This requirement applies to substitute manufacturers, but may
include importers, formulators or end-users, when they are responsible for introducing a substitute into commerce.

III. Listing of Acceptable Substitutes



This section presents EPA's most recent acceptable listing decisions for class I substitutes in the following industrial
sectors: refrigerants and air conditioning, foam blowing, solvent cleaning, fire suppression and explosion protection;
sterilants; aerosols; adhesives, coatings and inks. These decisions represent substitutes not previously reviewed
in the final rulemaking for SNAP (59 FR 13044; March 18, 1994) and, consequently, add to the lists of acceptable substitutes
under SNAP. For copies of the full list, contact the EPA Stratospheric Protection Hotline at the number listed in Section
V of this notice.

Parts A through H below present a detailed discussion of the substitute listing determinations by major use sector.
Tables summarizing listing decisions in this notice are in Appendix A. The comments contained in Appendix A provide
additional information on a substitute, but like the listings themselves, are not regulatory in nature, and thus
they are not mandatory for use of a substitute. Nor should the comments be considered comprehensive with respect to
other legal obligations pertaining to the use of the substitute. However, EPA encourages users of acceptable substitutes
to apply all comments to their use of these substitutes. In many instances, the comments simply allude to sound operating
practices that have already been identified in existing industry and/or building-code standards. Thus, many of
the comments, if adopted, would not require significant changes in existing operating practices for the affected
industry.

As described in the final rule for the SNAP program, EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are required to
list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. Such listings do not impose any sanction, nor do they remove
any prior license to use a substitute. Consequently, EPA is adding substances to the list of acceptable alternatives
without first requesting comment on new listings.

EPA, however, does believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required to place any alternative on the list of
prohibited substitutes, to list a substitute as acceptable only under use restrictions, or to remove a substitute
from either the list of prohibited or acceptable substitutes. Updates to these lists are published as separate notices
of rulemaking in the Federal Register.



D. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning



1. Overview



The refrigeration and air conditioning sector includes all uses of class I and class II substances to produce cooling,
including mechanical and non-mechanical refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat transfer. Please refer to the
final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for a more detailed description of this sector.

The refrigeration and air conditioning sector is divided into the following end-uses:

 Commercial comfort air conditioning;

 Industrial process refrigeration systems;

 Industrial process air conditioning;

 Ice skating rinks;

 Uranium isotope separation processing;

 Cole storage warehouses;

 Refrigerated transport;

 Retail food refrigeration;

 Vending machines;

 Water coolers;

 Commercial ice machines;

 Household refrigerators;

 Household freezers;

 Residential dehumidifiers;

 Motor vehicle air conditioning;

 Residential air conditioning and heat pumps;

 Non-mechanical heat transfer; and

 Very low temperature refrigeration.



In addition, each end-use is divided into retrofit and new equipment applications. EPA has not necessarily reviewed
substitutes in every end-use for this Notice.



EPA has modified the list of end-uses for this sector for this SNAP update. First, EPA has changed the name of the heat
transfer end-use to non-mechanical heat transfer. This change is intended to avoid confusion between systems that
move heat from a cool area to a warm one (mechanical refrigeration) and systems that simply aid the movement of heat
away from warm areas (non-mechanical heat transfer). The second change is that EPA added a new end-use, very low temperature
refrigeration. Substitutes for this end-use have been reviewed since the final rule, and therefore have been added
for this SNAP update. Finally, EPA has also reviewed substitutes for CFC-13, R-13B1, and R-503 industrial
process refrigeration. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for a detailed description of end-uses other
than these three. EPA may continue to add other end-uses in future SNAP updates.



a. Non-mechanical Heat Transfer.

 As discussed above, this end-use includes all cooling systems that rely on a fluid to remove heat from a heat source
to a cooler area, rather than relying on mechanical refrigeration to move heat from a cool area to a warm one. Generally,
there are two types of systems: systems with fluid pumps, referred to as recirculating coolers, and those that rely
on natural convection currents, known as thermosyphons.



b. Very Low Temperature Refrigeration.

 Medical freezers, freeze-dryers, and other small appliances require extremely reliable refrigeration cycles.
These systems must meet stringent technical standards that do not normally apply to refrigeration systems. They
usually have very small charges. Because they operate at very high vapor pressures, and because performance is critically
affected by any charge loss, standard maintenance for these systems tends to reduce leakage to a level considerably
below that for other types of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.

<PARENT> FR940826-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



c. CFC-13, R-13B1, and R-503 Industrial Process Refrigeration. 

This end-use differs from other types of industrial refrigeration only in the extremely low temperature regimes
that are required. Although some substitutes may work in both these extremely low temperatures and in systems designed
to use R-502, they are acceptable only for this end-use because of global warming and atmospheric lifetime concerns.
These concerns are discussed more fully below.



2. Corrections from the March 18, 1994 FRM



In the FRM, the components of two refrigerants, R-404A and R-507, were inadvertently reversed. R-507
consists of HFC-125 and HFC-143a and R-404A consists of HFC-125, HFC-143a, and HFC-134a.
These blends were listed as acceptable for the same end-uses, so the reversal had no effect on the acceptable status
of either refrigerant. 

Also in the FRM, EPA listed HFC-134a as acceptable in several CFC-12 end-uses. In the descriptive text,
EPA wrote ``while HFC-134a is compatible with most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment
parts, it is not compatible with mineral oils currently used in such systems. An ester-based lubricant should be used
rather than mineral oils.'' EPA's intention was to alert users to the need to use lubricants other than current mineral
oils, rather than to recommend a particular type of new oil. While it remains true that mineral oils are incompatible
with HFC-134a, it is not true that polyol ester oils are the only replacement. Polyalkylene glycol oils are also
available, and are in fact the predominant choice of the automobile manufacturers. Therefore, the portion of each
listing for HFC-1234a should have read ``An appropriate ester-based, polyalkylene glycol-based, or other
type of lubricant should be used.'' In addition, specifically in the Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning end-use the listing
for HFC-134a should have included the recommendation to consult the original equipment manufacturer or the
retrofit kit manufacturer for further information. For clarity, these changes have been incorporated into the listing
for HFC-134a in Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning in the NPRM.



3. Substitutes for Refrigerants



Substitutes fall into eight broad categories. Seven of these categories are chemical substitutes used in the same
vapor compression cycle as the ozone-depleting substances being replaced. They include hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrocarbons, refrigerant blends, ammonia, perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and
chlorine systems. The eighth category includes alternative technologies that generally do not rely on vapor compression
cycles. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 

FR 

13044) for more discussion of these broad categories.



4. Listing Decisions





a. Acceptable Substitutes

. These determinations are based on data submitted to EPA and on the risk screen described in the draft background document
entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Refrigerants''. In accordance
with the guiding principles for SNAP, substitutes were compared both to the substance they replace and to each other.

EPA believes the use of all acceptable substitutes presents lower overall risk than the continued use of an ozone-depleting
substance. Not all substitutes will necessarily be appropriate choices for all systems within an end-use. Engineering
decisions must take into account factors such as operating temperatures and pressures, ambient conditions, and
age of equipment, especially during retrofits. For example, substitutes listed under industrial process refrigeration
may be listed as acceptable for retrofits for both CFC-12 and R-502 systems. However, these substances
exhibit significantly different thermodynamic characteristics, and a substitute for one may not be appropriate
for use as a substitute for the other. EPA believes such decisions are most appropriately made by the equipment owner,
manager, or contractor.

Users of HCFCs should be aware that an acceptability determination shall not be construed to release any user from
compliance with all other regulations pertaining to class II substances. These include: (a) The prohibition against
venting during servicing under section 608, which was effective July 1, 1992; (b) recycling requirements under section
608, which were effective July 13, 1993; (c) section 609 regulations regarding MVACS which were effective August
13, 1992; and (d) the revised production phaseout of class II substances under section 606, which was published on
December 10, 1993. In addition, users of refrigerants that do not contain chlorine should be aware that an acceptability
determination shall not be construed to release any user from compliance with the venting prohibition under section
608(c)(2), which takes effect November 15, 1995, at the latest.

Substitutes are listed as acceptable by end-use. These substitutes have only been found acceptable for use in the
specific end-uses for which they have been reviewed, as described in this section. Users of blends should be aware
that EPA has evaluated and found acceptable in each case only the specific percentage composition submitted for review;
no others have been evaluated. EPA strongly recommends that users of alternative refrigerants adhere to the provisions
of 

ASHRAE Standard 15_Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration 

when applicable. 

ASHRAE Standard 34_Number Designation and Safety Classification of Refrigerants 

is a useful reference on refrigerant numerical designations. Users are also strongly encouraged to contain, recycle,
and reclaim all refrigerants.



(1) R-500 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit





(a) R-406A

._

R-406A, which consists of HCFC-22, HCFC-142b, and isobutane, is acceptable as a substitute for
R-500 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers

. Because HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b contribute to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional
alternative. Regulations regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply
this blend. HCFC-142b has one of the highest ODPs among the HCFCs. The GWPs of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b
are somewhat high. Although HCFC-142b is flammable, the blend is not. After significant leakage, however,
this blend may become weakly flammable.



(2) CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 Industrial Process Refrigeration, Retrofit



Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use.



(a) HCFC-123

._

HCFC-123 is acceptable as a substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted industrial
process refrigeration

. Because HCFC-123 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative. Since it poses
much lower ozone-depleting risk than continued use of CFCs, EPA has determined that its use is acceptable for certain
end-uses. In addition, HCFC-123's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than almost all other
alternatives. HCFC-123 is not flammable. EPA strongly recommends that users of HCFC-123 adhere to any
requirements provided in ASHRAE Standards 15 and 34. Worker-monitoring studies conducted by EPA demonstrate that
in office building equipment rooms, HCFC-123's 8-hour time-weighted average concentration can be maintained
at or under 1 ppm (less than the industry-established AEL of 30 ppm), provided that such standards are followed. HCFC-123
is acceptable for use in commercial building chillers and should pose no hazard in industrial uses.



(b) R-406A

._

R-406A, which consists of HCFC-22, HCFC-142b, and isobutane, is acceptable as a substitute for
CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. 

See the discussion on R-406A under retrofitted R-500 centrifugal chillers.



(c) R-407A and R-407B

._

R-407A and R-407B, which consist of HFC-134a, HFC-32, and HFC-125, are acceptable as
substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration

. None of the components contribute to ozone depletion. However, HFC-125 has a very high GWP and HFC-134a
has a moderate GWP. EPA strongly encourages recycling and reclamation of this blend in order to reduce its direct global
warming impact. Although HFC-143a is flammable, the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition
never becomes flammable.

(d) HCFC Blend Epsilon._HCFC Blend Epsilon, which consists of HCFC-22, HFC-143a, and HFC-125,
is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration.


Because HCFC-22 contributes to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional alternative. Regulations
regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. HFC-125
and HFC-143a have very high GWPs, and the GWP of HFC-22 is somewhat high. Although HFC-143a is flammable,
the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable.



(3) CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 Industrial Process Refrigeration, New



Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use.



(a) HCFC-123._HCFC-123 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502
in new industrial process refrigeration.

 Because HCFC-123 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative. Since it poses
much lower ozone-depleting risk than continued use of CFCs, EPA has determined that its use is acceptable for certain
end-uses. In addition, HCFC-123's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than almost all other
alternatives. HCFC-123 is not flammable. EPA strongly recommends that users of HCFC-123 adhere to any
requirements provided in ASHRAE Standards 15 and 34. Worker-monitoring studies conducted by EPA demonstrate that
in office building equipment rooms, HCFC-123's 8-hour time-weighted average concentration can be maintained
at or under 1 ppm (less than the industry-established AEL of 30 ppm), provided that such standards are followed. HCFC-123
is acceptable for use in commercial building chillers and should pose no hazard in industrial uses.



(b) R-407A and R-407B._R-407A and R-407B, which consist of HFC-134a, HFC-32,
and HFC-125, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in new industrial
process refrigeration.

 See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 industrial process
refrigeration.



(4) CFC-13, R-13B1, and R-503 Industrial Process Refrigeration, Retrofit and New 



This type of refrigeration requires temperatures well below those achieved with R-502 or HCFC-22. A limited
number of substitutes have been identified that are capable of meeting technical requirements. These substitutes
all contain components with extremely high GWPS, and EPA is concerned about their potential contribution to global
warming. However, under SNAP, EPA intends to only find those substitutes unacceptable that clearly present greater
overall risk. Given this framework, EPA finds these high-GWP substitutes acceptable. At the same time, EPA strongly
urges industry to develop new alternatives for this end-use that do not contain substances with such high GWPs and
long lifetimes.



(a) HFC-23._HFC-23 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-13, R-13B1, and R-503 in retrofitted
and new industrial process refrigeration.

 HFC-23 has an extremely high 100-year GWP of 9000 relative to CO

2

 and a lifetime of 280 years. Its GWP is the highest among the HFCs, and its lifetime is exceeded only by the PFCs. EPA believes
HFC-23 could contribute significantly to global warming. In addition, the long lifetime of HFC-23 means
any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible. While the current rule issued under section
608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of HFC-23, or leak repair for systems using HFC-23,
EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary compliance. In particular, EPA urges
users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle HFC-23 during equipment servicing and upon the retirement of
equipment. HFC-23 is nonflammable and does not deplete stratospheric ozone.



(b) R-403B._R-403B, which consists of HCFC-22, R-218, and propane, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC-13, R-13B1, and R-503 in retrofitted and new industrial process refrigeration.

 Because HCFC-22 contributes to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional alternative. Regulations
regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. R-218,
or perfluoropropane, is an extremely long-lived substance with an extremely high GWP. EPA believes this blend could
contribute significantly to global warming. In addition, the long lifetime of R-218 means any global warming
or other effects would be essentially irreversible. R-403B is only acceptable as a substitute for this end-use.
The GWP of HCFC-22 is also somewhat high. Although propane is flammable, the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated
that the blend's composition never becomes flammable. In a proposed rulemaking soon to be issued, EPA intends to propose
R-403B unacceptable as a substitute for R-502 in all end-uses because other substitutes have been identified
which do not exhibit such extreme GWPs or lifetimes.

(c) PFC Blend Alpha._PFC Blend Alpha, which contains HFC-23 and R-116, is acceptable as a substitute for
CFC-13, R-13B1, and R-503 in retrofitted and new industrial process refrigeration.

 Both components of this blend exhibit extremely high GWPs and long lifetimes. HFC-23 has a GWP of 9,000 and a lifetime
of 280 years, and R-116, perfluoroethane, has a GWP of 9,000 and a lifetime of 10,000 years. EPA believes this
blend could significantly contribute to global warming if allowed to escape refrigeration systems. In addition,
the long lifetimes of R-116 and HFC-23 mean any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible.
While the current rule issued under section 608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of this blend, or
leak repair for systems using it, EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary
compliance. In particular, EPA urges users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle this blend during equipment
servicing and upon the retirement of equipment. This blend is nonflammable and does not deplete ozone.

transport.

 See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 industrial process
refrigeration.


(c) HCFC Blend Gamma._HCFC Blend Gamma, which consists of HCFC-22, HCFC-142b, and HCFC-124, is
acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12, R-500, and R-502 in retrofitted refrigerated transport.

 Because HCFC-22, HCFC-142b, and HCFC-124 contribute to ozone depletion, this blend is considered
a transitional alternative. Regulations regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean
Air Act apply to this blend. HCFC-142b has one of the highest ODPs among the HCFCs, while HCFC-124 has one
of the lowest. The GWPs of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b are somewhat high. Although HCFC-142b is flammable,
the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable.

as a substitute for CFC-12 and R-502 in retrofitted vending machines. 

None of this blend's constituents contains chlorine, and thus this blend poses no threat to stratospheric ozone.
However, HFC-125 and HFC-143a have very high GWPs, and the GWP of HFC-134a is somewhat high. EPA strongly
encourages recycling and reclamation of this blend to reduce its direct global warming impact. Although HFC-134a
is flammable, the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable.

However, HFC-125 and HFC-143a have very high GWPs. EPA strongly encourages recycling and reclamation
of this blend in order to reduce its direct global warming impact. Although HFC-143a is flammable, the blend
is not. It is an azeotrope, so it will not fractionate during operation. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition
never becomes flammable.

are acceptable as substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-12, and R-502 in retrofitted household freezers.

 HCFC-22 contributes to ozone depletion, and will be phased out according to the accelerated schedule (published
12/10/93, 58 FR 65018), although it has a lower ODP than CFC-12. The GWP of HFC-125 is very high and that of
HCFC-22 is somewhat high. Although these blends contain one flammable constituent, propane, the blends themselves
are not flammable. In addition, while testing demonstrated that the vapor and liquid compositions changed during
leaks, neither phase became flammable.

(21) CFC-12 Automobile Air Conditioners, Retrofit and New



A smooth transition to the use of substitutes strongly depends on the continued purity of the recycled CFC-12
supply. The existence of several substitutes in this end-use may increase the likelihood of significant cross-contamination.
To address this increased risk, EPA is proposing several use conditions on the use of all motor vehicle air conditioning
refrigerants. Please refer to the notice of proposed rulemaking, soon to be issued, for more information.



(22) CFC-12 Non-Automobile Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, Retrofit and New





(a) HCFC-22._HCFC-22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in retrofitted and new CFC-12
Non-Automobile Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners. 

In some situations, HCFC-22 may be used as a retrofit refrigerant in bus and rail car air conditioning systems
originally designed to use CFC-12. In addition, while HCFC-22 is the primary refrigerant in these uses,
EPA is listing it as an acceptable substitute for CFC-12 in new systems in order to remove confusion about its
usefulness. Please note that HCFC-22 is only acceptable in motor vehicles other than automobiles. Design differences
render HCFC-22 ineffective in cars. In fact, HCFC-22 may damage automobile air conditioners. HCFC-22
does contribute to ozone depletion and will therefore be phased out according to the accelerated schedule (published
12/10/93, 58 FR 65018). It is therefore covered by regulations issued under section 608 of the CAA. HCFC-22 is
nonflammable.



(23) Non-mechanical Heat Transfer, Retrofit and New



EPA did not review substitutes for this end-use as part of the SNAP FRM, nor did it propose to include this end-use in
the refrigeration and air conditioning sector in the NPRM (58 FR 28094). However, the Agency has developed a better
understanding of the volumes likely to be used as coolants, and this new information has led EPA to reconsider its earlier
position that heat transfer systems constitute small uses. Therefore, EPA has included this end-use within the refrigeration
and air conditioning sector. In a subsequent proposal, EPA plans to propose narrowed use limits for several substitutes
in this end-use.



(24) CFC-13, R-13B1, and R-503 Very Low Temperature Refrigeration, Retrofit and New



This type of refrigeration requires temperatures well below those achieved with R-502 or HCFC-22. Because
these systems are used for purposes such as freezing blood or for simulating extreme conditions for testing, extremely
low leakage rakes are essential. A limited number of substitutes have been identified that are capable of meeting
technical requirements. These substitutes all contain components with extremely high GWPS, and EPA is concerned
about their potential contribution to global warming. However, under SNAP, EPA intends to only find those substitutes
unacceptable that clearly present greater overall risk. Given this framework, EPA finds these high-GWP substitutes
acceptable. At the same time, EPA strongly urges industry to develop new alternatives for this end-use that do not
contain substances with such high GWPs and long lifetimes.



(a) HFC-23._HFC-23 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-13, R-13B1, and R-503 in retrofitted
and new very low temperature refrigeration. 

HFC-23 has an extremely high GWP of 9000 and a lifetime of 280 years. Its GWP is the highest among the HFCs, and its
lifetime is exceeded only by the PFCs. EPA believes it could contribute significantly to global warming. In addition,
the long lifetime of HFC-23 means any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible. While
the current rule issued under section 608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of HFC-23, or leak
repair for systems using HFC-23, EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary
compliance. In particular, EPA urges users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle HFC-23 during equipment
servicing and upon the retirement of equipment. HFC-23 is nonflammable and does not deplete ozone.

(b) R-403B.

_

R-403B, which consists of HCFC-22, R-218, and propane, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-13,
R-13B1, and R-503 in retrofitted and new very low temperature refrigeration.

 Because HCFC-22 contributes to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional alternative. Regulations
regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. R-218,
or perfluoropropane, is an extremely long-lived substance with an extremely high GWP. EPA believes this blend could
significantly contribute to global warming. In addition, the long lifetimes of R-218 means global warming
and other effects would be essentially irreversible. R-403B is only acceptable as a substitute for the refrigerants
listed above. The GWP of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b are also somewhat high. Although propane is flammable,
the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that the blend's composition never becomes flammable. In a proposed
rulemaking soon to be issued, EPA intends to propose R-403B unacceptable as a substitute for R-502 in all
end-uses because other substitutes have been identified which do not exhibit such extreme GEPs or lifetimes.



(c) PFC Blend Alpha.

_

PFC Blend Alpha, which contains HFC-23 and R-116, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-13, R-13B1,
and R-503 in retrofitted and new very low temperature refrigeration.

 Both components of this blend exhibit extremely high GWPs and long lifetimes. HFC-23 has a GWP of 9,000 and a lifetime
of 280 years, and R-116, perfluoroethane, has a GWP of 9,000 and a lifetime of 10,000 years. EPA believes this
blend could significantly contribute to global warming if allowed to escape refrigeration systems. In addition,
the long lifetimes of R-116 and HFC-23 mean any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible.
While the current rule issued under section 608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of this blend, or
leak repair for systems using it, EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary
compliance. In particular, EPA urges users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle HFC-23 during equipment
servicing and upon the retirement of equipment. This blend is nonflammable and does not deplete ozone.



B. Foams



1. Clarification from March 18, 1994 Final Rulemaking



In Section IX.E. Foams, under the listing decisions for rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminate boardstock
(59 FR 13085), the narrative under substitute (e) HCFC-22/HCFC-141b incorrectly reads as follows: ``The


HCFC-22/HCFC-142b 

blend is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminate boardstock
foams.'' This sentence should read 

HCFC-22/HCFC-141b. 

The Agency regrets any confusion this error may have caused.

Further, the end-use titled ``Phenolic Insulation Board'' requires clarification. In this end-use the Agency includes
foam products manufactured from both the discontinuous block (or bun) process and the continuous lamination process.
Henceforth, this end-use will be referred to as ``Phenolic Insulation Boardstock and Bunstock Foam.''



2. New Listing Decisions

a. Acceptable Substitutes

(1) Rigid Polyurethane and Polyisocyanurate Laminated Boardstock





(a) Electroset Technology.

_

The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC-11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 This proprietary manufacturing process, developed by the U.S. Navy, transforms organic casting resins into electrosettable
foaming compounds. These compounds are made electrically semiconductive with the addition of electrically polarizable
particles, and if necessary, an electrically conductive fluid. This process enables foam manufacturers to electrically
accelerate the speed at which they set (i.e., harden) and cure (i.e. solidify). Other characteristics such as density,
compressibility, adhesion, and shear strength can also be electrically controlled.

Potential health and environmental risks for this technology are considered similar to or less than those of other
acceptable substitutes for this end-use. Risk is expected to vary based on the quantity of electrically polarizable
particles added in the polymer and whether other electrically conductive fluids are added to the formulation. Of
the six potential electrically foaming agents reviewed by the Agency, none represented a significant risk under
the SNAP criteria for evaluation. Adequate workplace precautions such as workplace ventilation were presumed.
For additional detail see, ``SNAP Evaluation for Electroset Technology.''

 HFC-143a has a higher global warming potential (GWP) than other acceptable substitutes for this end-use.



(b) Electroset Technology.

_

The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC-11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 See discussion above.



(6) Phenolic Insulation Boardstock and Bunstock Foam

(7) Polyurethane Flexible





(a) Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3-C6.

_

Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 (and blends thereof) are acceptable as substitutes for CFC-11 and
methyl chloroform in polyurethane flexible foam.

 Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 offer the potential of a non-ozone-depleting flexible foam. Saturated
light hydrocarbons C3-C6 offer the potential of a non-ozone-depleting alternative to the use of CFC-11
blowing agents in polyurethane flexible foams. Plant modifications, however, may be necessary to accommodate the
flammability of hydrocarbons. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3-C6 are VOCs and are subject to control as such
under Title I of the Clean Air Act.



(b) Electroset Technology.

_

The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC-11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 See discussion above.

_

The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC-11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 See discussion above.



(10) Polyolefin Foam





(a) Methylene Chloride.

_

Methylene chloride is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-14 in polyolefin foams.

 Methylene chloride is a non-ozone-depleting and non-global warming alternative blowing agent. Nevertheless,
it does pose potential health and safety concerns. In addition to occupational and worker safety standards, some
local and regional restrictions apply to the use of methylene chloride. To assess risks in the Polyolefin foam sector,
EPA used data collected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for the proposed revision of
the permissible exposure level (PEL) for methylene chloride. The Agency's estimate for total population risk for
methylene chloride was based on average plant emissions derived from OSHA's analysis, and while not negligible,
was within the range of existing Agency decisions on acceptable risk. For further detail, refer to the SNAP background
document entitled, ``Risk Screen on the Use of Methylene Chloride in Polyolefin Foams for Class I Ozone-Depleting
Substances: Foams, June, 1994.'' Users of this substitute should note that methylene chloride will be subject to
future controls for hazardous air pollutants under Title III section 112 of the Clean Air Act.

 New toxicity data has led to an upward revision of the company set workplace exposure limit (AEL) of 30 ppm. The Agency
believes that under normal conditions of use this limit is attainable.



(c) Volatile Methyl Siloxanes._Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxanes and decamethylcyclo pentasiloxanes are acceptable
alternatives to MCF and CFC-113 in precision cleaning.

 Evaluation of other VMS's is ongoing.



D. Fire Suppression and Explosion Protection



1. Weight and Volume Equivalence of Halon Substitutes



In the SNAP Rulemaking published March 18, 1994 (59 FR 13043), EPA included weight and volume equivalence data in the
discussion of halon substitutes. This data was derived from either of two sources. EPA used manufacturer data when
available, otherwise the data was taken from the background document entitled ``Characterization of Risk from the
Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Fire Extinguishing and Explosion Protection (Halon
Substitutes).'' While this data was presented in the Rulemaking for informational purposes only to establish a relative
concept, the variability of methodologies for calculating these values has generated some confusion in the regulated
and user community. Therefore, at EPA's request, the Technical Committee of the Halon Alternatives Research Corporation
has developed an agreed upon set of data for determining weight and volume equivalence of halon substitutes.

The following table presents weight and volume equivalents for certain halon substitutes when compared to Halon
1301. The equivalents were calculated using a single, fuel-specific design concentration (heptane); therefore,
they do not represent the exact weight or volume of the agent needed to protect any specific space against any specific
hazard. The information used to calculate the equivalents was obtained from agent manufacturers and NFPA 2001, ``Standard
on Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems.'' Equivalents are included for general comparison and informational
purposes only.

Fire suppression agents must be evaluated in the context of the fire extinguishing system equipment with which they
are used. Design concentration, and weight and volume equivalents are only meaningful when evaluated in specific
system hardware configurations. This is especially important when comparing storage volume where storage container
fill density varies with the equipment used. Agent fire suppression performance will vary with the system used and
the detailed design of the system. Therefore, fire suppression agent manufacturers do not generally recommend design
concentration as these are also a function of the system hardware in which they are used. Hence, these data are provided
for general guidance only and do not reflect a recommendation for system design or a basis for rigorous quantitative
comparison.

Weight and volume equivalencies based on cup burner data are much less meaningful for streaming agents than for total
flood agents. One needs to consider performance of the agents and equipment in larger-scale standardized tests.



2. Use of CFCs and HCFCs in Portable Extinguishers



In this notice, EPA is clarifying the relationship between CAAA section 610 and section 612 regulations. Under section
610(b) (58 FR 4768; January 15, 1993), CFCs are banned from sale or distribution in all portable fire extinguishers.
Under section 610(d) (58 FR 69637, December 30, 1993), HCFCs in pressurized dispensers are banned from sale or distribution.
However, section 619(d) excludes HCFCs which are part of an installed `system,' and therefore exempted total flooding
systems and those streaming applications which incorporate fixed, automatic systems (58 FR 69646). Further, section
610(d) only allows the sale of a portable fire extinguisher containing HCFCs where other agents are not suitable for
the intended applications. Suitability includes the commercial availability of the agent and the ability of the
agent to suppress a fire in progress without damaging the equipment requiring protection (58 FR 69648). Because alternatives
are available for residential consumer uses, section 610(d) banned the sale and use of HCFCs in portable fire extinguishers
for residential consumer applications. However, in commercial (including industrial and military) settings,
the variety of hazards are too broad to make a standard rulemaking, and therefore under section 610(d) EPA has established
industry-based mechanisms for controlling the sale of HCFCs to commercial users and owners of watercraft and aircraft.
Because section 610(d) already bans CFCs in portable fire extinguishers and HCFCs in residential applications,
it is not necessary for them to be listed as unacceptable under SNAP.

The HCFCs and HCFC Blends that are listed as acceptable under SNAP, but that are not acceptable under section 610(d)
in residential streaming applications are: HCFC-123, HCFC-124, [HCFC Blend] B, [HCFC Blend] C, and [HCFC
Blend] D.



3. New Listing Decisions

a. Acceptable Substitutes

(1) Streaming Agents





(a) HCFC-124._HCFC-124 is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. 

HCFC-124 has an ODP of 0.02, a 100-year GWP of 440 and an atmospheric lifetime of 7 years. Its extinguishment concentration,
based on cup burner tests, is 7.0 per cent, while its cardiotoxic level (LOAEL) is 2.5 per cent in the dog, with no effect
(NOAEL) apparent at 1.0 per cent.

Actual exposures were assessed using personal monitoring devices, and the Agency concludes that likely exposure
levels from its use as a streaming agent do not exceed safe levels when used in a well ventilated area. The manufacturer
of portable extinguishers using these agents should include cautionary language on the label indicating the need
for ventilation.

This agent is subject to regulations under section 610(d) of the CAA, which stipulates that HCFCs may only be used in
portable fire extinguishers where other commercially available agents are not as effective for the fire hazard.
Under section 610(d), HCFCs may not be used in residential extinguishers.



(b) [HCFC Blend] C._[HCFC Blend] C is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. 

This agent is a proprietary blend of HCFC-123, HCFC-124, HCFC-134a, and an additive. The cardiotoxic
LOAEL and NOAEL for HCFC-123 is, respectively, 2.0 per cent and 1.0 per cent; the LOAEL and NOAEL for HCFC-124
is 2.5 per cent and 1.0 per cent; and the LOAEL and NOAEL for HCFC-134a is 8.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively.
While the manufacturer may, in the future, conduct personal monitoring studies of actual exposure levels of this
agent, previous studies conducted for pure HCFC-123 and for pure HCFC-124 have shown that exposure in
the breathing zone does not exceed cardiotoxicity values.

The ODP of both HCFC-123 and HCFC-124 is 0.02 while HCFC-134a has no ODP since it contains no chlorine.
The respective GWP values for HCFC-123, HCFC-124, and HCFC-134a are 90, 440, and 1200, relative
to CO

2

, while their respective atmospheric lifetimes are 2 years, 7 years and 16 years.

This agent is subject to regulations under section 610(d) of the CAA, which stipulates that HCFCs may only be used in
portable fire extinguishers where other commercially available agents are not as effective for the fire hazard.
Under section 610(d), HCFCs may not be used in residential extinguishers.


(c) [HCFC Blend] D._[HCFC Blend] D is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute.

 This blend is comprised of HCFC-123 plus a proprietary additive, and is intended for large outdoor uses such
as wheeled extinguishers, HCFC-123 is currently listed as acceptable for use in non-residential streaming
applications. This agent is subject to regulations under section 610(d) of the CAA, which stipulates that HCFCs may
only be used in portable fire extinguishers where other commercially available agents are not as effective for the
fire hazard. Under section 610(d), HCFCs may not be used in residential extinguishers.


(d) Gelled Halocarbon/Dry Chemical Suspension (formerly Powdered Aerosol B)._Gelled Halocarbon/Dry Chemical
Suspension is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute.

 This class of agents is comprised of a variety of blends developed for particular markets. Each blend contains one
or more halocarbons, a dry chemical, and a gel which keeps the powder and gas uniform. Both the halocarbon and the dry
chemical act on the fire, while the gel is consumed by the fire.
EPA's acceptability listing is extended to any blend comprised of a halocarbon with a cardiotoxic LOAEL of at least
2.0 per cent, in combination with a dry chemical or multipurpose dry chemical that is currently widely used, including
monoammonium phosphate (ABC powder), potassium bicarbonate (Purple K powder), and sodium bicarbonate. This listing
decision also includes ammonium polyphosphate.
The manufacturer of this technology proposes using several different halocarbons singly and in blends, in combination
with one of several dry chemicals or multipurpose dry chemical powders. The halocarbons included in the SNAP submission
include HFC-227ea, HFC-125, HFC-134a, and HFC-125 blended with HFC-134a. The cardiotoxic
LOAEL and NOAEL of HFC-227ea is, respectively, 10.5 per cent of 9.0 per cent; the LOAEL and NOAEL of HFC-125
is 10.0 per cent and 7.5 per cent; and the LOAEL and NOAEL of HFC-134a is 8.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively.
Previous personal monitoring tests of streaming agents using pure HCFC-123 (LOAEL 2.0 per cent; NOAEL 1.0 per
cent) and HCFC-124 (LOAEL 2.5 per cent; NOAEL 1.0 per cent) indicate that actual exposure to the breathing zone
does not exceed these values. Such tests with agents which pose greater risk of cardiosensitization indicate that
HFC-227ea, HFC-125 and HFC-134a can also be used safely in well-ventilated areas. In addition,
the quantity of the halocarbons in this technology is approximately half of what a pure halocarbon extinguisher would
contain and thus there is a built-in margin of safety as it relates to cardiotoxicity.
While all of the proposed halocarbons have no ODP, the GWP and atmospheric lifetime of HFC-227ea is 2050 and 31
years; of HCF-125 is 3400 and 41 years; and of HCF-134a is 1200 and 16 years.
The dry chemical powders proposed by the manufacturer include ammonium polyphosphate, monoammonium phosphate
(MAP), potassium bicarbonate, and sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate was among the original dry chemical extinguishers,
followed by potassium bicarbonate and monoammonium phosphate which were developed in the 1960s. Thus, these dry
chemical agents have been in use for decades. These powders have been considered generally nontoxic, although if
not used according to manufacturers directions they can cause temporary breathing difficulty during and immediately
after discharge. Discharge in large quantities may decrease visibility. These powders typically have particle
sizes of less than 10 microns up to 75 microns, with most being optimized at 20 to 25 microns. Ammonium polyphosphate
has previously been used as a fire retardant additive to products and coatings, and the manufacturer is introducing
it for use as a streaming agent.
Monoammonium phosphate, commonly known as ABC powder, is a general purpose agent which can be used for class A, B and
C fires. However, it is corrosive on hard surfaces. Potassium bicarbonate (Purple K) and sodium bicarbonate cannot
be used on class A fires, but are used for specific class B and C applications, generally in the commercial sector. Ammonium
polyphosphate is most suitable for military uses, because it is not corrosive.
An initial assessment of inhalation toxicology of fine particulates indicates that some risk is posed when the particles
are below a certain size compared to the mass per cubic meter in air. Particle sizes less than 10 to 15 microns and a mass
above the ACGIH nuisance dust levels raise concerns which need to be further studied should these agents be used in
a total flooding application. However, in a streaming application, it is unlikely that the exposure level will exceed
ACGIH dust levels.





The particle size distribution for these powders was analyzed with a Micromeretics Sedigraph using Sedisperse A-11
as the settling medium. Mesh of various sizes ranging from 40 mesh (420 microns) to 325 mesh (45 microns) is used to filter
the powders into a pan, thus leaving a `pan fraction' of powder particles which are smaller than 45 microns. A sample
of the sediment in the pan is mixed in the Sedisperse medium, which is a heavy, high viscosity fluid. An X-ray beam shines
through the sample and counts the particles as they drift down.
Using this method, 50 to 75 per cent of the monoammonium phosphate is smaller than 45 microns. Of that portion which
is smaller than 45 microns, the median particle size is 20 microns, with 19.5 per cent of the particles being smaller
than 10 microns, and 3.0 per cent being smaller than five microns. Thus, up to 15 per cent (.75 x .195) of the entire
MAP product is smaller than 10 microns.
Seventy-four to 88 per cent of the potassium bicarbonate is smaller than 45 microns, with a median size of the pan fraction
being 17.4 microns. With 28.4 per cent of the pan fraction being ten microns in size, then up to 25 per cent (.284 x 88)
of the total potassium bicarbonate product is under ten microns. 11.3 per cent of the pan fraction is under five microns.

<PARENT> FR940826-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Seventy-five to ninety per cent of the sodium bicarbonate is retained in the pan, and therefore is smaller than 45 microns.
The median particle size of the pan fraction is 15.0 microns. With 12.2 per cent of the pan fraction being smaller than
ten microns, then 11 per cent of the total product is smaller than ten microns. One per cent of the pan fraction is smaller
than five microns.





The manufacturer's data indicate that there are two mixtures of ammonium polyphosphate. The P40 mixture has a particle
size distribution with 50% of the particles less than 10 microns. The intended market for this agent is military applications.
The P30 mixture has a distribution with 20% of particles less than 10 microns and 50% less than 30 microns. The intended
market for this agent is for use in domestic and industrial kitchens.








E. Sterilants






1. EtO/CO

2

 Systems





In the March 18, 1994 Final Rulemaking, EPA described ethylene oxide/carbon dioxide (EtO)/CO

2

) substitutes for use in medical sterilization. Recently, the Agency has become aware of more information concerning
the design and use of EtO/CO

2

 systems, which is described in this Notice.


EtO/CO

2

 is stored in tanks as a liquified compressed gas mixture. A tube in the tank draws the liquid mixture from the bottom
for use as a sterilant. By Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations, the tank can be filled with liquid to only
60 per cent of its capacity. The remaining 40 per cent capacity above the liquid is called the ``headspace.''





Liquified compressed gases will vaporize into the headspace of a tank until equilibrium is reached. Each gas in a mixture
vaporizes at its own specific rate. In EtO/CO

2

 systems, the CO

2

 vaporizes much more readily than does the EtO. The CO

2

 vaporizes to fill the headspace, and virtually all the EtO remains in the liquid mixture.




The starting liquid/compressed gas mixture is 8.5 per cent EtO and 91.5 per cent CO

2

. When a tank is filled, some CO

2

 vaporizes to fill the headspace. Because the liquid mixture loses some CO

2

 to form this vapor, the percentage of EtO in the mixture is now greater than 8.5 per cent. As liquid leaves the tank, the
headspace increases. More CO

2

 continues to vaporize into the headspace and the percentage of EtO in the remaining liquid mixture continues to increase.
This results in a liquid mixture that grows increasingly EtO-rich until the liquid is fully depleted. At a certain
point during depletion, the percentage of EtO in the liquid mixture increases to a point where the mixture may become
flammable. 



Once the liquid mixture is fully depleted, only the CO

2

-rich vapor phase remains in the tank. If the depletion is not noted, the sterilizer could attempt a sterilization
cycle using the CO

2

-rich vapor. Under these conditions, the vapor will not sterilize effectively.



Two methods of supply control effectively address these problems. The first uses one-tank-per-cycle ``unit dose''
tanks. The second uses larger, multiple-cycle tanks and a weight-sensing system.




Unit dose tanks hold only enough EtO/CO

2

 for a single sterilization cycle. Unit dose tanks are available for several sizes of sterilizer chambers. After a
cycle, the depleted tank is replaced with a fresh one. Using all of the gas in one discharge avoids the risks of flammability
and ineffective sterilization which occur in multiple-cycle tanks. However, replacing the tank after each cycle
is inconvenient. It also increases the risk of accidental exposure.


A weight-sensing system uses the tank for more than one sterilization cycle. To be safe, such a system must sense when
a tank is depleted, before either the liquid mixture becomes flammable or when only ineffective vapors remain in the
tank headspace.






For many gas mixtures, a pressure gauge can indicate the amount of gas in a tank. But for EtO/CO

2

 systems, tank pressure does not change appreciably during tank depletion. As the liquid is depleted, more CO

2

 fills the headspace and keeps the pressure almost constant. But as a tank of EtO/CO

2

 is depleted, the weight of the liquid mixture decreases steadily.




A weight-sensing system monitors the weight of a tank as it is depleted. Before the increasingly EtO-rich liquid in
the tank becomes flammable, the system switches to a fresh tank. The depleted tank can then be replaced.



Such systems are designed with numerous safety features to prevent accidental exposure. One drawback is that, when
depleted, a tank still contains a portion of the original EtO/CO

2

 charge. If more EtO/CO

2

 were removed, the liquid mixture would approach the point of flammability.





2. New Listing Decisions

a. Acceptable

(1) [HCFC Blend] A





[HCFC] Blend A is acceptable as a medical sterilant substitute for 12/88 CFC-12/EtO. 

This is the second agent listed under SNAP that can serve as a virtual drop-in replacement for 12/88, enabling users
to transition away from CFC-12 without replacing their existing equipment.

Under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Agency is required to regulate any of the 189 hazardous air
pollutants (HAPs). Ethylene oxide is a HAP, and the user is alerted to follow all upcoming regulations concerning
the use of ethylene oxide, whether used alone or in a blend. Manufacturers and users are alerted to the fact that the
Agency has issued a Proposed Rulemaking which includes EtO used in all sterilizers except hospital systems (59 FR
10591, March 7, 1994).

This agent has been registered under FIFRA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


The information collection requirements for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program have been approved by the
Office of Management and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520),
and assigned OMB control number 2501-0013. This interim rule does not contain additional information collection
requirements. 


II. Background 


The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) was enacted under title II (42 U.S.C. 12701-12839) of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (Pub. L. 101-625, approved November 28, 1990). Implementing regulations
for the HOME Program are at 24 CFR part 92. 
The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) included
a substantial number of amendments to the HOME program. These amendments were implemented in rules published on December
22, 1992 (57 FR 60960), June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34130), and April 19, 1994 (59 FR 18626). 
The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (MHPDRA) (Pub. L. 102-233, approved April
11, 1994) included an additional number of amendments to the HOME Program. The following discussion, arranged according
to the sequence of the MHPDRA sections, summarizes the changes made to the HOME program regulation in this interim
rule. 
Section 201 of MHPDRA amends section 104(2) of NAHA to allow governors to designate State agencies or instrumentalities
of the State (e.g., housing finance agencies or housing authorities) to administer HOME Program funds. Prior to this
change, a subrecipient agreement was required between the State and its instrumentality to administer the HOME funds.
This amendment provides greater flexibility to designate such an organization to run the program and the definition
of State in  92.2 is amended accordingly. 
Section 202 of MHPDRA amends section 214(1) of NAHA which required that at least 90 percent of the HOME funds invested
in rental housing be for units occupied by families below 60 percent of median income. This amendment changes the requirement
to say that at least 90 percent of the units assisted, and in the case of tenant-based rental assistance, the families
assisted be below 60 percent of median income. This amendment, as implemented through  92.216, will simplify
the targeting requirement since it is easier to count units than funds invested. 
Section 203 of MHPDRA amends section 215(b) of NAHA in two ways. The first change is the elimination of the ``first-time''
designation for homebuyers. The HCDA 1992 amendment broadened the eligibility of ``first-time'' homebuyers to
include almost all low-income homebuyers. By eliminating the designation, participating jurisdictions will not
have to document the statutory category under which income-eligible homebuyers qualify. The change will also conform
the HOME Program to the CDBG Program, which does not restrict homebuyer assistance to first-time homebuyers. 
The second change would permit participating jurisdictions to use funds recaptured from the sale of homebuyer units
for any eligible HOME cost. The provision formerly limited the use of the recaptured funds to assistance for additional
first-time homebuyers. This change will effect the use of current and future recaptured funds. Conforming changes
have been made to   92.2, 92.61(b)(4), 92.150(b)(4), 92.205(a)(1), 92.206(b), 92.214(a)(7), 92.254(a),
and 92.354 to implement the new homebuyer requirements. 
Section 204 of MHPDRA amends section 220(a) of NAHA to effect a flat 25 percent match on all funds drawn down for HOME
projects or tenant-based rental assistance. This provision eliminates the 30 percent match of funds drawn down for
new construction. This new, lower match rate will be applied to all Fiscal Year 1993 funds currently expended or future
year funds drawn down for eligible HOME activities, and  92.218 has been changed accordingly. 
The new environmental provisions make three amendments to section 288 of NAHA which are implemented for the HOME Program
by  92.352, for Subpart M_HOME Funds for Indian Tribes at  92.633, and also by revisions to HUD regulations
in 24 CFR part 58, which govern the assumption of environmental responsibilities by recipients under the HOME program
and other programs with similar statutory authority for recipient environmental reviews. The first amendment provides
for assumption of HUD's environmental review responsibilities by all jurisdictions receiving assistance under
the HOME Program, not just participating jurisdictions, as well as Indian tribes and insular areas. 
The second amendment to Section 288 makes HOME environmental review procedures consistent with the procedures under
the Community Development Block Grant and McKinney Act homeless assistance programs with regard to States' responsibilities.
Where a State makes funds available to a unit of general local government, the State would perform the release of funds
function otherwise performed by HUD, and local governments would assume the responsibility for performing environmental
reviews. To the extent that the State would be using the HOME funds directly, HUD would approve the request for release
of funds.

Third, a new paragraph,  58.77(d), is added to part 58, which adds the new statutory provisions for monitoring,
training, and termination or suspension of assumption of review responsibilities. 
The amendments to 24 CFR part 58 in this interim rule contain changes consistent with the above changes in part 92. 
In addition, Section 305 of MHPDRA amends Section 1011 of the HCDA 1992 to provide that for purposes of environmental
review, decisionmaking and action, certain grants for lead-based paint hazard reduction and abatement shall be
treated as assistance under the HOME Investment Partnership Act and shall be subject to HUD's regulations implementing
section 288 of that Act. In other words, recipients of these lead-based paint grants will assume environmental responsibilities
to the same extent as recipients under the HOME program and will be subject to 24 CFR part 58. The grants covered by this
provision are lead-based paint hazard reduction grants under section 1011, as well as grants to States and units of
general local government for abatement of lead-based paint and lead dust hazards pursuant to title II of the Departments
of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992 (approved
October 28, 1991, Pub. L. 102-139), (92 App. Act). Accordingly,  58.1(c) is amended to reflect the applicability
of part 58 to these lead-based paint grants. 
Section 208 of MHPDRA creates a new section 290 of NAHA which permits the Secretary to waive certain statutory provisions
for PJs that are in federally-declared disaster areas under title IV of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and
Emergency Assistance Act and that will be using HOME funds to address damage. However, the Secretary may not waive
requirements related to public notice of funding availability, nondiscrimination, fair housing, labor standards,
environmental standards and low-income housing affordability. With regard to low-income housing affordability,
projects must meet the occupancy rent and periods of affordability provisions outlined in   92.252 and
92.254. It is the Department's intent to provide waivers on other HOME requirements based on the circumstances of
a particular disaster, tailoring the waivers to the needs of the participating jurisdiction. 
The Department is making a technical correction to  92.211(a)(2) to reflect the 1992 amendments to the Section
6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. Selection policies and criteria for a tenant-based rental assistance program
funded by HOME are considered reasonably related to the Federal preference rules if, at least, 50% of the families
would meet the Federal preferences. The change reduces the proportion of families required to meet the Federal preferences
from 70% to 50%. 
The Department is amending  92.254(a) to include the requirement that homeownership under a lease-purchase
agreement, in conjunction with a homebuyer program, must occur within 36 months. This addition serves to integrate
policy guidance enunciated previously to the field into the rule. The Department believes that 36 months should be
ample time for a homebuyer to resolve any outstanding credit problems, to complete homeowner education courses,
or build up sufficient equity for homeownership (especially since HOME funds can be used for down-payment assistance).
Lease-purchase arrangements in connection with homebuyer programs are not subject to the same occupancy and rental
restrictions as are HOME rental projects and, therefore, the Department is concerned that any longer lease period
would be contrary to the statutory requirements governing HOME rental projects. The Department would appreciate
any comment regarding this regulatory amendment, whether the 36 month period is too long or not long enough or whether
the time period should be determined by the PJ. 
The HOME Program regulations published April 19, 1994 made a change to  92.252(a)(2) designed to prevent ``Low
HOME Rents,'' as calculated, to be higher than ``High HOME Rents'' as a result of fair market rents in some regions.
The change was made to correct this problem by indicating that if the low HOME rents were higher than the high HOME rents
that the figure for the lower rent would be used for all HOME units. That change, however, has been interpreted as limiting
the method for calculation of low HOME rents, which was not intended. Revisions have been made to  92.252(a)(2)(iii)
to clarify this point.

This interim rule also makes clarifying changes to three cross-cutting program provisions in the HOME rule. First,
this interim rule amends  92.257, ``Religious organizations,'' to remove a reference relating to control
of wholly secular entities established by ``primarily religious organizations'' to rehabilitate or construct
housing which will therefore not be owned by such primarily religious organizations. The Department recognizes
the important role served by religious groups in providing lower income housing. This change conforms the rule to
the same principles and tests applied in the Community Development Block Grant regulations at  570.200(j)
and in the section 202 program for elderly housing assistance. This clarification is intended to indicate the availability
of no lesser role in the HOME program for entities established by a ``primarily religious organization,'' a term equivalent
to what the United States Supreme Court describes as a ``pervasively sectarian institution,'' one in which ``religion
is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission.'' 

Hunt 

v. 

McNair,

 413 U.S. 734, 743 (1973). 
Second, this interim rule revises  92.353(e) to set out the requirement that HOME participating jurisdictions
must comply with the requirements of a Residential Antidisplacement and Relocation Assistance Plan (Plan). The
change reflects a statutory amendment to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy made by Section 220(b)
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. A participating jurisdiction with a Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) must follow a Plan identical to its CDBG Plan. A participating jurisdiction that is not a CDBG grantee
must follow a Plan that meets the requirements of the applicable CDBG regulation (24 CFR 570.606(c) for a local jurisdiction
and  570.488(c) for States). A certification requirement related to this provision is also added to  92.10(c)(4).
On July 1, 1994, HUD published a proposed rule at 24 CFR part 43 (59 FR 34300) describing proposed changes to Plan requirements.
The deadline for public comments was August 1, 1994. 
Finally, this interim rule also amends  92.354(a)(2), regarding Davis-Bacon Act applicability. The change
is intended to make clear that construction contracts covering 12 or more units, disregarding the number of projects
involved, are subject to Davis-Bacon requirements. Also, dividing a single project into multiple construction
contracts for purposes of avoiding Davis-Bacon requirements is not permitted. 


III. Findings and Certifications 


Justification for Interim Rulemaking


The Department has determined that this interim rule should be adopted without the delay occasioned by requiring
prior notice and comment. This interim rule simply constitutes the implementation of statutory language with the
exercise of little or no discretion on the part of the Department and makes a number of clarifying changes to existing
provisons. As such, prior notice and comment are unnecessary under 24 CFR Part 10. This rule is being published as an
interim rule and not as a final rule because the HOME program regulation at 24 CFR part 92 has not yet been issued as a final
rule. 


Environmental Review


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office
of the Rules Docket Clerk. 


Regulatory Planning and Review


This interim rule has been reviewed and approved in accordance with Executive Order 12866, issued by the President
on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Any changes to the interim rule resulting from this review are
available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk. 


Impact on Small Entities


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the undersigned hereby certifies that this
interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because jurisdictions
that are statutorily eligible to receive formula allocations are relatively larger cities, counties or States.



Regulatory Agenda


This interim rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994
(59 FR 20424) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 


Federalism Impact


The General Counsel has determined, as the Designated Official for HUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,


Federalism,

 that this interim rule does not have federalism implications concerning the division of local, State, and federal
responsibilities. While the HOME Program interim rule amended by this interim rule was determined to be a rule with
federalism implications and the Department submitted a Federalism Assessment concerning the interim rule to OMB,
this amending rule only makes limited adjustments to the interim rule and does not significantly affect any of the
factors considered in the Federalism Assessment for the interim rule. 


Impact on the Family


The General Counsel, as the designated official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family,

 has determined that this interim rule would not have significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general
well-being. Assistance provided under this interim rule can be expected to support family values, by helping families
achieve security and independence; by enabling them to live in decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and by giving them
the means to live independently in mainstream American society. This interim rule would not, however, affect the


institution

 of the family, which is requisite to coverage by the Order. Even if this interim rule had the necessary family impact,
it would not be subject to further review under the Order, since the provision of assistance under this interim rule
is required by statute, and is not subject to agency discretion.

or not HUD takes action under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Certifying Officer remains the responsible Federal
official under  58.17 with respect to projects and activities for which the Certifying Officer has submitted
a RROF and certification under this part.

11. In  92.205, paragraph (a)(1) is revised to read as follows:



 92.205 

Eligible activities: General.



(a) * * *

(1) HOME funds may be used by a participating jurisdiction to provide incentives to develop and support affordable
rental housing and homeownership affordability through the acquisition (including assistance to homebuyers),
new construction, reconstruction, or moderate or substantial rehabilitation of non-luxury housing with suitable
amenities, including real property acquisition, site improvements, conversion, demolition, and other expenses,
including financing costs, relocation expenses of any displaced persons, families, businesses, or organizations,
to provide tenant-based rental assistance, including security deposits; to provide payment of reasonable administrative
and planning costs; and to provide for the payment of operating expenses of community housing development organizations.
The housing must be permanent or transitional housing, and includes permanent housing for disabled homeless persons,
and single-room occupancy housing. The specific eligible costs for these activities are set forth in   92.206
through 92.209.

Tenant-based rental assistance.



(a) * * *

(2) The participating jurisdiction selects families in accordance with written tenant selection policies and criteria
that are consistent with the purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably
related to preference rules established under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.).
Selection policies and criteria meet the ``reasonably related'' requirement if at least 50% of the families assisted
qualify, or would qualify in the near future without tenant-based rental assistance, for one of the three Federal
preferences under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. These are families that occupy substandard housing
(including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless families); families that are paying more
than 50 percent of (gross) family income for rent; or families that are involuntarily displaced. The participating
jurisdiction may select low-income families currently residing in units that are designated for rehabilitation
or acquisition under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program without requiring that the family meet the written
tenant selection policies and criteria. Families so selected may use the tenant-based assistance in the rehabilitation
or acquired unit or in other qualified housing.



* * * * *



14. In  92.214, paragraph (a)(7) is revised to read as follows:



 92.214 

Prohibited activities.



(a) * * *

(7) Provide assistance (other than tenant-based rental assistance or assistance to a homebuyer to acquire housing
previously assisted with HOME funds) to a project previously assisted with HOME funds during the period of affordability
established by the participating jurisdiction under  92.502 or  92.504. However, additional HOME funds
may be committed to a project up to one year after project completion (see  92.502), but the amount of HOME funds
in the project may not exceed the maximum per-unit subsidy amount established under  92.250.



* * * * *



15. In  92.216, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) are revised to read as follows:

(i) The families receiving such rental assistance are families whose annual incomes do not exceed 60 percent of the
median family income for the area, as determined and made available by HUD with adjustments for smaller and larger
families (except that HUD may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 60 percent of the median for the area on
the basis of HUD's findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction cost
or fair market rent, or unusually high or low family income) at the time of occupancy or at the time funds are invested,
whichever is later; or 

(ii) The dwelling units assisted with such funds are occupied by families having such incomes; and 

(2) The remainder of:

families described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) at the time of occupancy or at the time funds are invested,
whichever is later; or 

(ii) The dwelling units assisted with such funds are occupied by such households. 



* * * * * 



16. In  92.218, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows: 



 92.218 

Amount of matching contribution. 



(a) Each participating jurisdiction must make contributions to housing that qualifies as affordable housing under
the HOME program, throughout a fiscal year. The contributions must total not less than 25 percent of the funds drawn
from the jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund Treasury account in that fiscal year. 



* * * * * 



17. In  92.252, paragraph (a)(2)(iii) is revised, to read as follows: 



 92.252 

Qualification as affordable housing and income targeting: Rental housing. 



(a) * * *
 
(2) * * *
 
(iii) If the rent determined under this paragraph (a)(2) is higher than the applicable rent under (a)(1) of this section,
then the applicable maximum rent for units under this paragraph would be that calculated under (a)(1) of this section.

acquire the housing; 

(4) * * * 

(ii) * * * 

(C) The HOME investment that is subject to recapture is the HOME assistance that enabled the homebuyer to buy the dwelling
unit. This includes any HOME assistance, whether a direct subsidy to the homebuyer or a construction or development
subsidy, that reduced the purchase price from fair market value to an affordable price. The recaptured funds must
be used to carry out HOME-eligible activities. If no HOME funds will be subject to recapture, the provisions at  92.254(a)(4)(i)
apply. 

(D) Upon recapture of the HOME funds used in a single-family, homebuyer project with two to four units, the affordability
period on the rental units may be terminated at the discretion of the participating jurisdiction. 



* * * * * 



19. Section 92.257 is revised to read as follows: 



 92.257 

Religious organizations. 



HOME funds may not be provided to primarily religious organizations, such as churches, for any activity including
secular activities. In addition, HOME funds may not be used to rehabilitate or construct housing owned by primarily
religious organizations or to assist primarily religious organizations in acquiring housing. However, HOME funds
may be used by a secular entity to acquire housing from a primarily religious organization, and a primarily religious
entity may transfer title to property to a wholly secular entity and the entity may participate in the HOME program
in accordance with the requirements of this part. The entity may be an existing or newly established entity, which
may be an entity established by the religious organization. The completed housing project must be used exclusively
by the owner entity for secular purposes, available to all persons regardless of religion. In particular, there must
be no religious or membership criteria for tenants of the property. 

20. In  92.352, paragraph (b) is revised to read as follows:

(b) 

Responsibility for review.

 (1) The jurisdiction (e.g., the participating jurisdiction or state recipient) or insular area must assume responsibility
for environmental review, decisionmaking, and action for each activity that it carries out with HOME funds, in accordance
with the requirements imposed on a recipient under 24 CFR part 58. In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, the jurisdiction
or insular area must carry out the environmental review of an activity and obtain approval of its request for release
of funds before HOME funds are committed for the activity. 

(2) A state participating jurisdiction must also assume responsibility for approval of requests for release of HOME
funds submitted by state recipients. 

(3) HUD will perform the environmental review, in accordance with 24 CFR part 50, for a competitively awarded application
for HOME funds submitted to HUD by an entity that is not a jurisdiction. 

21. In  92.353, paragraph (e) is revised to read as follows: 



 92.353 

Displacement, relocation, and acquisition. 



* * * * * 



(e) 

Residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan.

 Each participating jurisdiction shall comply with the Residential Antidisplacement and Relocation Assistance
Plan requirements described at 24 CFR 570.606(c), or, in the case of a State-administered HOME Program, the requirements
at 24 CFR 570.488(c). These policies require one-for-one replacement of low/moderate-income housing demolished
or converted to another use and the provision of relocation assistance to lower income persons displaced by such conversion
or by demolition. 



* * * * * 



22. In  92.354, paragraph (a)(2) is revised to read as follows: 



 92.354 

Labor. 



(a) * * *
 
(2) The contract for construction must contain these wage provisions if HOME funds are used for any project costs (as
defined in  92.206), including construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12 or more HOME-assisted
units. When HOME funds are only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single-family housing, and not for any other project
costs, the wage provisions apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or
developer of the housing that HOME funds will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing and the construction contract
covers 12 or more housing units to be purchased with HOME assistance. The wage provisions apply to any construction
contract that includes a total of 12 or more HOME-assisted units, whether one or more than one project is covered by
the construction contract. Once they are determined to be applicable, the wage provisions must be contained in the
construction contract so as to cover all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the entire project,
including portions other than the assisted units. Arranging multiple construction contracts within a single project
for the purpose of avoiding the wage provisions is not permitted. 



* * * * * 



23. Section 92.633 is revised to read as follows: 



 92.633 

Environmental review. 



The Indian tribe must assume responsibility for environmental review, decisionmaking, and action for each activity
that it carries out with HOME funds, in accordance with the requirements imposed on a recipient under 24 CFR part 58.
In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, the Indian tribe must carry out the environmental review of an activity and obtain
approval of its request for release of funds before HOME funds are committed for the activity.

All comments received on or before the close of the comment period will be considered by the Administrator. This rule
may be changed in light of the comments received. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a pre-addressed, stamped postcard with those comments on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket
No. 27873.'' The postcard will be date-stamped by the FAA and returned to the commenter.




Availability of SFAR 



Any person may obtain a copy of this SFAR by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of
Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center (APA-200), 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC
20591, or by calling (202) 267-3484. Requests must include the amendment or docket number. 

Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future rulemaking actions should request a copy of Advisory
Circular 11-2A, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Distribution System, which describes the application procedure.





Background 




The FAA has authority to assess civil penalties not to exceed $50,000 for certain violations of the Federal Aviation
Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. App. 1301 

et seq

.), the FAA's regulations (14 CFR parts 1-199), and certain other statutes and orders. (49 U.S.C. App. 1471(a)(3)).
In the case of persons other than those acting in the capacity of a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman,
the procedures for civil penalty assessment actions are those contained in  13.16 and part 13, subpart G of the
FAA's regulations. The current civil penalty assessment process for these actions is outlined below. 


During the investigation phase, FAA investigative personnel ordinarily notify alleged violators of an agency investigation
by issuing a letter of investigation. This notification is described in FAA Order 2150.3A, the FAA's Compliance and
Enforcement Program, but is not required by statute, regulation, or that order. Following an investigation, a civil
penalty may be assessed only after notice of the proposed charges and an opportunity for a hearing. This process is
begun by issuing a notice of proposed civil penalty to an alleged violator (respondent). Section 13.16(c) delegates
the authority to the FAA's Deputy Chief Counsel and certain Assistant Chief Counsel in the regions, centers, and headquarters
to issue such notices. 



Respondents have several options to respond to the notice of proposed civil penalty. The person charged with a violation
is required to do one of the following: 

(1) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-upon lower amount. 

(2) Submit written information demonstrating that the violation did not occur, or that a penalty or the penalty amount
is not warranted under the circumstances. 

(3) Submit a request for a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including the amount of reduction along with supporting
reasons and documentation, such as records indicating a financial inability to pay the proposed penalty. 

(4) Submit a written request for an informal conference to discuss the matter with an agency attorney and submit relevant
information or documents. 

(5) Request a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of
Hearings. 


If a respondent does not respond to the notice of proposed civil penalty, or chooses to proceed informally in response
to a notice of proposed civil penalty, and the matter is not resolved, the FAA attorney then serves a final notice of
proposed civil penalty. The respondent must either request a hearing before an ALJ or pay the amount of the proposed
civil penalty, or an agreed-upon amount, within 15 days of receipt of the final notice. If neither a penalty is paid
nor a hearing is requested during the 15-day period, the FAA attorney serves an order assessing civil penalty, which
contains a finding of violation and assesses a civil penalty. That order is final and not appealable. 

On September 7, 1993, the Vice President's National Performance Review published a report entitled ``From Red Tape
to Results: Creating a Government that Works Better and Costs Less.'' That report included a recommendation that
the FAA streamline its civil penalty enforcement program by eliminating several of the procedural steps it takes
to issue civil penalties in certain minor, uncontested cases. The FAA has determined that streamlined procedures
would be most appropriately applied to those legal enforcement actions that facially appear to be simple and factually
straightforward. The SFAR adopts interim changes to the existing rules governing procedures and delegation of authority
that are designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the processing of civil penalty assessment actions
in these types of cases. The National Performance Review indicates that a streamlined enforcement process may reduce
costs, improve efficiency, and enhance safety by notifying individuals of certain violations and processing these
actions within reduced time frames.

In addition to shortening the time for initiating certain cases, it is expected that this test program also will encourage
prompt settlement of proposed civil penalties in these cases. The program will not eliminate an individual's opportunity
to request a hearing or otherwise contest a proposed civil penalty. This SFAR will be effective for two years, unless
sooner canceled.


Discussion of Rule


Scope


These regulatory changes initially will be tested in certain civil penalty assessment actions resulting from violations
occurring in two FAA regions (Great Lakes and Southwest) at three airports (Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport,
O'Hare International Airport, and Indianapolis International Airport). The program may be extended to violations
at other airports or regions during the duration of the test program.
In addition, the test program will apply only to alleged violations by individuals presenting dangerous or deadly
weapons for screening at airports or in checked baggage, for which a civil penalty less than $5,000 is proposed. While
the FAA considers these violations to be serious, the initial evaluation and processing of these cases tends to be
uncomplicated. Violations of weapons prohibitions, on the other hand, for which a penalty of $5,000 or more is sought
ordinarily are more factually complex and involve evidence of several aggravating factors. As a result, these cases
tend to be more difficult to process, and, therefore, would not be appropriate for handling under the test program.
The FAA does not intend to apply this program to complex civil penalty actions, including factually complicated cases
under $5,000.
If the program is successful in streamlining the civil penalty enforcement process for the cases described above,
the FAA will consider amending this rule to extend the program to include other relatively simple violations warranting
civil penalty action.


Procedures and Delegations


The test program will involve several changes to current enforcement practice. The test program dispenses with the
FAA's current practice of ordinarily issuing to the alleged violator a letter of investigation seeking information
about the alleged violation. Experience has indicated that in the majority of factually clear, uncomplicated cases,
the respondent often does not provide additional relevant information that is not already known to the FAA. The information
received by the FAA from local law enforcement offices regarding weapons violations at airport screening checkpoints
tends to be complete and beyond serious dispute. A respondent, however, will continue to have an opportunity to make
any statements and submit any evidence regarding the alleged violation following notification of the alleged violation.
FAA Office of Civil Aviation Security Division Managers and Deputy Division Managers, instead of FAA attorneys,
will initiate a legal enforcement action by issuing a notice of violation (NOV) to the respondent. The NOV will cite
the relevant facts and circumstances pertaining to the alleged infraction and will include a proposed civil penalty
amount. The authority to issue NOVs will not be delegated below the division level. By delegating to the Office of Civil
Aviation Security the authority to send the initial notification to a respondent of an alleged violation, the FAA
believes that it can reduce significantly the time currently expended before a respondent is given this notification.
The name and phone number of a security agent involved in the investigation will be included in the NOV in case the respondent
has any questions about the action being proposed.
The NOV will serve the same purpose that the notice of proposed civil penalty now serves under current procedures.
The NOV, however, will include the following specific information:
(1) A description of the alleged violation;
(2) The proposed amount of civil penalty;
(3) An offer of settlement of the case, if appropriate, as described below;


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00116 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) The name and phone number of an FAA security special agent involved in the investigation of the violation;
(5) Information regarding informal procedures; and
(6) Information on how to request a formal hearing before a DOT ALJ.
In appropriate cases, the agency may extend to the respondent a settlement offer to resolve the case immediately with
a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, on the condition that the penalty is paid or a commitment to pay is made within
30 days. In conjunction with the publication of this rule, the FAA will issue guidance on the exercise of its discretionary
settlement authority in these cases as well as other similar cases not covered by the test and evaluation program.
This guidance will be published in Appendix 1 of FAA Order 2150.3A, Compliance and Enforcement Program, and may be
changed during the test program.

The FAA believes that swifter notification of a violation, coupled, in most cases, with an immediate offer of settlement,
may encourage quick resolution of simple cases while, at the same time, having no negative impact on the effectiveness
of the enforcement process. The National Performance Review studied a similar program offered by the Federal Highway
Administration and found that approximately 40 percent of proposed civil penalties were paid in this manner within
30 days.

The provisions of this SFAR will not limit the respondent's rights in any way. An individual may choose to proceed under
the current informal and formal procedures, including requesting an informal conference with an FAA attorney or
formal hearing before a DOT ALJ. If the FAA and respondent are unable to resolve the case informally, or if the respondent
fails to respond to the NOV within 30 days after receiving it, a final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment
order (``final notice and order'') will be issued to the respondent. This document serves two purposes:



(1) It provides a second opportunity for the respondent to request a hearing on the record before a DOT ALJ; and

(2) It becomes an order assessing a civil penalty if the respondent pays the civil penalty proposed in the final notice
and order, or the respondent does not request a hearing in accordance with the final notice and order and fails to pay
the amount of the proposed civil penalty.

This streamlined process dispenses with the current procedure requiring a separate order assessing civil penalty
to be sent to the respondent when the respondent pays the amount of the civil penalty reflected in the final notice of
proposed civil penalty, or when the respondent fails to request a hearing in accordance with the final notice of proposed
civil penalty and fails to pay the amount of the proposed civil penalty. The final disposition of the assessment action
results from the respondent's act or failure to act upon receipt of the final notice. Issuance of a separate document
entitled ``order assessing civil penalty'' under the current procedures provides no additional rights or notice
to the respondent that is not otherwise given in the final notice and order under these procedures. Accordingly, elimination
of the issuance of a separate order assessing civil penalty under these circumstances will not alter the procedural
protections afforded respondents.

The final notice and order will be issued by an appropriate Assistant Chief Counsel. The final notice and order will
result in either a civil penalty assessment or a formal hearing.



Regulatory Evaluation Summary



Changes to Federal regulations are required to undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866
directs each Federal agency to propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. With respect to this rule, the FAA has
determined that it: (1) is not ``a significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not significant
as defined in the Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) will not constitute a barrier to international trade. Therefore,
a full regulatory analysis, which includes the identification and evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to
this rule, has not been prepared. Instead, the agency has prepared a more concise analysis of this rule which is presented
in the following paragraphs.

The rule establishes a test program at three airports. The program covers certain civil penalty cases against individuals
submitting dangerous or deadly weapons for screening at airport checkpoints or in checked baggage. The rule will
apply only to those cases that facially appear to be simple and are factually straightforward, and that are uncomplicated
to process. During the test period, the rule delegates authority to program office managers to initiate legal enforcement
actions and reduces the number of documents issued in this action. The rule is intended to streamline the agency's
civil penalty enforcement process of notifying individuals of certain violations by processing these actions within
reduced time frames.



Costs



There will be no costs associated with this rule because it consists only of changes to agency rules of procedure or
practice in part 13 of the FAA's regulations. The changes do not impose any new economic requirements on the affected
parties.



Benefits



The streamlined procedures will reduce the number of documents to be served upon individuals. Additionally, this
rule will likely reduce the time between the violation and the processing of the enforcement action.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by Federal regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if
a rule will have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order 2100.14A outlines
FAA's procedures and criteria for implementing the RFA. Small entities are defined as independently owned and operated
small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations. Because this rule will directly affect certain individuals
(who are not defined as entities), the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.



International Trade Impact Assessment



Because the rule only will affect certain individuals, it will not constitute a barrier to international trade, including
the export of American goods and services to foreign countries and the import of foreign goods and services to the United
States.



Federalism Implications



The rule will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government
and that of any state, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
The respondents affected by the amendments are private citizens, not state governments. Therefore, in accordance
with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation will not have federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule contains no information collection requests requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.).



Conclusion



For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory
action under Executive Order 12866. This rule is not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). In addition, this rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

(A) 

Delegation of authority

. The authority of the Administrator, under section 901 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, to initiate
the assessment of civil penalties for a violation of the Act, or a rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder, is
delegated to the regional Office of Civil Aviation Security Division Manager and the regional Office of Civil Aviation
Security Deputy Division Manager for the purpose of issuing notices of violation in cases involving violations of
the Federal Aviation Act and the FAA's regulations by individuals presenting dangerous or deadly weapons for screening
at airport checkpoints or in checked baggage. This authority may not be delegated below the level of the Office of Civil
Aviation Security Deputy Division Manager.

(B) 

Notice of violation

. A civil penalty action is initiated by sending a notice of violation to the person charged with the violation. The
notice of violation contains a statement of the charges and the amount of the proposed civil penalty. Not later than
30 days after receipt of the notice of violation, the person charged with a violation shall:

(1) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-upon amount, in which case either an order assessing
a civil penalty or a compromise order shall be issued in that amount;

(2) Submit to the regional Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel any of the following:

(i) Written information, including documents and witness statements, demonstrating that a violation of the regulations
did not occur or that a penalty or the penalty amount is not warranted by the circumstances;

(ii) A written request to reduce the proposed civil penalty, the amount of reduction, and the reasons and any documents
supporting a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including records indicating a financial inability to pay
or records showing that payment of the proposed civil penalty would prevent the person from continuing in business;
or

(iii) A written request for an informal conference to discuss the matter with an agency attorney and submit relevant
information or documents; or

(3) Request a hearing in which case a complaint shall be filed with the hearing docket clerk.

(C) 

Final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order. 

A final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order (``final notice and order'') may be issued after participation
in any informal proceedings as provided in paragraph (B)(2) of this section, or after failure of the respondent to
respond in a timely manner to a notice of violation. A final notice and order will be sent to the individual charged with
a violation. The final notice and order will contain a statement of the charges and the amount of the proposed civil
penalty and, as a result of information submitted to the agency attorney during any informal procedures, may modify
an allegation or a proposed civil penalty contained in the notice of violation.

A final notice and order may be issued_

(1) If the person charged with a violation fails to respond to the notice of violation within 30 days after receipt of
that notice; or

(2) If the parties participated in any informal procedures under paragraph (B)(2) of this section and the parties
have not agreed to compromise the action or the agency attorney has not agreed to withdraw the notice of violation.

(D) 

Order assessing civil penalty. 

An order assessing civil penalty may be issued after notice and opportunity for a hearing. A person charged with a violation
may be subject to an order assessing civil penalty in the following circumstances:

(1) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person charged with a violation submits, or agrees to submit,
the amount of civil penalty proposed in the notice of violation.

(2) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person charged with a violation submits, or agrees to submit,
an agreed-upon amount of civil penalty that is not reflected in either the notice of violation or the final notice and
order.

(3) The final notice and order becomes (and contains a statement so indicating) an order assessing a civil penalty
when the person charged with a violation submits the amount of the proposed civil penalty that is reflected in the final
notice and order.

(4) The final notice and order becomes (and contains a statement so indicating) an order assessing a civil penalty
16 days after receipt of the final notice and order, unless not later than 15 days after receipt of the final notice and
order, the person charged with a violation does one of the following_

(i) Submits an agreed-upon amount of civil penalty that is not reflected in the final notice and order, in which case
an order assessing civil penalty or a compromise order shall be issued in that amount; or

(ii) Requests a hearing in which case a complaint shall be filed with the hearing docket clerk.

(5) Unless an appeal is filed with the FAA decisionmaker in a timely manner, an initial decision or order of an administrative
law judge shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if an administrative law judge finds that an alleged
violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found to be appropriate by the administrative
law judge, is warranted.

(6) Unless a petition for review is filed with a U.S. Court of Appeals in a timely manner, a final decision and order of
the Administrator shall be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the FAA decisionmaker finds that an alleged
violation occurred and a civil penalty is warranted.

 This action is taken to implement Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The rules will promote
the development and rapid deployment of new technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the public, including
those residing in rural areas. These rules also will promote economic opportunity and competition, and disseminate
licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by members of minority groups and women. This action will result in recovery for the public of a portion of the
value of the public spectrum made available for commercial use.

I. Introduction 



1. By this action, we respond to petitions for reconsideration or clarification of the rules and policies adopted
in the 

Second Report and Order

 in this proceeding, which sets forth general rules for the use of competitive bidding to award licenses.

1

 Twenty-one such petitions were received, as well as eight oppositions and five replies. 





2. On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Budget Act) added Section 309(j) to the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  309(j).

2

 Section 309(j) gives the Commission express authority to employ competitive bidding procedures to choose among
mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses. The Commission adopted a 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

 in this proceeding on September 23, 1993.

3

 The 

Second Report and Order

 prescribing the required regulations was adopted on March 8, 1994. The Commission has subsequently adopted specific
rules for auction of narrowband Personal Communications Service (PCS) licenses,

4

 Interactive Video and Data Service (IVDS) licenses,

5

 and broadband PCS licenses.

6

 









3. The 

Second Report and Order

 established rules for determining what types of services and licenses may be subject to auctions. The 

Second Report and Order

 also set forth a range of auction designs and procedures, from which the Commission stated it would choose in establishing
procedures for awarding licenses in specific services. The 

Second Report and Order

 addressed a variety of procedural issues regarding announcement of auctions, filing of applications, bidder and
licensee qualifications, payment requirements, and penalties for default or disqualification, as well as safeguards
to deter possible abuses of the bidding and licensing process. In response to statutory directive, the 

Second Report and Order

 also identified provisions designed to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by women or members of minority groups (designated entities) are given the opportunity to participate in the
provision of spectrum-based services. 

4. In many cases, the appropriate auction procedures and rules vary from service to service. In the 

Second Report and Order

 we retained the flexibility to choose, from within a defined range, the appropriate procedures for particular services,
depending on characteristics of the service such as the likely value and interdependence of the licenses being auctioned
and the capital required to construct a system. We also retained the flexibility to alter our procedures in response
to our experience with different auction techniques. 

5. We dispose of all but two of the petitions for reconsideration of the 

Second Report and Order

 in this Order. We defer consideration of Brown and Schwaninger's petition concerning Finder's Preferences. We plan
to issue a Further Notice addressing the applicability of Finder's Preferences to auctionable services in the near
future, and we will consider Brown and Schwaninger's petition in the context of that Notice. We also defer to a future
Order consideration of MCI's petition concerning auctioning of BETRS licenses. 

6. The issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration fall into three categories: those dealing with the applicability
of competitive bidding to specific services and particular circumstances, those dealing with auction design and
procedures, and those dealing with the definition of the groups eligible for special provisions (the ``designated
entities'') and the nature of these provisions. We consider issues raised by these petitions below. 



II. Applicability of Competitive Bidding 



A. Cellular Unserved Areas 



7. Two cellular systems operate on separate frequency blocks in each cellular market.

7

 The geographic areas not covered after five years by the initial licensees are considered cellular ``unserved areas''
that are licensed separately. In 1991, we adopted random selection procedures to govern licensing of the cellular
unserved areas,

8

 and stated that we would revisit this decision to use lotteries if Congress authorized Commission use of competitive
bidding procedures.

9

 As noted above, competitive bidding authority was in fact enacted in 1993.

8. After receiving comment and considering the extensive record, the Commission indicated in the 

Second Report and Order 

that, unless specifically excluded, mutually exclusive applications for licenses in the Public Mobile Services,
including the Cellular Service, will be subject to competitive bidding if they were filed after July 26, 1993.
 We noted, however, that applications filed before July 26, 1993 present special issues due to the ``special rule''
of Section 6002(e) of the Budget Act.
 That rule does not require the Commission to award licenses or permits by competitive bidding if the license applications
were filed before July 26, 1993, even if the applications otherwise meet the criteria that would subject them to selection
by bidding.
 We therefore stated in the 

Second Report and Order

 that we would determine in a separate order how to authorize Public Mobile systems if applications were filed before
July 26, 1993.
 Subsequently, after thorough consideration of the record, we adopted a 

Memorandum Opinion and Order 

stating that in such situations we will award licenses for the unserved areas by random selection.









9. Petitions. 

We received three petitions for reconsideration of the provisions of the 

Second Report and Order 

related to authorization of the cellular unserved areas.
 John G. Andrikopoulos, et al. (Andrikopoulos) states that where applications for cellular unserved area licenses
were accepted for filing before July 26, 1993, the applications should not be subject to competitive bidding. Andrikopoulos
asserts that auctioning these licenses would be unreasonable, retroactive application of the Budget Act.
 The Houston, Dallas, Oxnard and Huntington Cellular Settlement Groups (Cellular Settlement Groups; Groups) assert
that the Commission should accept full-market settlements between mutually exclusive applicants for cellular
unserved area licenses.
 These Groups state that Congress intended the Commission to continue use of its existing policy favoring full-market
settlements, and express concern that the 

Second Report and Order 

appears to profit full-market settlements where licenses will be awarded through competitive bidding procedures.
 Finally, Thumb Cellular, a party to a full-market settlement agreement filed for a Detroit unserved area, asks the
Commission to process its settlement agreement immediately.









10. Discussion. 

The issues raised by these petitioners are fully addressed in the 

Memorandum Opinion and Order, 

which was released shortly after these petitions were filed. We stated in that item that we will grant licenses for
cellular unserved areas by random selection from the pool of applicants that filed lottery applications prior to
July 26, 1993, and we will permit full-market settlements among lottery applicants to avoid mutual exclusivity.
 Applications for cellular unserved areas accepted for filing prior to July 26, 1993 will not be subject to competitive
bidding. Accordingly, the issues raised by these three petitioners are moot.




B. Principal Use of PCS


11. Section 309(j)(1) of the Communications Act, as amended, permits auctions only where mutually exclusive applications
for initial licenses or construction permits are accepted for filing by the Commission and where the principal use
of the spectrum will involve or is reasonably likely to involve the receipt by the licensee of compensation from subscribers
in return for enabling those subscribers to receive or transmit communications signals.
 In the 

Second Report and Order 

we concluded that PCS service would meet the criteria for auctionablility.
 Millin requests that we reverse that decision and conduct further inquiry concerning the possibility of non-subscription
PCS.
 We consider and rejected Millin's arguments in the 

Fifth Report and Order 

in this docket, stating that the overwhelming weight of the comments in that proceeding, as well as our experience
with the PCS experiments that we have licensed, reflect that licensed PCS spectrum is likely to be used principally
for the provision of service to subscribers for compensation.
 We continue to believe that the record strongly supports the likelihood that PCS spectrum will be used principally
for the provision of service to subscribers for compensation. Accordingly, we deny Millin's request.

III. Auction Design and Procedures


A. Activity and Stopping Rules


12. Activity rules and stopping rules are intended to govern the speed and duration of bidding in an auction. An activity
rule encourages each bidder to participate actively through the course of an auction. Activity rules are intended
to ensure that simultaneous auctions with simultaneous stopping rules will close within a reasonable period of time
and that bid prices will convey meaningful information during the course of the auction. In the 

Second Report and Order,

 the Commission adopted a three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rule as the preferred activity rule when a simultaneous
stopping rule is employed.
 Under this rule the auction moves from stage I to stage II when, in each of three consecutive rounds of bidding, the high
bid has increased on less than some specified percent of the spectrum (measured in terms of MHz-pops) being auctioned.
 The auction will move from stage II to stage III when in each of three consecutive rounds the high bid has increased on
less than some specified percent of the spectrum (measured in terms of MHz-pops). The Commission, however, retained
the flexibility to decide whether to use an activity rule, and if so what type of activity rule to use. We described possible
activity rules, and stated the range of alternatives from which we would choose and the circumstances that might cause
us to choose particular rules. We stated that we would announce the activity rule to be used by Public Notice before
an auction.
 A stopping rule specifies when an auction is over. In the 

Second Report and Order

 we stated that, for simultaneous auctions, our preferred stopping rule was that all markets would close simultaneously
if a single round passed in which no new acceptable bids are submitted for any license. We retained the discretion,
however, to announce at any point during a multiple round auction would end after a specified number of rounds.

Petitions.

 Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC), the GTE Service Corporation (GTE), and the Association of Independent Designated
Entities (AIDE) argue that the three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rule is unnecessarily complex and should be
simplified or eliminated.
 SBC points out that the three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rule would require the Commission to track a large number
of upfront payments and eligibility levels, and notes that the software the Commission intends to develop to track
activity levels may not be developed in time. SBC states that allowing five automatic waivers, as the Commission proposes
to do, does not reduce the uncertainty and expense which the activity rule imposes and may make bidding strategy more
complex.
 GTE states that the upfront payment formula, when combined with the activity rule, unnecessarily restricts bidder
flexibility.
 GTE states that the activity rules limit the ability of bidders to revise their plans in the course of the auction, particularly
if information revealed during the latter stages of the auction causes a bidder to become interested in additional
properties. The activity rules, according to GTE, discourage qualified entities from participating as fully as
they might otherwise do, so that some licenses may not be awarded to the entity placing the highest value on them.

SBC urges the Commission to alter the stopping rule to allow the agency to issue a notice that bidding will close after
a given number of rounds.
 GTE and SBC ask the Commission to adopt a simpler activity rule, such as a requirement that bidders be active on a single
license in each round.
 AIDE urges that the activity rules be withdrawn, at least in the case of designated entities.
 Pacbell counters that the three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rule avoids delay, provides meaningful information,
and allows bidders the flexibility to react to that information, and that software is available to help ensure that
the Milgrom-Wilson rule will not be hard to implement.
 







14. 

Discussion. 

As we noted in the 

Second Report and Order, 

the decision to use activity rules and the choice among activity rules involve tradeoffs among the speed of the auction,
bidder flexibility, and simplicity.
 The petitioners raise no issues relating to activity rules that we did not consider carefully in the 

Second Report and Order.


 We see nothing in the petitions for reconsideration to cause us to change our opinion concerning the choices we made
among these goals. 






15. We do not believe that the Milgrom-Wilson activity rules will excessively restrict bidders' flexibility to bid
for desired combinations of licenses or cause licenses to be awarded to bidders who value them less than other bidders.
The rules were expressly designed to counteract the incentive to delay serious bidding that occurs in simultaneous
auctions, without unduly limiting bidders' flexibility to pursue backup strategies and to use new information.
 The restrictions placed on bidders at the beginning of the three-stage auction procedure are modest. In the first
stage, to retain full eligibility a bidder need only bid on, or have the highest bid from the previous round on, licenses
representing at least one-third of the MHz-pops he or she ultimately hopes to win. In the second stage, the bidder must
bid on, or hold the high bid on, two-thirds of the MHz-pops he or she hopes to win. Only in the third stage are bidders required
to bid on the full amount of MHz-pops they hope to acquire.
 Bidders may shift bids among any combination of licenses from round to round.
 Paul Milgrom points out that at the shift from stage I to stage II there will be no more than three bidders on an average
license, and at the shift to stage III there will be at most 11/2 bidders on an average license.
 Because the progression to higher stages imparts such information, it gives the bidders important signals concerning
the state of bidding. By stage III, bidding should be rapidly drawing to a close, and any major shifts in strategy should
already have been implemented. Bidders who believe that they may want to expand their purchases if prices are unexpectedly
low can guarantee their ability to do so by making a sufficiently high upfront payment. 







16. In the 

Second Report and Order,

 we also stated our intention to reduce the complexity faced by bidders by developing bidding software and making it
available to all bidders in auctions in which a Milgrom-Wilson activity rule is used.
 SBC expresses concern that the software may not be available in time. Software was in fact developed in time for the
July nationwide narrowband auction, and performed successfully in that auction. In light of that success, we have
no doubt that appropriate software will also be available for the remaining narrowband and broadband auctions. 




17. Finally, we remind petitioners that, in the 

Second Report and Order,

 we adopted the three-stage Milgrom-Wilson activity rules only as a preferred option.
 We deferred to later, service-specific Orders the choice of actual rules to be used in auctions for individual services,
depending, as discussed in the 

Second Report and Order,

 on the characteristics of the services and our experience with the conduct of auctions. In addition, we retained the
flexibility to decide on an auction-by-auction basis, and to announce by Public Notice before the auction, whether
to use an activity rule, and if so what type of rule.
 Thus, if experience shows that the Milgrom-Wilson rules are unduly difficult to administer, we may shift to other
activity rules, including the one recommended by petitioners requiring only that bidders be active on a single license
in each round. We also expressly retained the discretion, requested by SBC, to announce at any point during a multiple
round auction that the auction will end after some specified number of additional rounds.
 







18. In the 

Second Report and Order

 the Commission also retained the ability to speed up an auction by announcing at any time during an auction that the
next stage of the auction will begin in the next bidding round.
 In this Order the Commission wishes to make explicit that this discretion could be exercised by employing an alternative
rule for moving from one stage of the auction to the next. The Commission will announce by Public Notice prior to an auction
its intent to use an alternative rule. One possible alternative rule would be that the auction will move to the next
stage if in each of some fixed number of rounds, bidding activity is below some level measured as the ratio of new bids
(measured in terms of MHz-pops) to available licenses (measured in terms of MHz-pops). The ratio of new bids to licenses
may be a better measure of bidding activity than the percentage of total licenses on which the high bid has increased
(measured in terms of MHz-pops) because it accounts for the possibility that bidding may be concentrated on a few licenses.
In contrast, the latter measure indicates the same level of bidding activity regardless of how many bids are made on
a given set of licenses.

B. Suggested Opening Bid


19. In the 

Second Report and Order, 

we stated that in multiple round auctions the Commission will generally specify minimum bid increments to speed the
progress of the auction.
 The bid increment is the amount or percentage by which the bid must be raised above the previous round's high bid in order
to be accepted as a valid bid in the current round. We retained the discretion to use a ``suggested'' minimum bid increment
rather than a required bid increment.






20. In the recent nationwide narrowband auctions, it became apparent that the Commission may need further tools to
avoid unnecessarily long auctions. In order to expedite the auction process further, we also reserve the discretion
to establish a suggested opening bid on each license in addition to the minimum bid increment.
 Where we adopt a suggested opening bid, initial bids will have to be above the minimum bid increment but may be below
the suggested opening bid. Generally, we will establish suggested opening bids in the range of $.02-$.20 per
pop per MHz for each license. This suggested opening bid will provide bidders with an incentive to start bidding at
a substantial portion of the license value, thus ensuring a rapid conclusion of the auction.




C. Commission Discretion During Auctions


21. In the 

Second Report and Order, 

and discussed 

supra, 

we chose our primary auction methodology, but noted that no one auction design is optimal for all auctionable services.
We stated that we would adopt auction rules for specific services in subsequent Report and Orders, based on criteria
established in the 

Second Report and Order. 

We further stated that when we announced individual auctions for specific services, we would specify more detailed
procedures for those auctions in a Public Notice, but that those procedures also would be governed by criteria set
forth in the 

Second Report and Order

.
 Our rules also afforded flexibility with respect to some auction procedures, such as those governing the duration
of bidding rounds, minimum bid amounts, and stopping rules, and we stated that we might make decisions regarding such
matters during the course of an auction.






22. 

Petition. 

The National Association of Business and Educational Radio, Inc. (``NABER'') asserts that the auction rules do not
comply with the public interest and the Administrative Procedure Act
 because they allow the Commission to circumvent the normal notice and comment procedure, and that the rules prevent
providers of service from devising a business plan and auction strategy in advance.
 NABER states that the Commission should eliminate its discretion to change the auction rules or procedures during
a particular auction, that bidders need to know the rules which will apply for a particular service auction, and that
interested parties should have the opportunity to provide meaningful comment before the final auction rules for
particular services and frequencies are set.
 NABER asserts that should the Commission change bidding methods in mid-stream without prior public comment, the
Commission would violate the notice and comment rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, by
its failure to keep a record and analyze and consider all relevant matter regarding those new rules.








23. 

Discussion. 

We believe that the process we have used to adopt auction designs and implementation procedures and the rules themselves
fully comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. In the NPRM in this docket, we provided notice of the auction designs
we were considering and requested comment on issues of auction design and procedure. We received voluminous public
comment on these issues. In the 

Second Report and Order, 

we carefully considered all comments and suggestions concerning a wide variety of proposed auction designs, including
the comments and proposals of numerous experts in auction theory. We have established a broad framework for the conduct
of license auctions, specifying a menu of auction designs and procedures from which we will choose for individual
auctions. We have identified our preferred options, and have discussed the circumstances in which we believe the
various options will be most appropriate in order to serve our statutory goals, and which are therefore most likely
to be chosen. After the 

Second Report and Order 

was issued, we made, in addition, more specific choices of auction designs for particular services in Orders dealing
with those services.
 We have also established application, payment, and penalty procedures for individual services.
 The procedures, we believe, afforded members of the public all of the procedural rights to which they are entitled
under the Administrative Procedure Act.

24. Our rules, however, must also be flexible enough so that we can adjust our procedures to fit the circumstances of
individual auctions. We will not know until we have gained some experience with simultaneous multiple round auctions
exactly what values of such parameters as bidding increments and triggers for movement to the next auction phase work
best under what circumstances. Consequently, we believe that it is important for those running the auctions to be
able to use information generated in the early auctions and in the early rounds of individual auctions. Further, it
may be important to be able to respond to the behavior of bidders in the course of particular auctions. We may find it
desirable to allow more time for consultation between bidding rounds in complex auctions, for instance, or, in light
of the statutory requirement to issue licenses expeditiously, to increase the bidding increment to hasten the conclusion
of an auction if the auction is proceeding slowly. Clearly, notice and comment procedures would be unworkable in such
cases. The flexibility that our rules permit us is analogous to the 

ad hoc 

decisional authority that may be exercised within other types licensing proceedings, and our discretion here is
similarly constrained by the general framework and standards embodied in our rules. The latitude remaining to the
Commission to alter auction procedures is, however, necessary to ensure that we can make improvements as we become
aware of the need for them, and that we can manage auctions efficiently. The Commission will exercise its discretion
in a manner consistent with our clearly articulated goals and the general procedures we have established.
25. We have also taken care to safeguard bidders' interests. During the course of an auction only minor adjustments
in procedures are permitted that will necessitate no major changes of strategy on their part. Further, we have stated
clearly which procedures are, and which are not, subject to change during the course of an auction, so that bidders
will know what kinds of changes to expect and to prepare for. We have stated that when we announce auctions for particular
services by public notice, we will also announce the procedures to be used in those auctions.
 We believe that this approach will provide prospective bidders with ample information to plan rational bidding strategies.




26. Finally, although the Commission has never before used auctions as a licensing method, we note that our auction
procedures afford as much, or more, detailed guidance to bidders than is usually provided in advance of an auction.
For example, in conventional oral auctions the auctioneer customarily has the discretion to alter bid increments
and other procedures at will in any manner and at any time during an auction. As in other types of auctions, we believe
that it will be critically important to the success of our auctions to leave the Commission some discretion to fine-tune
auction procedures between auctions and, in some cases, on an 

ad hoc

 basis, during the course of an auction. Accordingly, we affirm our original decisions to adopt rules that afford the
Commission some flexibility to modify its procedures during the course of an auction, within the scope of the options
we have delineated and under the circumstances described above.



D. Treatment of Upfront Payments


27. In the 

Second Report and Order 

we required bidders to tender a substantial payment in advance of the auction in order to deter frivolous or insincere
bidding.
 Upfront payments were also intended to provide a source of funds for collection of penalties for bid withdrawal.
 The amount of the upfront payment was related to the level of eligibility the bidder wished to establish, measured
in terms of the population and amount of spectrum encompassed by the licenses on which the bidder was permitted to bid.
In some cases the upfront payment could amount to millions of dollars.
 We required that upfront payments be submitted prior to bidding, and we did not permit use of letters of credit or Treasury
bills for upfront deposits due to administrative difficulties in accepting payment in such forms, at least until
the Commission has more experience in conducting auctions.
 We stated that upfront payments made by a winning bidder would be applied to satisfy its down payment obligations,
and that losing bidders' upfront payments would be returned if they wished to withdraw from further bidding.









28. 

Petitions. 

GTE asserts that the Commission should adopt an interest-bearing evergreen deposit procedure for upfront deposits.
 GTE states that, since the Commission is not currently authorized to establish interest-bearing accounts, substantial
sums of money could be tied up in upfront deposits without any accrual of interest for substantial periods of time.
GTE asserts that maximum bidder flexibility can be achieved by allowing bidders to add or withdraw deposit funds during
the course of the auction. GTE states that the Commission needs to ensure that it has the requisite authority to permit
the accumulation and payment of interest.





29. AIDE states that when a winning bidder's upfront payments, less bid withdrawal penalties, exceed the required
deposit, the excess upfront payment should remain available for crediting to another auction or for refund to the
winning bidder.
 AIDE points out that, in the case of designated entities, the required deposit is only 10 percent. AIDE notes that the
Commission has stated that it will apply this policy for losing bidders, and as a matter of equal protection the Commission
should apply the same policy to winning bidders with excess upfront payments.






30. AIDE requests clarification of footnote 133 in the 

Second Report and Order

.
 Footnote 133 reads:




For example, an entity that is interested in bidding on several 30 MHz PCS licenses with a goal of providing service
to a population of at most 50 million should make an upfront payment of $30 million ($.02 x 30 MHz x 50,000,000). That
bidder will not be permitted to bid (at any time) in the auction, or be permitted to win, 30 MHz licenses covering more
than 50 million pops.

31. 

Discussion. 

Allowing bidders to add funds to upfront deposits in order to increase their eligibility level, or to withdraw funds
from upfront deposits, as GTE recommends, would add greatly to the complexity of the Commission's administrative
task. The Commission would have to keep track of changes in eligibility due to changes in upfront payments, as well
as to changes in bidders' activity levels, and would have to ascertain that fund transfers had taken place before permitting
bidders to bid at the levels to which the additional payments entitled them. Because of the short intervals between
rounds, delays in the transfer of funds would likely create problems for both bidders and the Commission. For these
reasons, we believe it is prudent to require bidders to submit upfront payments that represent the maximum level of
bidding that they anticipate before the beginning of the auction. Bidders can always ensure that they will be able
to expand their bidding above their originally anticipated level by submitting a sufficiently large upfront payment
and maintaining a high activity level.

32. We agree with AIDE that winners' upfront deposits, in excess of their required down payment deposits and any penalties
they may owe, should be refunded expeditiously. We intend to refund excess upfront deposits of all bidders as soon
as possible. We will not apply excess upfront deposit balances to subsequent auctions, however, due to the additional
administrative difficulty of tracking the funds.

33. With respect to AIDE's request for clarification, we clarify that footnote 133 means that in any round of the auction,
a bidder who has made an upfront payment of $30 million may bid on, or hold the high bid from the previous round on, 30 MHz
licenses in markets with a combined population totaling not more than 50 million. The specific licenses on which the
bidder submits bids may vary from round to round, but the total MHz-pop ceiling cannot be exceeded in any single round.



E. Default Penalty

34. In the 

Second Report and Order

 the Commission imposed a default penalty for withdrawing a bid after a simultaneous multiple round auction has closed.
 This default penalty was set at 3 percent of the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission,
or 3 percent of the amount of the defaulting bidder's bid, whichever is less. The default penalty would be imposed in
addition to the bid withdrawal penalty, which was set at the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the
subsequent winning bid. We stated that the default penalty was intended to provide an incentive for bidders who wished
to withdraw their bids to do so before the close of the auction. We stated that such a penalty was appropriate because
a withdrawal that occurs after an auction closes is likely to be more harmful than one that occurs before closing. We
stated that if a withdrawal occurs after the auction closes, other bidders will have little opportunity to revise
their strategies, and the likelihood will be lower that the licenses will be awarded to those who value them most. We
also stated that default imposes on the government the extra costs of re-auctioning the license.




35. 

Petition.

 AIDE asserts that the default penalty will produce a windfall to the Treasury if the winning bid exceeds the defaulting
bid by more than 3 percent.
 AIDE states that the defaulting bidder should pay no penalty if the second bid exceeds the defaulting bid by 3 percent
or more, and that if the second bid exceeds the defaulting bid by less than 3 percent, the defaulting bidder's penalty
should be the difference between the second winning bid and 103 percent of the defaulting bid.




36. 

Discussion.

 We believe that it is appropriate to charge the full 3 percent default penalty in addition to the bid withdrawal penalty
whether or not the winning bid in the second auction exceeds the defaulting bid. As we stated in the 

Second Report and Order,

 the function of the default penalty is to encourage bidders who plan to withdraw their bids to do so before the close
of the auction.
 The additional costs to the Commission and to other bidders of auctioning the license a second time, and the increased
likelihood that the license will not be won by the bidder who values it most, are incurred as a consequence of default
regardless of the level of the bids. Even if the winning bid is higher than the defaulting bid, we have no reason to believe
that it is higher than the winning bid would have been had the defaulting bidder withdrawn before the close of the auction,
nor have we reason to believe that a high winning bid compensates for the undesirable effects of default. Consequently,
we retain the default penalty as set forth in the 

Second Report and Order.




F. Disclosure of Bidding Information


37. In the 

Second Report and Order

 the Commission recognized the informational benefits to be gained from releasing bidder identities during an auction,
but concluded that such information should not be released because ``the risk of collusion and strategic manipulation
outweighs the benefits of the additional information.'' Instead the Commission adopted an intermediate approach
pursuant to which the bidder identification numbers and bid amounts for each bidder will be released at the end of each
round of bidding. This approach provides bidders with useful information without incurring excessive risks of collusion
and strategic manipulation.





38. 

Petitions.

 GTE and Southwestern Bell request that the identities of bidders be released during the course of the auction. GTE
requests that the identity of the bidder associated with each bidder identification number be disclosed during the
bidding process.
 SBC states that the Commission should announce both the identity of the highest bidder and the bid amount for each round
of the auction.
 GTE argues that a bidder must construct a strategy based on its own valuation of the spectrum as well as estimates of
its competitors' valuations and past bids, and that a fundamental component of this exercise is knowledge of who the
competitors are. GTE notes that the Commission's sole justification for not furnishing information about the identity
of bidders is a concern for collusion, and states that the 

Second Report and Order

 includes other mechanisms for minimizing collusion. GTE states that increases in available information raise the
level of competition and the efficiency of license assignments, and that access to bidder identification information
may increase revenue from the auction process while ensuring award to the bidder who most highly values the license.
 SBC argues that the decision to keep winning bidder identities secret creates an opportunity for collusive behavior
because cartels could coordinate activities and punish violators without detection. SBC notes that if the identity
of all bidders is known, the Commission and bidders need not be concerned with protecting bidders' identity. SBC states
that knowing who the successful bidders are affects other bidders' ability to assess the accuracy of their valuation
of the spectrum and allows them to ascertain that an aggregation of licenses is underway which might pose a competitive
threat. MCI states that because of the potential for bidder collusion and strategic manipulation, bidder identities
should not be revealed.








39. 

Discussion.

 Arguments in favor of disclosing bidder identities primarily turn on the value of the information in improving the
quality of bids. Some auction experts argue that bidders' estimates of license values can be improved by comparing
them to the valuations of their competitors.
 Bidders' valuations of licenses may also be highly dependent on knowing the identity of neighboring carriers, especially
regional leaders and competitors, and on knowing the manner in which complementary licenses are likely to be used
and the compatibility of standards both inside and outside their desired service areas. Maximizing information
available to bidders may increase bids by decreasing bidders' incentives to reduce their bids to avoid the ``winner's
curse,'' the tendency for the bidder who most overestimates the value of the item for sale to win an auction. Revealing
bidder identities may facilitate awarding licenses to those who value them most highly by providing more information
to bidders. More accurate valuation of licenses by bidders can thus improve the efficiency of license assignments.
In addition, publicly disclosing the identity of other bidders may encourage vigorous bidding for licenses. Releasing
bidder identities may increase interest in and media coverage of the auctions.

40. Our experience with the first narrowband PCS auction showed that preventing bidder identities from being revealed
can be extremely difficult. In addition, if some but not all bidders know other bidders' identities, those bidders
have an advantage in the quality of information available to them and in the potential ability to thwart others' bidding
strategies. Concealing bidder identities may give an advantage to larger bidders that have the resources to devote
to discovering other bidders' identities.
41. As we noted in the 

Second Report and Order,

 however, releasing the identities of high bidders may foster strategic manipulation, such as bidding up the prices
of licenses needed by rivals, and may facilitate collusion.
 Some auction experts argue that anonymity makes it harder to target a firm for strategic hold-up because the bidding
and aggregation strategies of specific competitors cannot be easily detected.
 Concealing bidder identities makes initiating collusive arrangements during the course of an auction more difficult
because bidders will not easily be able to identify the parties against whom they are bidding, unless those parties
voluntarily reveal their identities. On the other hand, concealing bidders' identities may not be critical to preventing
collusion during an auction; existing antitrust laws and the FCC's collusion rules should be adequate to prevent
collusive conduct. In any event, under an anonymous bidding scenario, if bidders want to collude they can simply disclose
their bidder identification numbers to one another before the auction.





42. Because of the advantages of providing more information to bidders and the difficulties involved in ensuring
that bidder identities remain confidential, we will generally release the identities of bidders before each auction.
However, we recognize that experts disagree on the potential for knowledge of bidders' identities to facilitate
collusion and other strategic behavior. Consequently we wish to have the flexibility to conceal bidder identities
if further experience shows that it would be feasible and desirable to do so. We may also wish to test the effects of releasing
identities of bidders. Consequently we are reserving the option to withhold bidder identities on an auction-by-auction
basis. If we decide to withhold bidder identities for a particular auction, we will announce that decision by a service-specific
auction Order. We will announce by Public Notice prior to each auction whether the identities of bidders will be made
public in that auction.


G. Standby Queue


43. 

Petition.

 GTE states that for 10 MHz blocks in broadband PCS the Commission should adopt the ``standby queue'' bidding mechanism
considered in experiments sponsored by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and conducted
at the California Institute of Technology.
 The standby queue allows parties seeking individual licenses to coordinate their bids in order to beat a bid for a combination
of licenses. GTE asserts that the standby queue would allow bidders seeking to combine smaller blocks into a larger
set of frequencies, or to combine blocks on a geographic basis, to obtain information about the status of bidding that
would permit them to bid rationally and efficiently.




44. 

Discussion.

 The standby queue is a mechanism to be used in conjunction with combinatorial auctions. In the 

Fifth Report and Order

 we concluded that the disadvantages of combinatorial bidding were likely to outweigh the advantages for auctions
of broadband PCS licenses, and we adopted simultaneous multiple round bidding as our auction methodology for broadband
PCS licenses. Nevertheless, we left open the option to use combinatorial auctions if simultaneous multiple round
auctions do not result in efficient aggregation of licenses, and if there are significant advances in the development
of combinatorial auctions.
 Although we have no current plans to use combinatorial auctions, if in the future we do adopt such an auction methodology
we will consider the use of a standby queue mechanism.




H. Filing Fees


45. 

Petition.

 William E. Zimsky (Zimsky) states that the rule imposing filing fees for the filing of short-form applications for
auctions should be deleted.
 Zimsky asserts that because there is no provision in 47 U.S.C.  158(g) for imposing the filing fee for the new
short-form application, the Commission lacks the statutory authority to impose such a fee. Zimsky also asserts that,
even if the Commission has such statutory power, to impose a filing fee on all bidders is unreasonable because the filing
fee was designed to recoup the costs of fully processing the application. Since only auction winners will submit long-form
applications and have their applications scrutinized, the losing bidders do not receive this service. Consequently,
the Commission's proposed scheme is unconstitutional, he argues, because a user fee which is not reasonably related
to, or a fair approximation of, the cost incurred by the government in providing the service for which the fee is assessed,
effects a taking of applicants' property without just compensation, in violation of their fifth amendment rights.
Zimsky cites 

Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc.

 v. 

Beckwith,

 449 U.S. 155, 163 (1980); 

United States

 v. 

Sperry Corp.,

 493 U.S. 52, 60 (1989) in support of his argument.




46. 

Discussion.

 The Commission has requested express statutory authority to impose section 8 application fees for short-form applications.
In the absence of such express authority, we do not currently impose fees for short-form applications. However, long-form
applications in most services are subject to fees under section 8. Consequently we find Zimsky's petition to be moot,
and we dismiss it.


I. Waiver Requests in Short-Form Applications


47. Cable & Wireless, Inc. (CWI) asks that the Commission reconsider its rules that appear to mandate dismissal
of the short-form application (Form 175) that do not certify compliance with the foreign ownership provision of Section
310 of the Communications Act, notwithstanding the filing of a request for waiver or other relief.
 CWI asserts that the Commission should permit participation at auction where the applicant certifies to the pendency
of such a waiver request. In considering the acceptance for filing of short-form applications, the Commission will
accept certifications that state that a request for waiver or declaratory ruling concerning the requirements of
section 310 is pending.






J. Rules Prohibiting Collusion

48. In order to prevent collusion in bidding, the Commission in the 

Second Report and Order 

stated, * * * bidders will be required to identify on their short-form applications any parties with
whom they have entered into any consortium arrangements, joint ventures, partnerships or other agreements or understandings
which relate in any way to the competitive bidding process. Bidders will also be required to certify on their short-form
applications that they have not entered into any explicit or implicit agreements, arrangements or understandings
of any kind with any parties, other than those identified, regarding the amount of their bid, bidding strategies or
the particular properties on which they will or will not bid * * *. After such applications are filed
and prior to the time that the winning bidder has made its required down payment, all bidders will be prohibited from
cooperating, collaborating, discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or bidding strategies
with other bidders, unless such bidders are members of a bidding consortium or other joint bidding arrangement identified
on the bidder's short form application.





49. 

Petition. 

BET Holidays, Inc. (BET) states that the above requirements prevent bidders from entering into any new agreements,
joint ventures or similar arrangements with other entities after filing a short-form application.
 BET claims that as a consequence bidders may be locked into bidding arrangements significantly before the commencement
of the auctions, and will be unable to modify their bidding strategies, consult with experts or others, or enter into
alliances with new parties any time after the filing of the short-form application. BET states that the collusion
rule is an unrealistic constraint on lawful business behavior. For example, according to BET, if a company does not
identify affiliates or others with whom it must consult, the company would be forbidden from soliciting research,
sharing resources, or discussing its bids until after the winning bidder tenders its down payment.
 BET requests that the Commission rely on antitrust law as a safeguard against collusion.





50. 

Discussion. 

While we intend to rely primarily on the antitrust laws to prevent bidding collusion, we believe that the anticollusion
rules in the 

Second Report and Order 

will provide an important tool that will enable the Commission to detect, prevent, and punish collusion. To prevent
and detect collusion, we believe that it is important to have clearly stated rules concerning the entities with whom
communication about bidding strategies is permissible. The requirement that an entity identify at the time of the
short-form application those affiliates, or others with whom it has agreements concerning bidding, and the prohibition
of communication concerning bidding with entities identified by other bidders, serve this purpose and are not particularly
burdensome. Similarly, prohibiting additional agreements and alliances concerning bidding between applicants
bidding for the same licenses, after applications have been filed and the identities of all applicants are known,
seems a prudent deterrent to collusion that should have only a minimal and temporary effect on bidders' flexibility.
We wish to make explicit our intention that the prohibition extend to post-application settlement agreements and
discussions concerning settlement agreements. 
51. We do believe, however, that our prohibition on communication among bidders and formation of agreements among
bidders after applications have been filed may have been excessively broad in that it includes communications and
agreements with bidders who are not bidding against each other, and so may prevent useful agreements that have no effect
on the competitiveness of bidding. Consequently, we are modifying our collusion rules, which currently prohibit
bidders from communicating with another after short-form applications have been filed regarding the substance
of their bids or bidding strategies and which also prohibit bidders from entering into consortium arrangements or
joint bidding agreements of any kind after the deadline for short-form applications has passed. In order to permit
certain bidders to respond to higher than expected license prices by combining their resources during an auction,
we will now permit bidders who have not filed Form 175 applications for any of the same licenses to engage in discussions
and enter into bidding consortia or joint bidding arrangements during the course of an auction. We conclude that where
bidders have not applied for any of the same licenses there is little risk of anticompetitive conduct and therefore
we believe that it is appropriate to relax our collusion rules to permit bidders in this context to have great flexibility
to increase their competitiveness in the auction by combining their resources, provided that no change of control
of any applicant takes place.
52. In addition, we now believe that entering into consortium arrangements or adding equity partners during an auction
may have a useful effect in enabling bidders to acquire the capital necessary to bid successfully for licenses. We
have concluded that formation of consortia or changes in ownership after the filing of short-form applications will
not necessarily have anticompetitive effects, provided they do not involve parties that might have bid against each
other and do not result in a change in control of the applicant. Consequently, we wish to modify our rules regarding
amendments to short-form applications. As a result of our experience in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction, we
believe that it is necessary to allow applicants to amend their FCC Form 175 applications to make ownership changes
after the filing deadline has passed, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant. Permitting
such amendments will provide bidders with flexibility to seek additional capital after applications have been filed,
whole ensuring that the real party in interest does not change. Accordingly, we will modify Section 1.2105(c) to permit
applicants to amend their FCC Form 175 applications to reflect ownership changes that do not result in a change in control
of the applicant, provided the parties have not filed Form 175 applications for any of the same licenses. Such changes
shall not be regarded as major amendments to an application, provided they do not result in a transfer of control of
the license or the applicant and do not change control of the company.

53. Situations may arise in which an applicant has some common ownership interest with another bidder. We wish to clarify
that, unless that other entity is expressly identified as an entity with whom the applicant has an agreement concerning
bidding, we will prohibit communication concerning bidding with that bidder, as described in the 

Second Report and Order,

 even if the other bidder is identified on the applicant's short form application as having some common ownership interest
with the applicant. We will retain the anticollusion rule as set forth in the 

Second Report and Order,

 with these clarifications. 

 

K. Information Disclosure by Applicants and Licensees 

 

54. 

Petitions.

 Two petitions deal with the amount of information auction participants are required to disclose. GTE requests that
the Commission require applicants to provide full ownership disclosure in their short form applications.
 GTE asserts that by enabling the Commission and competing applicants to assess the legitimacy of auction applicants,
full disclosure facilitates the award of licenses to qualified and eligible service providers. According to GTE,
full disclosure also promotes open and informed bidding decision. 

 



55. SBC asks that the Commission minimize requirements for disclosure of information upon transfer of licenses.
 SBC states that the point of transfer disclosures is to ``prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed
to issue licenses and permits.''
 SBC assserts that rules designed to prevent unjust enrichment should be solely applicable, if at all, to designated
entities that receive special accommodations, since the risk of unjust enrichment is high only in auctions where
such special accommodations are provided. SBC asserts that the formation of reasonable and efficient alliances
would be discouraged by the mandate to expose the details of the alliance to competitors. SBC particularly objects
to the requirement that any management agreements or consulting contracts be filed. SBC seeks clarification that
the disclosure requirements will apply only to the licensees which either have not begun to offer service or have only
offered service for some minimal period of time. 

 




56. 

Discussion.

 With respect to ownership disclosure in short-form applications, in the 

Second Report and Order

 we decided to require applicants to furnish only minimal information in short-form applications and bidder certifications
prior to auctions in order to reduce administrative burdens and minimize the potential for delay.
 Further ownership disclosure requirements, however, were adopted on a service specific basis in later Reports and
Orders.
 We believe that GTE's concerns are fully met by these requirements. 

 




57. As for transfer disclosure requirements, Congress in the Budget Act required us to develop and test alternative
auction designs.
 We noted in the 

Second Report and Order

 that in addition to allowing detection of unjust enrichment, transfer disclosure requirements would provide data
necessary for evaluation on our auction designs.
 We noted that the reporting requirements would allow us to monitor our compliance with the Congressional directive
in Section 309(j)(3)(B) to ensure that ``new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American
people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants.
*
 9*
 9*.''
 The information will be useful in meeting our statutory obligation to report to Congress on the outcome of the auctions.
 The information we acquire from transfer disclosures, including purchase price and other aspects of the sale contracts
and management agreements, will enable us to determine the ultimate distribution of licenses and the value of the
spectrum for particular uses, and will permit comparisons between licenses awarded with and without designated
entity provisions. Such analyses require collection of data from all licensees, not just from designated entities
or those who have not begun to offer service or have only offered service for a short period of time. As we stated in the


Second Report and Order,

 we do not expect the transfer disclosure requirements to be burdensome to licensees because the documents to be submitted
will have been prepared for other purposes in any event. Moreover, parties may request confidential treatment of
competitively sensitive information pursuant to   0.457 and 0.459 of our Rules.
 Consequently we will retain transfer disclosure requirements for all transfers of licenses obtained by competitive
bidding. 

 







L. Application-Processing Rules 

 

58. In the 

NPRM

 in this proceeding the Commission stated: 

 In order to avoid needless duplication, we propose that the following general filing and processing rules apply to
all PCS: Sections 22.3-22.45 and 22.917(f), and 22.918-22.945, 47 CFR 22.3-22.45, 22.917(f),
and 22.918-22.945. For those PCS applicants who file on Form 574, we believe that   90.113-90.159
of our rules, 47 CFR 90.113-90.159, could be used to process those applications with appropriate modifications.
 

 



59. 

Petition.

 AIDE asserts that the Commission acted improperly in proposing substantive PCS application-processing rules in
the 

NPRM

 because, it argues, such rules are outside the scope of this rulemaking, which is limited to implementation of the
competitive bidding requirements of  390(j) of the Communications Act.
 AIDE argues that the Commission's proposal of application-processing rules is legally insufficient to constitute
a valid notice of proposed rules, and that some of the rules cited have no immediate applicability to PCS service. AIDE
asserts that in the 

Second Report and Order

 the Commission failed to respond to the merits of the arguments concerning filing and processing rules in AIDE's comments
on the 

NPRM.

 AIDE concludes that the Commission needs to issue a supplemental 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

 to adopt license-processing rules for PCS. 

 



60. 

Discussion.

 The competitive bidding process is a means of assigning licenses, and rules and procedures for processing of license
application are an integral and necessary part of that process. The Commission adopted few filing or processing rules
in the 

Second Report and Order.

 Those rules that the Commission did adopt pertaining to the filing and processing of applications and certifications
were clearly proposed in the NPRM.
 The rules to which AIDE refers were adopted not in the 

Second Report and Order

 but in subsequent Orders establishing auction rules for specific services.
 We address AIDE's petition relating to those rules either in the Orders in which they were adopted or in reconsiderations
of those Orders.
 

 





M. Financial Qualifications

<PARENT> FR940826-0-00020 </PARENT>

61. In the 

Second Report and Order,

 the Commission stated that applicants filing short form applications would be required to certify that they are financially
qualified pursuant to Section 308(b) of the Communications Act. The applicants would also be required to certify
that they satisfy any financial qualification requirements for the service in question.






62. 

Petition.

 AIDE states that applying competitive bidding and payment requirements in addition to existing financial qualification
requirements disadvantages designated entities, who have historically been constrained by difficulties in capital
formation and financing. AIDE recommends that short-form applications not require and certification of financial
qualification. If an application become mutually exclusive, according to AIDE, the applicant's payment of its winning
bid would demonstrate that it was financially qualified. If the application did not become mutually exclusive, then
the applicant should have a short period in which to file any required demonstration of financial qualifications
by amendment.






63. 

Discussion.

 We believe that, in order to prevent the delay in bringing service to the public that might be occasioned by bankruptcies
or by prolonged financial negotiations, it is important to require licensee to have the financial ability to construct
and operate a system in addition to being able to purchase the license. Consequently we will continue to require applicants
to certify on their short-form applications that they meet any existing financial qualification requirements of
the services in which licenses are auctioned. We will not, however, impose additional showings of financial qualification
as part of the auction process.



IV. Designated Entities



A. Introduction



64. Several provisions of the Budget Act address participation by small businesses, rural telephone companies,
and businesses owned by women and minorities (referred to collectively as ``designated entities'') in the competitive
bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. Specifically, Section 309(j)(4)(D) of the Act,
provides that, in prescribing competitive bidding regulations, the Commission shall, 

inter alia,

 ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and
women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services, and, for such purposes,
consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures * * *






In addition, section 309(j)(3)(B), provides that in establishing eligibility criteria and bidding methodologies
the Commission shall seek to promote the objectives of ``economic opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that
new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration
of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural
telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' To promote these objectives,
section 309(j)(4)(A) expressly states that the Commission is required ``to consider * * * alternative
payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments, with or without
royalty payments, or other schedules or methods.''






65. In the 

Second Report and Order

 we adopted a broad menu of provisions that the Commission might employ to implement these statutory provisions. We
adopted general provisions and eligibility rules designed to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies,
and businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women were afforded the opportunity to participate in both
the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. Specifically, we provide that
small businesses (including those owned by women and/or minorities and rural telephone companies) that are winning
bidders for certain blocks of spectrum could pay in installments over the term of their licenses. We also indicated
that rural telephone companies may be eligible for bidding credits for licenses obtained in their service areas if
they make an additional infrastructure build-our commitment beyond any existing performance requirements. We
indicated that bidding credits may be available to designated entities on certain frequency blocks. In addition,
we retained the option of establishing set-aside spectrum in certain services, in which eligibility to bid may be
limited to some or all designated entities. Finally, we stated that we would consider the use of tax certificates as
a means of creating incentives both for designated entities to attract capital from non-controlling investors and
to encourage licensees to assign licenses to designated entities in post-auction transactions.

66. In the 

Second Report and Order

 we recognized that the provisions applicable to particular designated entities would vary depending on the nature
of each individual service. For example, we retained the discretion to modify our general designated entity provisions
for capital intensive services such as broadband PCS. In this regard, we stated that we would evaluate on a service-specific
basis the capital requirements and other characteristics of the service to determine the appropriate provisions.
We continue to believe that it is essential for the Commission to retain flexibility to select, and if necessary to
modify, the general designated entity provisions and eligibility requirements on a service-specific basis depending
on the capital requirements and construction costs of the particular service.



B. Rural Telephone Company Definition



67. 

Background.

 In the 

Second Report and Order,

 we adopted a definition of ``rural telephone company'' that includes independently owned and operated local exchange
carriers that (1) do not serve communities with more than 10,000 inhabitants in the licensed area, and (2) do not have
more than 50,000 access lines, including all affiliates.
 We stated our belief that a limitation on the size of eligible rural telephone companies was appropriate because Congress
did not intend for us to provide special treatment to large LECs that happen to serve small rural communities.







68. 

Petitions.

 Several parties filed petitions for reconsideration of the 

Second Report and Order

 requesting that we modify our standard definition for rural telephone companies. Petitioners' proposals include
requests that the Commission amend its definition of ``rural telephone company'' (1) to expressly include municipal-
and government-owned telephone companies within the ``rural telephone company'' definition in accordance with
the earlier Senate version of the Budget Act,
 (2) to define ``rural telephone company'' as a local exchange carrier with annual revenues of less than $100 million
or serving no more than 100,000 access lines;
 and (3) to include within the definition of ``independently owned and operated'' LECs that either operate 50,000
access lines or less serve communities of 10,000 or fewer inhabitants.








69. In addition, Blooston, Mordkofsky, Jackson & Dickens (Blooston) and South Dakota Networks, Inc. (SDN) request
that the Commission eliminate the term ``independently owned and operated'' from the definition of ``rural telephone
company.'' According to Blooston, this restriction is unnecessary to prevent the largest telephone companies from
taking advantage of provisions provided for rural telephone companies, since this same purpose is already served
by the 50,000 access line limit, Blooston argues the Commission should amend its eligibility rules to indicate that
they include the access lines of affiliates. Similarly, SDN indicates that the Commission should include ``and affiliates''
after ``50,000 or fewer access lines'' in the current definition. SDN maintains that the current language penalizes
holding companies structured to permit telephone companies to offer paging and other nonregulated services.

70. The National Telephone Cooperative Association (NTCA) requests that the Commission amend the definition of
rural telephone company to include any local exchange carrier with annual revenues of less than $100 million or serving
no more than 100,000 access lines. NTCA also indicates that the term ``independently owned'' should not exclude small
rural telephone companies that are affiliated with each other and that rural telephone company consortia should
be permitted. USIN similarly advocates a ``rural telephone company'' definition based annual revenues of less than
$100,000,000 or less than 100,000 access lines. According to USIN a revenue-based test is more accurate than net worth/net
profit test.

71. The Rural Cellular Association (RCA), South Dakota Network, Inc. (SDN) and NTCA ask that the Commission amend
the definition of rural telephone companies to include any independently owned and operated local exchange carriers
(``LECs'') that 

either

 operate 50,000 access lines or less 

or

 serve communities of 10,000 or fewer inhabitants. According to NTCA and RCA, the existing definition needlessly
excludes many small independent telephone companies that serve rural areas. SDN alternatively requests that we
revise the definition to include carriers with 100,000 or fewer access lines or up to $100 million in annual revenues.

72. Finally, Anchorage Telephone Utility (ATU) requests that the Commission modify the definition of rural telephone
companies to include government-owned telephone companies. According to ATU, such a modification is necessary
to achieve congressional intent. ATU notes that the Senate bill included municipally-owned telephone companies
in its definition of rural telephone companies. ATU's argues that the Senate Bill mandates special consideration
for rural telephone companies and directed the FCC to grant ``rural program licenses'' to ``qualified'' common carriers
and explicitly said that the category of ``qualified'' carriers included all state-owned and municipally-owned
telephone companies.
 As evidence Congress' intent to include these provisions in the enacted version of Budget Act, ATU asserts that the
Conference Report declares that the Senate's ``findings'' are incorporated by reference.





73. 

Oppositions and Replies.

 In its Comment on Petitions for Reconsideration, BET supports retention of the Commission's existing generic rural
telephone company definition.
 BET maintains that adoption of RCA's proposal to define rural telephone companies as LECs that have 50,000 access
or fewer or serve communities with no more than 10,000 inhabitants will allow large LECs that ``happen to serve rural
areas'' to qualify for designated entity provisions. In response to BET's Comments, RCA asserts that the ``independently
owned and operated'' requirement for rural telephone company eligibility will prevent large LECs from qualifying
for rural telephone company provisions. RCA also restates its request for an amendment to the general rural telephone
company definition to include LECs that serve 100,000 access lines or fewer.







74. In light of the Commission's decision in 

Fifth Report and Order

 in this proceeding, which adopted an alternative rural telephone company definition, NTCA argues that the Commission
should abandon its generic rural telephone company definition and instead establish rural telephone company eligibility
criteria on a service-specific basis. Alternatively NTCA proposes that we define rural telephone companies to include
LECs that have annual revenues not in excess of $125 million or that serve no more than 100,000 access lines.
 Tri-County Telephone Company, Inc. (Tri-County) supports SDN's proposed rural telephone company definition (50,000
access lines 

or

 serves no community with more than 10,000 inhabitants or alternatively 100,000 access lines or less).







75. 

Discussion.

 We are persuaded by petitioner's arguments that the current generic ``rural telephone company'' definition is overly
restrictive and effectively excludes many independently owned telephone companies that serve rural areas.
 In the 

Fifth Report and Order

 we departed from our generic definition of rural telephone companies in the context of broadband PCS by adopting a
definition that includes any local exchange carrier having 100,000 or fewer access lines, including all affiliates.
 In adopting this definition of a ``rural telephone company,'' we sought to achieve the congressional goal of promoting
the rapid deployment of service in rural areas by targeting only those telephone companies whose service territories
are predominantly rural in nature, and who are thus likely to use their wireline telephone networks to build infrastructures
to serve rural America.
 For purposes of our rules governing broadband PCS licenses, we indicated our belief that this goal could best be achieved
if we defined ``rural telephone companies'' as those local exchange carriers having 100,000 or fewer access lines,
including all affiliates. We concluded that this definition included virtually all telephone companies whose service
areas are predominantly rural.







76. For the foregoing reasons, we also believe that using the 100,000 access line definition as our standard rural
telephone company definition will better serve our goals of encouraging the provision of service to rural areas than
the definition previously adopted in the 

Second Report and Order.

 Accordingly, we will amend our standard definition of ``rural telephone company'' to include all local exchange
carriers with 100,000 access lines or fewer, including affiliates. In general, we believe that this definition will
more precisely capture those carriers that are truly rural in nature, while excluding the largest telephone carriers
that do not face similar capital formation problems. We believe that this definition will also better achieve Congress'
goal for fostering the development and rapid deployment of new technologies and services to rural areas by making
special measures available to legitimate rural telephone companies that require such provisions in order to meaningfully
participate in the provision of service to rural areas without giving such benefits to large companies that do not
require such assistance. Rural telephone companies that satisfy this definition thus will be eligible for rural
telephone company provisions in each service where such provisions are established.






77. As indicated above, Blooston, SDN and NTCA request that we eliminate the phrase ``independently owned and operated''
from the definition of ``rural telephone company.'' These petitioners assert that the ``independently owned and
operated'' restriction in the rural telephone company definition was intended to prevent large telephone companies
from taking advantage of rural telephone company benefits, but that this purpose is served by the access line limit.
In this regard, SDN argues that such language unduly penalizes holding companies of nonregulated services and entities
created by groups of telephone companies to provide equal access, SS7, and other services.

<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00132 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

78. We agree. The new 100,000 access line rural telephone company definition adopted above includes the access lines
of affiliates. Under the affiliation rules established in the context of broadband PCS, and adopted below as our generic
affiliation rules, the access lines of holding companies, parent companies or affiliates of rural telephone companies
that are not independently owned will be attributed for purposes of determining eligibility. This definition will
capture most of the independently owned rural telephone companies, while excluding carriers affiliated with the
largest LECs. In addition, we are concerned that the requirement that a rural telephone company must be independently
owned would unnecessarily exclude rural telephone companies that are part of a holding company structure. Therefore
we will delete the ``independently owned and operated'' requirement from our standard rural telephone company definition.

79. With respect to ATU's request that we amend our definition of rural telephone company to include municipal and
government owned telephone companies that are owned by governmental authorities, we do not believe that such a change
is warranted. ATU contends that Congress meant to mandate special consideration not only for telephone carriers
serving rural areas but also for all municipally-owned telephone companies, even those with wholly or predominantly
urban service areas.
 This argument is based on ATU's interpretation of the Senate bill which preceded the enacted Budget Act. ATU argues
that the Senate bill containing the prototype of a mandate for special consideration for rural telephone companies
directed the FCC to grant ``rural program licenses'' to ``qualified'' common carriers and explicitly said that the
category of ``qualified'' carriers included all state-owned and municipally-owned telephone companies. ATU further
states that the report of the conference committee that drafted the Budget Act declares that the Senate's ``findings''
are incorporated by reference.
 ATU also asserts that without the aid of special assistance it and most other state-owned and municipal telephone
companies will not be able to purchase spectrum licenses at auction because it is politically infeasible for them
to generate and retain enough surplus revenue to fund such investments, due to popular aversion to increases in taxes
or telephone rates.
 







80. As we indicated in the 

Fifth Report and Order,

 we are not persuaded by ATU's arguments.
 We can find no specific evidence that Congress intended the term ``rural telephone companies'' to include all state
or municipally-owned telephone companies. In fact, the preceding bill contained an explicit mandate for preferential
treatment of government-owned telephone companies that was deleted from the enacted bill. To the contrary, the fact
that an antecedent bill contained an explicit mandate for preferential treatment of government-owned telephone
companies that was deleted from the enacted bill could just as easily be interpreted as an indication that Congress
rejected such a rule. We also disagree that state and municipal governments are without the means to participate successfully
in auctions. As we noted in 

Fifth Report and Order

 such governments have substantial capabilities to raise funds through private financing, bond offerings and taxation.
 






C. Rural Telephone Company Consortia



81. 

Petitions

. Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS) requests that the Commission relax the eligibility requirements for rural
telephone company bidding consortia by 
(1) eliminating the 50,000 access line limit for rural telephone company consortium applicants; (2) allowing companies
with more than 50,000 access lines, directly or through affiliates, to participate in rural telephone company consortia
by demonstrating that more than 50 percent of their access lines company-wide (including affiliates) and over 50
percent of those in the proposed service area serve only communities with 10,000 or fewer inhabitants and 
(3) providing that all rural telephone companies in consortia with 50,000 access lines or less have the right to hold
up to 60 percent of the equity in the consortium. SDN and NTCA also argue that the Commission should allow rural telephone
companies to form consortia, since combining telephone companies would not alter their rural nature, so long as the
rural telephone company retains at least 50.1 percent equity and control.

82. USIN similarly requests that small businesses, including rural telephone companies, be allowed to qualify for
special provisions if they pool their resources into consortia, provided such consortia are controlled by designated
entities. According to USIN, if such consortia are not permitted, rural telephone companies and other small businesses
may be foreclosed from participation in the auction process and in the provision of auctionable services. USIN also
indicates that efficiencies and economies of scale are created by aggregation and thus special measures should be
provided to these entities who may be able to provide service most efficiently.

<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00133 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

83. 

Discussion. 

We deny the requests of TDS, SDN,
 and NTCA that we modify the standard definition of rural telephone company to eliminate or relax the access line limit
for rural telephone company consortia. In the 

Second Report and Order 

as a general matter, we declined to provide exceptions to our designated entity eligibility criteria for applicants
that are consortia of various individual entities, which in combination fail to qualify as designated entities.
 We found that such combinations, if they deviate from our standard definitions of designated entities, should not
be eligible for provisions expressly designed for designated entities. This conclusion was based on our desire to
provide economic opportunity to those entities designated in the statute and to ensure such entities the opportunity
to provide spectrum-based services. We concluded that establishing exceptions to our definitions for consortia
(even those wholly comprised of otherwise qualified designated entities) would undermine this objective by diluting
the economic opportunity for individual qualified designated entities. We also found that allowing applicants
to be formed from a combination of eligible and ineligible entities would invite attempts to abuse the designated
entity provisions by those not entitled to them.






84. However, in the 

Second Report and Order 

we noted that we may determine on a service-specific basis to allow a designated entity consortium to receive other
benefits based on equity and operational participation in the consortium by one or more designated entities. We retained
the flexibility to enable designated entity consortia to qualify for special provisions particularly where the
capital costs of a particular service are high and the formation of consortia is thus essential to foster investment
in designated entity ventures and to enable such entities to compete in the provision of such service. In this regard,
in the 

Fifth Report and Order 

we allowed consortia comprised of small businesses to qualify for all of the measures applicable to individual small
businesses provided each member of the consortium individually satisfies the definition of a small business. We
found that given the ``exceptionally large capital requirements'' associated with broadband PCS, allowing small
businesses to pool their resources in this manner was necessary to help them overcome capital formation problems
and thereby ensure their opportunity to participate in auctions and to become strong broadband PCS competitors.

85. As a general matter, we will continue to determine whether to permit designated entities to receive benefits based
on their participation in consortia on a service-specific basis, depending on the capital requirements and other
characteristics of the particular service. We modify the 

Second Report and Order, 

however, to provide that consortia may be permitted to qualify for any designated entity provisions (where each member
individually meets the eligibility requirements) on a service-specific basis, where the capital requirements
of the service are high. Where, as in broadband PCS, we will find that the capital requirements necessitate allowing
designated entities to pool their resources to help them overcome capital formation problems and thereby ensure
their opportunity to participate in auctions and in the provision of service, we may adopt rules allowing such consortia
to qualify for designated entity provisions.



D. Affiliation Rules



86. 

Petitions. 

Blooston and NTCA request that the Commission clarify the meaning of ``affiliate'' for purposes of access line aggregation.
According to Blooston, passive investments by a rural telephone holding company in other telephone companies should
not preclude eligibility for rural telephone company status, so long as there is no common control between the rural
telephone company and the other carrier. Blooston reasons that the common control definition is used in the auction
rules for small businesses' affiliates, has been used by the Commission when defining connecting carriers, and is
generally used by the financial community and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, Blooston requests
that the Commission amend its designated entity provisions to allow rural telephone companies to combine into consortia
and partner with investors without losing designated entity status so long as the majority equity control resides
with members who are rural telephone companies. NTCA similarly requests that the term ``affiliates'' be clarified
to indicate what organizational structures are permitted.

87. 

Discussion. 

In response to the requests of the NTCA and Blooston that we clarify the meaning of the term affiliate to indicate the
types of organizational structures that will be included, we amend the 

Second Report and Order 

to establish as our standard affiliation rules the same affiliation rules adopted by the Commission in the 

Fifth Report and Order

.
 Blooston specifically requests that we clarify the meaning of ``affiliate'' so that passive investments by a rural
telephone company in other rural telephone companies do not preclude designated entity status if there is no common
control. As described more fully below, under our affiliation rules a passive interest in another telephone company,
which does not constitute control of that company would not be considered an affiliation for purposes of access line
aggregation.





88. In the 

Second Report and Order, 

we referenced the SBA's affiliation rules for purposes of defining generally whether an entity qualifies as a small
business and gave examples of how the affiliation rules would be applied. In the 

Fifth Report and Order 

we expanded on the SBA's affiliation rules in establishing detailed affiliation standards for broadband PCS to be
used in the context of determining designated entity eligibility where our criteria are based on the size of the entity
seeking special treatment and require applicants to include ``affiliates'' when calculating their eligibility.
These affiliation requirements are intended to prevent entities that do not meet these size standards for receiving
benefits targeted to smaller entities.
 We believe that these rules are appropriate for determining affiliations generally, and therefore we will incorporate
these standards into our generic auction rules for purposes of determining all size-based eligibility requirements.
We summarize these standards below.

the applicant and all its ``affiliates,'' the following rules shall govern determinations regarding affiliation.
Apart from determining affiliation between the applicant itself and outside entities, the need to determine affiliation
arises where an investor has an attributable interest in a designated entity.
 In this context it is necessary for the Commission to examine whether such investor has a relationship with other persons
or outside entities that rise to the level of an affiliation with the applicant, and if so, whether the affiliate's
assets, revenues, net worth, number of access lines, or other applicable financial thresholds, when aggregated
with the applicant's, exceed the Commission's size eligibility thresholds.





90. 

General Principles of Affiliation. 

An affiliation under the SBA rules would arise, first, from ``control'' of an entity or the ``power to control it.''
Thus, under the SBA rules, entities are affiliates of each other when either directly or indirectly (i) one concern
controls or has the power to control the other, or (ii) a third party or parties controls or has the power to control both.
 In determining control, the SBA's rules provide generally that every business concern is considered to have one or
more parties who directly or indirectly control or have the power to control it. The rules, in addition, provide specific
examples of where control resides under various scenarios, such as through stock ownership or occupancy of director,
officer or management positions. The rules also articulate general principles of control, and note, for example,
that control may be affirmative or negative and that it is immaterial whether control is exercised so long as the power
to control exists.
 Second, an affiliation, under SBA rules, may also arise out of an ``identity of interest'' between or among parties.
 We adopted these same general provisions as our affiliation rules for broadband PCS and will also incorporate them
into our general affiliation rules.







91. In adopting these affiliation rules, we emphasize that these rules will not be applied in a manner that defeats
the objectives of our service specific attribution rules. For example, in the context of broadband PCS, our attribution
rules expressly permit applicants to disregard the gross revenues, total assets and net worth of certain passive
investors, provided that an eligible control group has 

de facto 

and 

de jure 

control of the applicant.
 Our attribution rules are designed to preserve control of the applicant by eligible entities, yet allow investment
in the applicant by entities that do not meet the size restrictions in our rules. Therefore, so long as the requirements
of our attribution rules are met, the affiliation rules will not be used to defeat the underlying policy objectives
of allowing such passive investors. More specifically, if a control group has 

de facto 

and 

de jure 

control of the applicant, we shall not construe the affiliation rules in a manner that causes the interests of passive
investors to be attributed to the applicant.





92. Applying these SBA affiliation rules, an affiliation would arise, for example, where an entity with an attributable
interest in an applicant is under the control of another entity. An affiliation would also arise where an entity with
an attributable interest in an applicant controls, or has the power to control, another entity. For example, if an
attributable investor in an applicant is also a shareholder in a large Corporation X, when should Corporation X be
deemed an affiliate of the applicant as a result of the shareholder's ownership interest in both entities? Under the
SBA rules and the rules we adopt here, Corporation X would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant if the shareholder
controlled or had the power to control Corporation X, in which case, Corporation X's gross revenues must be included
in determining the applicant's gross revenues.






93. For purposes of determining control, ownership interests will be calculated on a fully-diluted basis. Thus,
for example, stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle)
will generally be considered to have a present effect on the power to control or own an interest in either an outside
entity or the PCS applicant or licensee. We will treat such options, debentures, and agreements generally as though
the rights held thereunder had been exercised.
 However, an affiliate cannot use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over or relationship
with another concern before it actually does so.







94. 

Voting and Other Trusts. 

In a similar vein, we also borrow from the SBA's rules and our own rules in other services to find affiliation under certain
voting trusts in order to prevent a circumvention of eligibility rules. The SBA's rules provide that a voting trust,
or similar agreement, cannot be used to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of voting stock for the purpose
of shifting control of or the power to control an outside concern, if the primary purpose of the trust is to meet size
eligibility rules.
 Similarly, under the Commission's broadcast multiple ownership rules, stock interests held in trust may be attributed
to any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, has the sole power to sell such stock, has the right to revoke
the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will.
 Also, under the broadcast rules, if a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the
grantor or the beneficiary of a trust, the stock interests held in trust will be considered assets of the grantor or
beneficiary, as appropriate.
 Because we believe the broadcast rules provide more definitive guidance in this particular area, we shall use them
as a model for the general affiliation rules adopted here. Thus, for example, if an investor with an attributable interest
in an applicant holds a beneficial interest in stock of another firm that amounts to a controlling interest in that
other firm, depending on the identity of the trustee, the other firm may be considered an affiliate and its assets and
gross revenues may be attributed to the applicant.

95. Officers, Directors and Key Employees. 

Under the SBA's affiliation rules, which we adopt as our generic approach, affiliations also generally arise where
persons serve as the officers, directors or key employees of another concern and they represent a majority or controlling
element of that other concern's board of directors and/or management of the outside entity.
 Thus, if a person with an attributable interest in an applicant, through his or her other key employment positions
or positions on the board of another firm, controls that other firm, then the other firm will be considered an affiliate
of the applicant. Such affiliations may or may not result in the applicant's exceeding our size limitations. As this
rule reflects, for purposes of attributing the financial position of an outside entity in this context, officers
and directors of an outside concern are not foreclosed entirely from holding attributable or non-attributable interests
in an applicant. Whether or not such persons control the outside entity, we also do not want to prohibit these persons,
who may be experienced in the telecommunications, finance, or communications and equipment industries, from assisting
start-up companies by serving as officers or directors of the applicant. Thus, if such persons serving as officers
or directors of the applicant do not control the applicant or otherwise have an attributable interest in the applicant,
their outside affiliations (even if controlling) will not be considered at all for purposes of determining the applicant's
eligibility under our rules.







96. 

Affiliation Through Identity of Interest: Family and Spousal Relationships. 

Consistent with the SBA's rules, an affiliation may arise not only through control, but out of an ``identity of interest''
between or among parties.
 For example, affiliation can arise between or among members of the same family or persons with common investments
in more than one concern. In determining who controls or has the power to control an entity , persons with an identity
of interest may be treated as though they were one person.
 For example, if two shareholders in Corporation X are both attributable shareholders in an applicant, to the extent
that together they have the power to control Corporation X, Corporation X may be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.








97. Similarly, as under the SBA rules, we will consider spousal and other family relationships in determining whether
an affiliation exists. Under the SBA rules for determining small business status, for example, members of the same
family may be treated as though they were one person because they have an ``identity of interest.''
 Likewise, in order to determine whether individuals are economically disadvantaged, the SBA rules governing eligibility
for participation in the government's ``section 8(a)'' program for socially and economically disadvantaged small
businesses have special provisions for attributing spousal interests. The latter rules provide generally that
half of the joint-owned interests of an applicant and his or her spouse must be attributed to the applicant for purposes
of determining the applicant's net worth.








98. In the context of auction size-based eligibility standards at issue here, we begin by clarifying that our reason
for considering spousal and kinship relationships is not to determine whether the spouse or other kin of a women-owned
applicant actually is controlling the applicant, thereby violating our eligibility rules for woman-owned businesses.
Our rules do not embody any presumptions concerning spousal control in that context. Rather, our objective here is
to ensure both that entities are actually in need of the assistance provided by our rules and that entities otherwise
ineligible under applicable size criteria do not circumvent the rules by funding family members that purport to be
eligible applicants.




99. In formulating these rules, we need to consider also that, as a practical matter, it will not be possible for us prior
to the auctions to resolve all questions that pertain to the individual circumstances of particular applicants.
Furthermore, if we determine subsequent to an auction that a winning bidder in fact was ineligible to bid or to benefit
from special provisions, such as bidding credits, because of spousal or kinship relationships, not only will authorization
of service be delayed but, as discussed above, disqualified applicants may be subject to substantial penalties.
In these circumstances, we think that the public interest requires that we endeavor, insofar as possible, to establish
bright-line tests for determining when the financial interests of spouses and other kin should be attributed to the
applicant.


100. We have decided that, for purposes of determining whether the financial limitations in our eligibility rules
have been met, interests of an applicant's spouse to the applicant. This will resolve any concern that an applicant
might transfer his or her assets to a spouse in order to satisfy the financial restrictions that apply to eligible entities.
For example, an applicant could not transfer stock or other assets to his or her spouse and thereby dispose of interests
that, I held by the applicant, would render the applicant ineligible. Just as importantly, this approach will resolve
any concern that an applicant might participate in bidding by using the personal assets of an ineligible spouse, which
would defeat entirely the objective of providing special financial measures for designated entities.




101. In adopting this rule, we fully recognize that instances could arise in which, if all factors were considered,
attributing a spouse's financial interests to the applicant could lead to harsh results. As a general matter, however,
we think it provides a workable bright-line standard that resolves fully our policy concerns and avoids undesirable
ambiguity concerning the nature of our requirements. As in the SBA rules, however, one exception is clearly warranted;
this affiliation standard would not apply if the applicant and his or her spouse are subject to a legal separation recognized
by a court of competent jurisdiction. In calculating their personal net worth, for example, investors in the applicant
who are legally separated must, of course, still include their share of interests in community property held with
a spouse.

102. As indicated above, circumstances could also arise in which other kinship relationships are used as a means to
evade our eligibility requirements. Because we believe kinship relationships in many cases do not present the same
potential for abuse that exists with spousal relationships, particularly in terms of the ``identity of interests''
that are likely to exist between the persons involved, we shall adopt a more relaxed standard for determining when
kinship interests must be attributed to applicants. In this area, we shall follow the same standard that is applied
by the SBA when interpreting its ``identity of interest'' rule described above. Specifically, an identity of interests
between family members and applicants will be presumed to exist, but the presumption can be rebutted by showing that
the family members are estranged, or that their family ties are remote, or that the family members are not closely related
in business matters.
 For purposes of determining who is a family member under this rule, we shall use a definition that is identical to the
definition of ``immediate family member'' in the SBA's rules, 13 CFR 124.100.




103. In appropriate cases, an applicant should be able to rebut the presumption regarding kinship affiliations with
relative ease, simply by demonstrating that the applicant has no close relationship in business matters with the
relevant family members. Of course, should such business relationships arise with a winning applicant after the
auction, we might need to consider whether the applicant intended to circumvent the requirements of our eligibility
rules.
104. The affiliation requirement is intended to prevent entities that, for all practical purposes, do not meet the
size standard required for eligibility from receiving benefits targeted to smaller entities.
 We believe that the affiliation rules described above will accomplish this objective.





E. Rural Telephone Company Bidding Credits.


105. 

Petitions. 

NCTA, USIN and SDN argue that the FCC should retain the rural telephone company bidding credit provision adopted in
the 

Second Report and Order 

but delete the accelerated build-out requirement as a condition for receipt of bidding credits. USIN asserts that
bidding credits will not help attract capital when tied to such an expanded build-out requirement. According to USIN,
making bidding credits contingent on an accelerated build-out effectively nullifies the provision because the
commitment of additional capital for network build-out will reduce the amount available to finance the license price
by enough to offset any benefit conferred by the availability of the credit.
 SDN agrees that additional build-out should not be required as a prerequisite for rural telephone company bidding
credits, but states that a rural telephone company should receive additional bidding credits if it substantially
covers its certified rural service area during its license term.
 NTCA argues that the accelerated build-out requirement for bidding credits should be eliminated since this requirement
is unrelated to the statutory purpose of promoting investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services
in rural areas.








106. SDN also contends that the risk of forfeiting the bidding credit (plus interest) for failure to meet the expanded
build-out commitment will have a chilling effect because of the difficulty of anticipating potential problems that
may be encountered in attempting to extend service rapidly to remote areas. Further, SDN maintains that an accelerated
build-out requirement could engender a perverse incentive for a rural telephone company that would otherwise concentrate
primarily on providing PCS service in the rural portions of a BTA or MTA (which, according to SDN might be a commercially-attractive
strategy because of in densely-populated areas.






107. Finally, SDN and USIN contend that it is inequitable to provide rural telephone companies with a less favorable
bidding credit provision than other designated entities. In this regard, USIN argues that the 

Second Report and Order 

fails to explain why rural telephone company bidding credits should contain more restrictive terms than other designated
entity bidding credits. On the contrary, SDN contends that rural telephone companies should receive a greater bidding
credit than other entities, because they face higher service and construction costs. Accordingly, SDN maintains
that if accelerated build-out is to be included in the rural telephone company provision, an incentive should be provided
in the form of bonus credit over and above the standard bidding credit available to other designated entities.

108. 

Discussion. 

In the 

Second Report and Order 

we adopted a system of bidding credits for rural telephone companies designed to further promote the investment in
and rapid deployment of new technologies and services in rural areas.
 We generally concluded that any special measures adopted for rural telephone companies, including bidding credits,
should be limited to bidding for licenses, in their rural service areas. We found that this limitation satisfied Congress'
objectives without unduly favoring rural telephone companies in markets where there was no compelling reason to
do so. Specifically, we concluded that Congress was primarily concerned with assuring rural consumers the benefits
of new technologies and providing opportunities for participation by rural telephone companies in the provision
of wireless services that supplement or replace their landline facilities.
 Accordingly, we provided that rural telephone companies would be eligible for bidding credits for specified licenses
only in their service areas.








109. However, unlike bidding credits available to women and minority-owned firms, we linked the amount of the bidding
credit for rural telephone companies to their commitment to achieve certain expanded infrastructure build-out
requirements in their rural service areas. We provided that the amount of the bidding credit would be proportionately
linked to the amount by which the rural telephone company agreed to expand its build-out commitment. In this regard,
we indicated that failure to meet the expanded build-out commitment would result in liability for a penalty in the
amount of the bidding credit, plus interest at the rate applicable to installment payments. We further provided that
grant of the licenses to rural telephone companies utilizing bidding credits would be conditioned upon payment of
this penalty, if and when it becomes applicable. We concluded that this added construction requirement would fulfill
the congressional objective of developing and rapidly deploying new services to those residing in rural areas.

110. On reconsideration of this issue, we no longer believe the provision in the 

Second Report and Order

, which links the availability of bidding credits for rural telephone companies to their agreement to satisfy an expanded
construction requirement, is necessary or appropriate to promote the statutory objectives. We agree with petitioners'
assertions that the expanded build-out requirement may have adverse consequences contrary to the purpose of bidding
credit provision. We are also concerned that the expanded construction requirement may be unduly burdensome both
to rural telephone company licensees and the Commission. In this regard, we are concerned that the accelerated build-out
requirement may not be economically feasible in some rural areas and thus may result in frequent forfeitures of the
bidding credit amount by rural telephone companies. As discussed more fully below, we now believe that Congress'
objectives of promoting investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services to rural areas will best
be achieved through the use of other provisions such as installment payments, bidding credits (without an expanded
build out requirement), and service area partitioning. Thus, we amend our rules to retain flexibility to adopt any
of these or other provisions for rural telephone companies on a service-specific basis after considering the characteristics
and capital requirements of the particular service.



F. Rural Telephone Company Eligibility for Installment Payments



111. 

Petitions.

 SDN, USIN, and NCTA all request that installment payments be extended to rural telephone companies regardless of
their status as small businesses. AIDE and Cook Inlet argue that all designated entities should be permitted to pay
for their licenses in installment payments irrespective of their size. These parties all object to the decision to
limit eligibility for installment payments to small businesses as defined in  1.2110(b)(1), (

i.e.,

 companies with net worth including that of affiliates of $6 million or less and no more than $2 million of annual after-federal-tax
profit for the last two years). USIN argues that there is no statutory support in the provisions cited by the Commission
as authority for adopting different provisions for one designated entity group as opposed to another.

112. Citing the legislative history to the Budget Act and H.R. Report No. 103-111 in particular, USIN also maintains
that the statutory purpose of requiring special provisions for designated entities was to promote entry by firms
with difficulty in obtaining access to capital. Petitioners maintain that the $6 million net worth/$2 million net
revenue standard for installment payment eligibility is too strict and will prevent rural telephone companies from
qualifying for the installment payment option although they face significant difficulty in obtaining access to
capital. USIN asserts that as a practical matter rural telephone companies may have high levels of non-amortized
assets and yet have less capital available for investment than many businesses that meet the small business definition.
SDN maintains that rural telephone companies should be eligible for installment payments regardless of whether
they qualify as small businesses because they will generally incur higher build out costs with lower revenue streams
than other designated entities. According to USIN, a rural telephone company bidding for a license in a capital-intensive
service should be eligible for installment payments if its annual revenue are under $100 million. USIN asserts that
without installment payments such telephone companies will be unable to bid for broad-coverage licenses as traditional
rural telephone company lenders have indicated unwillingness to finance auction bids.

113. AIDE objects to the determination in the 

Second Report and Order

 that limits the installment payment option to small businesses bidding on licenses for ``those smaller spectrum
blocks that are most likely to match the business objectives of 

bona fide

 small businesses.''
 According to AIDE, such the installment payment option should be available to all designated entities bidding on
all licenses. AIDE maintains that Congress did not intend to give the FCC discretion to offer special provisions to
some designated entities in some auctions but not in others. AIDE argues, moreover, that these limitations on the
availability of installment payments are not justified by the Commission's desire to prevent abuse of its designated
entity provisions since there are other safeguards designed specifically for that purpose, such as the rules for
disclosure of real parties in interest, the definitional requirements including the assets of affiliates and the
financial qualification rules.





114. 

Discussion.

 For the reasons set forth below, we deny petitioners' requests to expand the installment payment option to other designated
entities irrespective of their economic status. However, we will retain the flexibility to expand or modify the installment
payment option on a service-specific basis for other appropriately-sized entities where the spectrum costs and
capital infrastructure requirements necessitate their application to other entities. For example, in the 

Fifth Report and Order

 we recognized that the substantial expected capital required to acquire and construct broadband PCS licenses warranted
expansion of the installment payment option to most entities acquiring licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks.
 Under the broadband PCS rules, installment payments are available to smaller entities that do not technically qualify
as small businesses and an enhanced installment payment option is available to eligible small businesses and businesses
owned by women and/or minorities.





115. In the 

Second Report and Order,

 we concluded that for some auctions, small businesses would be eligible for installment payments. We noted that by
allowing payment in installments, the government would be extending credit to an eligible winning bidder, thus reducing
the amount of private financing needed in advance of the auction by a prospective licensee. We noted that this will
assist small entities who are likely to have difficulty obtaining adequate private financing. As a result, we concluded
that installment payments would be an effective way to promote efficiently the participation of small businesses
in the provision of spectrum-based telecommunications service and an effective tool for efficiently distributing
licenses and services among geographic areas.
 Thus, we limited application of installment payments to small entities, including such entities that are owned by
minorities and/or women. We found that this approach best served the intent of Congress in enacting section 309(j)(4)(A),
to avoid a competitive bidding program that has the effect of favoring incumbents, with established revenue streams,
over new companies or start-ups.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940826-0-00138 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940826-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

116. Consistent with Congress's concern that auctions not operate to exclude small businesses, the provisions relating
to installment payments for minorities and/or women also were intended to assist only minorities and women who are
small businesses. The House Report states that these related provisions were drafted to ``ensure that 

all small businesses 

will be covered by the Commission's regulations, 

including those owned by members of minority groups and women.

''
 (emphasis added). It also states that the provisions in section 309(j)(4)(A) relating to installment payments were
intended to promote economic opportunity by ensuring that competitive bidding does not inadvertently favor incumbents
with ``deep pockets'' ``over new companies or start-ups.''
 Because the Congressional objective here was to assist ``new companies or start-ups,'' we therefore concluded that
the Commission should use installment payments only for smaller sized entities. As indicated by the legislative
history, large entities with established revenue streams were not intended to be beneficiaries of this particular
means of financial assistance. We concluded that the statutory language, when read in conjunction with the legislative
history, does not indicate that Congress's purpose was to accord special financial assistance measures under section
309(j)(4)(A) to entities other than those with small economic status.
 In this regard, we reject petitioner's proposals to allow installment payments for rural telephone companies or
other designated entities irrespective of their size. We will continue to determine on a service-specific basis
the appropriate economic eligibility criteria for installment payments. And we may, as we did in the context of broadband
PCS, establish different installment payment options for entities who face different economic barriers.






117. In addition, and consistent with our decision to limit installment payments to small entities, we decline to
make installment payments available for all licenses in all auctions. Rather, in order to match the provisions with
eligible recipients, we will continue to make installment payments available only for certain licenses that do not
involve the largest spectrum blocks and service areas. In this regard, in the context of narrowband PCS, we adopted
installment payments only for the regional, MTA and BTA licenses. Similarly, for broadband PCS, we limited eligibility
for installment payments to the BTA licenses contained in the entrepreneurs' blocks. We continue to believe that
where large, valuable blocks of spectrum are being auctioned we should not give ineligible entities the incentive
to create small business ``fronts,'' thereby enabling large businesses to become eligible for low-cost government
financing. Nor do we desire to delay service to the public by encouraging under-capitalized firms to receive licenses
for facilities which they may lack the resources adequately to finance.
 Accordingly, we will continue to allow installment payments only for licenses in those smaller spectrum blocks and
service areas that are most likely to match the business objectives of 

bona fide 

small entities in the context of a particular service. The particular spectrum block sizes that will be eligible for
installment payments will be decided in the context of each particular service taking into account the cost of acquiring
the spectrum and constructing the system.




G. Rural Telephone Company Partitioning


118. 

Petitions. 

SDN requests that rural telephone companies be allowed to partition their rural service areas either pursuant to
an agreement with the BTA or MTA licensee, or by licensing a separate PCS service area using a system similar to the cellular
unserved area application process.





119. Several commenters responding to the NPRM in this proceeding suggested that the Commission allow partitioning
of PCS licenses so as to permit rural telephone companies to hold licenses to provide service only in their service
areas.
 In the 

Second Report and Order 

we recognized that partitioning may be an effective means to achieve Congress's goal of ensuring that advanced services
are provided in rural areas.
 In the context of broadband PCS, we adopted a system of geographic partitioning, for rural telephone companies which
allows rural telephone companies to acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses in one of two ways: (1) they may form
bidding consortia to participate in auctions, and then partition the licenses won among consortia participants,
or (2) they may acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses from other licensees through private negotiation and
agreement either before or after the auction (provided the partitioned area is reasonably related to the size of the
rural telephone company's rural service area).
 We require that partitioned areas conform to established geopolitical boundaries and that each area include the
wireline service area of the rural telephone company applicant. We believe that this system of partitioning of rural
service areas will provide a significant opportunity for many of these designated entities who desire to offer PCS
to their customers as a complement to their local telephone services. Therefore, we will retain the flexibility in
the generic auction rules to adopt a system of partitioning on a service-specific basis where the capital requirements
and construction costs are such that a system is necessary to assist rural telephone companies who cannot afford or
do not desire to bid for or construct systems for an entire service area.

H. Unjust Enrichment Provisions



120. 

Petitions.

 AIDE requests that when the Commission recaptures the benefits accruing to a designated entity pursuant to the unjust
enrichment provisions, the unjust enrichment penalty should credit the licensee's pre-sale investments in the
license and should be based on the portion of the licensee's taxable gain on the sale allocated to the license, with
appropriate adjustments. BET similarly requests that the Commission revise the unjust enrichment provisions to
credit the designated entity for its pre-transfer expenditures on the license including construction costs. 

121. 

Discussion.

 We deny the requests of AIDE and BET. In the 

Second Report and Order

 the Commission crafted unjust enrichment provisions designed to prevent designated entities from profiting by
the rapid sale of licenses acquired through the benefit of provisions and policies meant to encourage their participation
in the provision of spectrum-based services. These rules were intended to deter designated entities from prematurely
transferring licenses obtained through the benefit of provisions designed to create opportunities for such designated
entities in the provision of spectrum-based services. We sought through our unjust enrichment provisions to discourage
designated entities who do not intend to provide service to the public from abusing our provisions by obtaining a license
at a lower cost than other licensees and then selling the license after a short time to a non-designated entity at a profit.
In addition, the unjust enrichment rules were intended to recapture for the government a portion of the value of the
bidding credit or other special provision if such a designated entity prematurely transfers its licenses to an ineligible
entity, thereby frustrating the government's efforts to encourage the inclusion of designated entities in the provision
of new spectrum-based services. 

122. We recognize that over time, a designated licensee may have made substantial investments in a license prior to
transfer. In order to reward efficiency and encourage such investments in infrastructure development, we provided
that we will generally reduce the amount of the recapture penalty as time passes or construction benchmarks are met.
 We further provided that our recapture provisions would not apply to the transfer or assignment of a license that has
been held for more than five years.
 In addition, where a recapture penalty is assessed, we stated that the penalty will not prevent the transferring designated
entity from recovering the depreciated value of its capital investment. Moreover, we indicated that in appropriate
circumstances, we might waive recapture ``if the licensee has incurred substantial start-up costs or made significant
capital investments with the intention of starting service, but due to circumstances beyond its control, was unable
to provide service.''
 







123. We believe that these measures adequately account for a designated entity's pre-transfer investments in a license,
including construction expenses. Therefore, we decline to adopt AIDE's proposal that we credit the licensee's pre-sale
investments in the license and base the recapture amount on the portion of the licensee's taxable gain on the sale allocated
to the license, because such provisions would require the government to undertake lengthy and complex accounting
and allocation proceedings to determine the amount of the penalty. Similarly, we deny BET's request that we credit
designated entities for their pre-transfer expenditures on a license because we believe that our recapture provisions
adequately account for these expenditures by reducing the amount of the penalty over time. Moreover, the unjust enrichment
provisions were designed to act as a penalty to deter premature license transfers by designated entities. Therefore
we decline to modify the recapture provisions adopted in the 

Second Report and Order

. We note, however, that because license terms and construction requirements vary by service, and because we may adopt
different designated entity provisions for different services, we will set forth the specific recapture provisions
in the service-specific competitive bidding rules of each auctionable service. Moreover, we modify our general
recapture provisions to provide flexibility on a service-specific basis to extend the duration of the recapture
provisions beyond five years. 



I. Upfront Payment Amount



124. 

Petitions.

 AIDE requests that the Commission reduce the amount of the upfront payment for designated entities. AIDE asserts
that a reduced upfront payment would help ensure that capital constrained designated entities have the opportunity
to participate in the competitive bidding process. According to AIDE, a reduced upfront payment is necessary to create
opportunities for designated entities to participate in competitive bidding and will allow such entities to preserve
their limited resources for post-auction infrastructure development.

125. 

Discussion.

 The Commission adopted an upfront payment requirement in order to ensure that only serious, qualified bidders participate
in our auctions. We reasoned that an upfront payment requirement would ensure the validity of the information generated
during auctions and increase the likelihood that licenses will be awarded to the qualified bidders who value them
the most, thus promoting the rapid deployment of new technology. Upfront payments will also provide the Commission
with a source of available funds in the event a bid withdrawal penalty must be assessed. By requiring a substantial
upfront payment amount, the Commission seeks to deter speculative and frivolous bidding by all bidders, including
designated entities. Moreover, the standard upfront payment formula ($.02 per MHz per pop for the maximum MHz-pops
a bidder intends to bid on in any single round of bidding), is based on the amount of spectrum and population coverage
on which a bidder seeks to bid and therefore is directly linked to the expected value of the license and anticipated
construction costs a licensee will incur.


126. Nevertheless, in the 

Second Report and Order

 we retained the flexibility to cap, reduce or modify the upfront payment amount for designated entities.
 We indicated that such decisions would be made in the service-specific competitive bidding rules for individual
services. In the 

Fifth Report and Order,

 recognizing that the standard upfront payment formula may create a barrier for smaller entities wishing to participate
in auctions, we reduced by 25 percent the upfront payment amount required for designated entities bidding in the entrepreneur's
blocks.
 Given the varied spectrum costs of different services, we will continue to consider such reduced upfront payments
for designated entities on a service-specific basis. Generally, we will only reduce the upfront payment amounts
for designated entities in capital intensive services, such as broadband PCS, where the spectrum bandwidth will
result in upfront payment amounts that may be prohibitive for some smaller entities.






J. Installment Payments




127. In the 

Second Report and Order,

 we stated that, for some auctions, winning bidders that are small businesses would be eligible to use installment
payments in paying for licenses.
 We provided that for these winning bidders, a down payment of 10 percent would be due within five business days of the
close of the auction, and that an additional 10 percent would be due within five days of grant of the license.
 We stated that we would impose interest on installment payments at a rate equal to the rate for U.S. Treasury obligations
of maturity equal to the license term. We stated that the schedule of installment payments would begin with interest-only
payments for the first two years, and that thereafter principal and interest would be amortized over the remaining
term of the license.








128. Upon reconsideration, we have decided that we may need to tailor installment payment provisions more precisely
to needs of various groups of designated entities and the characteristics of particular services. In the 

Fifth Report and Order

 we provided installment payments for minorities and women in some blocks, and provided different installment provisions
for small businesses of different sizes.
 We will continue to establish different installment payment provisions on a service-specific basis. We may offer
installment payments to minorities and women, in some circumstances, and may offer installment payments having
differing terms to different classes of designated entities. We may vary the interest rate and the payment schedule
for installment payments, including the amount and timing of the down payment and the schedule for amortization of
principal and interest. Installment payment provisions for each service will be specified in Orders establishing
auction rules for that service. We believe that this additional flexibility will allow us to take account of differences
in capital requirements across services and license blocks, and to provide access to capital in ways that will give
various groups of designated entities a realistic chance to participate in offering service.





K. Eligibility Issues




129. 

Petitions.

 Black Entertainment Television Holdings, Inc. (BET) requests that the FCC reconsider the public company restriction
on the availability of provisions for minority and women-owned companies in broadband PCS. BET argues that given
the costs of acquiring spectrum and the construction expense, such a limitation would defeat realistic opportunities
for a wide range of minority-owned firms. BET also requests that we clarify that provisions for minority and women-owned
firms are separate and distinct from provisions for small businesses. Finally, BET argues that rights, privileges,
options or other forms of ownership that do not affect the ability of a designated entity to control a company, or diminish
a designated entity financial stake in a venture, should not be considered in the definitional analysis for purposes
of determining eligibility.

130. 

Discussion.

 In the 

Second Report and Order,

 we stated that publicly traded minority and women-owned companies would not be eligible for provisions applicable
to these designated entities. In the 

Fifth Report and Order,

 however, we deviated from this restriction to allow publicly traded minority and women-owned companies to qualify
to bid in the entrepreneurs' block, and under certain circumstances to qualify for bidding credits.
 We will continue to consider exceptions to our restriction on publicly traded company eligibility for minority and
women-owned businesses on a service-specific basis, in each case considering the capital requirements and the expected
build-out cost of the service. We agree with BET that in services with high entry costs, precluding publicly traded
companies from receiving measures intended for minority and women-owned businesses may undermine our objective
of ensuring the opportunity for these designated entities to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.





131. As requested by BET, we clarify that the provisions for businesses owned by women and minorities are separate
and distinct from the provisions for small businesses. Thus, women and minority-owned businesses may qualify for
measures adopted for these entities irrespective of their size, and small businesses may qualify for small business
provisions regardless of their ownership by minorities and women. And small businesses that are owned by members
of minorities and/or women may qualify for provisions applicable to both groups.


132. Finally, in the general auction rules, we indicated that in determining designated entity eligibility we would
consider all rights, warrants and options on a fully diluted basis, 

i.e.

, they will be treated as if already exercised.
 We intend to maintain the existing rule of calculating these ownership interests on a fully diluted basis, since we
expect that such ownership interests will almost always have the potential either to impact the ability of a designated
entity to control a company or to diminish a designated entity's financial stake in the venture. However, in the rare
circumstance where such ownership interests have no effect on a designated entity's ability to control a firm or to
diminish the designated entity's financial stake, we will consider requests for waivers.
 We note, however, that we expect such instances to be rare, and petitioners will be required to make an affirmative
showing sufficient to overcome the presumption that such ownership interests should be calculated as if exercised
for purposes of determining eligibility issues.






133. 

Petitions.

 AIDE and Cook Inlet propose stricter eligibility and anti-sham measures to avoid designated entity shams. Specifically,
Cook Inlet proposes requiring that a designated entity maintain clear structural control of an entity in order to
be eligible for designated entity provisions. In this regard, Cook Inlet argues that in limited partnerships, the
general partner should be required to be a designated entity and restrictions should be imposed on the ability of other
general partners to exercise management control. Cook Inlet also proposes that the Commission require designated
entities to document their eligibility by attaching documentation to their long form application.


134. We agree with AIDE that in some instances stricter eligibility requirements are appropriate to ensure that only
legitimate designated entities are the beneficiaries of the special provisions established under our rules. In
particular, we clarify that, when an applicant or a licensee is a partnership, because each general partner generally
has the ability to act on behalf of the partnership, all general partners in the license applicant must be designated
entities in order to qualify for designated entity status. We believe that this clarification is consistent with
the Commission's long-standing practice of attributing control in the context of partnerships to the general partners.
This clarification will ensure that designated entities in partnerships retain 

de facto 

as well as 

de jure

 control.



135. In addition, we agree with AIDE that documentation of designated entity status should be submitted along with
the applicants' long-form applications in order to enable the Commission to verify designated entity eligibility.
Accordingly, we will require designated entities to substantiate their eligibility by describing on their long-form
application how they satisfy the requirements for eligibility. We will also require designated entity applicants
to list on their long-form application all agreements that effect designated entity status, such as all partnership
agreements, shareholder agreements, management agreements and other agreements, including oral agreements,
which establish that the designated entity will have both 

de facto

 and 

de jure

 control of the entity. In addition, we will require that such information be maintained at the licensee's facilities,
or by its designated agent, for the term of the license, and that the information be made available to Commission staff
upon request in order to enable the Commission to audit designated entity eligibility on an ongoing basis.



136. In addition, if an applicant for designated entity status proves unqualified, and the Commission determines
that the application for designated entity status involved willful misrepresentation or other serious misconduct,
the Commission will impose severe penalties. These may include monetary forfeitures, revocation of licenses, and
prohibition of participation in future auctions.


137. With respect to AIDE's proposal that clear structural control should be required to establish designated entity
eligibility, we believe that as a general rule, our strict requirement that women and minority principals control
the applicant and maintain a 50.1 percent voting interest (in a corporate applicant) and a 50.1 percent equity stake
in the entity is sufficient to prevent ``fronts'' and to ensure that our provisions are only made available to legitimate
qualified designated entities. However, we reserve the flexibility on a service-specific basis, taking into account
the nature of the specific provisions applicable in that service, to adopt additional or different requirements
for designated entity eligibility.





138. While we conclude that our requirement that control and substantial equity rest with minorities and/or women
will generally be adequate to ensure that parties do not attempt to evade the statutory requirement to provide economic
opportunities and ensure participation by businesses owned by these groups, we also reaffirm our commitment to investigate
all allegations of fronts, shams or other methods used to try to evade our eligibility rules. In this regard, we remind
parties that we will conduct random pre and post-auction audits to ensure that applicants receiving designated entity
benefits are 

bona fide

 designated entities.



L. Small Businesses

139. 

Petitions. 

NTCA and USIN request that we amend the small business definition so that it can be flexibly modified in the context
of a particular service. NTCA and USIN advocate that such flexibility is appropriate because the existing $6 million
net worth/$2 million net income test is too low to reflect the capital-intensive nature of the broadband PCS business.
NTCA asserts that most telephone companies are unable to meet this test even though they have few subscribers and few
employees. USIN states that the current definition discriminates against small rural telephone companies, and
that the proper measure for small businesses in capital-intensive service is those with annual revenues of less than
$100 million.
140. 

Discussion. 

We agree with NTCA. In the 

Second Report and Order 

we relied on the Small Business Administration's (SBA) standard definition. The SBA definition permits an applicant
to qualify for financial assistance based on a net worth not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal
income taxes for the two preceding years not in excess of $2 million.
 The record in this proceeding reflected broad disagreement about the appropriate definition of small businesses.
Many commenters, including the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA, argued that the SBA net worth/revenue definition
was too restrictive and would exclude businesses of sufficient size to survive, much less succeed, in the competitive
wireless communications marketplace. The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy and Suite 12 Group advocated adoption
of a revenue test, arguing that a net worth test could be misleading as some very large companies have low net worth.
The SBA's Chief Counsel recommended that the revenue standard be raised to include firms that (together with affiliates)
have less than $40 million in revenue. The SBA Chief Counsel suggested that the Commission consider a higher revenue
ceiling or adopt different size standards for different telecommunications markets.






141. Other parties indicated that the definition used by the Commission might impede the ability of small businesses
to raise capital in anticipation of auctions. They noted that many small firms are soliciting investors to enable
these firms to compete better in auctions, and argued that their designated entity status should not be jeopardized
as a result. Thus, these commenters suggested, if the FCC adopts the SBA's net worth standard, the net worth valuation
should relate back to the date of the PCS Final Report and Order (September 23, 1993).
142. In contrast, several commenters argue that the small business definition must be made more restrictive in order
to prevent large firms from spinning off companies to compete as designated entities. In this regard, some parties
recommend limiting provisions to those small businesses that were in existence for the previous two years.
143. In the 

Second Report and Order, 

we adopted the existing SBA net worth/net income size standard as the generic threshold for small businesses to qualify
as designated entities because at that time we were unable to conclude that the other proposals suggested by commenters
were superior to this established standard. However we acknowledged that for certain telecommunications industry
sectors this standard may not be high enough to encompass those entities that require the benefits, but also have the
financial wherewithal to construct and operate the systems. Accordingly, we indicated that this ``threshold could
be adjusted upward on a service-by-service basis to accommodate such situations.'' We also noted that we may modify
the small business definition if the SBA changed its definition or the Commission determined that an alternative
definition was more appropriate for capital intensive services.
144. In this regard, in the 

Fifth Report and Order 

we revised the definition of a small business set forth in the 

Second Report and Order 

to include entities with up to $40 million in gross revenues, and we provided that these small businesses would permit
to pool their resources and form consortia to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks or to receive other small business benefits.
We also adopted rules that allow small businesses and businesses owned by women and/or minorities to raise capital
by selling passive ownership interests in their companies. Thus, for example, under certain conditions, businesses
owned by women and minorities have the option of taking on one large passive partner (holding up to 49.9 percent of the
enterprise) or selling a greater portion of their companies' equity (up to 75 percent of the equity) to passive investors
in smaller increments. Either of these structures should enhance the ability of these entities to obtain the necessary
funding to meet long-term construction, operation and expansion goals.





145. Given the diversity of services that may be subject to competitive bidding and the varied spectrum costs and build-out
requirements associated with each, we conclude that it is more appropriate to define the eligibility requirements
for small businesses on a service-specific basis, taking into account the capital requirements of each particular
service in establishing the appropriate threshold. Therefore we will amend our generic auction rules to replace
the small business definition with a provision enabling the Commission to establish a small businesses definition
in the context of each particular service.


V. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis


146. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C.  604, the Commission's final analysis is as
follows:


A. Need for, and Purpose of, this Action


147. As a result of new statutory authority, the Commission may utilize competitive bidding mechanisms in the granting
of certain initial licenses. The Commission published an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, 

see generally 

5 U.S.C.  603, within the 

Notice of Proposed Rule Making 

in this proceeding, and published a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis within the 

Second Report and Order 

(at   299-302). As noted in these previous final analyses, this proceeding will establish a system
of competitive bidding for choosing among certain applications for initial licenses, and will carry out statutory
mandates that certain designated entities, including small entities, be afforded an opportunity to participate
in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services.

Purpose.



The provisions of this subpart implement Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66), authorizing the Commission to employ competitive bidding
procedures to choose from among two or more mutually exclusive applications for certain initial licenses. 



 1.2102 

Eligibility of applications for competitive bidding.



(a) Mutually exclusive initial applications in the following services or classes of services are subject to competitive
bidding: 

(1) Interactive Video Data Service (

see

 47 CFR Part 95, Subpart F). This paragraph does not apply to applications which were filed prior to July 26, 1993;

(2) Marine Public Coast Stations (

see

 47 CFR Part 80, Subpart J);

(3) Multipoint Distribution Service and Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (

see

 47 CFR Part 21, Subpart K). This paragraph does not apply to applications which were filed prior to July 26, 1993;

(5) Public Mobile Services (

see

 47 CFR Part 22), except in the 800 MHz Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service, and in the Rural Radio Service. This paragraph
does not apply to applications in the cellular radio service, such as cellular unserved area applications, that were
filed prior to July 26, 1993;

(6) Specialized Mobile Radio Service (SMR) (

see

 47 CFR Part 90, Subpart S) including applications based on finder's preferences for frequencies allocated to the
SMR service (

see

 47 CFR 90.173); and

(7) Personal Communications Services (PCS) (

see

 47 CFR Part 24).






Note to paragraph (a): 

To determine the rules that apply to competitive bidding in the foregoing services, specific service rules should
also be consulted.




(b) The following types of license applications are not subject to competitive bidding procedures: 

(1) Applications for renewal of licenses;

(2) Applications for modification of license; provided, however, that the Commission may determine that applications
for modification that are mutually exclusive with other applications should be subject to competitive bidding;

(3) Applications for subsidiary communications services. A ``subsidiary communications service'' is a class of
service where the signal for that service is indivisible from that of the main channel signal and that main channel
signal is exempt from competitive bidding under other provisions of these rules. 

See, e.g., 

 1.2102(c) (exempting broadcast services). Examples of such subsidiary communications services are those
transmitted on subcarriers within the FM baseband signal (

see

 47 CFR 73.295), and signals transmitted within the Vertical Blanking Interval of a broadcast television signal;
and

(4) Applications for frequencies used as an intermediate link or links in the provision of a continuous, end-to-end
service where no service is provided directly to subscribers over the frequencies. Examples of such intermediate
links are:

(i) Point-to-point microwave facilities used to connect a cellular radio telephone base station with a cellular
radio telephone mobile telephone switching office; and 

(ii) Point-to-point microwave facilities used as part of the service offering in the provision of telephone exchange
or interexchange service.

(c) Applications in the following services or classes of services are not subject to competitive bidding:

(9) Public Safety, Industrial/Land Transportation, General and Business Radio categories above 800 MHz, including
finder's preference requests for frequencies not allocated to the SMR service (

see

 47 CFR 90.173), and including, until further notice of the Commission, the Automated Vehicle Monitoring Service
(

see

 47 CFR 90.239);

(10) Private Land Mobile Radio Services between 470-512 MHz (

see

 47 CFR Part 90, Subparts B-F), including those based on finder's preferences, (

see

 47 CFR 90.173); 

(11) Private Land Mobile Radio Services below 470 MHz (

see

 47 CFR Part 90, Subparts B-F) except in the 220 MHz band (

see

 47 CFR Section 90.173); and

(12) Private Operational Fixed Services (

see

 47 CFR Part 94).



 1.2103

Competitive bidding design options.



(a) The Commission will select the competitive bidding design(s) to be used in auctioning particular licenses or
classes of licenses on a service-specific basis. The choice of competitive bidding design will generally be made
pursuant to the criteria set forth in PP Docket No. 93-253, FCC 94-61, adopted March 8, 1994, available
for purchase from the International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M St. NW, suite 140, Washington, DC 20037,
telephone (202) 857-3800, but the Commission may design and test alternative methodologies. The Commission
will choose from one or more of the following types of auction designs for services or classes of services subject to
competitive bidding: (1) Single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or simultaneous); (2) Sequential
oral auctions; (3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions.

(b) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations
of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid,
a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be
used with any type of auction.

(c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses
and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in
conjunction with any type of auction.



 1.2104

Competitive bidding mechanisms.



(a) 

Sequencing.

 The Commission will establish the sequence in which multiple licenses will be auctioned.

(b) 

Grouping. 

In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial
bidding, the Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned simultaneously or in combination.

(c) 

Reservation Price.

 The Commission may establish a reservation price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject
to auction will not be awarded.

(d) 

Minimum Bid Increments.

 The Commission may, by announcement before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage
terms. The Commission may also establish suggested minimum opening bids on a service-specific basis.

(e) 

Stopping Rules. 

The Commission may establish stopping rules before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate the auctions
within a reasonable time.

(f) 

Activity Rules.

 The Commission may establish activity rules which require a minimum amount of bidding activity.

(g) 

Withdrawal, Default and Disqualification Penalties. 

As specified below, when the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to  1.2103,
the Commission will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, or who default
on payments due after an auction closes or who are disqualified.

(1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be
subject to a penalty equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the
license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds
the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing
bidder has deposited with the Commission.

(2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close
of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in paragraph (g)(1) plus an additional penalty
equal to 3 percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid
amount, the 3 percent penalty will be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be
deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with
the Commission. When the Commission conducts single round sealed bid auctions or sequential oral auctions, the Commission
may modify the penalties to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, however,
that such penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above.

(h) The Commission will generally release information concerning the identities of bidders before each auction
but may choose, on an auction-by-auction basis, to withhold the identity of the bidders associated with bidder identification
numbers.

(i) The Commission may delay, suspend, or cancel an auction in the event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle,
evidence of security breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or for any other reason that
affects the fair and efficient conduct of the competitive bidding. The Commission also has the authority, at its sole
discretion, to resume the competitive bidding starting from the beginning of the current or some previous round or
cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety.



 1.2105



Bidding application and certification procedures; prohibition of collusion.



(a) 

Submission of Short Form Application (FCC Form 175). 

In order to be eligible to bid, an applicant must timely submit a short-form application (FCC Form 175), together with
any appropriate filing fee set forth by Public Notice. Unless otherwise provided by Public Notice, the Form 175 need
not be accompanied by an upfront payment (see  1.2106).

(1) All Form 175s will be due:

(i) On the date(s) specified by Public Notice; or

(ii) In the case of application filing dates which occur automatically by operation of law (

see, e.g.

, 47 CFR 22.902), on a date specified by Public Notice after the Commission has reviewed the applications that have
been filed on those dates and determined that mutual exclusivity exists.

(2) The Form 175 must contain the following information:

(i) Identification of each license on which the applicant wishes to bid;

(ii) The applicant's name, if the applicant is an individual. If the applicant is a corporation, then the short-form
application will require the name and address of the corporate office and the name and title of an officer or director.
If the applicant is a partnership, then the application will require the name, citizenship and address of all partners,
and, if a partner is not a natural person, then the name and title of a responsible person should be included as well.
If the applicant is a trust, then the name and address of the trustee will be required. If the applicant is none of the
above, then it must identify and describe itself and its principals or other responsible persons;

(iii) The identity of the person(s) authorized to make or withdraw a bid;

(iv) If the applicant applies as a designated entity pursuant to  1.2110, a statement to that effect and a declaration,
under penalty of perjury, that the applicant is qualified as a designated entity under  1.2110.

(v) Certification that the applicant is legally, technically, financially and otherwise qualified pursuant to
Section 308(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The Commission will accept applications certifying
that a request for waiver or other relief from the requirements of Section 310 is pending;

(vi) Certification that the applicant is in compliance with the foreign ownership provisions of Section 310 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended;

(vii) Certification that the applicant is and will, during the pendency of its application(s), remain in compliance
with any service-specific qualifications applicable to the licenses on which the applicant intends to bid including,
but not limited to, financial qualifications. The Commission may require certification in certain services that
the applicant will, following grant of a license, come into compliance with certain service-specific rules, including,
but not limited to, ownership eligibility limitations;

(viii) An exhibit, certified as truthful under penalty of perjury, identifying all parties with whom the applicant
has entered into partnerships, joint ventures, consortia or other agreements, arrangements or understandings
of any kind relating to the licenses being auctioned, including any such agreements relating to the post-auction
market structure.

(ix) Certification under penalty of perjury that it has not entered and will not enter into any explicit or implicit
agreements, arrangements or understandings of any kind with any parties other than those identified pursuant to
paragraph (a)(2)(viii) regarding the amount of their bids, bidding strategies or the particular licenses on which
they will or will not bid;






Note to paragraph (a): 

The Commission may also request applicants to submit additional information for informational purposes to aid in
its preparation of required reports to Congress.




(b) 

Modification and Dismissal of Form 175. 

(1) Any Form 175 that is not signed or otherwise does not contain all of the certifications required pursuant to this
section is unacceptable for filing and cannot be corrected subsequent to any applicable filing deadline. The application
will be dismissed with prejudice and the upfront payment, if paid, will be returned.

(2) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects specified herein (except for failure
to sign the application and to make certifications) and to resubmit a corrected application. Form 175 may be amended
or modified to make minor changes or correct minor errors in the application (such as typographical errors). The Commission
will classify all amendments as major or minor, pursuant to rules applicable to specific services. An application
will be considered to be a newly filed application if it is amended by a major amendment and may not be resubmitted after
applicable filing deadlines. 
(3) Applicants who fail to correct defects in their applications in a timely manner as specified by Public Notice will
have their applications dismissed with no opportunity for resubmission. 
(c) 

Prohibition of Collusion.

 (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, after the filing of short-form applications,
all bidders are prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance
of their bids or bidding strategies, or discussing or negotiating settlement agreements, with other bidders until
after the high bidder makes the required down payment, unless such bidders are members of a bidding consortium or other
joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's short-form application pursuant to  1.2105(a)(2)(viii).


(2) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect formation of consortia or changes in ownership
at any time before or during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant,
and provided that the parties forming consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for the same
license. Such changes will not be considered major modifications of the application. 

(3) after the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make agreements to bid jointly for licenses, provided
the parties to the agreement have not applied for the same license. 


 1.2106 


Submission of upfront payments. 



(a) The Commission may require applicants for licenses subject to competitive bidding to submit an upfront payment.
In that event, the amount of the upfront payment and the procedures for submitting it will be set forth in a Public Notice.
No interest will be paid on upfront payments. 

(b) Upfront payments must be made either by wire transfer or by cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a financial
institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the
Federal Communications Commission. 

(c) If an upfront payment is not in compliance with the Commission's Rules, or if insufficient funds are tendered to
constitute a valid upfront payment, the applicant shall have a limited opportunity to correct its submission to bring
it up to the minimum valid upfront payment prior to the auction. If the applicant does not submit at least the minimum
upfront payment, it will be ineligible to bid, its application will be dismissed and any upfront payment it has made
will be returned. 
(d) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any down payment required for licenses on which the bidder
is the high bidder. Where the upfront payment amount exceeds the required deposit of a winning bidder, the Commission
may refund the excess amount after determining that no bid withdrawal penalties are owed by that bidder. 
(e) In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d), in the event a penalty is assessed pursuant to  1.2104
for bid withdrawal or default, upfront payments or down payments on deposit with the Commission will be used to satisfy
the bid withdrawal or default penalty before being applied toward any additional payment obligations that the high
bidder may have. 



 1.2107 

Submission of down payment and filing of long-form applications. 



(a) After bidding has ended, the Commission will identify and notify the high bidder and declare the bidding closed.


(b) Within five (5) business days after being notified that it is a high bidder on a particular license(s), a high bidder
must submit to the Commission's lockbox bank such additional funds (the ``down payment'') as are necessary to bring
its total deposits (not including upfront payments applied to satisfy penalties) up to twenty (20) percent of its
high bid(s). (In single round sealed bid auctions conducted under  1.2103, however, bidders may be required
to submit their down payments with their bids.) This down payment must be made by wire transfer or cashier's check drawn
in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
and must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission. Winning bidders who are qualified designated
entities eligible for installment payments under  1.2110(d) are only required to bring their total deposits
up to ten (10) percent of their winning bid(s). Such designated entities must pay the remainder of the twenty (20) percent
down payment within five (5) business days of grant of their application. 

See

  1.2110(e) (1) and (2). Down payments will be held by the Commission until the high bidder has been awarded the
license and has paid the remaining balance due on the license, in which case it will not be returned, or until the winning
bidder is found unqualified to be a licensee or has defaulted, in which case it will be returned, less applicable penalties.
No interest will be paid on any down payment.

(c) A high bidder that meets its down payment obligations in a timely manner must, within ten (10) business days after
being notified that it is a high bidder, submit an additional application (the ``long-form application'') pursuant
to the rules governing the service in which the applicant is the high bidder (unless it has already submitted such an
application, as contemplated by  1.2105(a)(1)(b). For example, if the applicant is high bidder for a license
in the Interactive Video Data Service (

see

 47 CFR Part 95, Subpart F), the long form application will be submitted on FCC Form 574 in accordance with  95.815
of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision in title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary,
high bidders need not submit an additional application filing fee with their long-form applications. Notwithstanding
any other provision in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, the high bidder's long-form application
must be mailed or otherwise delivered to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Attention:
Auction Application Processing Section, 1919 M Street, N.W., Room 222, Washington, D.C. 20554.
An applicant that fails to submit the required long-form application as required under this subsection, and fails
to establish good cause for any late-filed submission, shall be deemed to have defaulted and will be subject to the
penalties set forth in  1.2104.
(d) As an exhibit to its long-form application, the applicant must provide a detailed explanation of the terms and
conditions and parties involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other agreement or arrangement
it had entered into relating to the competitive bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed. Such agreements
must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form applications pursuant to  1.2105.


 1.2108


Procedures for filing petitions to deny against long-form applications.


(a) Where petitions to deny are otherwise provided for under the Act or the commission's Rules, and unless other service-specific
procedures for the filing of such petitions are provided for elsewhere in the Commission's Rules, the procedures
in this section shall apply to the filing of petitions to deny the long-form applications of winning bidders.
(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Commission gives public notice that a long-form application has been accepted
for filing, petitions to deny that application may be filed. Any such petitions must contain allegations of fact supported
by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.
(c) An applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, and the petitioner a reply to such opposition. Allegations
of fact or denials thereof must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The
times for filing such opposition and replies will be those provided in  1.45.
(d) If the Commission determines that:
(1) an applicant is qualified and there is no substantial and material issue of fact concerning that determination,
it will grant the application.
(2) an applicant is not qualified and that there is no substantial issue of fact concerning that determination, the
Commission need not hold a evidentiary hearing and will deny the application.
(3) substantial and material issues of fact require a hearing, it will conduct a hearing. The Commission may permit
all or part of the evidence to be submitted in written form and may permit employees other than administrative law judges
to preside at the taking of written evidence. Such hearing will be conducted on an expedited basis.


 1.2109


License grant, denial, default, and disqualification.


(a) Unless otherwise specified in these rules, auction winners are required to pay the balance of their winning bids
in a lump sum within five (5) business days following award of the license. Grant of the license will be conditioned
on full and timely payment of the winning bid.
(b) If a winning bidder withdraws its bid after the Commission has declared competitive bidding closed or fails to
remit the required down payment within five (5) business days after the commission has declared competitive bidding
closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the
default penalty specified in  1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission may either re-auction the license
to existing or new applicants or offer it to the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final bids. The
down payment obligations set forth in  1.2107(b) will apply.
(c) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be a licensee, fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely
manner, or defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made the required down payment, will be deemed to
have defaulted and will be liable for the penalty set forth in  1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission will
conduct another auction for the license, affording new parties an opportunity to file applications for the license.
(d) Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the Commission's rules in connection with their participation
in the competitive bidding process may be subject, in addition to any other applicable sanctions, to forfeiture of
their upfront payment, down payment or full bid amount, and may be prohibited from participating in future auctions.


 1.2110


Designated entities.


(a) Designated entities are small businesses, businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women, and rural
telephone companies.
(b) Definitions.
(1) Small businesses. The Commission will establish the definition of a small business on a service-specific basis,
taking into consideration the characteristics and capital requirements of the particular service.

(2) Businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women. Unless otherwise provided in rules governing specific
services, a business owned by members of minority groups and/or women is one in which minorities and/or women who are
U.S. citizens control the applicant, have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and, in the case of a corporate applicant,
a 50.1 percent voting interest. For applicants that are partnerships, every general partner either must be a minority
and/or woman (or minorities and/or women) who are U.S. citizens and who individually or together own at least 50.1
percent of the partnership equity, or an entity that is 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women
who are U.S. citizens. The interests of minorities and women are to be calculated on a fully-diluted basis; agreements
such as stock options and convertible debentures shall be considered to have a present effect on the power to control
an entity and shall be treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised. However, upon a demonstration
that options or conversion rights held by non-controlling principals will not deprive the minority and female principals
of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated entity, a designated
entity may seek a waiver of the requirement that the equity of the minority and female principals must be calculated
on a fully-diluted basis. The term minority includes individuals of African American, Hispanic-surnamed, American
Eskimo, Aleut, American Indian and Asian American extraction. 

(3) Rural telephone companies. A rural telephone company is any local exchange carrier including affiliates (as
defined in 1.2110(b)(4)), with 100,000 access lines or fewer. 

(4) Affiliate. (i) An individual or entity is an affiliate of an applicant or of a person holding an attributable interest
in an applicant under  24.709 (both referred to herein as ``the applicant'') if such individual or entity_ 

(A) directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the applicant, or 

(B) is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant, or 

(C) is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or parties that also controls or has the power to control the
applicant, or 

(D) has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant. 

(ii) Nature of 

control 

in determining affiliation. 

(A) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or indirectly control or have the
power to control it. Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the
power to control exists.

 




Example. 

An applicant owning 50 percent of the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control such concern
since such party can block any action of the other stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder
with less than 50 percent of the voting stock to block any actions taken by the other stockholders in the other entity.
Affiliation exists when the applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time another person, or persons,
are in control of the concern at the will of the party or parties with the power to control. 


 


(B) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of director, officer or key employee positions; contractual
or other business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key employee is an employee who, because
of his/her position in the concern, has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations or management
of the concern. 

(C) Control can arise through management positions where a concern's voting stock is so widely distributed that no
effective control can be established. 


 




Example. 

In a corporation where the officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 percent of the corporation's
voting stock, but no officer or director has a block sufficient to give him or her control or the power to control and
the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no individual stockholder having a stock interest greater than
10 percent, management has the power to control. If persons with such management control of the other entity are persons
with attributable interests in the applicant, the other entity will be deemed an affiliate of the applicant. 


 


(iii) Identity of interest between and among persons. Affiliation can arise between or among two or more persons with
an identity of interest, such as members of the same family or persons with common investments. In determining if the
applicant controls or has the power to control a concern, persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though
they were one person. 


 




Example. 

Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable interests in the same PCS application. While neither shareholder
has enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have the power to control Corporation Y. The
two shareholders with these common investments (or identity in interest) are treated as though they are one person
and Corporation Y would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant. 


 


(A) Spousal Affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or controlled
by either of them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a court of competent jurisdiction in
the United States. In calculating their net worth, investors who are legally separated must include their share of
interests in property held jointly with a spouse. 

(B) Kinship Affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed to own or control or have the power to control interests
owned or controlled by other immediate family members. In this context ``immediate family member'' means father,
mother, husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law, brother-
or sister-in-law, step-father or -mother, step-brother or -sister, step-son or -daughter, half brother or sister.
This presumption may be rebutted by showing that the family members are estranged, the family ties are remote, or the
family members are not closely involved with each other in business matters. 


 




Example. 

A owns a controlling interest in Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a PCS application.
Because A and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, A's interest in Corporation Y is attributable to B, and thus
to the applicant, unless B rebuts the presumption with the necessary showing.

(iv) Affiliation through stock ownership.

(A) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he or she owns or controls or has the power
to control 50 percent or more of its voting stock.

(B) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern even though he or she owns, controls or
has the power to control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block of stock he or she owns, controls
or has the power to control is large as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.

(C) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a
concern, such minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the aggregate of these minority holdings
is large as compared with any other stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons individually
controls or has the power to control the concern; however, such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control
or power to control, in fact, does not exist.

(v) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge. Stock options, convertible
debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally considered to have a present
effect on the power to control the concern. Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, debentures,
and agreements are generally treated as though the rights held thereunder had been exercised. However, an affiliate
cannot use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over another concern before it actually
does so.






Example 1. 

If company B holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable interest in
a PCS application, the situation is treated as though company B had exercised its rights and had come owner of a controlling
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken into account in determining the size of the applicant.



Example 2. 

If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who holds an attributable
interest in a PCS application, and gives a third party, SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by BigCo,
BigCo will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus the applicant, until SmallCo actually exercises its option
to purchase such shares. In order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of the rule which requires such options
to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the option is not considered to have present effect in this case.



Example 3. 

If company A has entered into an agreement to merge with company B in the future, the situation is treated as though the
merger has taken place.




(vi) Affiliation under voting trusts.

(A) Stock interests held in trust shall be deemed controlled by any person who holds or shares the power to vote such
stock, to any person who has the sole power to sel
