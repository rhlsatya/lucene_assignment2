DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 



Agricultural Marketing Service









Milk in the New England and Other Marketing Areas; Recommended Decision and Opportunity To File Written Exceptions
on Proposed Amendments to Tentative Marketing Agreements and to Orders 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document recommends adopting a proposal to have the Class II milk price in all Federal orders be the basic formula
price for the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.30. The Class II price would, like the Class I price
in all Federal orders, be announced on or before the fifth day of the month and apply to milk marketed during the following
month. This recommended decision would also eliminate the ``add-back'' provision that requires that the difference
between the Class II price and the Class III price be added to a subsequent month's Class II price when the Class II price
for the month falls below the Class III price.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code
and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small
entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendments
would promote more orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers. 

The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.
They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling. 

Prior document in this proceeding: 

Notice of Hearing: Issued December 14, 1993; published December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67380). 



Preliminary Statement 



Notice is hereby given of the filing with the Hearing Clerk of this recommended decision with respect to proposed amendments
to the tentative marketing agreements and the orders regulating the handling of milk in the New England and other marketing
areas. This notice is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the applicable
rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR Part
900). 

Interested parties may file written exceptions to this decision with the Hearing Clerk, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Washington, DC 20250, by the 30th day after publication of this decision in the 

Federal Register

. Six copies of the exceptions should be filed. All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available
for public inspection at the office of the Hearing Clerk during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). 

The proposed amendments and findings and conclusions set forth below are based on the record of a public hearing held
at Ramada Hotel-Old Town, 901 N. Fairfax Street, Alexandria, Virginia, on January 6 and 7, 1994, pursuant to a notice
of hearing issued December 14, 1993, and published in the 

Federal Register

, December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67380). 

The material issues on the record of the hearing relate to: 

1. Replacing the current Class II pricing formula used to establish the Class II milk price in all Federal milk orders.


2. Determining whether emergency marketing conditions exist that would warrant omission of a recommended decision
under the rules of practice and procedure (7 CFR 900.12(d)).

Findings and Conclusions 



The following findings and conclusions on the material issues are based on evidence presented at the hearing and the
record thereof: 

1. Class II milk price. A proposal to replace the Class II milk price formula with the basic formula price for the second
preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.30 should be adopted. Further, this price will be announced by the
fifth day of the preceding month. Thus, for example, the Class II price delivered by producers in September would be
announced on August 5, and would be the M-W price for July plus $0.30. Adoption of this proposal will result in
the Class II milk price and the Class I milk price being announced at the same time and being applicable for all Federal
milk orders. Adoption of this proposal would eliminate the need to retain in Federal milk orders the section providing
for the basic Class II formula price. Adoption of this proposal also eliminates the ``add-back'' provision of current
Class II pricing where, for a given month, if the Class II price is less than the Class III price for the same month, the
difference between these prices are ``added-back'' in computing the second succeeding month's Class II price. 

For most Federal milk orders, the current Class II milk price is the Minnesota-Wisconsin (M-W) price for the
second preceding month as adjusted by an ``updating'' product price formula (the basic Class II formula price provisions
of those orders), plus an amount by which the simple average of the basic formula prices (M-W prices) for the most
recent 12-month period, plus ten cents, exceeds the same 12-month period's average of the basic Class II formula prices.
The Class II milk price is announced by the 15th of the previous month. However, if the announced Class II price for a
given month is less than the Class III price for the same month, the difference between these prices is ``added-back''
in computing the second succeeding month's Class II price. This feature is often referred to as the ``add-back'' provision.


The purpose of the basic Class II formula price (Section 51a in most orders) is to provide a mechanism for updating the
M-W price for the second preceding month so that the Class II price for the current month can be based on the M-W
price but still reflect more current marketing conditions that might indicate forthcoming changes in the M-W
price. This updating is done by comparing movements of wholesale prices for butter, nonfat dry milk, and Cheddar cheese
during the first 15 days of the preceding month with such prices during the same period a month earlier. 

The current Class II differential, which is included in the Class II milk price, in most orders is 10 cents. A 15-cent
differential applies under the three Florida orders, and a 25-cent differential applies under the Pacific Northwest
order. 

The proposal recommended for adoption was proposed by the Milk Industry Foundation and International Ice Cream Association
(MIF/IICA) and the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), Proposal One as published in the hearing notice. The
MIF/IICA are national trade associations for processors of fluid milk, cultured dairy products, and manufacturers
of frozen desert products. The MIF comprises some 220 member companies who operate nearly 500 plants nationwide and
process about 80 percent of all the Class II cultured dairy products in the United States. The IICA comprises some 186
member companies who operate about 350 plants nationwide that manufacture, as well as distribute, approximately
85 percent of the ice cream and related frozen products consumed in the United States. The NMPF is the national farm
commodity organization that represents dairy producers and the dairy cooperative marketing associations they
own and operate. The Federation's members produce a substantial majority of the U.S. milk supply and market milk in
all Federal milk order areas. 

A second proposal, Proposal Two as published in the hearing notice, was offered by Friendship Dairies, Inc. Like the
proposal recommended for adoption, this proposal would replace the Class II price formula with the basic formula
price for the second preceding month, but would add a fixed differential of $0.10 instead of $0.30. Announcement of
the Class II milk price under this proposal would also be by the fifth day of the preceding month. Friendship Dairies,
Inc. (Friendship), is a family owned and operated cultured dairy products manufacturer regulated under the New York-New
Jersey (Order 2) marketing area and processes most of the 250 million pounds of milk which it receives annually from
about 175 independent producers and milk marketing cooperatives in Class II products such as cottage cheese and yogurt.


A third proposal, Proposal Three as published in the hearing notice, was offered by Women Involved in Farm Economics
(WIFE). This proposal would replace the Class II price formula with the basic formula plus a fixed differential of
$0.50. No witness from WIFE testified. However, testimony was received by a witness from the National Farmers Organization
(NFO) in support of a $0.50 Class II differential. The NFO represents about 4,000 member dairy farmers and others who
market their milk through NFO in at least 13 Federal milk orders. 

A fourth proposal, Proposal Four as published in the hearing notice, would replace the Class II price formula with
a Class II price of $0.60 above the Class III or Class III-A price, whichever was higher. This proposal received no evidence
or testimony at the hearing and is considered abandoned.

The fifth proposal, Proposal Five as published in the hearing notice, proposed including the ``add-back'' provision
in the Class II price calculation. Retention of the ``add-back'' provision was proposed by the Central Milk Producers
Cooperative (CMPC), a federation of milk cooperatives with operations in the Chicago Regional (Order 30) marketing
area. Its membership includes: Associated Milk Producers, Inc., Bongards Creameries, Inc., Golden Guernsey Dairy
Cooperative, Independent Milk Producers Cooperative, Land O'Lakes, Inc., Manitowoc Milk Producers Cooperative,
Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., Midwest Dairymen's Company, Milwaukee Cooperative Milk Producers, National Farmers
Organization, Southern Milk Sales, Inc., Wisconsin Dairies Cooperative, Wisconsin Milk Producers Cooperative,
Inc., and the Woodstock Progressive Milk Producers Association. Members of CMPC supply milk to bottlers with Class
I and Class II utilization in Federal Orders 30, 32, 40, 50, 68, and 79. They also supply milk to primarily ``stand alone''
Class II plants in Federal Orders 30, 33, and 49. Certain CMPC members also operate plants processing Class I and Class
II products. 

Testimony in support of adopting Proposal One, which would replace the Class II price formula with the basic formula
price for the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.30 and be announced by the fifth day of the preceding
month, included: 

a. The proponents MIF/IICA and NMPF; 

b. Prairie Farms Dairy, a large regional dairy cooperative that processes and distributes a full line of Grade A dairy
products, wholly owns 15 dairy plants, manages one plant for Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., and jointly owns 11 plants
with other cooperatives; 

c. The Kroger Company, which operates seven fluid distributing plants regulated under six Federal Orders. Kroger
Company also operates two nonpool ice cream manufacturing plants that distribute dairy products in 22 Federal orders;


d. Crowley Foods, a major dairy products manufacturer that operates six plants in Federal Orders 1, 2, and 4, four of
which are involved in the manufacture of Class II products; and 

e. Dean Foods Company, which operates 34 fluid milk plants in 17 Federal orders, processing in excess of 4.5 billion
pounds of milk per year. 

Except for supporting the fifth proposal, which would retain the ``add-back'' provision, the CMPC offered testimony
in support of replacing the Class II price formula with the basic price formula for the second preceding month plus
a fixed differential of $0.30, with this price being announced by the fifth day of the preceding month. 

Testimony offered by the proponent witness for the MIF/IICA cited that price volatility in Federal order markets
in the past few years has resulted in the movement of Class II prices in a magnitude and direction too often in the opposite
direction of Class I and Class III prices. The witness indicated that these more volatile and opposite-moving price
relationships have acted to severely limit Class II processors in their ability to sell products on a forward contract
basis and have caused confusion to their customers who possess a relatively limited knowledge of milk procurement
and pricing. This witness maintains that for efficient marketing and efficient pricing of milk, both Class I and Class
II prices should be reflecting movements in the M-W price at the same time, in the same magnitude, and in the same
direction. 

The MIF/IICA proponent witness offered testimony that revisited a proposal that they submitted at the National Hearing
in the fall of 1990 to change the method for establishing advance notice of the price paid for Class II milk under Federal
orders. At that hearing, the proposal offered was to establish a Class II price by using the M-W price for the second
preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.15, explaining that the rationale for establishing a 15-cent differential
was based on a comparison of the Class II price with the basic formula price over the decade of the 1980's. The proponent
witness observed that for the 10-year period of 1980 through 1990 the Class II price averaged about $0.15 above the
M-W price. 

The witness also testified that because of the Food Security Act of 1985, and the subsequent 1990 Farm Bill, the groundwork
was laid for basing milk prices on market forces more than had been done in the past. The MIF/IICA witness contends that
the result has been more volatile milk pricing which has rendered the current Class II price formula ineffective in
tracking the Class I price, and that the spread between the Class II and the M-W price has increased from its longer-term
average. 

The proponent witness testified that the Class II price has on average approximated the basic formula price for the
second preceding month plus 30 cents. It is on this basis that, according to the proponent witness, they are endorsing
a Class II price based on the basic formula price for the second preceding month plus a 30-cent fixed differential.
They maintain that this approach has the advantage of being easily understood and is revenue-neutral when compared
to the current Class II price computation. They noted that it also allows for the announcement of the Class II price
for the month to be made a full ten days earlier than under the current Class II pricing and announcement structure.


From an economic point of view, the MIF/IICA proponent witness stressed that while revising the price computation
for determining the Class II price is certainly needed, it is imperative not to have a Class II price which would increase
the probability of reducing an already declining market for Class II product sales. Because the Class II price has
averaged nearly 30 cents above the basic formula price for the second preceding month over the past six years, the witness
asserted that the level of the Class II price for raw milk to both processors and producers would be maintained. The
witness offered and cited Federal order statistics that supported their position that Class II product sales are
steady-to-declining. The witness said this underscores the economic need to maintain the cost of Class II milk at
its current level relative to the basic formula price. 

Lastly, the MIF/IICA proponent witness testified that the changing cost structure of milk components under Federal
orders reinforces their position of a fixed 30-cent differential added to the second preceding month's basic formula
price in determining the Class II milk price. The witness noted that since 1990, the butter price has been reduced under
the Federal price support program while the cost of nonfat dry milk has risen. Noting also that the butterfat differential
computation was changed in mid-1990, these two developments have significantly increased the cost structure for
Class II products, particularly for lower to nonfat Class II products.

The NMPF witness offered testimony and evidence in support of the testimony of the MIF/IICA position. The witness
compared the actual Class II price each month under the Chicago Regional order with what the Class II price would have
been under their alternative proposal for the six-year period from 1988 to 1993. These comparisons on average, the
witness said, would neither have increased handler's costs nor have changed prices received by dairy farmers. This
proponent witness maintained that this alternative proposal would have generated more stable prices over the past
six years and that the range between monthly high and low prices would have been less than the actual Class II price range.
According to the witness, their proposal assures that monthly fluctuations in Class I and Class II prices will be identical.
Also, according to the NMPF witness, under the current Class II pricing formula, Class I and Class II prices could,
and often did, move in opposite directions in the same month. They maintained that consistent movements in Class I
and Class II prices would lessen confusion and mitigate marketing problems that arise when Class I and Class II prices
move in opposite directions in the same month. 


The NMPF proponent witness testified that their proposed alternative for determining the Class II milk price is simple,
easy to understand, and can be calculated as soon as the basic formula price is announced by the USDA. In addition to
joining the MIF/IICA position in support of Proposal One, this witness asserted that based on data for the past six
years, adoption of their proposal would result in no changes in either Class II prices paid by handlers or prices received
by producers. Additionally, this witness observed that there would be little overall price impact, but prices would
be more stable, and market conditions would improve. 


A joint brief filed by the MIF/IICA and the NMPF reiterated their testimony calling for adoption of Proposal One. 


The witness for Prairie Farms Dairy, Inc., offered testimony in support of the need to adopt the MIF/IICA and NMPF's
Class II pricing proposal. This witness offered testimony supporting the proponents' observations of the pricing
problems and business impacts that occur when Class I and Class II prices move in different directions in the same month.
This witness attributes, in part, the decline in sales of Class II products to the wide price swings of the Class II price
and how retailers have reacted to these swings. The Prairie Farms witness asserted that adoption of the MIF/IICA and
NMPF proposal would not negatively affect farmers, that returns to processors would be more constant, and that consumers
would see a more stable average price on Class II products, which might result in increased sales.

The Prairie Farms witness viewed the 10-cent differential as a ``nuisance'' differential and summarized their opinion
in four major points in support of Proposal One: (1) that the proposal is supported by the majority of the dairy industry;
(2) the proposal would result in a 10-day earlier announcement of the Class II price along with the Class I price, which
would simplify price changes to customers in a more timely manner; (3) that Class I and Class II prices will move in the
same direction and at the same magnitude; and (4) that Class II price swings will be more moderate, resulting in more
stable consumer prices that hopefully will increase Class II product sales.

The witness representing Kroger Company testified to their support for the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal, offering
that adoption of the proposal will enable processors to intelligently inform their customers of changes in costs
for Class I and Class II products simultaneously. This witness similarly expressed concern of a declining Class II
products market. In support of the fixed 30-cent differential feature for Class II pricing, the Kroger witness maintained
that the value of Class II milk to dairy farmers is greater than the intended target differential of ten cents contained
in the current Class II pricing formula. This witness also asserted that it is important to establish a pricing level
which recognizes these market realities. He maintained that a 30-cent Class II differential added to the basic formula
price recognizes the increased value of Class II milk and establishes a competitive price level for Class II products.
The Kroger witness testified that this proposal would, over time, establish revenue neutrality with the current
Class II pricing method.

The witness for Crowley Foods, testifying in support of the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal, voiced identical concerns
about Class I and Class II price relationships and went further to mention that the 30-cent fixed differential also
offers a happy medium between the price concerns of producers and processors. Additionally, the Crowley Foods witness
said that announcing the Class II price an additional ten days in advance of the current Class II price announcement
would afford improved promotional planning and ensure that Class II prices move in tandem with fluid prices.
 
Testimony by the witness for Dean Foods offered his organization's support for the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal. 

The witness representing the CMPC offered testimony in support of Proposal One. However, CMPC sees the need to retain
the ``add-back'' feature of Class II milk pricing. Hence, their support as proponents for Proposal Five. 

The CMPC witness emphasized the role of Class II products in the market place, offering evidence that customers demand
the same basic product and equal service levels (and costs) for their Class II milk as with Class I milk. However, this
witness testified, the current Class II pricing system does not generate adequate returns to pay for the costs of service
so closely associated with Class I. 

This witness offered evidence in support for a 30-cent differential, indicating it is the minimum justifiable differential
level. However, the witness tempered support for this level with concern that in no event should such apparent increase
in the Class II differential be permitted to result in no real price increase, hence their support for the fifth proposal
for retention of the ``add-back.'' The impetus for retaining the add-back provision offered by the CMPC witness drew
from the Recommended Decision of October 31, 1989 (54 FR 33709) that concluded that Class II milk should not be less
than the value for Class III milk. Although the CMPC witness acknowledged that a Class II differential increase without
an add-back feature would lessen the risk of loss to producers, they continue to assert that the add-back provision
provides the necessary guaranty against such loss.
The brief filed by CMPC elaborated further on their support for retention of the add-back provision. In their view,
the add-back provides the month-to-month guaranty against lost revenue to producers. This is necessary to retain,
stated the CMPC brief, because producer and handler prices are computed on a month-to month basis and not on the basis
of annual, or three year or six year average prices. 

Support for Proposal One was offered in a brief filed on behalf of the Southern Foods Group, Inc. (SFG), and Anderson-Erickson
Dairy Company (AE). The SFG owns and operates six fluid processing plants in Texas and Louisiana and processes Class
II products. The AE operates a fluid processing plant and an ice cream plant in Des Moines, Iowa. In the opinion of SFG/AE,
only Proposal One provides the changes necessary to correct the problems currently associated with Class II milk
pricing. 

The SFG/AE brief points to producer and handler agreement that Class II pricing needs to move in the same direction
and at the same rate as Class I prices and that advance pricing of Class II milk is critical to the ability of the industry
to sell finished Class II products. They also point out that there is universal agreement that the existing Class II
price formula is unacceptable and that Class II pricing should be based on the Minnesota-Wisconsin (M-W)
price series. On the basis of the record, the SFG/AE concludes that the Class II price must be based on the second prior
month's M-W plus a differential of not more than thirty cents without an add-back. 

Testimony offered in support of Proposal Two, which would establish the Class II price as the basic formula price for
the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.10 and have this price announced by the fifth day of the preceding
month, was received from: 

a. The proponent, Friendship Dairies, Inc.; 

b. Kraft General Foods, a large handler of producer milk that operates plants that process Class II and Class III products
in many states; and 

c. Galloway Company, a regulated handler under Federal Order 30 that primarily produces sweetened condensed milk,
and ice cream mixes. 

The proponent witness representing Friendship Dairies, Inc., offered testimony on the need for the Class II differential
to be set at ten cents, and for the ``add-back'' provision of current Class II milk pricing to be eliminated. The testimony
offered in support of their proposal rested largely on prior decisions issued by the Department which had determined
that ten cents above the basic formula price was the appropriate price (differential) level for Class II milk. Additionally,
this proponent witness agreed with other testimony that eliminating the Class II product price formula and using
the second preceding month's basic formula price would more accurately reflect the true direction or magnitude in
the movement of the Class III price and simplify the pricing of Class II milk. This witness emphasized that this distortion
was most attributable to the ``add-back'' provision.

The Friendship witness offered testimony that demonstrated that the add-back provision resulted in price enhancement
of the Class II price above the intended 10-cent target differential. Additionally, this witness testified that
when the Class II price is dramatically higher than the Class III-A price, the economic incentive exists for
using nonfat dry milk (NFDM) in place of fresh fluid milk. According to this witness, while increasing the price of
Class II milk may increase the blend price producers receive in the short term, the long-term effect will be to promote
the use of NFDM for manufacturing Class II products. 

Even if the Class II price had not increased, said the Friendship witness, the decreasing value placed on butterfat
has had the effect of increasing the cost of a hundredweight of Class II skim milk. Because the cost of milk is the single
most significant factor affecting the price of most finished Class II products, especially cottage cheese, this
absolute increase in cost is staggering and sales have declined, said the witness. According to the witness, any resulting
decline in the use of milk for skim-based Class II products would yield a lower price to dairy farmers and would compound
the continuing shift of milk value from the fat to skim component. 

While the Friendship witness applauded the advance pricing feature of Class II milk, he asserted that the add-back
provision of current Class II pricing effectively obliterates any benefits of advance pricing, citing that prices
have become volatile. This volatility has caused confusion in the marketplace because Class II prices too often move
completely independent of the Class III and Class I price, according to this witness. The result of this confusion,
said the witness, is manufacturers attempting to quote a price based upon a forecast, only to rescind because of a large
movement in prices due to the add-back feature of current Class II milk pricing. This reality, said the witness, has
implications at the consumer level because special featured prices on products that are offered to supermarket chains
to promote sales must be guaranteed well in advance so that advertising and related promotional business can be planned.
The witness sees the result of current pricing practices as lower Class II product sales and lower returns to dairy
farmers. 

The Friendship witness testified that their proposal achieves the Department's intent that the Class II price be
Class III plus ten cents. The witness said that adoption of any other proposal would deviate from this intent. Further,
said the witness, supply and demand conditions, at least in Order 2, do not warrant any increase in the Class II price.

Support for the 10-cent differential level for Class II milk was offered from Kraft General Foods (Kraft). The Kraft
witness testified that current Class II pricing has not achieved the targeted Class II differential of ten cents above
the Class III price. Rather, it has exceeded the intended differential, and the difference has been compounded in
recent years. On a month-to-month basis, said Kraft, the advance Class II price formula has resulted in gross distortions
between the Class II and Class III price in the amount of difference and the direction of price movements. 

The Kraft witness expressed disagreement with the MIF/IICA and NMPF proposal only from the view that the appropriate
differential level should be ten cents and not thirty cents. The witness noted that current Class II pricing has resulted
in an effective Class II differential level of almost thirty cents. This is not what should be adopted as the Class II
differential because the effective thirty cents is a result of the failure of the formula used to compute the Class
II price, he said. According to the Kraft witness, it is one thing to achieve enhancement of the minimum regulated price
by mistake and quite another to do so by design. Like the Friendship witness, the Kraft witness drew heavily on previous
decisions that reiterated that the appropriate Class II price be the Class III price plus ten cents. This witness was
of the opinion that supply and demand conditions did not warrant any increase in the current target differential.


Like the Friendship witness, the Kraft witness joined in the concern that if the Class II differential level is increased
above the current intended 10-cent level, there would likely be increased substitution of NFDM for fluid milk in Class
II products. Kraft also agreed with Friendship that the add-back provision should be eliminated. 

The witness from Galloway Company offered testimony in support of Proposal Two. Much of this witness's testimony
supported testimony of the Friendship and Kraft witnesses and further elaborated on the concern for the substitution
of NFDM for fluid milk in the manufacture of Class II products. Noting the wide price disparity between Class III-A
and Class II, this witness said that processors will make their ingredient selection based on arbitrary and capricious
pricing regulations if the Class II price is increased. Increasing the Class II price would not enhance producer revenue
because of the ability to substitute lower-priced ingredients in the manufacture of Class II products.

A brief filed on behalf of Friendship, Kraft, Galloway Company, and the Sorrento Cheese Company, Buffalo, New York,
expressed opposition to the 30-cent differential of Proposal One. This brief maintained that the appropriate differential
should be ten cents and that placing the differential at thirty cents would be undue price enhancement of the Class
II price and would only institutionalize an unintended aberration from the target differential. They contend that
testimony of the proponents of Proposal One is flawed because it is based on the Class II prices that prevailed in 1990
when the M-W price recorded some of its lowest prices in a decade and because of the effects of the add-back provision.


This brief cites past decisions that affirm that the current target 10-cent differential is appropriate, although
because of the add-back provision, the target differential could not be met and this resulted in high Class II prices.
It further revisits past decisions wherein concern was expressed that producer milk may not be made available for
Class II use if the price falls below the Class III price. While experience has not borne this out, they say, caution
still needs to be exercised in the relationship of Class II prices to Class III-A prices and substitution of powder
for producer milk in the manufacture of Class II products. Increasing the differential would only provide additional
stimulus to reduce handler purchases of producer milk. This brief also counters arguments on the role of over-order
premiums, maintaining that such payments reflect the cost of services incurred by producers (such as balancing and
transportation) and not the value of milk. They contend that such premiums should not be relevant to the raw product
value of milk. 

Lastly, the brief asserts that Proposal One's differential of thirty cents is an undue enhancement of the Class II
price and has no basis from an economic point-of-view. The view presented is that thirty cents represents a differential
of convenience between divergent views and is not arrived at on the basis of supply and demand considerations which,
they say, any price change must be predicated upon. 

In support of Proposal Three, a witness representing NFO testified that in addition to supporting a 50-cent Class
II differential, they were also supporting the CMPC proposal that the add-back provision of current Class II pricing
be retained. This witness testified that the record of the previous 43-day National Hearing in 1990 clearly supported
a Class II differential of at least fifty cents. The witness indicated that if the classified pricing structure of
Federal orders is to be of value, then there has to be meaningful price differences between classes. A class price break
of only ten cents between Class III and Class II was not meaningful in the view of this witness. Additionally, said the
NFO witness, handlers are already paying much more than the effective 30-cent Class II differential to secure Class
II milk supplies, perhaps as much as $0.70 to $0.80 cents above Class III is regularly being paid. According to this
witness, this indicates that the value of Class II milk is worth at least 50 cents over the Class III price. The NFO brief
further emphasized that 50 cents establishes a differential level which is at least minimally significant in a classified
price sense. Since Federal milk orders have three classes, then there should be a difference in the use value among
the three categories of products sufficient enough to justify separate classes, said NFO. 

Another reason offered by the NFO witness for a 50-cent Class II differential is the devaluation of butterfat relative
to the nonfat component of milk. Because Class II products have a significant butterfat content when viewed across
all Class II products, Class II milk producers have suffered losses in milk used in this class, and this represents
a reduction in costs to processors. This argument was reiterated in their brief.

The NFO witness testified that even though they would like to see a $1.00 Class II differential, a 50-cent level should
be sufficient, provided that the add-back be retained to maintain the intent that Class II prices be equal to or above
Class III prices. If the differential level were set at $1.00, the NFO witness testified that this would negate the
need for an add-back because of the unlikelihood that the Class III price would exceed the Class II price. 

In their brief, the NFO revisited past decisions that affirmed the establishment and intended role of the add-back
provision. The NFO reasserted that the add-back provides reinforcement to the principle that Class II prices by definition
should not be less than Class III prices. The culprit in the volatility of Class II prices, according to NFO, is the basic
Class II formula price and not the add-back. However, NFO did acknowledge that the add-back does play a role, albeit
a minor one, in Class II price volatility. 

Opponents to retaining the add-back provision argued in submitted briefs that it should be eliminated for a number
of reasons. All opponents agreed that if the Class II milk pricing method adopts using the second preceding month's
basic formula price and adding a fixed differential, then the add-back can only serve to enhance the Class II price.


The SFG/AE brief dismisses concern that producers won't deliver milk for Class II use if the Class II price falls below
the Class III price. In addition to this not happening in the marketplace, SFG/AE points out, it is also a function of
when the price is announced. Producers don't know until the month is over that the Class II price was below the Class
III price. Therefore, no purpose beyond price enhancement is served by an add-back provision. 

This theme is further developed in a brief filed on behalf of Friendship. While CMPC views a ``loss'' to producer revenues
without retaining the add-back, there is in effect no ``loss'' Friendship argues. Class II prices below Class III
prices arise only during months in which the cheese-driven M-W price is increasing, said Friendship. In periods
of falling M-W prices, the Class II differential will exceed the target differential. Producers will not be
denied the benefit of the Class II differential_rather its payment is delayed by two months, they said. In periods
of M-W price volatility, the fact that Class I and Class II differentials would be added to the M-W prices
for the second preceding month will actually serve to restrain, they said, the extent to which such volatility is reflected
in producer prices. Further, the Friendship brief finds it inconsistent to call Class II prices below Class III prices
a ``loss'' because it is not balanced against any concept of gain or a ``pay-back'' in months of a declining M-W
and the effective Class II differential at windfall levels above the M-W. 

It is clear from the record that there is universal endorsement for changing how Class II milk is priced under Federal
orders. The record supports the conclusion that the basic Class II price formula that ``updates'' the second preceding
month's M-W in establishing the Class II price is not functioning as intended; is no longer necessary and contributes,
in part, to price volatility; and results in a distorted relationship with other class prices. The record is also clear
on the unanimous support for retaining the advance-pricing of Class II milk and that the Class II price should be announced
at the same time as Class I prices by using the second preceding month's M-W price and adding a fixed differential.
The only issues of disagreement regarding Class II milk pricing are what is the appropriate Class II differential
and whether or not the ``add-back'' provision should be retained. 


Class II Differential 



Most handlers and producers agree that the appropriate differential value for Class II milk is at least thirty cents
above the Class III price. The record testimony and evidence supports this conclusion on the basis that this differential
value is representative of the additional value of milk used in this class; that it has been the effective differential
paid for Class II milk on average since 1987; and that handlers regularly pay over-order premiums to secure milk for
Class II uses above and beyond the service feature of over-order premiums.

Past decisions regarding the pricing of Class II milk concluded that the basic Class II formula price and target differential
of ten cents should not be changed. The most recent past decision concluded that the target differential of ten cents
should be maintained because supply and demand conditions revealed that there were adequate reserves of Class III
milk to meet Class II needs. That decision on the 43-day National Hearing of 1990 recognized that many in the industry
believed that Class II prices should move in the same magnitude and direction as Class I. That decision and this hearing
clearly reveal that Class I and Class II products are frequently processed together and marketed by handlers in common
distribution channels. However, with a basic differential of ten cents, the decision on the 1990 43-day National
Hearing continued the existing theory of coordinating the Class II price with the current month's Class III price
because Class III products could be used as a source of ingredients for Class II products. In this regard, the need to
coordinate the Class II price with the Class III price was the operative principle in the pricing of Class II milk. It
was for these reasons that the updating product price formula (represented by the basic Class II formula price) was
intended and retained. 

This decision makes a clear break from the past in that Class II milk pricing will function in a manner consistent with
Class I pricing largely in recognition of the similarity of the distribution and marketing channels shared by milk
used in both classes. The record testimony and evidence in this hearing support the conclusion that current Class
II pricing results in prices that do not always move in the same direction and magnitude as Class I prices even though
both products tend to move in the same marketing channels. Linking the Class II pricing method to that of Class I should
better reflect and respond to market conditions as well as simplify the procedure. 

As indicated in the brief by CMPC, the Class II price is driven largely by changes in the basic formula price_the M-W
price. As this price changes through movements in the hard product price markets, so will the Class II price. Therefore,
any change in the Class II price is due primarily to hard product market forces, and not due to the level of the differential
which will not change from month-to-month. 

By establishing the Class II milk price at the second preceding month's M-W and adding a fixed differential, as with
Class I prices, the intent of providing coordination with Class I prices is achieved. Additionally, a consistent
and predictable relationship between Class I and Class II prices is also achieved. However, because of the need to
retain advance pricing for orderly marketing, there may be times when the current month's Class III price will be greater
than the Class II price. Inversely, it is also true, that there may be times when the Class II price is more than 30-cents
greater than the current month's Class III price. Nevertheless, the intended target differential is maintained,
as with Class I pricing, albeit with a lag as exists with Class I pricing. This is a reality that both producers and handlers
must accept with the retention of advanced pricing and have accepted with regard to the Class I price for many years.


The record on this hearing expressed concern for the substitution of NFDM for fresh producer milk used to make Class
II products because the price relationship between the Class II price and, for most Federal orders, the Class III-A
price, may provide the economic incentive to do so. In this regard, there was a call on one hand to have the Class II price
be coordinated with the movement in Class I price and at the same time have the Class II price also be coordinated with
lower-class prices. The impossibility of this is clear. In addition, both handlers and producers will know, in advance,
the prices for both Class I and Class II milk at the same time. Delivery, procurement, and processing decisions can
be made with surety of what prices will be. However, the Class III or Class III-A price will not be known until after the
month has ended. It would seem that without knowing what the Class III or Class III-A price will be in advance, the argument
that NFDM will substitute for producer milk is weakened. This is not to say that substitution will not occur, because
the record reveals that it does. Substitution may occur if a handler predicts the future price relationship between
the Class II price and Class III or Class III-A price, and predicts that the future relationship will provide the economic
incentive for substitution. Economic prediction, in and of itself, is not a proper basis for determining the appropriate
value the milk has in Class II uses.

Significantly different conclusions were reached between the proponents of retaining the current 10-cent target
differential, the proponents for a 30-cent differential, and the proponents for a 50-cent differential on the basis
of the changing value of milk components. The 10-cent proponents argue that the increasing value of skim to butterfat
effectively has raised the costs of Class II products. The 30-cent proponents argue that the changing cost structure
provides, in part, the rationale for maintaining what the recent past's average differential has been. The proponents
for a 50-cent differential argue that because the utilization of butterfat to manufacture Class II products is relatively
high, processors enjoy a price decrease. The arguments presented on the changing cost structure of milk components
is not an issue for the purposes of establishing the Class II price. Rather, it is a butterfat differential issue that
has already been decided upon in other rulemaking decisions. 
As indicated in the brief submitted by SFG/AE, Federal order statistics reveal that there is an abundant supply of
milk for all class uses of producer milk. As indicated in this brief, and in the brief filed on behalf of Friendship,
Kraft, Sorrento Cheese Company, and Galloway Company, a price increase must be predicated upon supply and demand
considerations. Establishing the Class II differential for any given month at thirty cents above the second preceding
month's basic formula price is not intended to effectuate a price increase or a price decrease for Class II milk. Rather
it is a recognition of the effective differential that has been functioning for a long period of time. The record provides
no evidence on any difficulty in procuring milk for Class II use under the current pricing structure. However, the
record does indicate that the pricing structure creates problems regarding the timing and certainty of prices, in
part, because of its reliance on the basic Class II pricing formula used to update the M-W. 
An analysis of the record evidence and officially noticed materials does point to the fact that the Class II price has
averaged nearly thirty cents above the basic formula price for the second preceding month since 1987. Additionally,
an analysis of the effective differential (the difference between the current month's Class III price and Class II
price since adoption of the add-back provision) for the four-year period of 1990 through 1993 indicates that the Class
II differential has averaged thirty cents above the Class III price. It is because of these market realities that there
exists so strong an agreement between producers and processors that the true differential level of thirty cents for
Class II milk is warranted. Some describe this differential level as the appropriate level, some the minimum justifiable
differential, and by some, a differential level that represents the maximum that can be called for on the basis of supply
and demand considerations. 


The Add-Back Provision 


Only two proponents, CMPC who supported a 30-cent differential, and NFO, who advocated a 50-cent differential, called
for retention of the add-back provision. The add-back provision of current Class II milk pricing was established
in December 1989 as part of a decision to have true advanced pricing for Class II milk. Prior to that time, the Class II
milk price that was announced was a tentative price which could be retroactively updated when the Class III price for
the month was greater than the tentative Class II price. In this way, the Class II price was ``floored'' by the Class
III price. The intent of the add-back provision was to maintain in principle this relationship between Class II and
Class III prices. 
The decision on the 43-day National Hearing of 1990 recognized that, at the time of the hearing, the effective Class
II differential had averaged about 4 cents higher than the intended differential of ten cents per hundredweight.
This decision also affirmed the intent of the add-back was to ensure that producers not receive less than the Class
III value for Class II milk in the blend price when the basic formula price exceeded the announced Class II price so that
returns to producers would not be reduced. In this way, the Class II price was coordinated with the current month's
Class III price. 
Now that there exists much more pricing data under the current Class II pricing method, it is clear that the effect of
the add-back provision resulted in a Class II price that can never achieve the intended target differential. While
the goal of the add-back was to provide a degree of coordination with the Class III price, it did not attempt price coordination
with the Class III price in months when the effective Class II differential was well above the targeted differential.
Retention of the add-back feature for any proposal presented at this hearing would have similar results. 
The add-back provision similarly does not balance prices paid by handlers in months when producers receive more (and
at times much more) than the intended target differential. In this view, the add-back feature only works to the price
advantage of the producer who, because of the unintended effect of a pricing provision, enjoys all protection from
market price changes that handlers do not.

To retain the add-back provision under the proposal recommended for adoption herein could only result in increasing
the minimum Class II milk price. An analysis of what the Class II price would have been with and without an add-back provision
reveals that in 1990 the add-back would have enhanced the effective Class II differential by 19 cents; for 1991 it would
have enhanced the Class II differential by 24 cents; for 1992 it would have enhanced the Class II differential by 15
cents; and for 1993 the Class II differential would have been enhanced by 34 cents. Additionally, because this decision
makes a clear break from the past in that Class II prices are more importantly coordinated with the Class I price, there
remains no rational argument for its retention. The need for advance pricing, as well as the need for coordination
with Class I price movements, means moving away from price coordination with the current month's Class III price.
Both objectives can not be simultaneously satisfied. 
2. Need for Emergency Action. On the basis of the record evidence and testimony, no emergency conditions could be ascertained
that would warrant the omission of a recommended decision. 


Rulings on Proposed Findings and Conclusions 


Briefs and proposed findings and conclusions were filed on behalf of certain interested parties. These briefs, proposed
findings and conclusions, and the evidence in the record were considered in making the findings and conclusions set
forth above. To the extent that the suggested findings and conclusions filed by interested parties are inconsistent
with the findings and conclusions set forth herein, the requests to make such findings or reach such conclusions are
denied for the reasons previously stated in this decision. 


General Findings 


The findings and determinations hereinafter set forth supplement those that were made when the New England and other
orders were first issued and when they were amended. The previous findings and determinations are hereby ratified
and confirmed, except where they may conflict with those set forth herein. 
(a) The tentative marketing agreements and the orders, as hereby proposed to be amended, and all of the terms and conditions
thereof, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act; 
(b) The parity prices of milk as determined pursuant to section 2 of the Act are not reasonable in view of the price of
feeds, available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand for milk
in the marketing areas, and the minimum prices specified in the tentative marketing agreements and the orders, as
hereby proposed to be amended, are such prices as will reflect the aforesaid factors, insure a sufficient quantity
of pure and wholesome milk, and be in the public interest; and 
(c) The tentative marketing agreements and the orders, as hereby proposed to be amended, will regulate the handling
of milk in the same manner as, and will be applicable only to persons in the respective classes of industrial and commercial
activity specified in, marketing agreements upon which a hearing has been held; and 
(d) All milk and milk products handled by handlers, as defined in the tentative marketing agreements and the orders
as hereby proposed to be amended, are in the current of interstate commerce or directly burden, obstruct, or affect
interstate commerce in milk or its products. 


Recommended Marketing Agreements and Orders Amending the Orders 


The recommended marketing agreements are not included in this decision because the regulatory provisions thereof
would be the same as those contained in the orders, as hereby proposed to be amended. The following order amending the
orders, as amended, regulating the handling of milk in the New England and other marketing areas is recommended as
the detailed and appropriate means by which the foregoing conclusions may be carried out.

Milk in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania Marketing Area; Proposed Temporary Revision of Certain Provisions
of the Order 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed temporary revision of rule.












</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document invites written comments on a proposal to revise the supply plant shipping standards under the Eastern
Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. The proposal would reduce
shipping percentages for pool supply plants by 10 percentage points for each month during the requested period. The
temporary revision was requested by Brewster Dairy, Inc., a proprietary handler who operates a pool supply plant.
The handler contends that the action is necessary to prevent inefficient and uneconomic movements of milk.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
rule would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers
would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions
of  1036.7(f) of the order, the temporary revision of certain provisions of the order regulating the handling
of milk in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania marketing area is being considered for the months of September 1,
1994, through February 28, 1995. 
All persons who desire to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed revision should send two copies
of their views to USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456,
Washington, DC 20090-6456 by the 7th day after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete
the required procedures and include September 1994 in the temporary revision period. 
All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division
during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).

Statement of Consideration 


The provisions proposed to be revised are the supply plant shipping percentages for the months of September 1994 through
February 1995. The proposed action would reduce the amount of milk that supply plants must ship to pool distributing
plants by 10 percentage points. 
Currently, the order provides that for a supply plant to be considered a pool plant, a minimum percentage of the total
quantity of milk received at the supply plant must be transferred or diverted to and physically received at pool distributing
plants regulated under the order. The minimum percentages are: 40 percent for September, October, and November;
30 percent for December; and 35 percent for January and February. 
The Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order provides that the Director of the Dairy Division may increase or decrease
the percentage delivery requirement by up to 10 percentage points if the Director finds that such revision is necessary
to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. 
The revision was requested by Brewster Dairy, Inc. (Brewster), a proprietary handler who operates a pool supply plant
regulated under the order. Brewster contends that in Fall 1993 the plant was unable to accept surplus distributing
plant milk associated with Order 36 and still meet supply plant qualifications. Consequently, milk from a distributing
plant located 10 miles from Brewster had to be diverted to a manufacturing facility 92 miles away. At the same time,
Brewster had to procure surplus milk from greater distances to fulfill manufacturing obligations. Brewster contends
that this situation represents inequitable and inefficient movements of milk for both supply and distributing plants,
undertaken to meet order shipping requirements. Brewster asserts that the same inequitable and inefficient movements
of milk are expected again for Fall 1994. Thus, Brewster contends, a reduction of supply plant shipping percentages
is necessary to prevent uneconomic and inefficient shipments of milk. 
In view of the current supply and demand relationship, it may be necessary to reduce the supply plant shipping percentage
requirements as proposed to provide for the efficient and economic marketing of milk during the months of September
1, 1994, through February 28, 1994.

Use of the Term ``Fresh'' on the Labeling of Raw Poultry Products; Notice of Public Hearings



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public hearings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing three public hearings on the use of the term ``fresh''
on the labeling of raw poultry products. These hearings will provide an opportunity for interested persons to present
their views on the term ``fresh'' as used on the labeling of raw poultry products, and will assist FSIS in developing
policy.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 

et seq.

) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and maintain an inspection program designed to assure consumers
that poultry and poultry products distributed in commerce or within designated States are wholesome, not adulterated,
and are properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Under this authority, FSIS regulates the labeling of poultry and
poultry products and has established a policy on the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of poultry products.
The current U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) policy permits poultry kept at or below 40
 F and above 0
 F to be labeled as ``fresh.'' This policy is based on Federal regulations that set temperatures, and chilling
and freezing procedures for poultry products, and the labeling of such products.



The State of California enacted a State law (Section 26661 of the California Food and Agriculture Code) restricting
the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labels of poultry that has ever been kept at or below 25
 F. Three trade organizations filed suit to prevent enforcement of the California law, claiming, among other
things, that it was preempted by the PPIA. Federal preemption authority granted in the PPIA prohibits States from
imposing requirements on the labeling of poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, Federal labeling
requirements. On April 8, 1994, a United States District Judge ruled that the labeling provision in the California
law was preempted by Federal law and permanently enjoined the State from enforcing its law. The USDA, at the judge's
request, filed an 

amicus curiae

 brief on the Federal preemption issue. A Federal appellate court, which heard argument on the appeal, has not yet ruled.





As a result of issues raised by the California law and the litigation, the Secretary of Agriculture directed FSIS to
reexamine its policy for the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of raw poultry products. The Secretary stated
that the current labeling policy in this area should be reexamined to ensure that it ``is reasonable and meets today's
consumer expectations.'' The Secretary also directed FSIS to ``make sure that any policy change does not open the
door to problems like the growth of bacteria that could cause foodborne illness.''

FSIS is actively pursuing the Secretary's objective to consider both the scientific bases for the policy and the consumer's
expectations and perceptions of the term ``fresh'' as applied to raw poultry. To ensure that consumers, as well as
all other interested parties, have a voice in establishing the Department's ``fresh'' policy, FSIS is holding three
public hearings. These hearings will provide consumers, processors, producers, industry, State and local government
officials, health officials, and all other interested parties the opportunity to present oral and written views
on this issue.

FSIS has scheduled 1-day public hearings at Modesto, CA; Atlanta, GA; and Washington, DC (see locations and schedules
under 

``dates''

 and 

``addresses''

 above). These public hearings will focus on specific issues regarding the industry's practices and controls, and
consumer expectations and perceptions of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of raw poultry. Participants should
be prepared to respond to those issues which are identified below. Participants may comment on other issues relating
to the labeling of poultry as ``fresh'' that have not been identified by FSIS.



Industry's Practices and Controls



1. What are the current practices and controls used by industry (e.g., processors, wholesalers) for packaging, storing,
and transporting raw poultry products labeled as or to be labeled as ``fresh''?

2. What are the current practices and controls used by retailers for packaging, storing, and handling raw poultry
products labeled as or to be labeled as ``fresh''?

3. Typically, how much time elapses between slaughter and the sale to consumers of raw poultry products labeled as
``fresh''?

Consumer Expectations/Perceptions



1. What is the consumer's expectation when purchasing ``fresh'' poultry?

2. Do consumers consider previously frozen poultry to be ``fresh''?

3. Would it be useful to consumers to have an informative statement, such as ``previously frozen for your protection,''
on the labeling of poultry products that have been previously frozen?

4. What quality characteristics (e.g., tenderness, appearance, etc.) do consumers associate with the term ``fresh''?

5. What are the sensory differences (e.g., taste, texture, etc.), if any, between frozen poultry and poultry which
has never been frozen?

6. Would it be useful to consumers to combine the term ``fresh'' with other descriptive terms (e.g., ``fresh chilled,''
``fresh deep-chilled,'' ``cryo-fresh,'' ``fresh frozen,'' or ``fresh-super chilled'') on the labeling of poultry
products that have been held at temperatures slightly above 0
 F?

The presiding officer at the three hearings will be the FSIS Deputy Administrator for Regulatory Programs. The presiding
officer will be accompanied by a panel of FSIS employees with relevant expertise on the issues.

Persons who wish to participate are requested to submit a written request to Mr. Charles R. Edwards, Director, Product
Assessment Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Washington, DC 20250. The written request should contain the name, address, telephone number, facsimile number,
affiliation (if applicable) of the participant, location of hearing where participation is requested, and a brief
summary of the presentation. FSIS asks groups that have similar interests to consolidate their comments. FSIS will
allocate the time available for the hearings among the persons who have properly submitted a request for participation.
If time permits, FSIS may allow other interested persons attending the hearings who did not submit a request for participation,
in advance, to make an oral presentation prior to the conclusion of the hearings. FSIS hopes that a broad spectrum of
the private and public sectors will participate in these hearings.

FSIS will schedule each appearance after reviewing the notices of participation and accompanying information,
and notify each participant by mail, telephone, or FAX of when the time allotted to the person's oral presentation
is scheduled to begin. Presentations will be limited to 5 to 10 minutes depending on the number of participants. The
hearing schedule will be available at the hearing, and, after the hearing, it will be placed on file with the Docket
Clerk (address above) under Docket Number 94-022N.

FSIS is holding these public hearings to gather information and opinions on the use of the term ``fresh'' as applied
to raw poultry and how it is currently perceived when used on the labeling of raw poultry products. FSIS will use this
information to determine if and how the Department's current policy on ``fresh'' should be changed.

Direct Investment Surveys: BE-10, Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad_1994



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Economic Analysis, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 4(b) of the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act requires that a benchmark survey of
U.S. direct investment abroad be conducted covering 1982, 1989, and every fifth year thereafter. These proposed
rules set forth reporting requirements for the survey covering 1994 and replace the rules for the last benchmark survey
covering 1989. The major change in the reporting requirements to be implemented in these proposed rules is the raising
of the exemption level for determining whether a long form or a short form must be filed for nonbank foreign affiliates
of nonbank U.S. parent companies.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

These proposed rules set forth the reporting requirements for the BE-10, Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment
Abroad_1994. This survey is to be conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, under
the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (Pub. L. 94-472, 90 Stat. 2059, 22 U.S.C. 3101-3108,
as amended) hereinafter, ``the Act.'' Section 4(b) of the Act, as amended, requires that with respect to United States
direct investment abroad, the President shall conduct a benchmark survey covering year 1982, a benchmark survey
covering year 1989, and benchmark surveys covering every fifth year thereafter. In conducting surveys pursuant
to this subsection, the President shall, among other things and to the extent he determines necessary and feasible_




(1) identify the location, nature, and magnitude of, and changes in total investment by an parent in each of its affiliates
and the financial transactions between any parent and each of its affiliates;

(2) obtain (A) information on the balance sheet of parents and affiliates and related financial data, (B) income statements,
including the gross sales by primary line of business (with as much product line detail as is necessary and feasible)
of parents and affiliates in each country in which they have significant operations; and (C) related information
regarding trade, including trade in both goods and services, between a parent and each of its affiliates and between
each parent or affiliate and any other person;

(3) collect employment data showing both the number of United States and foreign employees of each parent and affiliate
and the levels of compensation, by country, industry, and skill level;

(4) obtain information on tax payments by parents and affiliates by country; and

(5) determine, by industry and country, the total dollar amount of research and development expenditures by each
parent and affiliate, payments or other compensation for the transfer of technology between parents and their affiliates,
and payments or other compensation received by parents or affiliates from the transfer of technology to other persons.

The responsibility for conducting benchmark surveys of U.S. direct investment abroad has been delegated by the President
to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated by the President to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated
it to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). 

The benchmark surveys are BEA's censuses, intended to cover the universe of U.S. direct investment abroad in value
terms. U.S. direct investment abroad is defined as the ownership or control, directly or indirectly, by one U.S. person
of 10 percent or more of the voting securities of an incorporated foreign business enterprise or an equivalent interest
in an unincorporated foreign business enterprise, including a branch.

The purpose of he benchmark survey is to obtain comprehensive data on the overall operations of U.S. parent companies
and their foreign affiliates, and on positions and transactions between them. The survey is mandated by Congress
to provide a factual framework for addressing the concerns of policymakers and the general public about the effects
of direct investment abroad on the U.S. and foreign economies. The data from the survey are needed to record the size
of U.S. direct investment abroad, measure changes in such investment, and assess its impact. The data will provide
benchmarks for deriving current universe estimates of direct investment from sample data collected in other BEA
surveys in nonbenchmark years. In particular, they will serve as benchmarks for the quarterly direct investment
estimates included in the U.S. international transactions and the national income and product accounts, and for
annual estimates of the U.S. direct investment position abroad and of the operations of U.S. parent companies and
their foreign affiliates.

The benchmark surveys are the most comprehensive of BEA's surveys in terms of subject matter in order that they obtain
the detailed information on U.S. direct investment abroad needed for policy purposes. As specified in the Act, policy
areas of particular interest include, among other things, trade in both goods and services, employment and employment
compensation, taxes, and technology.

As proposed, the survey will consist of an instruction booklet, a claim for not filing the BE-10, and the following
report forms:

1. Form BE-10A for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is not a bank;

2. Form BE-10A BANK for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is a bank;

3. Form BE-10B(LF) (Long Form) for reporting nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents with assets,
sales, or net income greater than $50 million (positive or negative);

4. Form BE-10B(SF) (Short Form) for reporting nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents with assets,
sales, or net income greater than $3 million, but not greater than $50 million (positive or negative); and 

5. Form BE-10B BANK for reporting foreign affiliates that are banks with assets, sales, or net income greater
than $3 million (positive or negative).

<TEXT>
 

Although the proposed survey is intended to cover the universe of U.S. direct investment abroad, in order to minimize
the reporting burden, foreign affiliates with assets, sales, and net income each to or less than $3 million (Positive
or negative) are exempt from being reported on Form BE-10B(SF) or BE-10B BANK (but must be listed on Form
BE-10A SUPPLEMENT or BE-10A BANK SUPPLEMENT).

In designing the survey, BEA made substantial efforts to consult with data users outside the Bureau and survey respondents
to obtain their views on the proposed benchmark survey, including the availability and need for the data, the data
items to be reported, and the clarity of instructions.The proposed draft incorporates comments received from users
and respondents. In reaching decisions on what questions to include in the survey, BEA considered the Government's
need for the data, the burden imposed on respondents, the quality of the likely responses (e.g., whether the data are
readily available on respondents' books), and BEA's experience in previous benchmark surveys.

The major change from the last (1989) survey to the 1994 survey that is reflected in these proposed rules is the raising,
from $15 million to $50 million, of the exemption level for reporting foreign affiliates on the more complex long form.
In the 1994 survey, nonbank foreign affiliates for which assets, sales, or net income is greater than $50 million (positive
or negative) will be required to be reported on Form BE-10B(LF) (Long Form); nonbank foreign affiliates for
which assets, sales, or net income is greater than $3 million (positive or negative), but for which no one of these items
is greater than $50 million (positive or negative), will be required to be reported on Form BE-10B(SF) (Short
Form). In the 1989 benchmark survey, the long-form exemption level was $15 million. This proposed change means that
approximately 6,000 foreign affiliates that previously would have been reported on the long form will now be reported
instead on the short form, thus reducing both reporting and editing burden from what it would otherwise have been.

Other proposed changes in the survey from 1989 to 1994 include revision of the instructions_primarily for purposes
of clarification_and modification, addition, deletion, or combination of some items on the forms. These changes
do not require changes to the rules. 

A copy of the proposed survey forms may be obtained from: Office of the Chief, Direct Investment Abroad Branch, International
Investment Division (BE-69(A)), Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC
20230; phone (202) 606-5566.



Executive Order 12612



These proposed rules do not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of
a Federalism assessment under E.O. 12612.



Executive Order 12866



These proposed rules have been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.



Paperwork Reduction Act



These proposed rules contain a collection of information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. A request
for review of the forms has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork
Reduction Act. 

The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 14 to 8,500 hours per response,
with an average of 159.4 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
Comments from the public regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information should
be addressed to: Director, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BE-1), U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC
20230; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department
of Commerce.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration,
under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that the proposed rules will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The exemption level is set in terms of the size of a U.S. company's
foreign affiliates. If an affiliate is owned 10 percent or more by the U.S. company and has assets, sales, or net income
greater than $3 million (positive or negative), it must be reported. Usually, the U.S. parent company (the one required
to file the report) is many times larger. Also, to minimize the reporting burden on smaller U.S. businesses, nonbank
foreign affiliates with assets, sales, and net income all below $50 million will be reported on the abbreviated BE-10B(SF),
or short form, rather than the BE-10B(LF), or long form.

(1) For purposes of the BE-10 survey, ``banking'' covers a business entity engaged in deposit banking or closely
related functions, including commercial banks, Edge Act corporations engaged in international or foreign banking,
foreign branches and agencies of U.S. banks whether or not they accept deposits abroad, savings and loans, savings
banks, and bank holding companies, i.e., holding companies for which over 50 percent of their total income is from
banks that they hold. If the bank or bank holding company is part of a consolidated business enterprise and the gross
operating revenues from nonbanking activities of this consolidated entity are more than 50 percent of its total revenues,
then the consolidated entity is deemed not

 to be a bank even if banking revenues make up the largest single source of all revenues. (Activities of subsidiaries
of a bank or bank holding company that may not be banks but that provide support to the bank parent company, such as real
estate subsidiaries set up to hold the office buildings occupied by the bank parent company, are considered bank activities.)
(2) 

Form BE-10A BANK (Report for a U.S. Reporter that is a bank). 

A BE-10A BANK report must be completed by a U.S. Reporter that is a bank. For purposes of filing Form BE-10A
BANK, the U.S. Reporter is deemed to be the fully consolidated U.S. domestic business enterprise and all required
data on the form shall be for the fully consolidated domestic entity.
(i) If a U.S. bank had 

any

 foreign affiliates at any time during its 1994 fiscal year, whether a bank or nonbank and whether held directly or indirectly,
for which 

any one

 of the three items_total assets, sales or gross operating revenues excluding sales taxes, or net income after provision
for foreign income taxes_was greater than $3 million (positive or negative) at any time during the affiliate's 1994
fiscal year, the U.S. Reporter must file a complete Form BE-10A BANK and, as applicable, a BE-10A BANK SUPPLEMENT
listing each, if any, exempt foreign affiliate, whether bank or nonbank. It must also file a Form BE-10B(SF)
for 

each

 nonexempt nonbank foreign affiliate and a Form BE-10B BANK for 

each

 nonexempt foreign bank affiliate.
(ii) If the U.S. bank Reporter had no foreign affiliates for which 

any one

 of the three items listed in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section was greater than $3 million (positive or negative)
at any time during the affiliate's 1994 fiscal year, then only items 1-4 of Form BE-10A BANK and the BE-10A
BANK SUPPLEMENT, listing all exempt foreign affiliates, should be completed.
(3) 

Form BE-10B BANK (Report for a foreign affiliate that is a bank).
(i) A BE-10B BANK report must be filed for each foreign bank affiliate of a bank or nonbank U.S. Reporter, whether
directly or indirectly held, for which any one

 of the three items_total assets, sales or gross operating revenues excluding sales taxes, or net income after provision
for foreign income taxes_was greater than $3 million (positive or negative) at any time during the affiliate's 1994
fiscal year.
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, a Form BE-10B BANK must be filed for a foreign bank
affiliate of the U.S. Reporter that owns another 

nonexempt

 foreign affiliate of that U.S. Reporter, even if the foreign affiliate parent is otherwise exempt, i.e., a Form BE-10B(LF),
(SF), or BANK must be filed for all affiliates upward in a chain of ownership. However, a Form BE-10B BANK is not
required to be filed for a foreign bank affiliate in which the U.S. Reporter holds only an indirect ownership interest
of 50 percent or less and that does not own a reportable nonbank foreign affiliate, but the indirectly owned bank affiliate
must be listed on the BE-10A BANK SUPPLEMENT.
(e) 

Due date. 

A fully completed and certified BE-10 report comprising Form BE-10A or 10A BANK, BE-10A SUPPLEMENT
(as required), and Form(s) BE-10B(LF), (SF), or BANK (as required) is due to be filed with BEA not later than May
31, 1995 for those U.S. Reporters filing less than 50, and June 30, 1995 for those U.S. Reporters filing 50 or more, Forms
BE-10B(LF), (SF), or BANK.

Supplemental Security Income For the Aged, Blind, and Disabled; 
Income and Resources; Victims' Compensation Payments and 
Relocation Assistance Exclusions 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rules. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These proposed regulations will exclude from income and 
resources under the supplemental security income (SSI) program, 
payments received by an individual (or spouse) from a fund 
established by a State to aid victims of crime and certain 
relocation assistance received from a State or local government. These amendments are being proposed in order to
reflect sections 5031 and 5035 of the Social Security Act.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 1612(b) of the 
Social Security Act (the Act), as amended by sections 5031 and 
5035 of Pub. L. 101-508, effective May 1, 1991, excludes from 
income under the SSI program payments received by an individual 
(or spouse) from a fund established by a State to aid victims of 
crime, and relocation assistance provided by a State or local 
government which is comparable to assistance provided under 
title II of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property 
Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. Sections 5031 and 5035 also 
amended section 1613(a) of the Act to exclude these payments and 
assistance from resources for a period of 9 months beginning with 
the month following the month in which they are received. 
However, with respect to victims' compensation payments under 
section 5031, the resource exclusion applies to the extent that 
the payments were made as compensation for expenses incurred or 
losses suffered as a result of a crime. In addition, section 
5031 amended section 1631(a) of the Act to provide that benefits 
under title XVI shall not be denied to any individual solely by 
reason of the refusal of the individual to accept an amount 
offered as compensation for a crime of which the individual was a 
victim. Section 13732 of Public Law 103-66 (the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993) amended section 5035 of Pub. L. 101- 
508 by making permanent the exclusion of relocation assistance 
which originally was set to expire on April 30, 1994. 



These proposed regulations would amend   416.210(b), 416.1124, 
and 416.1210 and create new   416.1229 and 416.1239 to reflect 
these statutory changes. These proposed rules would also amend 
 416.1161 to apply these same income exclusions when victims' 
compensation payments and State and local government relocation 
assistance are received by the ineligible spouse or ineligible 
parent of an eligible individual or child in order that the 
deeming rules not reduce the SSI payment of, or render 
ineligible, the individual or child. The proposed amendments to 
 416.1210 would result in the application of the resource 
exclusions to these deemors. Not to apply the exclusions in such 
cases could thwart the Congressional intent underlying 
sections 5031 and 5035 that State victims' compensation payments 
and relocation assistance not be treated as income and resources 
and thus not adversely affect SSI eligibility. For this same 
reason, the proposed resource exclusions would apply to victims' 
compensation payments and relocation assistance received by an 
alien's sponsor whose resources are deemed to an eligible alien. 
Under section 1621(b)(1) of the Act, income exclusions are not 
applicable in determining the amount of a sponsor's income that 
will be deemed to an alien. Therefore, the proposed income 
exclusions for victims' compensation payments and relocation 
assistance would not apply to such payments received by a sponsor 
whose income is deemed to an alien. Section 416.1204 would be 
updated to reflect the inclusion of the resource exclusion for 
victims' compensation payments and relocation assistance as well 
as the other resource exclusions applicable to the resources of a 
sponsor.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 


We certify that these proposed rules will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities since these rules affect only individuals. Therefore, a 
regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96-354, 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.

These proposed regulations, if promulgated, will impose no 
additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements subject to 
Office of Management and Budget clearance.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan: Texas Emission Statement



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action approves a revision to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) to include revisions to the Texas Air
Control Board, Part III, Chapter 101, 

General Rules

, section 101.10, 

Emission Inventory Requirements

. These revisions are for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within
the ozone nonattainment areas. The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal requirements
for an emission statement program as part of the SIP for Texas. 


In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will
be withdrawn, and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this
action should do so at this time.

Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta
of the State of California: Notice of Availability 






<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Availability. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability of two documents entitled, respectively, ``Alternative Formulation of
the Salmon Smolt Survival Index Criteria'', and ``Setting Goals for Salmon Smolt Survival in the Delta''. The first
of these documents presents EPA's proposed alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival index criteria.
The second document is a summary of the 3 scientific workshops held on June 9, 17, and 29, 1994, and prepared by the independent
workshop facilitator. This notice also requests comments on EPA's alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival
index criteria. EPA is not soliciting any additional comments outside the scope of this notice. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background 




On January 6, 1994, EPA published in the 

Federal Register

 a Proposed Rule for water quality standards in the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta
of California (Bay/Delta) (59 FR 810). The purpose of the rule would be to establish certain water quality criteria
for the Bay/Delta as authorized and required by section 303 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The federally-proposed rule
would replace portions of the State of California's water quality standards that were disapproved by EPA on September
3, 1991. Under the proposed regulations, three new sets of criteria would be established: salinity criteria protecting
the Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses, a second set of salinity criteria (measured in
electrical conductivity) to protect the Fish Spawning designated use in the lower San Joaquin River, and a set of salmon
smolt survival index criteria to protect the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat designated uses in the estuary.


EPA held public hearings on the Proposed Rule during the weeks of February 21, 1994 and February 28, 1994, and the comment
period closed on March 11, 1994. Subsequent to the close of the comment period, a number of scientific workshops on
the salmon smolt criteria were sponsored and facilitated by a group of water users (including the California Urban
Water Users) and environmental organizations (including the Bay Institute). The purpose of these workshops was
to consider and evaluate both the Proposed Rule and the major comments received by EPA during the comment period. The
workshop sponsors invited EPA to attend the workshops, and EPA staff participated in workshops on June 9, 17, and 29,
1994. The discussions at these workshops are summarized in the August 10, 1994 document entitled ``Setting Goals
for Salmon Smolt Survival in the Delta'' by Wim Kimmerer. After reviewing the oral and written comments and the discussions
at these workshops, EPA has developed a proposed alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival index criteria.

In its Proposed Rule, EPA proposed salmon smolt survival index criteria to protect certain of the designated uses.
The survival index quantifies and predicts the survival of salmon migrating through the Delta. These survival indices
are based on models developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and are based in large part on experiments
measuring and comparing smolt survival under a number of different physical conditions of varying migration pathways,
water temperatures, flow rates, and rates of exports from the Delta. 

The actual criteria in the Proposed Rule consisted of target salmon smolt survival index values for the Sacramento
and San Joaquin River systems, varying according to the type of water year (critically dry, dry, below normal, above
normal, and wet). 
Success in attaining the target values was to be predicted by using the USFWS models. 



II. Alternative Formulation 



EPA continues to believe that the USFWS models represent the best available tools to analyze the success of migration
of salmon through the Delta, and provide an adequate scientific basis for establishing water quality criteria that
will protect the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat uses. However, as a result of its review of comments on
the Proposed Rule and its consideration of the discussions at the scientific workshops described above, EPA is proposing
an alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival index criteria. 

Continuous function. The first major conceptual change in the alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival
index criteria is the use of continuous functions to describe the target index values. The proposed rule had different
target values for each of the five water year types. This meant that, for example, all critically dry years would have
the same target index value, even though the hydrological conditions within a critically dry year category could
vary substantially. A ``continuous function'' or ``sliding scale'' approach would recognize this intra-category
variability by providing a target index value that changes simultaneously with changes within underlying hydrological
conditions. For example, the target index value in a ``wet'' critically dry year would be higher than the value for
a ``dry'' critically dry year. 

EPA received comment on both the proposed estuarine habitat standard and the salmon smolt survival index criteria
to the effect that a continuous function relating the target values to a given condition was more flexible than the
use of five water year categories, while still protecting the designated uses of the waterbodies. Accordingly, the
salmon smolt survival index criteria for both the Sacramento River system and the San Joaquin River system have been
restated as continuous functions. On the Sacramento River system, the target index values have been correlated to
water temperature. On the San Joaquin River system, the target index values have been correlated to unimpaired water
flow. 

Performance standard. The second major proposed change in the alternative formulation of the salmon smolt survival
index criteria is to move away from using the model to predict attainment, and instead to measure attainment of the
criteria using actual experimental data. In the Proposed Rule, the criteria included the actual USFWS models for
the two river systems. Attainment of the criteria would be predicted by evaluating the variables included in the model
itself. That is, the state could attain the criteria only by manipulating the variables contained in the model equations
such that target index values were obtained. Although EPA believes the model contains the substantial majority of
the factors necessary for migrating smolt survival, EPA has restated the criteria to be a true performance standard.
The proposed alternative formulation states an index value as the target criteria (correlated, as indicated above,
to either temperature or unimpaired river flow). Attainment with the criteria, however, would no longer be determined
by manipulating the variables contained in the model, but instead be based on real-time field monitoring to determine
whether a given set of implementation measures have actually attained the target values in the criteria. This reformulation
gives the state maximum latitude to develop implementation measures that attain the target index value. Further,
the reformulation minimizes any statistical deficiencies that may exist in the model by measuring actual measured
success in meeting the target, rather than modeled or predicted success. 

EPA believes that the model will continue to be critically important to the standards process, in that it is the best
mechanism for developing and evaluating potential implementation measures. However, by not formally including
the model itself as a part of the criteria, the alternative formulation gives those implementing the standard maximum
latitude to develop implementation approaches that achieve the target index values. 

More detailed discussion of the conceptual basis for the proposed changes is found in the workshop summary entitled
``Setting Goals for Salmon Smolt Survival in the Delta''. The specific proposed criteria developed by EPA are contained
and described in the document entitled ``Alternative Formulation of the Salmon Smolt Survival Index Criteria.''




III. Public Participation 



EPA desires full public participation in arriving at its final decisions, and therefore solicits comments on all
aspects of this notice from all interested parties. However, EPA requests that comments be limited to the specific
issues raised by the two documents about the salmon smolt survival index criteria. EPA does not intend to respond to
late comments submitted at this time which concern other aspects of the Proposed Rule. Ample opportunity for such
comment was already provided at the public hearings and during the comment period that followed publication of the
Proposed Rule, and EPA is committed to signing a final rule by December 15th, 1994. For those submitting comments,
whenever applicable, full supporting rationale, data, and detailed analysis should be submitted to allow EPA to
make maximum use of the comments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



End Stage Renal Disease Payment Exception Requests 



In accordance with section 1881(b)(2) and (b)(7) of the Act, a facility that furnishes dialysis services to Medicare
patients with end stage renal disease is paid a prospectively determined rate for each dialysis treatment furnished.
This rate is a composite that includes all costs associated with furnishing dialysis services except for the costs
of physician services and certain laboratory tests and drugs, which are billed separately. The composite rate may
be adjusted periodically to reflect actual facility costs. 

When a facility incurs higher costs, HCFA may, under certain conditions, grant the facility an exception to its composite
rate and set a higher prospective rate. The facility must show, on the basis of projected cost and utilization trends,
that it will have an allowable cost per treatment higher than its prospective payment rate and that the excess costs
are attributable to one or more specific circumstances. These conditions are specified in existing regulations
at 42 CFR 413.170 and are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 27 of HCFA's Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM).


A facility may incur excess costs when it furnishes dialysis services to a patient population with a greater number
of pediatric patients or sick patients, such as those with heart disease or unstable medical conditions, which require
special equipment, procedures, supplies or staff trained in treating these patients. This is referred to as ``atypical
service intensity'' or ``patient mix.'' A facility may also incur increased costs when it is the only supplier of dialysis
services in its geographical area (an isolated essential facility), and its patients are unable to obtain dialysis
services elsewhere without considerable hardship. Such an isolated facility may find it difficult to find trained
staff, may have to pay employees additional wages or travel allowances, or may have to pay additional costs to have
supplies shipped to the area. 

A facility may also incur excess costs as a result of a fire, earthquake, flood, or other natural disaster (extraordinary
circumstances). However, we do not recognize those costs when a facility did not maintain adequate insurance, did
not file a claim for losses covered by insurance, or did not use its self-insurance program. 

Increased training costs may also be associated with a facility's self-dialysis training program. A facility may
train patients to perform self-dialysis with little or no professional assistance in the facility or at home. It may
also train other individuals to assist patients in performing self-dialysis or home dialysis. A facility that has
training costs greater than its composite training rate may apply for an exception, but must prove that the costs are
reasonable and allowable.

Typically, a patient undergoes dialysis three times a week. A facility may furnish a substantial number of treatments
to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times a week. As a result, the facility typically has higher per
treatment cost because the treatments involve increased labor or supplies. When this occurs, a facility may apply
for an exception to the composite rate. 



Organ Acquisition Costs 



Under  412.113, Medicare pays for heart, kidney, and liver acquisition costs incurred by transplant centers
on a reasonable cost basis. Currently, Medicare-certified transplant centers compute Medicare acquisition costs
for hearts and livers on Supplemental Worksheet D-6 of the Hospital Cost Report (Form HCFA-2552). The
average acquisition costs of hearts and livers transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries are deducted
from the total acquisition costs for all hearts and livers. Medicare reimburses the remaining balance as program
costs for these organs. Based on recent cost analyses, we are concerned about the very high Medicare costs associated
with acquiring a small number of hearts and livers. As a result, we propose to change the method of computing heart and
liver acquisition costs to more accurately determine the costs of acquiring organs transplanted in Medicare recipients.
The method we propose for computing acquisition costs for hearts and livers conforms to the method used for kidneys
because the kidney formula more fairly accounts for Medicare's portion of such costs, including organ wastage. The
kidney formula is specified in  413.202. 



II. Proposed Revisions 



End Stage Renal Disease Payment Exception Requests 



On several occasions, we have denied exception requests based on application of the criteria contained in our PRM,
and the facilities have appealed the denials; subsequently some denials have been overturned by the Provider Reimbursement
Review Board (PRRB) because the PRRB is not bound by the guidelines in the PRM. Therefore, we are proposing to place
in regulations the specific requirements for determining exceptions. We are proposing the conditions contained
in the PRM, with explanations in this preamble, that a facility must meet to qualify for a payment exception and the
criteria that we use to evaluate whether the facility meets the conditions. 

We propose to revise 42 CFR Part 413, Subpart H, Payment for ESRD Services. Currently, all our rules for payment for
covered outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments are in  413.170. We propose to reorganize the content
of Subpart H and divide existing  413.170 into several smaller sections so that readers can more easily locate
specific topics. 

Following is a list of the new sections: 





Below we discuss the proposed content of Subpart H.

Section 413.180 Procedures for Requesting Exceptions to Payment Rates



We would redesignate the content of  413.170(f), Procedures for requesting exceptions to payment rates, as
new  413.180. In  413.180(d), we propose to expand this item to provide that a facility must request an
exception to its payment rate within 180 days of: 

 The effective date of its new prospective payment rate(s); 

 The effective date that HCFA opens the exceptions process; or 

 An extraordinary cost-increasing event, as described in  413.188. 

In determining the 180-day period in which HCFA issues new prospective payment rates or opens the exceptions process,
HCFA counts the effective date as the first day of the 180-day period because payment for ESRD services under the new
composite rates or an approved exception begins that day. An exception request with all required documentation must
be filed with the intermediary by the 180th day. Delivery of the request must be accomplished through a method that
documents the date of receipt during the intermediary's regular business hours. A postmark or other similar mark
does not serve as documentation of the date of receipt. 

Initially, when the ESRD prospective payment rate regulations were promulgated, HCFA intended to annually review
composite rates. However, when HCFA determined that updated rates could not be issued in the near future, it opened
the exceptions process without issuing new rates. This allowed ESRD facilities additional opportunities (other
than when new rates are issued) to file for exceptions to their payment rates. HCFA has opened the exceptions process
twice, permitting facilities that had received partial approvals, new facilities or facilities that had been previously
denied exceptions the chance to file for an exception. 

In  413.180(f), we propose to require that the facility applying for an exception request compare its most recently
completed cost report with those of prior years. Such comparisons may reveal significant changes that may indicate
errors or problems with the cost or statistical data and, thus, the need for HCFA to more intensively review the applicable
area. Any changes to cost or statistical data (for example, treatments) must be explained and the explanation included
with the documentation supporting the exception request. 

In   413.180(f)(3) and 413.182, we would require that ESRD facilities provide documentation showing
that their excessive costs are specifically or directly attributable to one or more of the exception criteria. As
an example, for an atypical service intensity request, the facility should be able to document the excessive costs
of furnishing care to sicker patients. After submitting evidence that it treats sicker patients, to document higher
labor costs, the facility should submit records to show that either a more experienced and better trained nursing
staff is required to treat these patients, or additional nursing staff time is needed, or both. An example of the type
of records that a provider should submit to document its higher nursing costs could consist of staffing schedules,
indicating staff and patients per shift. The facility could indicate (on the schedules) the sicker patients treated
and the more experienced or additional staff needed to treat them. The monthly staffing schedules should represent
12 months and coincide with the actual cost reporting period of the cost report submitted with the exception request.


For a hospital facility, if the direct cost of nursing staff in the dialysis department increased, the administrative
and general (A & G) costs allocated to that department would automatically increase. This is the result of hospital
cost reporting accounting protocol, which requires A & G costs to be allocated on the basis of the accumulated
costs of the other departments. The accounting protocol used for cost reporting is separate and distinct from identifying
the actual A & G costs that are directly attributable to the additional nursing staff costs. Since the total A &
G costs represent costs allocated to the dialysis department, they do not accurately reflect the actual A & G costs
incurred as a result of the additional nursing staff costs. The facility must separately identify the A & G costs
directly attributable to the additional nursing staff costs.

In  413.180(g), we propose to codify in regulations section 1881(b)(7) of the Act by providing that unless HCFA
disapproves a composite rate exception request within 60 working days after it is filed with its intermediary, the
exception is deemed approved. We believe the Congress viewed the 60 days as beginning when we have a fully documented
exception request. Therefore, the first day for counting the 60 working days is the date that the exception request
is filed with all required documentation with the intermediary, not the date it was mailed nor the date postmarked
on the package. For this reason, facilities are advised to send their requests by a method that documents the date of
receipt during the intermediary's regular business hours. We would require that intermediaries review and process
all exception requests within 15 working days, and we would process the exceptions within 45 working days. If we fail
to process a composite rate exception request timely, we would deem the renal facility's rate request approved. 



Section 413.182 Criteria for Approval of Exception Requests
 


We propose to redesignate the content of  413.170(g), criteria for approval of exception requests, as  413.182.
In this section we would list the criteria that may be the basis of a rate exception. These criteria are: Atypical service
intensity (patient mix), as specified in a new  413.184; Isolated essential facility (new  413.186);
Extraordinary circumstances (new  413.188); Self-dialysis training costs (new  413.190); or Frequency
of dialysis (new  413.192). 

HCFA occasionally receives one-month time studies from facilities attempting to show that they are entitled to an
exception. HCFA does not require one-month time studies and has not considered a one-month time study as adequate
documentation to justify an exception. In the event that a time study is used, an applicant should refer to the general
Medicare principles regarding the adequacy of periodic time sampling described in chapter 23 of the Provider Reimbursement
Manual (HCFA Publication 15-1). 



Section 413.184 Payment Exception: Atypical Service Intensity (Patient Mix)



In new  413.184, paragraph (a) would repeat the content of existing  413.170(g)(1). We would specify
in a new paragraph (b) the documentation required of a facility requesting a rate exception under this provision.


We would require that a facility submit a list of all outpatient dialysis patients (including all home patients) treated
during the most recently completed fiscal or calendar year showing: 

 Patients who received transplants, including the date of transplant; 

 Patients awaiting a transplant who are medically able, have given consent, and are on an active transplant
list, and projected transplants; 

 Home patients; 

 Infacility patients, staff assisted or self-dialysis; 

 Individual patient diagnoses; 

 Diabetic patients; 

 Patients isolated because of a contagious disease; 

 Age of patients; 

 Mortality rate broken out by age and diagnosis; 

 Number of patient transfers, reasons for transfers and any related information; and 

 Total number of hospital admissions for the facility's patients, reason for, and length of stay for, each admission.


When adjudicating exception requests, to determine if a substantial proportion of the facility's outpatient maintenance
dialysis treatments involve more intense dialysis services and special dialysis procedures, HCFA will compare
the above data submitted by providers to data contained in HCFA's Patient Profile Tables. The information in the Tables
is developed annually and represents information on persons with end-stage renal disease covered by Medicare. While
the number of treatments is used when determining whether a facility furnishes a substantial proportion of treatments
to atypical patients, it is the typical or the atypical patient mix that generates the total treatment count used in
this determination. In determining whether a facility's patients are atypically sick, each patient category is
individually compared to its corresponding specific norm (national average). Various combinations of factors
might lead to a determination that a facility has an atypical patient mix. For example, a facility might qualify for
an exception for atypical patient mix if the percentage of its diabetic patients, older patients, and mortality rate
were significantly higher than the national averages. 

By its very nature, an exceptions process addresses situations that are not anticipated, and, because of the myriad
combinations of factors that are possible, we cannot articulate a single specific standard that encompasses all
of these situations. Instead, HCFA will evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis to determine if the characteristics
of the patient population are such that it might be beyond the facility's control to incur higher costs. (Facilities
will still have to demonstrate that the atypical patient mix, in fact, caused higher costs.) 

We would also require that a facility submit the following documentation on nursing personnel (registered nurses
(RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), technicians and aides) costs incurred during the most recently completed
fiscal or calendar year cost report showing: 

 Amount of remuneration of each employee; 

 Number of personnel; 

 Amount of time spent in the dialysis unit; and 

 Staff to patient ratio based on total hours, with an analysis of productive and nonproductive hours. 

The facility must demonstrate that its nursing personnel costs have been allocated properly between each mode of
care, and that the additional nursing hours per treatment are not the result of an excess number of employees in the
outpatient maintenance renal dialysis department. Normally, when determining whether there is an excess number
of employees assigned to a facility's dialysis department, HCFA uses staff to patient ratios. However, in addition
to the staff to patient ratios, we might also consider staffing schedules, as previously discussed. 

When adjudicating exception requests, HCFA will utilize the above data to determine if the facility's patients received
significantly more nursing hours per treatment than patients would receive in other facilities and whether the facility's
higher per treatment costs were necessitated by the special needs of the patients. 

We would also require that a facility submit documentation on supply costs incurred during the most recently completed
fiscal or calendar year cost report showing: 

 By modality, a complete list of supplies used routinely in a dialysis treatment; and 

 The make and model number of dialyzer and component cost of each dialyzer. 

The facility must demonstrate that excess supply cost per treatment is caused by the special needs of the patients
and is not the result of inefficiency. The facility must submit documentation to demonstrate that it prudently purchases
items and services (for example, uses bulk purchase discounts when available).

When adjudicating exception requests, HCFA will utilize the above data to determine if the facility's patients received
supplies that are medically necessary to meet special medical needs of the facility's patients. 



Section 413.186 Payment Exception: Isolated Essential Facility
 


We would redesignate  413.170(g)(2) as new  413.186, retain the existing content of  413.170(g)(2)
and add documentation requirements for facilities to use when applying for a payment rate exception based on being
an isolated essential facility. 



Isolated Facility



To be considered ``isolated,'' a facility must document that it is located outside an established Metropolitan Statistical
Area and provides dialysis to a permanent patient population, as opposed to a transient patient population. 



Essential Facility
 


To be considered essential, the facility must document that a substantial number of its patients cannot obtain dialysis
services elsewhere without substantial additional hardship and the additional hardship the patients will incur,
generally, will be in travel time and cost. 



Cost per Treatment
 


The facility must document that its cost per treatment is reasonable and explain how the facility's cost per treatment
in excess of its composite rate relates to the isolated essential facility criteria. For example, if a facility incurs
higher supply costs, it will need to identify the additional costs incurred on a per treatment basis and then relate
that additional cost per treatment to the exception criteria. 



Additional Information



The facility must also furnish, in a format that concisely explains the facility's cost and patient data to support
its request, the following information: 

 A list of current and requested payment rates for each modality. 

 An explanation of how the facility's costs in excess of its composite rate payment are attributable to the isolated
essential facility criteria specified above in this section. 

 An explanation of any unusual geographic conditions in the area surrounding the facility. 

 A copy of the latest filed cost report and a budget estimate for the next 12 months on cost report forms. 

 An explanation of unusual costs reported on the facility's actual or budgeted cost reports and any significant
changes in budgeted costs and data compared to actual costs and data reported on the latest filed cost report. 

 The name, location of, and distance to, the nearest ESRD facility. 

 A list of patients, treatment modality, commuting distance and commuting time to current and next nearest
ESRD facility.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940826-1-00044 </DOCNO>

 The historical and projected patient to staff ratios and number of machines used for maintenance dialysis
treatments. 

 A computation of the facility's treatment capacity, computed by dividing the maintenance treatments actually
furnished by the total maintenance treatments that could have been furnished (in other words, total stations multiplied
by the number of hours of operation divided by the average length of dialysis) for the year. 
 The geographic boundaries and population size of the facility's service area. 



Section 413.188 Payment Exception: Extraordinary Circumstances



We would redesignate  413.170(g)(4) as  413.188 with no changes except for the addition of internal paragraph
coding. 



Section 413.190 Payment Exception Self-Dialysis Training Costs

 


In new  413.190, paragraph (a) would repeat the content of existing  413.170(g)(5). To that we would add
the documentation that we would require of a facility requesting a rate exception under this provision. We would require
that a facility justify its exception request by separately identifying those elements contributing to its costs
in excess of the composite training rate. We consider the facility's total costs, cost finding and apportionment,
including its allocation methodology, to determine if costs are properly reported by treatment modality. Exception
requests for a higher training rate will be granted only with respect to those cost components relating to training
such as technical staff, medical supplies, and the special costs of education (manuals and education material).
Overhead and other indirect costs do not generally form a basis for granting an exception. 


The facility must provide the following information to support its exception request: 

 A copy of the facility's training program. 

 Computation of the facility's cost per treatment for maintenance and training sessions including an explanation
of the cost difference between the two modalities. 

 Class size and patients' training schedules. 

 Number of training sessions required, by treatment modality, to train patients. 

 Number of patients trained for the current year and the prior 2 years on a monthly basis. 

 Projection for the next 12 months of future training candidates. 

 The number and qualifications of staff at training sessions. 



Accelerated Training Exception



An ESRD facility may bill Medicare for a dialysis training session only when a patient receives a dialysis treatment
(which normally is three times a week). If an ESRD facility elects to train all its patients using a particular modality
more often than during each dialysis treatment and, as a result, the number of its billable training dialysis sessions
is less than its actual training sessions, the facility may request a composite rate limited to the lesser of the facility's
projected training cost per treatment (CPT) or the CPT the facility would have received in training a patient. For
example, facility x trains patients 5 days a week for a 3-week training period (15 training sessions). Facility Y trains
patients only during a dialysis session, 3 per week, but for a 5-week training period. Both facilities' composite
training rates were determined to be $150 per treatment. Facility X's payment would be adversely affected, since
its payment would be limited to the number of billable training sessions. Facility X's payment would be $1,350 (3 weeks
 x  3 treatments per week  x  $150) compared to facility Y's $2,250 payment (5 weeks  x  3 treatments
per week  x  $150). To correct this situation, an exception may be approved (assuming the facility documents
costs) to increase facility X's rate not to exceed $250 per treatment ($2,250 
 9). 



An ESRD facility may bill a maximum per patient of 25 training sessions for hemodialysis training and 15 training sessions
for continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) training.
To ensure adequate patient training, HCFA presumes a minimum number of training sessions per patient in calculating
exception rates, 15 for hemodialysis and 5 for CAPD and CCPD, where the renal facility's actual experience is less
than the minimum number of training sessions. The minimum and maximum numbers are based on HCFA's national data and
general program statistics. These numbers represent the minimum and maximum number of treatments necessary to adequately
train a patient and have been established to avoid paying any additional costs associated with over-training as well
as assuring that quality of care is not jeopardized by not adequately training a patient. 


For example, a facility trains all its CAPD and CCPD patients in 3 training sessions, and its composite training rate
is determined to be $150. To calculate a facility's training exception rate, the facility's training rate is multiplied
by 15 (the maximum training sessions per patient) and then divided by the facility's actual training sessions, unless
the actual sessions are less than the minimum. Using the facility's actual training sessions, the exception training
rate would be $750 ($150  x  15 = $2,250 
 3). However, based on using the minimum of 5 training sessions, the approved training rate would be $450 ($150  x 
15 = $2250 


'

 5). 


To justify an accelerated training exception request, an ESRD facility must document that all training sessions
provided under a particular modality are to be provided during the shorter but more condensed period. The facility
must submit with the exception request a list of patients, by modality, trained during the most recent cost report
period, and the list must include each beneficiary's name, age, and training status (completed, not completed, being
retrained, or in the process of being trained). The total treatments from the patient list must agree with the total
treatments reported on the cost report filed with the request. We propose to deny exception requests that a facility
submits without the above documentation. 




Section 413.192 Payment Exception Frequency of Dialysis



We would redesignate paragraph (g)(6) of  413.170 as  413.192 and add the following provisions. 


Existing  412.170(g)(6) specifies that, to qualify for an exception to the prospective payment rate based
on frequency of dialysis, the facility must have a substantial portion of outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments
furnished to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times per week. A facility that furnishes a substantial
portion of outpatient maintenance dialysis services to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times per
week typically has higher costs per treatment because the treatments that are furnished to these patients last longer
and involve higher labor and supply costs. For a facility to qualify as having a substantial portion of outpatient
maintenance dialysis treatments furnished to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times per week, a facility
must be able to document that it has a decrease in treatments in excess of 15 percent, and cost increases due to frequency.
Because the facility is only dialyzing patients twice a week instead of three times, if 100 percent of their patients
dialyze twice a week, the facility would lose 33.3 percent of treatments on an annual basis. HCFA has determined that
15 percent of lost treatments is substantial.

<PARENT> FR940826-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The percentages calculated above, and HCFA's determination of what is substantial is explained below. If a facility
had 200 patients and all the patients dialyzed twice a week, then the facility would be losing 200 billable treatments
a week or 33.3 percent. This calculation is as follows: 



200 patients x 3 times a week=600 treatments a week; 
200 patients x 2 times a week=400 treatments a week; 
Lost treatments=200 treatments a week. 
Lost treatments
total treatments=percentage of lost treatments (200
600=33.3 percent).

 

To arrive at a reasonable determination of substantial, we concluded that slightly less than half a facility's treatments
would have to be furnished to patients who dialyze less frequently than three times a week. This calculation is as follows:




200 patients x 3 times a week=600 treatments a week; 
100 patients x 2 times a week=200 treatments a week; 
100 patients x 3 times a week=300 treatments a week; 
Total treatments furnished=500 treatments a week. 
Lost treatments=100 treatments (100
600=16.67 percent).

 

We propose to require that, in order to document that it furnishes a substantial number of dialysis treatments at a
frequency less than three times per week, a facility submit the following information. The facility must submit a
list of patients who received outpatient dialysis treatments for the latest historical cost report that is being
filed with the request. The list must indicate_
 Whether the patients are permanent, transient or temporary; 
 The medically prescribed frequency of dialysis; and 
 The number of dialysis treatments that each patient received on a weekly and yearly basis and an explanation
of any discrepancy between that calculation and the number of treatments reported on the facility's cost report.

The facility must also submit a list of patients used to project treatments. The list must indicate_
 Whether the patients are permanent, transient or temporary; 
 The medically prescribed frequency of dialysis; 
 The number of dialysis treatments that each patient is projected to receive on a weekly and yearly basis, an
explanation of any discrepancy between that calculation and the number of treatments reported on the facility's
projected cost report, and an explanation for any change between prior actual and projected data. 
In order for HCFA to determine if the facility meets the 15 percent requirement discussed above, the following information
must be submitted: 
 A schedule showing the number of treatments to be furnished twice a week and the number of treatments that would
have been furnished if each beneficiary were dialyzed three times a week, including a computation of the facility's
projected cost per treatment using projected treatments based on the twice a week calculation and the three times
a week calculation. 
 A schedule showing the computation of the percentage decrease in the number of treatments, which must be at
least 15 percent to be deemed substantial for approval of an exception. 


Section 413.194 Appeals 


Existing  413.170(h) would be redesignated as  413.194. In new  413.194, in addition to coding
and editorial changes, we would make clear that exhaustion of administrative remedies is a prerequisite for judicial
review. 


Section 413.196 Notification of Changes in Rate-Setting Methodologies and Payment Rates


Existing  413.170(i) would be redesignated as  413.196 with only coding and editorial changes. 


Section 413.198 Recordkeeping and Cost Reporting Requirements for Outpatient Maintenance Dialysis


Existing  413.174 would be redesignated as  413.198. 


Section 413.200 Payment of Independent Organ Procurement Organizations and Histocompatibility Laboratories


Existing  413.178 would be redesignated as  413.200. In new  413.200(b), we would revise the definition
of ``Freestanding.'' We would provide that an organ procurement organization (OPO) or a histocompatibility laboratory
is freestanding unless it_

 Is subject to the control of the hospital with regard to the hiring, firing, training and paying of employees;
and 
 Is considered as a department of the hospital for insurance purposes (including malpractice insurance, general
liability insurance, worker's compensation insurance, and employee retirement insurance). 
We would remove from the definition of ``freestanding'' the requirement that hospital-based OPOs service a single
transplant center. Section 4009(g) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-203) required
that OPOs be designated by Medicare to include no more than one OPO per service area. As the certification process limited
only one to an area and some of the OPOs were hospital-based, limiting the OPO's responsibility to a single transplant
center became impractical. An OPO (whether independent or hospital-based) is required to service all transplant
centers in its area. Accordingly, it would be very rare when a hospital-based OPO would service a single transplant
center. 


Section 413.202 Organ Procurement Organizations' (OPOs') or Transplant Centers' Costs for Kidneys Sent
to Foreign Countries or Transplanted in Patients Other Than Medicare Beneficiaries


Existing  413.179 would be redesignated as  413.202 with changes discussed below. 


Organ Acquisition Costs 


To ensure that there is a more reasonable and accurate determination of the Medicare program's share of heart and lung
acquisition costs, we propose to pay transplant hospitals using the same method that we use to determine Medicare's
share of the cost of acquiring kidneys. As noted earlier, organ acquisition costs are paid to Medicare-certified
transplant centers as cost passthroughs ( 412.113(d)). The cost of acquiring kidneys for transplant is determined
by using a formula specified in  413.179. Existing  413.179 (redesignated as  413.202 in this proposed
rule) requires that transplant hospitals compute Medicare kidney acquisition costs based on the ratio of the number
of usable kidneys transplanted into Medicare beneficiaries to the total number of usable kidneys applied to reasonable
costs. We propose to expand the applicability of redesignated  413.202 to include hearts and livers by making
it apply to ``organs'' instead of ``kidneys.'' We believe that this revision would result in a more reasonable determination
of Medicare heart and liver acquisition costs because the kidney formula more fairly accounts for Medicare's portion
of such costs, including organ wastage. We would cross refer  412.113 to  413.202 to ensure proper cost
determination. 
By making this change, we would ensure that acquisition costs of organs transplanted in non-Medicare recipients
are excluded from Medicare payment. Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act requires that the cost of services be borne by
the appropriate payor. Accordingly, the cost associated with organs not used by Medicare beneficiaries must be borne
by the responsible individual or third party payor. The law precludes Medicare from paying any costs associated with
organs not used by Medicare beneficiaries.

<TEXT>
 

Consequently, we would require that Medicare-certified transplant centers and organ procurement organizations
(OPOs) separate costs associated with organs transplanted in non-Medicare recipients from Medicare allowable
costs prior to final settlement by the Medicare fiscal intermediary. To separate costs, we would require that the
transplant centers compute the ratio of the number of organs used for Medicare beneficiaries to the total number of
organs used and adjust the costs for organs transplanted in patients other than Medicare beneficiaries (proposed
 413.202). 


Payment for Erythropoietin (EPO)/Epoietin (EPO) 


Erythropoietin (EPO) is an anti-anemia drug given to dialysis patients with a specified level of anemia. Payments
to ESRD facilities are made in increments of 1,000 unit doses, rounded to the nearest 100 units. Section 13566 of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93) decreased the maximum payment for EPO from $11 to $10 per 1,000
units, which is specified in section 1881(b)(11)(B)(ii) of the Act. This amount is subject to adjustment by HCFA,
if necessary. Existing  413.170(c) provides that HCFA publishes annually a 

Federal Register

 notice indicating whether an update in the EPO payment amount is appropriate and requesting public comment. We would
revise redesignated  413.174(f) to add the statutory reference and to clarify that when we determine that an
adjustment to the payment amount is necessary, we publish a 

Federal Register

 notice proposing a revision to the EPO payment amount, but that we will no longer publish a notice routinely on an annual
basis. 


III. Response to Comments 


Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge
or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified
in the ``Dates'' section of this preamble, and we will respond to the comments in the preamble to the final rule. 


IV. Collection of Information Requirements 


Sections 413.184, 413.186, 413.190, and 413.192 of the regulations contain information collection or recordkeeping
requirements, or both, that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The information collection requirements concern the documentation required
of a facility furnishing dialysis services to patients with end stage renal disease that requests an exception to
the prospective payment rate. The respondents who will provide the information include providers that furnish dialysis
services to patients with end stage renal disease. No new reporting burden will exist as a result of this regulation,
since we propose to place in regulations current documentation requirements already published in Chapter 27 of the
PRM. Therefore, the public reporting burden for this collection of information would be the same as that for Chapter
27, which was approved by OMB on September 21, 1991 for use through September 30, 1994, under control number 0938-0296.
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements
should direct them to the OMB official whose name appears in the ``

ADDRESSES

'' section of this preamble. A notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 after approval of the regulations' information collection requirements is obtained.

V. Regulatory Impact Statement 


We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all hospitals and ESRD facilities are considered
to be small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. 
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a
significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 


Payment Exception Requests 


The purpose of this portion of the proposed rule is to codify in regulations existing policy concerning an ESRD facility's
request for an exception to its prospectively determined payment rate. This policy is contained in chapter 27 of the
Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM). This proposed rule would affect all ESRD facilities, including hospital-based
and freestanding, that file for an ESRD exception request. 
Our records indicate that as of December 31, 1990, there were 1,968 facilities eligible to file exception requests.
Of these, 275 or 14 percent of the facilities filed exception requests during the December 1, 1989 to May 29, 1990 exception
period. This resulted in 194 granted requests (mostly partially granted) and 81 denials. During our most recent exception
request cycle, for the period March 1, 1991 through August 27, 1991, 135 facilities filed exception requests. This
resulted in 87 requests being granted at least in part and 48 denials.
Under current procedures, an ESRD facility requesting an exception to its prospective payment rate complies with
the instructions contained in chapter 27 of the PRM. A facility whose request is granted only partially or is denied
an exception may appeal its request to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB). The PRRB is bound by the statute
and regulations and, in interpreting them, may come to a different conclusion than if it followed program instructions.
If we codify in regulations details now found in the PRM instructions, the PRRB would be presented with more specific
bases for adjudicating an appeal of a partially denied or denied exception request. 


Organ Acquisition Costs 


In 1992, there were 66 hospitals certified to perform heart transplants and 33 hospitals certified to perform liver
transplants. These amount to less than two percent of all Medicare participating hospitals. In 1991, there were 182
liver transplants and 335 heart transplants performed on Medicare beneficiaries. Although the number of Medicare
transplants represents less than one-fourth of the total number of heart and liver transplants, a preliminary review
of cost report data indicates the average Medicare acquisition cost per liver and per heart is higher than the average
non-Medicare acquisition cost. Most organ procurement costs are incurred before a recipient is identified as a Medicare
beneficiary; thus, we do not believe the Medicare program's share of acquisition costs should exceed the non-Medicare
share. We believe that the current method of cost reimbursement contains the potential for transplant centers to
include some non-Medicare costs in the Medicare costs. 
This proposed rule would extend the formula used to compute kidney acquisition costs to other organs, including hearts
and livers. Acquisition costs would be based on the ratio of the number of usable organs transplanted into Medicare
beneficiaries to the total number of usable organs. It would not affect our obligation to pay allowable organ acquisition
costs, but would prevent Medicare from bearing costs associated with non-Medicare procedures. Based on the number
of Medicare organ transplants, we anticipate annual Medicare program savings associated with this provision of
less than $5 million. Facilities that have been correctly reporting non-Medicare acquisition costs would not be
affected by this proposal. Facilities that have not would find their Medicare payments reduced to better reflect
Medicare's share of allowable acquisition costs. 
For the reasons stated above, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we
have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities and would not have a significant economic impact on the operations
of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.

(a) Setting forth the principles and authorities under which HCFA is authorized to establish a prospective payment
system for outpatient maintenance dialysis furnished in or under the supervision of an ESRD facility approved under
subpart U of part 405 of this chapter (referred to as ``facility'' in this section). For purposes of this section and
 413.198, outpatient maintenance dialysis means outpatient dialysis, home dialysis and self-dialysis and
home dialysis training, as defined in  405.2102(f)(2)(ii), (f)(2)(iii), and (f)(3) of this chapter, and includes
all items and services specified in   410.50 and 410.52 of this chapter. 
(b) Providing procedures and criteria under which a facility may receive an exception to the prospective payment
rates established under this section; and 
(c) Establishing procedures and criteria for a facility to appeal its payment amount under the prospective payment
system.

(a) Payments for outpatient maintenance dialysis are based on rates set prospectively by HCFA. 
(b) All approved ESRD facilities must accept the prospective payment rates established by HCFA as payment in full
for covered outpatient maintenance dialysis. 
(c) HCFA publishes the methodology used to establish payment rates and changes in those rates in the 

Federal Register

, as provided in  413.196(b). 



 413.174 

[Redesignated as  413.198] 


5. Existing section 413.174 is redesignated as  413.198. 
6. A new  413.174 is added to read as follows: 



 413.174 

Prospective rates for hospital-based and independent ESRD facilities. 


(a) In accordance with section 1881(b)(7) of the Act, HCFA establishes prospective rates using a methodology that_

(1) Differentiates between hospital-based facilities and independent ESRD facilities; 
(2) Effectively encourages efficient delivery of dialysis services; and 
(3) Provides incentives for increasing the use of home dialysis. 
(b) For purposes of rate-setting and payment under this section, HCFA considers any facility that does not meet all
of the criteria of a hospital-based facility to be an independent facility. A determination under this paragraph
is an initial determination under  498.3 of this chapter. 
(c) For purposes of rate-setting and payment under this section, HCFA will determine that a facility is hospital-based
if the_ 
(1) Facility and hospital are subject to the bylaws and operating decisions of a common governing board. This governing
board, which has final administrative responsibility, approves all personnel actions, appoints medical staff,
and carries out similar management functions; 
(2) Facility's director or administrator is under the supervision of the hospital's chief executive officer and
reports through him or her to the governing board; 
(3) Facility personnel policies and practices conform to those of the hospital; 
(4) Administrative functions of the facility (for example, records, billing, laundry, housekeeping, and purchasing)
are integrated with those of the hospital; and 
(5) Facility and hospital are financially integrated, as evidenced by the cost report, which reflects allocation
of overhead to the facility through the required step-down methodology. 
(d) In determining whether a facility is hospital-based, HCFA does not consider_ 
(1) An agreement between a facility and a hospital concerning patient referral; 
(2) A shared service arrangement between a facility and a hospital; or 
(3) The physical location of a facility on the premises of a hospital. 
(e) If all the physicians furnishing services to patients in an ESRD facility elect the initial method of payment (as
described in  414.313(c) of this subchapter), the prospective rate (as described in paragraph (a) of this section)
paid to that facility is increased by an add-on amount as described in  414.313. 
(f) Erythropoietin (EPO)/Epoietin (EPO). 
(1) When EPO is furnished to an ESRD patient by a Medicare approved ESRD facility or a supplier of home dialysis equipment
and supplies, payment is based on the amount specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. 
(2) The payment is made only on an assignment basis, that is, directly to the facility or supplier, which must accept,
as payment in full, the amount that HCFA determines.

(3) HCFA determines the payment amount in accordance with the following rules: 


(i) The amount is prospectively determined, as specified in section 1881(b)(11)(B)(ii) of the Act, reviewed and
adjusted by HCFA, if necessary, and paid to hospital-based and independent dialysis facilities and to suppliers
of home dialysis equipment and supplies, regardless of the location of the facility, supplier, or patient. 


(ii) If HCFA determines that an adjustment to the payment amount is necessary, HCFA publishes a 

Federal Register

 notice proposing a revision to the EPO payment amount and requesting public comment. 


(iii) Any increase in this amount for a year does not exceed the percentage increase (if any) in the implicit price deflator
for gross national product (as published by the Department of Commerce) for the second quarter of the preceding year
over the implicit price deflator for the second quarter of the second preceding year. 


(iv) The Medicare payment amount is subject to the Part B deductible and coinsurance. 


(g) In addition to the prospective payment described in this section, HCFA makes an additional payment for certain
drugs furnished to ESRD patients by a Medicare-approved ESRD facility. HCFA makes this payment directly to the ESRD

facility. The facility must accept the allowance determined by HCFA as payment in full. Payment for these drugs is
made as described below: 


(1) 

Hospital-based facilities

. HCFA makes payment in accordance with the cost reimbursement rules set forth in this part. 


(2) 

Independent facilities

. HCFA makes payment in accordance with the methodology set forth in  405.517 of this chapter for paying for drugs
that are not paid on a cost or prospective payment basis. 


7. A new  413.176 is added to read as follows: 




 413.176 

Amount of payments. 




(a) If the beneficiary has incurred the full deductible applicable under Part B of Medicare before the treatment,
the intermediary pays the facility 80 percent of its prospective payment rate. 


(b) If the beneficiary has not incurred the full deductible applicable under Part B of Medicare before the treatment,
the intermediary subtracts the amount applicable to the deductible from the facility's prospective rate and pays
the facility 80 percent of the remainder, if any. 




 413.178 

[Redesignated as  413.200] 




8. Existing  413.178 is redesignated as  413.200. 


9. A new  413.178 is added to read as follows: 




 413.178 

Bad debts. 




(a) HCFA reimburses each facility its allowable Medicare bad debts, up to the facility's costs as determined under
Medicare principles, in a single lump sum payment after the facility's cost reporting period ends. 


(b) A facility must attempt to collect deductible and coinsurance amounts owed by beneficiaries before requesting
payment from HCFA for uncollectible amounts. Section 413.80 specifies the collection efforts facilities must make.



(c) A facility must request payment for uncollectible deductible and coinsurance amounts owed by beneficiaries
by submitting an itemized list of all specific uncollectible amounts related to covered services. 




 413.179 

[Redesignated as  413.202] 




10. Existing  413.179 is redesignated as  413.202. 


11. A new  413.180 is added to read as follows: 




 413.180 

Procedures for requesting exceptions to payment rates. 




(a) All payments for outpatient maintenance dialysis furnished at or by facilities are made on the basis of prospective
payment rates. 


(b) If a facility projects on the basis of prior year cost and utilization trends that it will have an allowable cost
per treatment higher than its prospective rate set under this chapter and if these excess costs are attributable to
one or more of the factors in  413.182, the facility may request that HCFA approve an exception to that rate and
set a higher prospective payment rate. 


(c) This higher payment rate is subject to the rules governing the amount of payment in  413.176. 


(d) A facility must request an exception to its payment rate within 180 days of_ 


(1) The effective date of its new prospective payment rate; 


(2) The effective date that HCFA opens the exceptions process; or 


(3) The date on which an extraordinary cost increasing event occurs, as described in   413.182(c) and
413.188. 


(e) The facility must demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction that the requirements of this section and the criteria in
 413.182 are fully met. The burden of proof is on the facility to show that one or more of the criteria are met and
that the excessive costs are justifiable under the reasonable cost principles set forth in this part. The burden of
proof is not on HCFA to show that the criteria are not met and that the facility's costs are not allowable. 


(f) If requesting an exception to its payment rate, a facility must submit to HCFA its most recently completed cost
report as required under  413.198 and whatever statistics, data, and budgetary projections are determined
by HCFA to be needed to adjudicate the exception. HCFA may audit any cost report or other information submitted. The
materials submitted to HCFA must_ 


(1) Separately identify elements of cost contributing to costs per treatment in excess of the facility's payment
rate; 


(2) Show that the facility's costs, including those costs that are not directly attributable to the exception criteria,
are allowable and reasonable under the reasonable cost principles set forth in this part; 


(3) Show that the elements of excessive cost are specifically attributable to one or more conditions specified in
 413.182; 


(4) Specify the amount of additional payment per treatment the facility believes is required for it to recover its
justifiable excess costs; and 


(5) Specify that the facility has compared its most recently completed cost report with prior years. The facility
must explain any material cost changes and include the data and explanation with the documentation supporting the
exception request.

(g) An exception request is deemed approved unless it is disapproved within 60 working days after it is filed with its
intermediary. 


(h) In determining the facility's payment rate under the exception process, HCFA excludes all costs that are not reasonable
or allowable under the reasonable cost principles set forth in this part. 


(i) Except for exceptions approved under  413.182(c), a prospective exception payment rate approved by HCFA
applies for the period from the date the complete exception request was filed with its intermediary until the earlier
of the_ 


(1) Date the circumstances justifying the exception rate no longer exist; or 


(2) End of the period during which the announced rate was to apply. 


(j) A prospective exception payment rate approved by HCFA under   413.182(c) and 413.188 applies from
the date of the extraordinary event until the end of the period during which the prospective announced rate was to apply,
unless HCFA determines that another date is more appropriate. If HCFA does not extend the exception period and the
facility believes that it continues to require an exception to its rate, the facility must reapply in accordance with
the procedures in this section. 


(k) HCFA denies exception requests submitted without the documentation specified in  413.182 and the applicable
cross-references. 


(l) Facilities that have been denied exception requests during the 180 days may file a subsequent exception request
if all required documentation is filed with the intermediary by the 180th day.

HCFA may approve exceptions to an ESRD facility's prospective payment rate if the facility demonstrates by convincing
objective evidence that its total per treatment costs are reasonable and allowable under the relevant cost reimbursement
principles or this part 413 and that its per treatment costs in excess of its payment rate are directly attributable
to any of the following criteria: 


(a) Atypical service intensity (patient mix), as specified in  413.184. 

(b) Isolated essential facility, as specified in  413.186. 


(c) Extraordinary circumstances, as specified in  413.188. 


(d) Self-dialysis training costs, as specified in  413.190. 


(e) Frequency of dialysis, as specified in  413.192. 

13. A new  413.184 is added to read as follows: 




 413.184 

Payment exception: Atypical service intensity (patient mix). 




(a) To qualify for an exception to the prospective payment rate based on atypical service intensity (patient mix)_


(1) A facility must demonstrate that a substantial proportion of the facility's outpatient maintenance dialysis
treatments involve atypically intense dialysis services, special dialysis procedures, or supplies that are medically
necessary to meet special medical needs of the facility's patients. Examples that may qualify under this criterion
are more intense dialysis services that are medically necessary for patients such as_ 


(i) Patients who have been referred from other facilities on a temporary basis for more intense care during a period
of medical instability and who return to the original facility after stabilization; 


(ii) Pediatric patients who require a significantly higher staff-to-patient ratio than typical adult patients;
or

16. A new  413.190 is added to read as follows: 


 413.190 

Payment exception: Self-dialysis training costs. 


(a) To qualify for an exception to the prospective payment rate based on self-dialysis training costs, the facility
must establish that it incurs per treatment costs for furnishing self-dialysis and home dialysis training that exceed
the facility's payment rate for such training sessions. 
(b) To justify its exception request, a facility must_
(1) Separately identify those elements contributing to its costs in excess of the composite training rate; and 
(2) Demonstrate that its per treatment costs are reasonable and allowable. (c) HCFA considers the facility's total
costs, cost finding and apportionment, including its allocation of costs, to determine if costs are properly reported
by treatment modality. 
(d) Exception requests for a higher training rate are limited to those cost components relating to training such as
technical staff, medical supplies, and the special costs of education (manuals and education material) and do not
generally include overhead and other indirect costs. 
(e) Documentation: The facility must provide the following information to support its exception request:

(f) Accelerated training exception:
(1) An ESRD facility may bill Medicare for a dialysis training session only when a patient receives a dialysis treatment
(which normally is three times a week). 
(2) If an ESRD facility elects to train all its patients using a particular treatment modality more often than during
each dialysis treatment and, as a result, the number of its billable training dialysis sessions are reduced, the facility
may request a composite rate limited to the lesser of the_
(i) Facility's projected training cost per treatment; or 
(ii) Cost per treatment the facility would have received in training a patient if it had trained patients only during
a dialysis treatment.
(3) An ESRD facility may bill a maximum per patient of 25 training sessions for hemodialysis training and 15 training
sessions for continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)
training. 
(4) In computing the payment amount under an accelerated training exception, to ensure adequate patient training,
HCFA uses a minimum number of training sessions per patient, (15 for hemodialysis and 5 for CAPD and CCPD) when the facility
actually provides fewer than the minimum number of training sessions. 
(5) To justify an accelerated training exception request, an ESRD facility must document that all training sessions
provided for a particular modality are provided during the shorter but more condensed period. 
(6) The facility must submit with the exception request a list of patients, by modality, trained during the most recent
cost report period, and the list must include each beneficiary's_

(a) To qualify for an exception to the prospective payment rate based on frequency of dialysis, the facility must establish
that it has a substantial portion of outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments furnished to patients who dialyze
less frequently than three times per week. 

(b) For purposes of this section, 

substantial

 means the number of treatments furnished by the facility is at least 15 percent lower than the number if all patients
dialyzed three times a week.

(c) Per treatment payment rates granted under this exception may not exceed the amount that results in weekly payment
per patient equal to three times the facility's prospective composite rate, exclusive of any exception amounts.


(d) Documentation: To document that an ESRD facility furnishes a substantial number of dialysis treatments at a frequency
less than 3 times per week per patient, the facility must submit the following information: 

(1) A list of patients receiving outpatient dialysis treatments for the cost report that is being filed with the request.
The list must indicate_

(i) Whether the patients are permanent, transient or temporary; 

(ii) The medically prescribed frequency of dialysis; and 

(iii) The number of dialysis treatments that each patient received on a weekly and yearly basis and an explanation
of any discrepancy between that calculation and the number of treatments reported on the facility's cost report.


(2) A list of patients used to project treatments. The list must indicate_

(i) Whether the patients are permanent, transient or temporary; 

(ii) The medically prescribed frequency of dialysis; 

(iii) The number of dialysis treatments that each patient is projected to receive on a weekly and yearly basis, an explanation
of any discrepancy between that calculation and the number of treatments reported on the facility's projected cost
report, and an explanation for any change between prior actual and projected data. 

(3) A schedule showing the number of treatments to be furnished twice a week and the number of treatments that would
have been furnished if each patient were dialyzed three times a week, including a computation of the facility's projected
costs per treatment using the_

(ii) Number of treatments if patients dialyze three times a week. 

(4) A schedule showing the computation of the percentage decrease in the number of treatments. 

18. A new  413.194 is added to read as follows: 



 413.194 

Appeals. 



(a) 

Appeals under section 1878 of the Act. 

(1) A facility that disputes the amount of its allowable Medicare bad debts reimbursed by HCFA under  413.178

I. Proposed Designated Entity Provisions for MTA and BTA Auctions



A. Introduction



1. In the Budget Act, Congress recognized the novelty of auctions as a licensing method and encouraged us to experiment
with a variety of techniques to ensure that small businesses and those owned by women and minorities have an opportunity
to participate in spectrum-based services. While we believe that measures taken with respect to the regional narrowband
PCS auctions will provide substantial opportunities for designated entities to participate in narrowband PCS,
we seek comment on whether it may be necessary to adopt alternative provisions such as entrepreneurs' blocks or higher
bidding credits to encourage investment in minority- and women-owned businesses in future auctions. As we have learned,
narrowband PCS licenses may be auctioned for large sums of money in the competitive bidding process. It therefore
may be necessary to do more to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS
than may be necessary in other, less costly spectrum-based services. In our view, we must consider whether these steps
and any others we may adopt are required to fulfill Congress's mandate that designated entities have the opportunity
to participate in the provision of PCS. We believe that the measures we propose today would increase the likelihood
that designated entities will win licenses in the auctions and become strong competitors in the provision of narrowband
PCS service. We also will review the results of the regional auction in making our decision on the rules proposed in
this Further Notice.

2. As we noted in the 

Fifth Report and Order

, by instructing the Commission to ensure the opportunity for designated entities to participate in auctions and
spectrum-based services, Congress was well aware of the difficulties these groups encounter in accessing capital.
 Indeed, less than two years ago, Congress made specific findings in the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity
Enhancement Act of 1992, that ``small business concerns, which represent higher degrees of risk in financial markets
than do large businesses, are experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining credit.''
 Because of these problems, Congress resolved to consider carefully legislation and regulations ``to ensure that
small business concerns are not negatively impacted'' and to give priority to passage of ``legislation and regulations
that enhance the viability of small business concerns.''








3. Congress also recognized that these funding problems are even more severe for minority and women-owned businesses,
who face discrimination in the private lending market. For example, Congress explicitly found that businesses owned
by minorities and women have particular difficulties in obtaining capital and that problems encountered by minorities
in this regard are ``extraordinary.''
 A number of studies also amply support the existence of widespread discrimination against minorities in lending
practices. As we noted in the 

Fifth Report and Order

, in October, 1992, the year prior to passage of the auction law, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released an important
and highly-publicized study demonstrating that a black or Hispanic applicant in the Boston area is roughly 60 percent
more likely to be denied a mortgage loan than a similarly situated white applicant.
 The researchers measured every variable mentioned as important in numerous conversations with lenders, underwriters,
and examiners and found that minority applicants are more likely to be denied mortgages even where they have the same
obligation ratios, credit history, loan to value and property characteristics as white applicants. The lending
discrimination that occurs, the study found, does not involve the application of specific rules, but instead occurs
where discretionary decisions are made. Based on the Boston study, we found that it is reasonable to expect that race
will affect business loans that are based on more subjective criteria to an even greater extent than the mortgage loan
process, which uses more standard rules.






4. Similarly, evidence presented in testimony before the House Minority Enterprise Subcommittee on May 20, 1994
indicates that African American business borrowers have difficulty raising capital mainly because they have less
equity to invest, they receive fewer loan dollars per dollar of equity investment, and they are less likely to have
alternate loan sources, such as affluent family or friends. Assuming two hypothetical college-educated, similarly
situated male entrepreneurs, one black, one white, the testimony indicated that the white candidate would have access
to $1.85 in bank loans for each dollar of owner equity invested, while the black candidate would have access to only
$1.16. According to the testimony, the problems associated with lower incomes and intergenerational wealth, as
well as the discriminatory treatment minorities receive from financial institutions, make it much more likely that
minorities will be shut out of capital intensive industries, such as telecommunications. This testimony also noted
that African American representation in communications is so low that it was not possible to generate meaningful
summary statistics on underrepresentation.






5. We also stated in the 

Fifth Report and Order

 that inability to access capital is also a major impediment to the successful participation of women in PCS auctions.
In enacting the Women's Business Ownership Act in 1988, Congress made findings that women, as a group, are subject
to discrimination that adversely affects their ability to raise or secure capital.
 AWRT documents that these discriminatory barriers still exist today. Indeed, AWRT reports that while venture capital
is an important source of funding for telecommunications companies, women-owned companies received only approximately
one percent of the $3 billion invested by institutional venture capitalists in 1993. Citing a 1992 National Women's
Business Council report, AWRT further argues that even successful women-owned companies did not overcome these
financing obstacles after they had reached a level of funding and profitability adequate for most other businesses.

6. A study prepared in 1993 by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) further illustrates the barriers
faced by women-owned businesses. For example, it finds that women-owned firms are 22 percent more likely to report
problems dealing with their banks than are businesses at large. In addition, the NFWBO study finds that the largest
single type of short-term financing used by women business owners is credit cards and that over half of women-owned
firms use credit cards for such purposes, as compared to 18 percent of all small to medium-sized businesses, which
generally use bank loans and vendor credit for short-term credit needs. With regard to long-term financing, the study
states that a greater proportion of women-owned firms are turning, or are forced to turn, to private sources, and to
a wider variety of sources, to fulfill their needs. Based on these findings, the NFWBO study concludes that removal
of financial barriers would encourage stronger growth among women-owned businesses, resulting in much greater
growth throughout the economy.






7. If we are to meet the congressional goals of promoting economic opportunity and competition by disseminating licenses
among a wide variety of providers, we must find ways to counteract effectively these barriers to entry. As chronicled
in the 

Fifth Report and Order, 

both Congress and the Commission have tried various methods to enhance access to the broadcast and cable industries
by minorities and women.
 These efforts however, have met with limited success. The record shows that women and minorities have not gained substantial
ownership representation in either the broadcast or non-broadcast telecommunications industries. For example,
a 1993 report conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) Minority Telecommunications
Development Program shows that, as of August 1993, only 2.7 percent of commercial broadcast stations were owned by
minorities. Another study commissioned by the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency in 1991
found that only one half of one percent of the telecommunications firms in the country were minority owned. The study
also identified only 15 minority cable operators and 11 minority firms engaged in the delivery of cellular, specialized
mobile radio, radio paging or messaging services in the United States.
 And, according to the last available U.S. Census, only 24 percent of the communications firms in the country were owned
by women, and these women-owned firms generated only approximately 8.7 percent of the revenues earned by communications
companies.
 When companies without paid employees are removed from the equation, firms with women owners represent only 14.5
percent of the communications companies in the country.
 One result of these low numbers is that there are very few minority or women-owned businesses that bring experience
or infrastructure to narrowband PCS. They thus face an additional barrier relative to many existing service providers.








8. Small businesses also have not become major participants in the telecommunications industry. For instance, one
commenter asserts that ten large companies_six Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), AirTouch (formerly
owned by Pacific Telesis), McCaw, GTE and Sprint_control nearly 86 percent of the cellular industry. This commenter
further contends that nine of these ten companies control 95 percent of the cellular licenses and population in the
50 BTAs that have one million or more people.





9. In the new auction law, Congress directed the Commission to remedy this serious imbalance in the participation
by certain groups, especially minorities and women. The auction law itself contemplates that requiring payment
for initial licenses through competitive bidding, unlike existing licensing methods such as comparative hearings
or lotteries, may inhibit participation by those with limited access to capital and could further diminish opportunities
for designated entities. The first nationwide auction demonstrated that a 25 percent bidding credit may not be sufficient
to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate where narrowband PCS values are high. The
regional auctions will demonstrate whether a 40 percent bidding credit for women- and minority-owned firms combined
with installment payments for eligible small businesses is sufficient to provide meaningful opportunities for
designated entities at the regional level. We further propose to examine the use of measures we specified in the 

Fifth Report and Order 

to carry out Congress's directive to provide meaningful opportunities for small entities and businesses owned by
women and minorities to provide PCS services. If, based on the results of the regional auction, we conclude that the
40 percent bidding credit is insufficient, we may decide that these measures, which are expressly designed to address
the funding problems faced by these groups, may be necessary to achieve Congress's goals with respect to narrowband
PCS.



B. Summary of Special Provisions for Designated Entities



10. While there was significant designated entity participation in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction, we are
concerned that the high license values in that auction and the substantial involvement by large, incumbent firms
with significant financial resources suggests that designated entities may have difficulties in competing in future
narrowband PCS auctions. We recognize that larger incumbent firms are able to pay much higher license prices than
smaller firms because of the significant infrastructure and cost of capital advantages these firms enjoy. Because
of these factors, we believe that additional measures may be necessary to achieve Congress's mandate that we ensure
the opportunity for designated entities to participate in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of
spectrum-based services. In this regard, we propose additional provisions for businesses owned by women and/or
minorities and small businesses similar to those employed in the auction rules for broadband PCS.

11. To fulfill Congress's mandate that we ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in
providing narrowband PCS; we propose to reserve up to four MTA frequency blocks_19, 21, 22 and 24_, and both BTA frequency
blocks_25 and 26_for bidding exclusively by entities with annual gross revenues of less than $125 million and total
assets of less than $500 million (``entrepreneurs' blocks''). We believe that excluding large companies from bidding
in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks, and limiting the total number of licenses that one entity can obtain in these
blocks, would significantly enhance opportunities for smaller entities to become PCS providers and thereby ensure
that narrowband PCS licenses will be disseminated ``among a wide variety of applicants,'' as required by Section
309(j)(3)(B).

12. We recognize, however, that reserving blocks for bidding only by relatively small companies may not, by itself,
be sufficient to ensure that small businesses and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have the
opportunity to obtain narrowband PCS licenses. Businesses owned by members of minority groups and women face discrimination
that poses additional obstacles for these firms. Accordingly, we propose a number of related steps to assist small
businesses and businesses owned by woman and/or minorities in attracting the capital necessary to obtain a narrowband
PCS license.

13. First, to encourage large companies to invest in designated entities and to assist designated entities without
large investors to overcome the additional hurdle presented by auctions, we propose to make bidding credits available
to designated entities within the entrepreneurs' blocks. More specifically, we propose to provide small businesses
with a 10 percent bidding credit. Businesses owned by minorities and women would receive a 15 percent bidding credit
to compensate for the substantial problems they face in attracting capital.
 The credits would be cumulative, so that a business owned by minorities or women that also qualified as a small business
would receive a 25 percent bidding credit. Second, we propose to allow most successful bidders within the entrepreneurs'
block to pay for their licenses in installments and to ``enhance'' those installment payments for small businesses
and businesses owned by minorities and women by varying the moratorium on principal and the interest rate. Third,
we propose to continue to extend our tax certificate policies to promote participation by minorities and women in
the provision of narrowband PCS. Fourth, we propose to reduce the upfront payment for all eligible bidders in the entrepreneurs'
blocks from $0.02 per MHz per pop to $0.015 per MHz per pop.





14. Finally, we propose to redesignate the two BTA licenses as regional licenses organized in the same configuration
set forth in Section 24.102 of the rules. We also seek comment on other means to achieve larger geographic license sizes
such as designating these BTA licenses as nationwide licenses or by maintaining the BTA designation, but allowing
combinatorial bidding for the designated regions. We also seek comment on whether some of the MTA and BTA response
channels should be redesignated as larger license areas with bidding limited only to those entities eligible to bid
for entrepreneurs' block licenses.

15. The following chart highlights the major provisions proposed for businesses bidding in the proposed entrepreneurs'
blocks.

C. Summary of Eligibility Requirements and Definitions


1. Entrepreneurs' Blocks and Small Business Eligibility



16. The following points summarize the principal rules we propose regarding eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs'
blocks and have adopted above to qualify as a small business. In addition, they summarize the attribution rules we
will propose to use to assess whether an applicant satisfies the various financial thresholds. More precise details
are discussed in the subsections that follow.



Proposed Financial Caps

Entrepreneurs' Blocks:

 To bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, the applicant, including attributable investors and affiliates, must cumulatively
have less than $125 million in gross revenues and less than $500 million in total assets. No individual attributable
investor or affiliate may have $100 million or more in personal net worth.

 

Small Business:

 To qualify for special measures accorded a small business, the applicant, including attributable investors and
affiliates, must cumulatively have not in excess of $40 million in gross revenues. No individual attributable investor
or affiliate may have in excess of $40 million in personal net worth. (Note: this is the small business definition we
have adopted above). We seek comments on whether in an entrepreneur's block we should define small businesses differently.



Proposed Attribution Rules



 

Control Group.

 The gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth of certain investors are not considered so long as the applicant
has a ``control group'' consisting of one or more individuals or entities that control the applicant, hold at least
25 percent of the equity and, for corporations, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.

 The gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth of each member of the control group are counted toward
the financial caps.

 

Other Investors.

 Where the applicant has a control group, the gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth of any other investor
are not considered unless the investor holds 25 percent or more of the applicant's passive equity (which, for corporations,
will include as much as 15 percent of the voting stock).

 

Passive Equity.

 Passive equity is limited partnership or non-voting stock interests or voting stock interests of 15 percent or less
of the issued and outstanding voting stock.

 

Proposed Option for Minority or Woman-Owned Applicants.

 If the control group (consisting entirely of women and/or minorities) owns at least 50.1 percent of the equity and,
or corporation, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock, then the gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth
of any other investor are not considered unless the investor holds more than 49.9 percent of the applicant's passive
equity (which, for corporations, includes no more than as 15 percent of the voting stock).

 

Affiliates.

 The gross revenues, assets and personal net worth of outside interests held by the applicant (and the attributable
investors in the applicant) are counted toward the financial caps if the applicant (or the attributable investors
in the applicant) control or have power to control the outside interests or if the applicant (or the attributable investors
in the applicant) is under the control of the outside interests. The financial interests of spouses are also attributed
to each other.



2. Definition of Women and/or Minority-Owned Business



17. The points below summarize the two structural options proposed to be available to firms that wish to qualify for
the special provisions adopted for businesses owned by minorities and women. These options will be discussed in more
detail in the text that follows.



50.1 Percent Equity Option



 If woman and/or minority principals control the applicant and own at least:

 50.1 percent of the equity, and;

 50.1 percent of the voting stock, in the case of corporations.

 Then any other investor may hold:

 not more than 49.9 percent of the passive equity (which, for corporations, includes as much as 15 percent of
the voting stock).



25 Percent Equity Option



 If women and/or minority principals control the applicant and own at least:
 25 percent of the equity, and;
 50.1 percent of the voting stock, in the case of corporations.
 Then any other investor may hold:

 25 percent or less of the passive equity (which, for corporations, includes as much as 15 percent of the voting
stock).

18. We also request comment on alternatives intended to deter shams and fronts and to prevent abuse of the incentives
for designated entities. The Commission would enforce vigorously any requirements adopted. These proposals include
a holding and limited transfer period for licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks and repayment provisions associated
with bidding credits and installment payments. These steps and our eligibility and affiliation rules are intended
to ensure that the benefits of any measures we take flow to the entities Congress intended. Ultimately, we believe
that we will best fulfill our statutory mandate by creating powerful incentives for 

bona fide

 designated entities to attract the capital necessary to compete both in auctions for narrowband PCS and in the provision
of service. We therefore specifically request that comments address in detail the impact any of these alternatives
would likely produce on the opportunity for designated entities to acquire narrowband PCS licenses.

D. The Entrepreneurs' Blocks


19. As discussed above, because the auction process itself requires additional expenditures of capital to acquire
licenses, this new licensing procedure in many respects holds the potential to erect an additional barrier to entry
that had not existed even under the Act's previous licensing methods, comparative hearings and lotteries. As reflected
in the House Committee Report, Congress was well aware of that possibility and wanted to ensure that competitive bidding
should not exclude smaller entities from obtaining licenses.
 The inability of small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities to obtain adequate private financing
creates a serious imbalance between these companies and large businesses in their prospects for competing successfully
in narrowband PCS auctions.




20. We anticipate that the results of the narrowband regional auctions as well as the comments we seek in this Notice
will be relevant to our final conclusion of whether an entrepreneurs' block is appropriate in narrowband PCS. We seek
comments on what results in the regional auction would or would not justify the use of an entrepeneurs' block in subsequent
narrowband auctions. The $125 million gross revenue/$500 million asset caps have the effect of excluding the large
companies that would easily be able to outbid designated entries and frustrate Congress' goal of disseminating licenses
among a diversity of licensees. At the same time, this restriction does not exclude many firms that, while not large
in comparison with other telecommunications companies, nevertheless are likely to have the financial ability to
provide sustained competition for the PCS licensees. For example, the $125 million gross revenue figure corresponds
roughly to the Commission's definition of a Tier 2, or medium-sized, local exchange carrier,
 and would include virtually all of the independently owned rural telephone companies, while excluding the largest
incumbent paging licensees. Limiting the personal net worth of any individual investor or affiliate of the applicant
to $100 million would prevent a very wealthy individual from leveraging his or her personal assets to allow the applicant
to circumvent the size limitations of the entrepeneurs' blocks.




21. In determining which of the blocks in each market should constitute the entrepreneurs' blocks, we seek to make
sufficient opportunity available to businesses that would qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks and to those that
would not. We seek comment on whether it would be appropriate to include all of those remaining blocks designated for
bidding credits and to add one additional MTA block and one additional BTA block if we decide to adopt the proposal.
We seek comment on the choice of blocks and the number of blocks that should be included in the entrepreneurs' blocks.
We want to choose blocks to provide adequate amounts of spectrum and geographic territory necessary to ensure that
the eligible bidders will be able to compete effectively. We believe that designating a variety of frequency blocks
as entrepreneurs' blocks would satisfy the needs of those parties who believe they must have larger amounts of spectrum
to compete effectively as well as the needs of other designated entities who require smaller blocks. Finally, it would
not foreclose opportunities for other parties.





22. 

Holding and Limited Transfer Period.

 Because we interpret the congressional goal of giving designated entities the opportunity to provide spectrum-based
services to extend beyond merely obtaining a license, we seek comment on whether we should prohibit licensees in the
entrepreneurs' blocks from voluntarily assigning or transferring control of their licenses for a period of three
years from the date of the license grant.
 We further ask commenters to address whether, for the next two to seven years of the license term, we should permit the
licensee to assign or transfer control of its authorization only to an entity that satisfies the entrepreneurs' blocks
entry criteria.
 Comments should address whether any restrictions of this type would accurately balance the goal of promoting access
to capital by designated entities with the need to assure the integrity of our process. During this limited transfer
period, licensees would continue to be bound by the financial eligibility requirements, as set forth below.
 In addition, a transferee or assignee who receives an entrepreneurs' block license during this period would remain
subject to the transfer restrictions for the balance of the holding period.
 Should any of these proposals be adopted, the Commission would conduct random pre- and post-auction audits to ensure
that applicants receiving preferences are in compliance with the FCC's rules.







23. Our goals are to create significant opportunities for entrepreneurs, small businesses, and businesses owned
by minorities and women to compete in auctions for licenses and attract sufficient capital to build-out those licenses
and provide service. We recognize the critical need to attract capital, which requires flexibility. We are very concerned,
however, that such flexibility not undermine our more fundamental objective, which is to ensure that designated
entities retain 

de facto 

and 

de jure 

control of their companies. The holding and limited transfer period upon which we seek comment, may help promote this
objective. We seek comment on the effect that any rules of this sort are likely to have on the achievement of our goals
of meaningful long-term participation by designated entities and how such a rule would impact the ability to raise
capital.

E. Bidding Credits



24. In the 

Third Report and Order 

we adopted a 25 percent bidding credit for businesses owned by minorities and women. We concluded that the use of bidding
credits would be an effective tool to ensure that women and minority-owned businesses have opportunities to participate
in the provision of narrowband services.
 And, in this Order, we raised this bidding credit to 40 percent for the regional narrowband auctions. While we do not
think that a bidding credit of this magnitude is required when used in conjunction with an insulated entrepreneurs'
block, we continue to believe that a bidding credit is necessary to ensure that women and minority-owned businesses
have the opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS. In addition, we believe that a small bidding credit is warranted
to help small businesses overcome financing obstacles. Accordingly, we propose to continue to provide a bidding
credits in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks that would give small businesses a 10 percent credit, women and minority-owned
businesses a 15 percent credit, and small businesses owned by women and minorities an aggregate credit of 25 percent.





25. In 

ex parte 

presentations to the Commission, many commenters have indicated that, without spectrum set-asides for narrowband
PCS, bidding credits would not be sufficient to assist designated entities in outbidding very large entities who
are likely to bid for licenses in this service. PCSD states, for example, that all of the existing large paging companies
can justify much larger payments for licenses than could an individual entrepreneur, regardless of a bidder's credit.
Therefore, it believes no entrepreneur will win a bid for any PCS market that is desirable to any of the large companies.
 As described above, in order to afford designated entities a realistic opportunity to obtain licenses in the narrowband
PCS service, we propose to exclude very large businesses from bidding for licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks.
These measures would enhance the value of the bidding credits for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities
and women. In this context, we believe that bidding credits can have a significant effect on the ability of small businesses
and businesses owned by women and minorities to participate successfully in auctions for licenses in entrepreneurs'
blocks.





26. As explained above, the capital access problems faced by small firms and women and minority-owned firms make special
provisions like bidding credits appropriate for these designated entities in narrowband PCS.
 In effect, the bidding credit would function as a discount on the bid price a firm would actually have to pay to obtain
a license and, thus, will address directly the financing obstacles encountered by these entities. Moreover, as noted
previously, women and minorities face discrimination in lending and other barriers to entry not encountered by other
firms, including other designated entities. Therefore, as one of the measures designed to counter these increased
capital formation difficulties, we propose to provide them with a slightly higher bidding credit than small businesses.
Thus, women and minorities would receive a 15 percent payment discount that is applied against the amounts they bid
on licenses. Absent such measures targeted specifically to women and minorities, it might be impossible to assure
that these groups achieve any meaningful measure of opportunity for actual participation in the provision of narrowband
PCS. Similarly, it is reasonable to assume that small firms owned by women and minorities suffer the problems endemic
to both groups. Therefore, we propose a cumulative bidding credit of 25 percent for these groups. We believe that these
measures will help women and minorities to attract the capital necessary for obtaining a license and constructing
and operating a narrowband PCS system, consistent with the intent of Congress. We seek comments on these proposals.





27. As discussed below, we have also proposed to modify the definition of a minority and women-owned firm.
 To receive a 10 percent bidding credit, we propose that a small business must satisfy the same gross revenue test adopted
for installment payments. As explained more fully in the small business definition section, we propose that a consortium
consisting entirely of small businesses also be eligible for a 10 percent bidding credit even if the combined gross
revenues of the consortium exceed the small business gross revenues threshold. In addition, we propose that a small
business that is owned by women and minorities must satisfy the definition of a business owned by minorities and women
as well as the small business definition to receive a 25 percent bidding credit. Finally, we propose that a consortium
of small firms owned by women and/or minorities is eligible for a 25 percent bidding credit, provided that each member
of the consortium meets the definition of a small business and a minority and/or women-owned firm.





28. 

Repayment Policies Applicable to Bidding Credits

. To ensure that bidding credits benefit the parties to whom they are directed, we inquire whether we should adopt strict
repayment policies: if, within the original 10-year term, a licensee applies to assign or transfer control of a license
to for example, an entity that is not eligible for as a high a level of bidding credit, then the difference between the
bidding credit obtained by the assigning party and the bidding credit for which the acquiring party would qualify
would have to be paid to the U.S. Treasury as a condition of approval of the transfer. Thus, an assignment of a license
from a small minority-owned firm to a women-owned firm with revenues greater than $40 million would require repayment
of 10 percent of the original bid price (25 percent less 15 percent) to the Treasury. A sale to an entity that would not
qualify for bidding credits would entail full repayment of the original bidding credit as a condition of transfer.
Small businesses also would be bound by the financial eligibility rules during the entire license term as set forth
below. Thus, if after licensing an investor purchases an ``attributable'' interest in the business and, as a result,
the gross revenues of the firm exceed the $40 million small business cap, this repayment provision would apply.
 If such a proposal were to be adopted, we would envision that these repayment provisions apply throughout the original
term of the license to help promote the long-term holding of licenses by those parties receiving bidding credits.
Nevertheless, as in the case of the holding period and transfer restrictions discussed at   88-89
above we seek comment on any effects such rules may have on the ability of designated entities to attract capital. We
therefore ask commenters to address in detail whether this type of restriction would further the goal of increasing
the number of designated entities participating in the provision of narrowband PCS services.

F. Installment Payments



29. A significant barrier for most businesses small enough to qualify to bid in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks
would be access to adequate private financing to ensure their ability to compete against larger firms in the PCS marketplace.
 In the 

Third Report and Order,

 we concluded that installment payments are an effective means to address the inability of small businesses to obtain
financing and will enable these entities to compete more effectively for the auctioned spectrum. We also determined
that small businesses eligible for installment payments would only be required to pay half of the down payment (10
percent of the winning bid, as opposed to 20 percent) five days after the auction closes, with the remaining 10 percent
payment deferred until five days after grant of the license. Finally, we indicated that installment payments should
be made available to small businesses at an interest rate equal to the rate for U.S. Treasury obligations.







30. In light of the expected substantial capital required to acquire narrowband PCS licenses, we proposed that installment
payments be available to most businesses that obtain narrowband PCS licenses in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks.
By allowing payment in installments, the government would in effect be extending credit to licensees, thus reducing
the amount of private financing needed prior to and after the auction. Such low cost government financing would promote
long-term participation by these businesses, which, because of their smaller size, lack access to sufficient capital
to compete effectively with larger PCS licensees. Under the rules we propose today, installment payments would be
available to smaller entities that do not technically qualify as small businesses for purposes of other measures
we have proposed, such as bidding credits. We believe, however, that, given the significant costs of narrowband PCS
licenses and the likelihood of very large participants in the other blocks, this option would be fully consistent
with the congressional intent in enacting Section 309(j)(4)(A) to avoid a competitive bidding program that has the
effect of favoring incumbent providers of other communications services, with established revenue streams, over
smaller entities.






31. Under the plan we propose here, all licenses that satisfy the gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth
criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks would be allowed to pay in installments for regional and MTA licenses
granted in those blocks. With respect to the BTA licenses in those blocks, however, only businesses owned by women
and minorities and those licensees with less than $75 million in gross revenues would be able to use installment payments.
 This distinction is based on the expected lower costs to acquire licenses and construct systems in the BTAs. However,
if we adopt our proposal to redesignate BTA licenses as nationwide or regional licenses, we propose extending installment
payments on those blocks to all parties eligible for the entrepreneurs' blocks. Thus, with the exception of companies
owned by women or minorities, which face additional problems accessing capital, we do not think that a firm with gross
revenues exceeding $75 million would require government financing to be competitive for the BTA licenses.







32. The installment payment option would enable qualified businesses to pay their winning bid over time. These businesses
would still make the applicable upfront payment in full before the auction, but would be required to make a post-auction
down payment equaling only ten percent of their winning bids, half of which will be due five business days after the
auction closes. Payment of the other half of the down payment would be deferred until five business days after the license
is granted. In general, the remaining 90 percent of the auction price would be paid in installments with interest charges
to be fixed at the time of licensing at a rate equal to the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.5 percent.
Under this general rule, only payments of interest would be due for the first year with principal and interest payments
amortized over the remaining nine years of the license. Timely payment of all installments would be a condition of
the license grant and failure to make such timely payment would be grounds for revocation of the license.
 We seek comment on this installment payment proposal.

33. 

Enhanced Installment Payments.

 As explained previously, small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women face capital access difficulties
not encountered by other firms and, thus, require special measures to ensure their opportunity to participate in
narrowband PCS. Accordingly, we propose an ``enhanced'' installment payment plan for these entities. Pursuant
to this enhanced installment payment plan, small businesses who win licenses in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks
would be required to pay interest only for the first two years of the license term at the same interest rate as set forth
in the general rule. Businesses owned by women and/or minorities would be able to make interest-only payments for
three years. Interest would accrue at the Treasury note rate without the additional 2.5 percent.
 And finally, businesses that are both small and owned by women and/or minorities would be required to pay only interest
for five years. Interest would accrue at the Treasury note rate.





34. These proposed enhanced installment payments are narrowly tailored to the needs of the various designated entities,
as reflected in the record in this proceeding. We believe that varying the moratorium on principal in the early years
of the loan and varying the interest rate based on these needs would allow small businesses and companies owned by women
and/or minorities to bid higher in auctions, thereby increasing their chances for obtaining licenses. In addition,
it would allow them to concentrate their resources on infrastructure build-out and, therefore, it would increase
the likelihood that they become viable narrowband PCS competitors. We request comment on these proposed enhancements
to the installment payment plan.

35. 

Unjust Enrichment Applicable to Installment Payments. 

To ensure that large businesses do not become the unintended beneficiaries of measures meant for smaller firms, we
propose to retain the unjust enrichment provisions adopted in the 

Third Report and Order 

applicable to installment payments. Specifically, if a licensee that was awarded installment payments seeks to
assign or transfer control of its license to an entity not meeting the applicable eligibility standards set out above
during the term of the license, we would require payment of the remaining principal and any interest accrued through
the date of assignment as a condition of the license assignment or transfer.
 Moreover, if an entity seeks to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that does not qualify for as favorable
an installment payment plan, the installment payment plan, if any, for which the acquiring entity qualifies would
become effective immediately upon transfer. Thus, a higher interest rate and earlier payment of principal may begin
to be applied. For example, a transfer of a license in the fourth year after license grant from a small minority-owned
firm to a small non-minority owned firm would require that the firm begin principal payments and the balance would
begin accruing interest at a rate 2.5 percent above the rate that had been in effect. Finally, if an investor subsequently
purchases an ``attributable'' interest in the businesses and, as a result, the gross revenues or total assets of the
business exceed the applicable financial caps, this unjust enrichment provision would also apply.
 We seek comment on these proposals.

G. Upfront Payments



36. As previously indicated in the 

Third Report and Order

, the upfront payment requirement was designed to ensure that bidders are qualified and serious and to provide the
Commission with a source of funds in the event that it becomes necessary to assess default or bid withdrawal penalties.
 The upfront payment ensures that bids during the course of the auction are 

bona fide

 and convey information about the value of the underlying licenses. Our standard upfront payment for narrowband PCS
is $0.02 per MHz per pop. As an additional means of enhancing the opportunity of designated entities to participate
in competitive bidding we propose to reduce the required upfront payment for those applicants. As we concluded in
the 

Fifth Report and Order

, we are concerned that the $0.02 per MHz per pop upfront payment requirement might impose a barrier for smaller entities
wishing to participate in the auctions. Moreover, we note that most bidders in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks
would be entitled to pay for their licenses in installments, which would require a down payment of only five percent
of the winning bid. We are concerned that requiring an upfront payment that may be larger than the down payment that
the winning bidder is required to tender could discourage auction participation.





37. For these reasons, we propose to reduce the upfront payment requirement to $0.015 per MHz per pop for bidders in
the entrepreneurs' blocks. This 25 percent discount should facilitate auction participation by capital-constrained
companies and would permit them to conserve resources for infrastructure development after winning a license. Moreover,
since the upfront payment is still substantial, we believe that insincere bidding would be discouraged and the Commission
would have access to funds if it must collect default or bid withdrawal penalty payments.



H. Definitions and Eligibility



1. Eligibility to Bid in the Proposed Entrepreneurs' Blocks



38. As noted previously, eligibility to bid in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks would be limited to companies that,
together with their affiliates and investors, had gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years
and have total assets of less than $500 million at the time their short form applications are filed. In addition, we
propose to prohibit an applicant from bidding in these blocks if any one attributable individual investor or principal
in the applicant has $100 million or greater in personal net worth at the short form application filing date.



2. Attribution Rules for the Proposed Entrepreneurs' Blocks



39. For purposes of determining whether an entity qualifies to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we propose to follow
the control group and attribution rules set forth with regard to eligibility to bid as a small business. In particular,
winning bidders would be required to identify on their long-form applications a control group that controls the applicant,
owns at least 25 percent of the equity, and in the case of a corporation, holds at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
For partnership applicants, we propose that every general partner be considered part of the group. The gross revenues
and total assets of each member of the control group and each member's affiliates would be counted toward the $125 million/$500
million thresholds, regardless of the size of the member's total interest in the applicant. The $100 million personal
net worth limitation would also apply to each member of the control group. We would not consider the gross revenues
or personal net worth of any other investor unless the investor holds 25 percent or more of the outstanding passive
equity in the applicant, which, as defined above, includes as much as fifteen percent of the voting stock in a corporate
applicant.

40. We also propose more relaxed attribution standard with regard to investors in small businesses owned by minorities
and women. Specifically, we would not consider the gross revenues or personal net worth of a single passive investor
in a minority or female-owned small business unless the investor holds in excess of a 49.9 percent passive interest
(which includes as much as fifteen percent of a corporate applicant's voting stock), provided the women or minority
control group maintains at least 50.1 percent of the equity and, in the case of a corporate applicant, at least 50.1
percent of the voting stock. We believe that such revenue attribution would ensure that only 

bona fide

 small businesses are able to take advantage of the special provisions we have proposed, but would allow those businesses
to attract sufficient equity capital to be truly viable contenders in the PCS industry.

41. In addition, we propose to allow a consortium of small businesses to qualify for any of the measures adopted in this
order applicable to individual small businesses including the ability to bid in the entrepreneurs' block. As used
here, the term ``consortium'' means a conglomerate organization formed as a joint venture among mutually-independent
business firms, each of which individually satisfies the definition of a small business.

42. We explain how these attribution rules would apply with regard to any holding and limited transfer period for entrepreneurs'
block licensees should such rules ultimately be adopted. During this holding period, an entrepreneurs' block licensee
could not sell more than 25 percent of its passive equity to a single investor if the resulting attribution of that investor's
gross revenues or total assets would bring the company over the $125 million gross revenues/$500 million personal
net worth cap. Similarly, while individual members of the control group could change (if it would not result in a transfer
of control of the company), the control group would have to maintain control and at least 25 percent of the equity and
50.1 percent of the voting stock.
 A company would be permitted to grow beyond these gross revenues/total assets caps, however, through equity investment
by non-attributable (i.e. passive) investors, debt financing, revenue from operations, business development
or expanded service.






43. We seek comment on these proposed eligibility requirements for the entrepreneurs' blocks. In particular, parties
should discuss the equity and control requirements for the control group and investors in both the corporate and partnership
context. In addition, commenters should discuss the alternative option for women and minority-owned companies
and the ability of small businesses to form consortia. With regard to all of these issues, parties are asked to comment
on the proposals' impact on the ability of entities to obtain financing as well as on the Commission's goals of deterring
shams and fronts.


3. Definition of Women and Minority-Owned Business


44. As discussed above, we have proposed steps in this order to address the special funding problems faced by minority
and women-owned firms and thereby to ensure that these groups have the opportunity to participate and become strong
competitors in the narrowband PCS service.
 We previously adopted a tax certificate program for women and minorities to allow more sources of potential funding,
and in this Order have relaxed the attribution standard used to determine eligibility as a qualified small business.




45. For purposes of implementing these steps, we propose to depart from the definition of a minority and women-owned
firm that was adopted in the 

Third Report and Order.

 We have adopted relaxed attribution standards for businesses owned by women and minorities for purposes of qualifying
for small business provisions. We are proposing relaxed standards for businesses owned by women and minorities to
qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks. In the 

Third Report and Order,

 we found generally that to establish ownership by minorities and women, a strict eligibility standard should be adopted
that required minorities or women to have at least 50.1 percent equity stake and a 50.1 percent controlling interest
in the designated entity. 

Third Report and Order

 at   68; 47 CFR  1.2110(b)(2). For future narrowband PCS auctions, we propose to retain the requirement
that minorities and/or women control the applicant and hold at least 50.1 percent of a corporate applicant's voting
stock. However, to establish their eligibility for certain benefits, summarized below, we propose an additional
requirement that, even where minorities and women hold at least 50.1 percent of the applicant's equity, other investors
in the applicant may own only passive interests, which, for corporate applicants, is defined to include as much as
fifteen percent of the voting stock. In addition, provided that certain restrictions are met, we propose to allow
women and minority-owned firms the option to reduce to 25 percent the 50.1 percent minimum equity amount that must
be held.
46. We emphasized in the 

Third Report and Order

 that we did not intend to restrict the use of various equity financing mechanisms and incentives to attract financing,
provided that the minority and women principals continued to own 50.1 percent of the equity, calculated on a full-diluted
basis, and that their equity interest entitled them to a substantial stake in the profits and liquidation value of
the venture relative to the non-controlling principals. We noted, however, in the 

Second Report and Order

 that different standards that meet the same objectives may be appropriate in other contexts. 

Second Report and Order

 at   278. In view of the evidence of discriminatory lending experiences faced by minority and women entrepreneurs
and the exceptionally great financial resources believed to be required by narrowband PCS applicants, we conclude
that it may be appropriate to allow more flexibility with regard to the 50.1 percent equity requirements for this service
in order to open doors to more sources of equity financing for women and minority-owned firms.

<TEXT>
 

47. We propose therefore to allow women and minority-owned firms the following options. First, they may satisfy the
general definition set forth in the 

Second Report and Order

, which requires the minority and/or female principals to control the applicant, own at least 50.1 percent of its equity
and, in the case of corporate applicants, hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock. Under this option, other investors
may own as much as a 49.9 percent passive equity interest. As noted above regarding eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs'
blocks, passive equity in the corporate context means only non-voting stock may be held, or stock that includes no
more than fifteen percent of the voting interests.
 For partnerships, the term means limited partnership interests that do not have the power to exercise control of the
entity. We ask commenters specifically to address whether the proposed fifteen percent voting interest limitation
strikes the correct balance, or whether a higher percentage would facilitate capital formation without unduly contributing
to a proliferation of shams. In addition, the 

Second Report and Order

, all investor interests would be calculated on a fully-diluted basis, meaning that agreements such as stock options,
warrants and convertible debentures generally would be considered to have a present effect and would be treated as
if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised.
 We recognize that the requirement that other investors own only passive interests would be a departure from the definition
of a minority or women-owned business adopted in the 

Second Report and Order

, but because of the very significant financial contribution that may be made by such other investors in designated
entities, we believe that the passive equity requirement may be appropriate as an additional safeguard. In addition,
we seek comments on whether these rules as currently framed may affect the ability of legitimate designated entities
to obtain the capital needed to participate in the auction.





48. As a second proposed option, women and minority-owned firms would be able to sell up to 75 percent of the company's
equity, provided that no single investor may hold 25 percent or more of the firm's passive equity, which is defined
in the same manner as above. For example, a corporation with 100 shares of voting stock and 100 shares of non-voting
stock, with the 200 shares representing the total outstanding shares of the company, could qualify as a minority or
women-owned business under the following circumstances. The minority or women principals would have to own at least
51 shares of voting stock, which satisfies the requirement that they have voting control and, in this case, also meets
the requirement that they hold at least 25 percent of the equity. Two other investors could each own 34 shares of non-voting
stock and fifteen shares of voting stock, which represents 24.5 percent of the company's equity for each of the shareholders.
A third investor could own the remaining 32 shares of non-voting stock and fifteen shares of the voting stock, or 23.5
percent of the equity. The remaining 4 shares of voting stock may be sold to other investors.
49. Whichever option is chosen, we would require establishment of a ``control group'' for women and minority-owned
firms in much the same way we did for purposes of eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Specifically, winning
bidders, transferees or assignees would have to identify on their long-form applications a control group (consisting
entirely of minorities and/or women or entities 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and women) that has


de jure

 and 

de facto

 control of the applicant and holds either at least 50.1 or 25 percent of the applicant's equity, depending upon which
option is elected.
50. We believe that a modification of our 50.1 percent equity requirement would best achieve the Congressional objective
of providing effective and long-term economic opportunities for women and minority-owned firms in narrowband PCS.
At the same time, we propose to maintain strict enforcement of the requirement that actual control reside with the
qualified designated entities. Thus, to establish their eligibility for tax certificates, enhanced installment
payments, bidding credits and relaxed cellular attribution rules, women and minority-owned applicants electing
to use the 25 percent equity option could not in any instance allow an individual investor who is not in the control group
to own more than a 25 percent passive equity interest. This restriction would apply even in circumstances in which
allowing an investor to exceed these limitations would not result in the applicant's exceeding the gross revenues
and other financial standards that apply to other bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks and other situations involving
financial caps. These structural safeguards, as well as the general requirement that other investors hold only passive
interests in women and minority-owned applicants, would help to ensure that control truly remains with the women
and minority designated entities.

<TEXT>
 

51. For example, a women or minority-owned firm electing to use the 25 percent option may have a non-eligible investor
with more than 25 percent passive stake and still qualify to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks or for benefits that apply
to small businesses, as long as the attributable revenues of the investor do not cause the applicant to exceed the gross
revenues/total asset caps. In these contexts, no additional restrictions would be necessary, because women and
minority-owned applicants, like other applicants, would be eligible to bid in these blocks and to qualify as small
businesses so long as they comply with the same restrictions on financial eligibility that apply to other applicants.
Since the attribution rule itself operates to ensure compliance with size limitations, it would not be necessary
to impose additional restrictions on the size of interests held by investors with attributable interests. This firm
would not qualify, however, for special measures applicable only to women and minority-owned businesses, such as
``enhanced'' installment payments or the 15 or 25 percent bidding credits, because it has a single non-eligible investor
with more than 25 percent passive interest. In circumstances in which women and minorities are required to retain
only 25 percent of the firm's equity, this additional structural restriction would be appropriate because the objective
in this context is to ensure not merely financial eligibility, but that women and minorities retain control of the
license.

52. We set forth previously rules defining more explicitly the term ``control'' for purposes of determining whether
a ``control group'' maintains 

de facto

 as well as 

de jure

 control of an applicant.
 We propose to apply those rules equally to the minority and women principals of minority and women-owned applicants.
Consistent with our general policies with regard to women-owned applicants for purposes of our multiple ownership
and cross-ownership rules in this broadcast context, we do not propose to adopt, at this time, any special rules or
presumptions to determine whether women-owned applicants exercise independent control of their firms. 

See

 In the Matter of Clarification of Commission Policies Regarding Spousal Attribution, 7 FCC Rcd. 1920, 57 FR 08845
(Mar 13, 1992).





53. We also note here that we are proposing to depart from the provision in the 

Third Report and Order

 that bars publicly traded companies from qualifying as minority and women-owned businesses for purposes of participating
in auctions. Most of the steps proposed to assist these designated entities in this Further Notice (

e.g.

, bidding credits and installment payments) are confined to winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks, where
there would be a financial limit on the size of participants. Because of the large capital entry costs of narrowband
PCS, we now believe that even publicly traded companies owned by women and minorities that qualify to bid in entrepreneurs'
blocks require additional measures, such as bidding credits and installment payments, to be able to participate
successfully.

54. As noted above, we propose that applicants owned by women and minorities must meet the limitations on gross revenues,
total assets and personal net worth to qualify for entry into the entrepreneurs' blocks. The size limitations would
not apply, however, to all measures designed to assist applicants owned by minorities and/or women. The tax certificate
policy applies to all narrowhead PCS licenses and would not be limited to licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Therefore,
businesses owned by minorities and women need not meet the gross revenue and other financial restrictions to qualify
for tax certificates. But minority and women-owned firms would have to satisfy the Commission's structural ownership
requirements to receive the benefits of tax certificates; that is, they would be subject to the limitation that interests
held by investors who are not women and minorities must be passive.

4. Definition of an Affiliate



55. In the 

Second Report and Order,

 we referenced the SBA's affiliation rules for purposes of defining generally whether an entity qualifies as a small
business and gave examples of how the affiliation rules would be applied. In the 

Fifth Report and Order,

 we expanded on the SBA's affiliation rules in establishing detailed affiliation standards for narrowband PCS to
be used when designated entities must include ``affiliates'' to determine their eligibility for special designated
entity provisions. In the 

Second Memorandum Opinion and Order


 that we adopted in this docket, we incorporate into our generic auction rules the affiliation standards that we established
for narrowband PCS in the 

Fifth Report and Order.

 We propose to apply these affiliation standards to narrowband PCS for purposes of determining any of the above described,
size-based eligibility criteria for designated entities seeking special treatment under the provisions adopted
herein. These standards would give applicants clear guidance regarding the relationships that we will attribute
for purposes of applying any of our sized-based eligibility criteria.





I. Limit on Licenses Awarded in Entrepreneurs' Blocks



56. The special provisions which we propose for designated entities are based, in part, on our mandate to fulfill the
congressional goal that we disseminate licenses among a wide variety of applicants. 47 U.S.C.  309(j)(3)(B).
Therefore, in proposing the financial assistance measures set forth in this Further Notice, we are concerned about
the possibility, even if remote, that a few bidders will win a very large number of the licenses in the entrepreneurs'
blocks. As a consequence, the benefits that Congress intended for designated entities would be enjoyed, in disproportionate
measure, by only a few individuals or entities. Congress, in our view, did not intend that result. We therefore propose
steps to ensure that the financial assistance provided through our rules is dispersed to a reasonable number of applicants
who win licenses in these blocks.

57. To achieve a fair distribution of the benefits intended by Congress, we propose a limit on the total number of licenses
within the entrepreneurs' blocks that a single entity could win at auction. In setting this limit, we would avoid imposing
a restriction that would prevent applicants from obtaining a sufficient number of licenses to create large and efficient
nationwide or regional services. Specifically, we propose a limitation that no single entity may win more than 10
percent of the licenses available in the entrepreneurs' blocks. These licenses could be in any combination of frequency
blocks. Such a limit would ensure that at least 10 winning bidders enjoy the benefits of the entrepreneurs' blocks.
At the same time, it would allow bidders to effectuate aggregation strategies that include large numbers of licenses
and extensive geographic coverage.

58. Further, this limitation would apply only to the total number of licenses that may be won at auctions in these proposed
entrepreneurs' blocks; it would not be an ownership cap that applies to licenses that might be obtained after the auctions.
For purposes of implementing this restriction, we would consider licenses to be won by the same entity if an applicant
(or other entity) that controls, or has the power to control licenses won at the auction, controls or has the power to
control another license won at the auction.



J. Redesignation of Certain Narrowband PCS Spectrum Blocks

<TEXT>
 

59. Finally, we are concerned that there are companies that would be eligible for an entrepreneurs' block license
that may desire larger license areas than MTAs and BTAs. It appears that over half of the bidders in the nationwide auction
would have qualified for an entrepreneurs' block license. As a result, we propose to redesignate the two BTA licenses
as regional licenses organized in the same configuration set forth in section 24.102 of the rules. Doing so would give
designated entities an opportunity to bid on a larger and more valuable license under the rules for entrepreneurs'
blocks. We also seek comment on other means to achieve larger geographic license sizes such as designating these BTA
licenses as nationwide licenses or by maintaining the BTA designation, but allowing combinatorial bidding for the
designated regions. Commenters should also address the appropriate premium we should adopt for comparison of combinatorial
and BTA license bids if we allow combinatorial bidding. We also seek comment on whether some of the MTA and BTA response
channels should be redesignated as larger license areas with bidding limited only to those entities eligible to bid
for entrepreneurs' block licenses.



II. Procedural Matters and Ordering Clause



A. Further Notice_Initial Analysis



60. 

Reason for the Action.

 The purpose of the 

Further Notice

 is to implement competitive bidding rules and regulations rules consistent with the Commission's competitive bidding
authority that will carry out the statutory mandates that certain designated entities, including small entities,
are afforded an opportunity to participate in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based
services.

61. 

Objectives of this Action.

 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the subsequent Commission actions to implement it are intended
to establish a system of competitive bidding for choosing among certain applications for initial licenses, and will
carry out statutory mandates that certain designated entities, including small entities, are afforded an opportunity
to participate in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of narrowband PCS services.

62. 

Legal Basis.

 Authority for the 

Further Notice

 can be found in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and in Sections 2(a), 4(i) 303(r), 309(i) and 309(j) of
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.   152(a), 154(i), 303(r), 309(i) and 309(j).

63. 

Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements.

 The proposals under consideration in this 

Further Notice

 include the possibility of new reporting and recordkeeping requirements for a number of small business entities.

64. 

Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules.

 None. 

65. 

Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved.

 The rule changes proposed in this 

Further Notice

 could effect smaller entities if they have mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses or permits for narrowband
PCS licenses. The 

Further Notice

 proposes to establish certain narrowband PCS spectrum blocks for bidding exclusively by smaller entities and to
provide installment payments and bidding credits to certain eligible entities within those blocks.

66. 

Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent with the Stated Objectives.

 The 

Further Notice

 proposes certain provisions for smaller entities designed to ensure that such entities have the opportunity to participate
in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of narrowband PCS services.

Engineer Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (EFARS); Variation in Estimated Quantity


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DOD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed deviation with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Corps of Engineers is requesting a deviation from the FAR Variation in Estimated Quantity (VEQ) clause at 52.212-11
to revise the method for computing price adjustments under the clause (for quantity overruns and underruns) to be
more equitable both for the Government and for the contractor.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


Typical, in the Corps of Engineers, the VEQ clause is used in contracts for dredging or construction excavation. When
the VEQ clause is used, the Government estimates the quantity of units of work to be performed, and the solicitation
and contract provide a unit price for the work. The clause provides that, if the actual quantity is between 85 percent
and 115 percent of the original estimated quantity, the original contract unit price will be paid by the Government
to the contractor, but, if the actual quantity is below 85 percent or above 115 percent, the unit price may be revised
for the underrun or overrun quantity only, but not for the quantities within the 85-115 percent range of the estimated
quantity. The clause states that 

``The equitable adjustment shall be based upon any increase or decrease in costs due solely to the variation above
115 percent or below 85 percent of the estimated quantity. 

* * * (Emphasis added.) Because the FAR VEQ clause limits unit price adjustment so those ``due solely
to'' the variations in costs, it freezes the results of a ``bad bargain'' for the Government or the contractor in computing
a unit price for increased work above 115 percent of the estimated quantity. The revised EFARS clause proposed by the
Corps provides for repricing based on the contractor's profit or loss position as well as changes in costs. This will
compensate the contractor fairly, but eliminate windfalls for either the contractor or the Government.
The Corps of Engineers is interested in receiving comments on the following issues:
1. Should contracting officers have discretion to use figures different from 85 percent and 115 percent?
2. Should the use of this clause (and its repricing mechanism) be limited to ``major'' work items under the contract?
How would a major work item be defined?
(3) Should implementing guidance make it clear that issuance of a request for repricing by the contracting officer
is a discretionary decision to be issued only when it is expected that the reduction in contract price will exceed the
administrative cost involved or is otherwise in the Government's interest?


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


A Regulatory Analysis is not required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-611). The proposed change
would not impose a new burden on any small businesses. It is estimated that the revised method would increase the price
paid to a contractor about half the time and decrease the price paid to the contractor about half the time and that the
instances when the clauses would allow reporting the work above 115 percent or below 85 percent would be few.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C., Ch. 35) do not apply. This deviation would not impose a new
requirement on ten or more offerors or contractors to submit, maintain, retain or disclose information.


PART 52_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES


The USACE would be granted a deviation from FAR 52.212-11 to use a new clause to read as follows:


Variation in Estimated Quantity (Deviation)


As prescribed at 

XXXXX

, insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts for fixed-price construction contracts when subdivided
items are to be separately priced for payment purpose.


Variation in Estimated Quantity (Deviation) (XXX 1994)_EFARS


(a) If the quantity of a unit-priced item in this contract is an estimated quantity and the actual quantity is at least
85 percent but not more than 115 percent of the estimated quantity, payment for the actual quantity shall be made at
the contract unit price.
(b) If the actual quantity of a unit-priced quantity varies more than 15 percent above or below the original estimated
quantity:
(1) Either party may request an equitable adjustment in the contract price as set forth in (2) and (3) below. The party
requesting the equitable adjustment must establish the basis for the equitable adjustment; if no basis is established,
payment for actual quantity shall be made at the original contract unit price.
(2) If the actual quantity exceeds 115 percent, payment for 115 percent shall be made at the original contract unit
price, and an equitable adjustment may be made in the unit price for the quantity above 115 percent. The equitable adjustment
in the unit price for the balance of the actual quantity above 115 percent shall be based on the reasonable costs for
that part of the work. Such reasonable costs may include reasonable various costs and a reasonable profit; additional
fixed costs may be included, if incurred and reasonable.
(3) If the actual quantity is less than 85 percent of the original estimated quantity, payment for the actual quantity
shall be made at the original contract unit price, and an equitable adjustment may be made to compensate the contractor
for incurred reasonable fixed costs that would otherwise be unrecovered.
(c) If a quantity variation causes an increase in the time necessary for completion, the Contractor may request in
writing an extension of time. The written request must be received by the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the
beginning of the delay, or with such further period as may be granted by the Contracting Officer before the date of final
settlement of the contract. Upon receipt of the written request, the Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts
and make an adjustment for extending the completion date as, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, is justified.

In response to petitions submitted by Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety and the American Automobile Manufacturers

vehicles to rollover. NHTSA believes that commenters need more time to formulate their responses because of the complexity
of the issues in the NPRM. Moreover, to the extent that persons commenting on a series of public meetings on consumer
safety information issues discuss rollover resistance information, preparation of those comments and the comments
on the proposal will be facilitated by specifying the same comment closing date for both. Accordingly, the agency
has decided to extend the comment period from August 29, 1994 to October 21, 1994, the current comment closing date
on the public meeting issues.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 28, 1994, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 that would require vehicle manufacturers to provide consumers with information on the vehicle's resistance to rollover,
in the form of a label that would be affixed to the vehicle and information in the owner's manual (59 FR 33254). The notice
contained an analysis of methods for objectively measuring vehicle stability. It also referenced an extensive discussion
of rollover statistics in an ``Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper'' that was placed in the docket. In addition
to proposing methods to be used to generate the information on the label, the NPRM requested comments on the size, location,
permanence, and content of the information label. The notice requested comments on the proposed regulation and specified
a comment due date of August 29, 1994.




On July 26, 1994, NHTSA published a notice (59 FR 38025) announcing a series of four public meetings on the general subject
of vehicle safety information for consumers. The agency is seeking comment at those meetings on what kinds of safety
information would be useful to consumers and how that information should be presented. The last of the public meetings
will be held on October 6, 1994. The comment due date for public comments on the issues raised at those meetings is October
21, 1994. 

Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) submitted a petition dated August 4, 1994, asking that the comments
period for the NPRM be extended to October 21. Advocates requested the extension primarily because it believes that
the public meetings are ``substantively connected'' to the rollover rulemaking. Advocates believes that the commenters
on the June 28 NPRM should have the benefit of the statements presented at each of the public meetings. It suggested
that the agency will receive better submissions from commenters who desire to file comments in both dockets. In addition,
Advocates requested the extension because it needs additional time to resolve the ``highly technical'' issues raised
by the use of engineering metrics for generating consumer information.

The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) submitted a petition dated August 9, 1994, also asking
the agency to extend the comment period for the NPRM. The AAMA requested the extension because it believes that the
NPRM and other available agency information are insufficient to permit a meaningful analysis of the proposal. The
AAMA requested additional information and an extension of the comment period to the date 60 days after the information
is provided.

After reviewing the petitions, NHTSA agrees with the petitioners that extending the comment closing date is desirable,
given the complexity of the issues underlying the NPRM. NHTSA also accepts Advocates' reasoning that the public meeting
may generate issues and information that would aid the public in preparing comments on this rulemaking.

Based on the above considerations, the agency believes that there is good cause to extend the comment period an additional
53 days and that this decision is consistent with the public interest. Accordingly, the agency has decided to extend
the comment period until October 21, 1994.

However, the agency wants to stress that persons commenting about issues raised at the public meetings should not
focus on the limited issue of how to present rollover information. Instead, they should address the larger issues
of what additional safety information NHTSA can provide to the public and how NHTSA can better present consumer information
from all the agency's safety activities. Comments focusing on rollover information should be addressed to the docket
for this rulemaking.

NHTSA believes that it is unnecessary to grant a further extension in response to AAMA's petition. The extension to
October 21 should provide sufficient additional time to complete analysis of even the complex issues presented in
the NPRM. The additional information that the AAMA sought in its petition is, and has always been, publicly available,
either by careful reading of the documents in Docket 91-68, Notices 1 and 3, or through direct correspondence
with the NHTSA personnel who conducted the statistical analyses. Further, much of this information is comparatively
minor and does not significantly affect commenters' ability to conduct analysis or prepare meaningful comments
on the agency's proposal.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Status Review; Extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) provides notice that the comment period on the status review for this
petitioned action is extended. The Alexander Archipelago wolf (

Canis lupus ligoni

) is found in forested areas of southeast Alaska. All interested parties are invited to submit comments regarding
this species' status.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The Alexander Archipelago wolf occurs in insular and mainland southeast Alaska, from Dixon Entrance (U.S./Canada
border) to Yakutat Bay, including all large islands of the Alexander Archipelago except Admiralty, Baranof, and
Chichagof Islands. The subspecies may be threatened by elimination of habitat, reduction in prey availability due
to the harvest of older forests, and disturbance due to increased opportunities for public access on expanded logging
road networks.

The comment period for the status review originally closed on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 26476). Since that date many parties
have expressed interest in submitting substantive comments. In order to accommodate these parties, the Service
is extending the comment period until October 1, 1994. Written comments may be submitted to the Service office in the
addresses

 section.

<DOCTITLE>Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; 90-Day Finding for a Petition to List as Endangered or Threatened
the Contiguous United States Population of the Canada Lynx and to Emergency List a Southern Rocky Mountain Population</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of 90-day petition finding.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 90-day finding for a petition to add the contiguous United
States population of the Canada lynx (

Lynx lynx canadensis

) to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species (List) and to add a southern Rocky Mountain population to the List
via an emergency listing. The Service finds the petition presents substantial information indicating the requested
action for the contiguous population may be warranted, but there is not substantial information to indicate that
an emergency listing of a southern Rocky Mountain population may be warranted. As a result of a previous court settlement,
a formal status review is underway.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted. This
finding is to be based on all information available to the Service at the time the finding is made. To the maximum extent
practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the date the petition was received, and a notice regarding
the finding is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. If the finding is that substantial information was presented, the Service also is required to promptly commence
a review of the status of the species involved if one has not already been initiated under the Service's internal candidate
assessment process.

This document meets the requirement that a notice be published for the 90-day finding made earlier for the petition
discussed below. Information contained in this document is a summary of the information in the 90-day finding, which
is the Service's decision document. A status review has been ongoing since the species was classified as a category
2 candidate species in the December 30, 1982, Vertebrate Notice of Review (47 FR 58454)

A petition dated April 23, 1994, was received by the Service from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation, Evan Frost, Mark
Skatrud, Craig Coonrad, and Michael J. Polly on April 27, 1994. The petition requested that the conterminous United
States population of the ``North American'' lynx (

Felis lynx canadensis

) be listed as a threatened or endangered species. Additionally, the petitioners requested that the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the ``North American'' lynx in Wyoming and Colorado be emergency listed.

This species is now recognized as 

Lynx lynx canadensis (Jones et al. 1992) and is often referred to as the Canada lynx. The Service accepts both of these
names.
The petitioners assert that the Canada lynx population in the contiguous United States should be added to the List
of Threatened and Endangered Species because of the following factors: 1. Intensive logging that eliminates foraging
and denning habitat for Canada lynx and snowshoe hare until the vegetation has regrown sufficiently, creates openings
in the forest that Canada lynx avoid, and causes habitat fragmentation that creates barriers to dispersal and colonization;
2. Logging roads allow human accessibility that may increase incidental trapping of Canada lynx and disrupt Canada
lynx travel and hunting; 3. Forest fire suppression adversely affects Canada lynx through the reduction of hare habitat;
4. Few comprehensive management plans for Canada lynx have been developed or implemented by government agencies;
5. State agencies have not adequately modified their furbearer regulations; 6. The Canada lynx's inherent characteristics,
including naturally low population densities, specialized prey requirements, and large home ranges, make it vulnerable
to extinction; and 7. The southern Rockies population is further threatened by ski area developments that may reduce
habitat and prey base and increase human disturbance and accidental trapping. The petitioners requested that the
southern Rocky Mountain population of the lynx be protected by emergency listing because it is severally imperiled,
the population level is low, and it is reproductively isolated.


Listing Factors


The following are the five listing criteria as set forth in section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations (50 CFR Part 424)
promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act and their applicability to the current status of the Canada
lynx.


A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range


The suppression of forest fires and intensive logging prescriptions have had a detrimental effect on Canada lynx
habitat, and logging roads have increased human accessibility to the species.


B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes


Past overharvest has had a detrimental effect on Canada lynx populations.


C. Disease or Predation


Canada lynx may be displaced or eliminated when competitors, such as the bobcat (Lynx rufus

) or coyote (

Canis latrans

), expand into the range of the Canada lynx.


D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms


States managed the Canada lynx as a furbearer in the past, but as a result of declining Canada lynx populations, Canada
lynx are classified as threatened or endangered in Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, Vermont, Washington, and
Wisconsin. It is also fully protected from harvest in Maine, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.
Only Idaho and Montana currently allow the harvest of Canada lynx. The above States either prohibit or control the
``take'' of Canada Lynx, but their laws are relative ineffective in controlling the loss or modification of the species'
habitat.


E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence


Human development has had a determinental effect on the Canada lynx habitat and population.


Finding


The Service may issue an emergency rule when there is an emergency posing a significant risk to the well-being of a species.
Although the Canada lynx population in the southern Rockies may be small, the Service is not aware of any actions that
immediately threaten the population. The petition did not present substantial information to indicate that emergency
listing is warranted.
After finding that a 1991 petition to list the North Cascades population of the Canada lynx as endangered was not warranted,
the Service concluded that a rangewide status review of the Canada lynx should be conducted (58 FR 36924). As a result
of a court settlement in November 1993, the Service is now in the process of formally reviewing the status of the contiguous
United States population of the Canada lynx to determine whether it should be added to the List of Threatened and Endangered
Species. On February 2, 1994, the Service published a notice (50 FR 4887) announcing a continuation of the status review
initiated in 1982. The findings from this review, which must be published by the court appointed date of November 15,
1994, will constitute the 12-month finding for this petition. Considering the language agreed to by the Service in
the court settlement, information provided by the petitioners, and the fact that the Canada lynx is a category 2 candidate
species, the Service finds that there is substantial information to indicate that listing the contiguous population
of the Canada lynx may be warranted.
The Services' 90-day administrative finding contains more detailed information regarding the above decisions.
A copy may be obtained from the Service's Helena office (see

Notice of 90-day petition finding.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 90-day finding for a petition to list the Queen Charlotte goshawk
(

Accipiter gentilis laingi

) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The Service finds that the petition presents substantial information
indicating the requested action may be warranted. Through issuance of this notice, the Service is requesting additional
information regarding this subspecies.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background




Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the
maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding
is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. If the finding is positive, the Service must promptly commence a review of the status of the species involved and disclose
its findings within 12 months (12-month finding).

On November 21, 1991, the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 58804) a notice of review for an updated list of animal taxa that are being considered for possible addition to
the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. Among the species included as a Category 2 candidate species was the
northern goshawk (

Accipiter gentilis

). By inclusion as a subspecies, the Queen Charlotte goshawk (

Accipiter gentilis laingi

) was also designated a Category 2 candidate species at that time. Through the publication of that notice, the Service
announced the possible vulnerability of the Queen Charlotte goshawk, initiated a review of subspecies' status,
and requested additional pertinent information.

On May 9, 1994, a petition dated May 2, 1994, was received by the Service from Mr. Peter Galvin of the Greater Gila Biodiversity
Project, Silver City, New Mexico, and nine copetitioners, including the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity,
the Biodiversity Legal Foundation, Greater Ecosystem Alliance, Save the West, Save America's Forests, Native Forest
Network, Native Forest Council, Eric Holle, and Don Muller.

The petitioners request that the Queen Charlotte goshawk be listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act
(16 U.S.C. 1533(a)(1)) because of the following factors:

1. Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat and range because of clearcut logging
of mature and old growth forest; 

2. Increased predation because of increased open area habitat caused by clearcut logging; 

3. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms to protect preferred habitat from clearcut logging. 

The Service has reviewed the petition, literature cited in the petition, and other references available in the Service's
files, and contacted persons knowledgeable about this subspecies. On the basis of the best scientific and commercial
information available, the Service finds the petition presents substantial information that listing the Queen
Charlotte goshawk may be warranted. 

As part of an ongoing status review, the Service will further evaluate the current status of the Queen Charlotte goshawk
and determine if listing is warranted for either the entire subspecies or certain distinct population segments of
the subspecies. 

The Service would appreciate any additional data, comments, and suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental
agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other parties concerning the status of the Queen Charlotte
goshawk. 


The following issues are of particular interest to the Service: 

1. The genetic, morphologic, and ecological differences, including variations of intergradation of the Queen Charlotte
goshawk within it's currently described range, and from adjacent goshawk subspecies. 

2. The range of geographic distribution of goshawks exhibiting the described characteristics of the Queen Charlotte
goshawk subspecies. 

3. Additional historic and current population data which may assist in determining population trends. 

4. The extent and effects of long-term habitat conversion and fragmentation of mature forest habitat on Queen Charlotte
goshawks and their prey.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:





Background



On March 30, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 determining the coastal California gnatcatcher to be a threatened species (58 FR 16741). In its decision to the list
the gnatcatcher, the Service relied, in part, on taxonomic studies conducted by Dr. Jonathan Atwood of the Manomet
Bird Observatory, Manomet, Massachusetts. As is the standard practice in the scientific community, the Service
did not request, nor was it offered, the data collected and used by Dr. Atwood in reaching his conclusions. Instead,
the Service depended upon the conclusions published by Dr. Atwood in a peer-reviewed scientific article on the subspecific
taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher (Atwood 1991).

In response to a suit filed by the endangered Species Committee of the Building Industry Association of Southern California
and the other plaintiffs, the United States District Court of the District of Columbia vacated the listing of the coastal
California gnatcatcher because the Service did not make available Atwood's data for public review and comment. In
response to the court decision, Dr. Atwood released his data to the Service, which the agency made available to the
public for review and comment on June 2, 1994. On June 16, 1994, the court reinstated threatened status for the coastal
California gnatcatcher until the Secretary of the Interior determines in a finding whether the listing should be
revised or revoked in light of his review of the subject data and public comments received during the comment period.
as a result of the court order of July 27, 1994, the Secretary must publish this finding in the 

Federal Register

 by December 31, 1994.

On July 1, 1994, the plaintiffs requested a 100-day extension in the comment period. Because the Secretary had no objection
to a 30-day extension, both parties agreed to an extension in the comment period to August 31, 1994, which the Service
published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38426). On July 27, 1994, the court ordered the comment period extended to October 31, 1994.
